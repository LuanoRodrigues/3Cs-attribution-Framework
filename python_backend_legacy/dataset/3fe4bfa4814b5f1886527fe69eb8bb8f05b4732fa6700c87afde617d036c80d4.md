When a state decides to attack another state, it is not concerned solely with its relative power to its adversary. An attacking state is concerned with the power of its adversary and its ability to conduct an attack against an adversary while maintaining anonymity. Anonymity in cyberspace in the initiation and implementation phases of an attack provides the freedom to maneuver. Webster's defines anonymity as follows:\n1: of unknown authorship or origin\n2: not named or identified\n3: lacking individuality, distinction, or recognizability\nThe analysis below focuses on the origin or instigating actor, the target that is not identified, and the recognition that an attack is occurring. Specifically the concept of anonymity is approached from the offensive perspective of a state considering instigating a cyber attack against a potential opponent.\nTo understand anonymity it is necessary to ask basic questions of international politics. First, why is anonymity important to a cyber attacker? Second, is it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? Third, why is attribution important to a cyber defender? These three questions are answered below followed by a summary of the importance of understanding anonymity and attribution in offensive cyber decision-making.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\n# THE IMPORTANCE OF ANONYMITY\nMost of the literature on cyber attacks makes clear that one of the most valuable aspects of the cyber domain is anonymity. Anonymity is a distinctive asset in covert operations, providing political plausible deniability while allowing for the attainment of a strategic or tactical objective. It is difficult to assess the true value of anonymity in cyber. From an offensive perspective the objective is to remain anonymous as long as possible while still achieving an objective. This is likely to lead an attacker to obfuscate his or her operation. As described in earlier chapters, if a target of a potential attack emanating from cyberspace knows where an attack will occur, or who will perpetrate an attack, it is much more likely to be able to defend against that attack.\nAnonymity in cyber is multifaceted. The layers of anonymity are constructed by the following characteristics: the inability to identify a perpetrator (state instigator) of an attack, the inability to recognize an attack is occurring, and the inability to isolate the target or objective of an attack. These characteristics build upon the two characteristics of attribution within Susan Brenner's legal framework for understanding cyber attacks.² These three characteristics are important for both legal and practical reasons. As *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace* accurately notes: \"The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult.\"³ Beyond simply being unable to identify the perpetrator, as is often the case in cyber attacks, it is difficult to recognize when a cyber attack is even occurring.\nTitan Rain, a cyber espionage operation targeting various defense systems, including U.S. Logistics Command, is an example of a cyber attack that stayed beneath the radar.⁴ A defender that does not know an attack is occurring is even less likely to know what the target of that attack is. The Titan Rain incident is particularly difficult to access in its entirety because the stolen data were encrypted on the way out, making it technically difficult to know what the purpose of the attack was and exactly which files were taken.⁵ The only way to judge the significance of the attack was to measure the volume of the data taken in terabytes.\nAnonymity within cyberspace is a valuable tool to both the perpetrators of attacks and the average user alike. Over the last several years I have worked with democracy NGOs around the Middle East and other regions building training platforms for democracy activists. These websites are designed to offer potential democracy activists the maximum amount of anonymity to protect them against government persecution. In this instance anonymity is a tool that safeguards liberties. This same ability to remain anonymous facilitates nefarious groups and nation-states that wish to do harm.\nAlthough this book is primarily concerned with the decision-making processes of state actors, the quote at the beginning of this chapter by the group\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [81]\nAnonymous is illustrative of the power a disparate group of nonstate actors can have in cyberspace. If states are unable to prevent ad hoc organizations such as Anonymous from taking down the websites of major governmental agencies such as the FBI or CIA, then how is it possible to defend against state actors with infinitely more resources?⁶\nVarious scholars have indicated that one of the fundamental problems associated with the structure of the Internet is that it was never designed to provide tracking and referencing of users.⁷ It is prudent to remember that the Internet as we know it was started as a private collaboration tool between universities and U.S. laboratories under the control of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In fact, at its beginning commerce was prohibited on the Internet. As the value and the volume of connections has increased, the value of anonymity has been both a blessing and a curse. For a state deciding whether to use cyber as a means of attack against another state, one of its primary considerations should and does often rightly center on anonymity.\nThe value of anonymity is supported by both anecdotal evidence as well as sound political logic. In every major case of state-on-state hostile cyber interaction, ranging from cyber exploitation (CE) to cyber attack (CA), anonymity has been a central feature. The answer as to why anonymity is a central feature of hostile state interactions within cyber is discussed in previous chapters, but it does not hurt to reiterate its central premise and applicability to the decision to instigate offensive cyber operations within cyberspace.\nA bullet or bomb launched from a gun or plane has a defined trajectory. It is possible to harden a target against them with either a bulletproof vest or a bunker. But once that trajectory has been established, the target is typically assured of impact barring some counterballistic system. In much the same way it is possible to harden cyber assets against cyber weapons. Network administrators can build firewalls or air gap networks to protect them against incoming bits and bytes. But unlike the bulletproof vest that works against any bullet regardless of type, up to a certain caliber, a firewall only protects against identified threats. And at the time of this writing it is estimated that there are approximately 200 million different types of viruses, Trojans, and worms.\nFurthermore, just as a bulletproof vest offers little protection against a howitzer round, a firewall can be overcome by larger inflows of bits and bytes (a DDoS attack). If a larger round is coming toward an individual, that individual will attempt to fortify himself or herself in a bunker and survive. The same is true of a cyber attack. If it is known that a large-scale DDoS attack will be conducted, network administrators can expand or distribute network infrastructure capacity or engage in other mitigation techniques to weather the attack.⁸ If the network administrators do not know an attack is coming, then they are likely to be casualties, as has been demonstrated in many instances including the 2010 “Operation\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nPayback,\" in which a group of substate actors from the group Anonymous took off-line via DDoS attack multiple websites including MasterCard, PayPal, and Visa. If advance warning on a cyber attack is available, a network administrator can also take systems off-line and remove targets altogether, making an attack ineffective for want of a target, or the administrator can mass defensive resources or prohibit traffic from certain points of origin.\nIf the objective of an attack is to make small changes in the defenses of another state's systems, then the goal is to hide those changes for as long as possible. Not only is it prudent to hide the attacker's identity, but it is prudent to hide the knowledge of the attack as well. Once an opponent knows it is being attacked, its security personnel begin implementing defensive measures as a response. Defenders can increase the robustness of their firewall(s), increase their network capacity, or, in worst-case scenarios, remove the systems altogether. The same is not true of conventional attacks. Once an attack is ongoing, it typically must be weathered or responded to.\nAny probability for success in cyber is dependent largely on a relationship between the objective of an attack and the ability to remain anonymous to the point at which that objective is completed. Furthermore, even if the anonymity of the attack is lost, the anonymity of the attacker can still be preserved. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the victim to retaliate with any meaningful accuracy. The three characteristics of anonymity combine to significantly condition the decision-making process of actors in cyber.\nMany scholars note anonymity is a strong characteristic of the cyber domain. Robert Axelrod and Rumen Illiev indicate that anonymity serves as a fundamental aspect of cyber attacks and define the ability to use a cyber weapon in terms of the ability of a cyber resource to maintain stealth and persistence.[10] Their argument for the importance of anonymity is based on data presented by Bilge and Dumitras suggesting that on average over the course of a three-year period only 3-5 percent of hundreds of vulnerabilities in different browsers were discovered and that the average duration of a zero-day attack is 312 days.[11] This would indicate that not only is anonymity often present as a component in the decision to attack, but that it is also an attribute of the vulnerabilities and viruses associated with the systems being attacked. Axelrod and Iliev's data on when to use a cyber resource indicate that the persistence of an unknown vulnerability is nearly 100 percent when not used, meaning that the life span of vulnerabilities is quite significant.\nBeyond just the long duration of vulnerabilities available for exploit due to their almost inherently anonymous nature and persistence, Cornish et al. argue that anonymity might also make it possible for certain actors to achieve disproportionate amounts of political utility from identical acts conducted in cyberspace.[12] While it is true a small state can create a disproportionate amount\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nof harm in cyberspace in ways not possible using conventional military tactics, it is unclear if this state derives a higher degree of utility for cyber attacks over other forms of asymmetric conflict. Instead, because political utility is compared to various options within the toolbox of state, the actual utility of cyber attacks does not change, only its relative value to other options within the overall decision set. For instance, in the case of Stuxnet, the United States had at least half a dozen options for dealing with potential Iranian nuclear development. Israel had fewer options. Economic sanctions imposed by the United States would be far more harmful than those imposed by Israelis because the United States controls much larger swaths of the global market. Under this logic, the value of a cyber attack does not change based on the size of a state; it simply alters its position within the decision set, making it appear more valuable and thus appear to have greater utility than other options. Moreover, as discussed, cyber power is dependent on many factors, among which are the theoretical capabilities of cyber power. It is a lack of these capabilities that limits the ability to conduct highly complex attacks capable of achieving significant impact.\nAnonymity provides a means by which to achieve political utility and acts as a facilitator for the application of power. Chapter 7 provides a graphical representation of the scale and complexity of attacks in relation to their feasibility. The larger and more complex an attack, the more likely it is to need anonymity over time. One exception would be distributed denial of service attacks conducted by nonstate actors who want public acknowledgment of their attack but have time-limited utility measures resulting from disruption of services. The relationship of complexity and scale with feasibility indicates an inverse relationship. The more difficult an attack, the more likely it is to be significant in either size, complexity, or both. There are only a few select countries with the technical capabilities to conduct a highly complex attack such as Stuxnet or the attack on Syrian air defense systems. There are nearly a hundred countries and large numbers of substate actors capable of conducting the type of attacks used against Estonia in 2007. The disproportionate relationship between the size of a state and anonymity is directly related to the number of potential actors and the ability to remain anonymous. Although the Stuxnet attack has not been publicly claimed, it has been widely reported as emanating from the United States and Israel through official sources within President Obama's administration.[13] Anonymity was a crucial aspect of Stuxnet, and although the attack has not been publicly claimed, particularly in the first few years after its initiation, the range of possible actors based just on factors such as complexity and scale of attack is quite small. If the attack is contextualized in foreign policy and international relations, the range narrows to possibly three and more likely two actors.\nAnonymity is a complex measure. The three characteristics of anonymity are extremely difficult to maintain indefinitely. The key is to prolong a combination\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nof the characteristics long enough to achieve an objective in cyber. Furthermore, if the identity of the attacker remains anonymous, this denies the legal justification for retaliation by the targeted state as well as denying the identification of a proper institutional format for recourse.[14]\n## POLITICAL ACTION AND ANONYMITY\nIs it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? If we follow the logic of Thomas Rid that “history does not know acts of war without eventual attribution,” then do cyber attacks constitute political acts?[15] With anonymity being a central feature that influences the success of cyber attacks, does anonymity remove the political aspect of attacks? Rid goes on to say: “aggressors engaging in subversion, espionage or sabotage do act politically; but in sharp contrast to warfare, they are likely to have a permanent or at least temporary interest in avoiding attribution. This is one of the main reasons why political crime, more than acts of war, has thrived in the cyber domain, where non-attribution may be easier to achieve than waterproof attribution.”[16]\nThis book largely steps over the linguistic gap between what constitutes an act of war and what constitutes a crime or other form of action. For the purposes of understanding anonymity the definition is largely based on the perception of the aggrieved party. However, Rid does make it clear, through linguistic nuance, that certain acts within cyber can contain political utility. Virtually all other scholars agree on this point.[17] While the linguistic distinction between war and political crime has caused a degree of animosity within the subfield, this animosity is likely misplaced and represents different linguistic traditions and conceptualizations of the state of modern conflict in regard to historical frameworks.[18]\nThe focus on the debate over whether anonymous acts that take place constitute different types of conflict is dependent on the framework of definitions a scholar uses. What is evident is that regardless of how cyber attacks are referred to in the conventional typology, they are capable of generating utility, as demonstrated in chapter 3.\n## THE VALUE OF ANONYMITY\nActs that occur in cyberspace are not necessarily anonymous, yet anonymity is a desired characteristic for the conduct of offensive cyber actions. How then can we operationalize the concept of anonymity within a rational choice decision-making model so it is logical to the decision-maker?\nBruce Bueno de Mesquita’s utility theory simply compares the power scores of different states. By using a capability (power) relationship between states he is able to determine the probability of success for the instigator of a potential\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nconflict. It is this probability of success that greatly affects the decision to engage in an act. In theory it would be possible to use Bueno de Mesquita's model to explain any type of decision to engage in interstate interactions ranging from diplomacy to war. It would be possible to rearrange the probability function of the model to incorporate those characteristics that influence successful diplomatic interactions to derive a model for bargaining. However, Bueno de Mesquita's model is focused on overt conflict. He uses power to assess the probability of success. Yet because he works in a domain of interaction where distance has an effect, his power relationship is scaled by distance.[19] Distance, as examined in previous chapters, does not matter in cyberspace as it does in conventional military encounters because cyber attacks can occur with no diminishing capability due to distance. A virus code in China does not need to be resupplied by a virus code in the United States. What does affect the probability of success is time. However, the probability of success affected by time does not interact with the power of a state, as is often the case in conventional conflict. Instead it influences the overall probability of success.\nThere are several ways to represent the relationship to time in mathematical models and probability. One of the more standard statistical methods available to test time to an event is to use a hazard or survivability model. This model is not noting the changes in the power relationship over time; rather, it is examining the probability any given type of attack can remain anonymous within the three above combined characteristics long enough to achieve the objective of the attack. More simply, it examines how long until the target knows it is being attacked, knows the target of the attack, and knows who is doing the attacking.\nThis is important to the development of a decision-making model for the instigation of cyber attacks, as has been mentioned several times. Once a victim recognizes an attack, it can begin taking defensive measures to protect itself. Once it knows the target of the attack, it can harden that target. Once it knows the perpetrator of the attack, it can begin retaliation. The question the decision-maker then asks is what is the probability at a point from time  $t_{i}$  to time  $t_{c}$  or from instigation to completion of the attack that the instigator is able to maintain anonymity. This probability changes over time. At time  $t_{i}$ , the initiation of the attack, the likelihood that anonymity is lost is relatively low. The longer the attack takes to complete, the more likely the attacker is to lose anonymity. This then becomes a fluid measure expressed in moments in time that can be graphed. Because each type of attack is unique, no two hazard models are the same.\nThe hazard model is composed of those factors essential to maintaining anonymity discussed above. It is important to know the scale (S) of an attack. The larger the attack, the more difficult it is to accomplish. Next it is important to understand the complexity (C) of the attack. The more complex an attack, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nTABLE 5.1 Probability of Maintaining Anonymity by Attack\n|  Propaganda | 99%  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Web Vandalism | 95%  |\n|  Denial of Service | 90%  |\n|  Distributed Denial of Service | 85%  |\n|  Cyber Exploitation | 80%  |\n|  Equipment Disruption | 70%  |\n|  Critical Infrastructure | 60%  |\n|  Compromised Hardware Systems | 50%  |\nmore difficult it is to accomplish. These two variables interact as well. A large and complex attack is more difficult than a small, complex attack or a large, simple one. Next, as mentioned above, it is important to contextualize the attack by determining the level of hostility (H) between nations. If state X has only two primary adversaries, it can quickly isolate the instigator of an attack against its interests. By understanding the level of hostility, it is possible to begin narrowing the number of countries in the system. The more potential actors (Q) within a grouping, the more likely a perpetrator is to remain anonymous. The expression of the hazard function is listed below in equation 5.1.\n# Hazard Function for Anonymity\n5.1  $A = \\log h_{1}(t) = a + C_{i}\\beta + S_{i}\\beta + (C_{i}S_{i})\\beta + H_{i}\\beta + Q_{i}\\beta + e$\nUsing this function with complete data, it is possible to isolate at any given point in time from the initiation of an attack to the completion of an attack the probability of maintaining anonymity across the three characteristics of anonymity. As is examined in chapter 7, this model can be greatly influenced by the collection of intelligence. Such intelligence would influence all variables within the above hazard function.\nBecause there is an assumption of anonymity necessary to instigate any attack due to the characteristics of cyber attacks as defined above, the model in this book is not filled in by data. Instead the probability of maintaining anonymity at the point of initial decision to instigate an attack is kept constant at 1. The probability of maintaining anonymity changes over time. Therefore anonymity at time  $t_0$  is always kept at 1. The probability of anonymity at  $t_{0 + n}$  is here defined by the type of attack, rather than using the hazard function for which data are not available. Attacks are broken into eight categories, each with a probability of maintaining anonymity over time. The categories and their corresponding probabilities are listed in table 5.1. These probabilities are anecdotal and as-\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [87]\nsumed. Actual probabilities for each attack would depend on the intricacies of the attack, the hostility between nations, and all of the other features included in the hazard function for anonymity.\nThe above indicates that the more complicated the attack, the more difficult it is to maintain anonymity. Although the numbers are rough, they are meant to illustrate the intersection of all three categories of anonymity. Many groups and organizations can participate in web propaganda, and it is therefore a low-level and common form of attack. Only a few states are currently capable of fully compromising hardware systems; it is therefore more difficult to maintain anonymity during such an attack.\n# ANONYMITY, ATTRIBUTION, AND DECISIONS\nAlthough many works focus on the term \"attribution,\" here the focus is on anonymity. This has been done for several reasons. First, an anonymous actor is one who avoids attribution. Many legal scholars, including Susan Brenner, tend to focus only on the attribution aspect of cyber. They do this primarily because they are concerned with the defensive capabilities of states. The ability for states to respond to cyber attacks and their perpetrators is an important aspect of cyber defense. But when we consider the offensive strategy of a state, the concern is a combination of achieving the objective and avoiding attribution. For an attack to gain political utility, a state must achieve its stated objective. If a state cannot achieve even the minimum threshold of its objective, an attack remains unattributed if it did not gain any political utility. Anonymity is a fundamental aspect of offensive cyber operations (OCOs). Attribution is a fundamental aspect of cyber defense. The focus of this book is on developing a model that examines how states decide to attack; therefore attribution is largely ignored from a defensive orientation except where it affects the probability of success.\nWheeler and Larson define attribution as \"determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker's intermediary.\"20 Once a targeted country begins the attribution process, it is often after an attack has been completed. It is doubtful that the Israelis cared that the Syrians knew they invaded their airspace to bomb the nuclear facilities. They had already gained the benefit they sought. The Syrians did not respond militarily because they had already lost that which they sought to protect. In cyber it is more important to identify that an attack is occurring, what the target of that attack is, and how to prevent the achievement of an attacker's goal, than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack.\nDeterrence does not work the same in cyber as in conventional conflict. Simply identifying the attacker and threatening response is typically not possible. And even when it is possible, it is only feasible with a cross-domain re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nsponse. Such a response would likely escalate a conflict significantly with unforeseen consequences.\nThe response mechanism to a cyber attack is theoretically confined in the short term to cross-domain actions due to an inability to quickly and efficiently plan meaningful on-the-fly attacks against an adversary. Cyber attacks are tailored to specific systems and require extensive planning and development to be successful. Unless the groundwork was laid out in advance, making it possible to conduct retaliatory in-domain attacks, a state's primary function is to remove the first two characteristics of anonymity by determining that an attack is occurring, and second, what the target of that attack is.\nJoel Brenner created a hypothetical scenario in which attribution is attained but matters far less than the recognition that an attack was occurring and a comprehension of the target of that attack.[21] The scenario is one in which the previously laid groundwork for a coordinated attack against U.S. critical infrastructure begins to take down vital U.S. systems coinciding with a foreign policy flap occurring with China. The decision-makers are paralyzed because at first it is not known whether the critical infrastructure malfunctions are due to an attack or normal error. As the malfunctions continue to occur, it becomes apparent the malfunctions are due to an attack and not an error. Although the likely attributable source is China, that is of little importance. The anonymity of the attack and the targets of the attack are more important than pointing fingers. The ability to hide an attack and the target of an attack facilitates it. In Brenner's case, by the time it was recognized as an attack it was too late to do anything, let alone isolate future targets, and the United States didn't have assets in place to retaliate in kind. Brenner notes that a cross-domain response would have been a prelude to all-out war with unforeseen consequences between two nuclear-armed states. The systems affected were such that even the kill switch mechanism once proposed in Congress would not have been of much use.[22]\nMoreover, to publicly attribute the system failures within the U.S. critical infrastructure without having a means to stop them also has many negative side effects. Such an attack could compel the defensive party to work in tandem with the attack initiator to maintain their anonymity. Should information on an attack become known, it could severely degrade public confidence in critical infrastructure and cause widespread panic. Furthermore, without being able to identify the various targets of the attack, the defender risks inciting even more damage against its systems. In this particular case Brenner indicates that the Chinese were using a cyber attack to prevent an armed military response while they asserted control over vast swaths of sea. When engaged in defensive cyber operations (DCOs), it is more important to know that an attack is occurring and what the targets of that attack are than it is to attribute the attack to a particular actor. But because the systems we depend on every day for every aspect\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [89]\nof national security and stability are subject to their own problems, it can be difficult to identify when hostile activity is occurring and when a system is malfunctioning due to purely technical issues not resulting from an attack.\n## SUMMARIZING THE DEBATE\nKenneth Geers accurately sums up the need for attribution when he writes: “The challenge of cyber attack attribution means that decision-makers will likely not have enough information on an adversary’s cyber capabilities, intentions, and operations to respond in a timely fashion.”²³ Attribution is a defensive necessity. Anonymity is an offensive necessity.\nThe probability of maintaining the anonymity of an attack and a target is equally important to maintaining the anonymity of the actor involved. The above analysis attempts to focus on the offensive dynamic of the anonymity-attribution debate and outline a solution for assessing the probability for maintaining anonymity at specific points in time during an attack through social scientific and technical methods. The probability for maintaining anonymity influences the probability of success in a cyber attack as much as the relative cyber power of the state engaging in the cyber attack. Adding a measure of anonymity into the decision-making model adds to the robustness of its findings and facilitates a more accurate understanding of when a state will decide to engage in offensive cyber actions.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Anonymity is a distinctive asset in covert operations, providing political plausible deniability while allowing for the attainment of a strategic or tactical objective. It is difficult to assess the true value of anonymity in cyber. From an offensive perspective the objective is to remain anonymous as long as possible while still achieving an objective. This is likely to lead an attacker to obfuscate his or her operation. As described in earlier chapters, if a target of a potential attack emanating from cyberspace knows where an attack will occur, or who will perpetrate an attack, it is much more likely to be able to defend against that attack.\nAnonymity in cyber is multifaceted. The layers of anonymity are constructed by the following characteristics: the inability to identify a perpetrator (state instigator) of an attack, the inability to recognize an attack is occurring, and the inability to isolate the target or objective of an attack. These characteristics build upon the two characteristics of attribution within Susan Brenner's legal framework for understanding cyber attacks.² These three characteristics are important for both legal and practical reasons. As *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace* accurately notes: \"The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult.\"³ Beyond simply being unable to identify the perpetrator, as is often the case in cyber attacks, it is difficult to recognize when a cyber attack is even occurring.\nTitan Rain, a cyber espionage operation targeting various defense systems, including U.S. Logistics Command, is an example of a cyber attack that stayed beneath the radar.⁴ A defender that does not know an attack is occurring is even less likely to know what the target of that attack is. The Titan Rain incident is particularly difficult to access in its entirety because the stolen data were encrypted on the way out, making it technically difficult to know what the purpose of the attack was and exactly which files were taken.⁵ The only way to judge the significance of the attack was to measure the volume of the data taken in terabytes.\nAnonymity within cyberspace is a valuable tool to both the perpetrators of attacks and the average user alike. Over the last several years I have worked with democracy NGOs around the Middle East and other regions building training platforms for democracy activists. These websites are designed to offer potential democracy activists the maximum amount of anonymity to protect them against government persecution. In this instance anonymity is a tool that safeguards liberties. This same ability to remain anonymous facilitates nefarious groups and nation-states that wish to do harm.\nAlthough this book is primarily concerned with the decision-making processes of state actors, the quote at the beginning of this chapter by the group\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [81]\nAnonymous is illustrative of the power a disparate group of nonstate actors can have in cyberspace. If states are unable to prevent ad hoc organizations such as Anonymous from taking down the websites of major governmental agencies such as the FBI or CIA, then how is it possible to defend against state actors with infinitely more resources?⁶\nVarious scholars have indicated that one of the fundamental problems associated with the structure of the Internet is that it was never designed to provide tracking and referencing of users.⁷ It is prudent to remember that the Internet as we know it was started as a private collaboration tool between universities and U.S. laboratories under the control of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In fact, at its beginning commerce was prohibited on the Internet. As the value and the volume of connections has increased, the value of anonymity has been both a blessing and a curse. For a state deciding whether to use cyber as a means of attack against another state, one of its primary considerations should and does often rightly center on anonymity.\nThe value of anonymity is supported by both anecdotal evidence as well as sound political logic. In every major case of state-on-state hostile cyber interaction, ranging from cyber exploitation (CE) to cyber attack (CA), anonymity has been a central feature. The answer as to why anonymity is a central feature of hostile state interactions within cyber is discussed in previous chapters, but it does not hurt to reiterate its central premise and applicability to the decision to instigate offensive cyber operations within cyberspace.\nA bullet or bomb launched from a gun or plane has a defined trajectory. It is possible to harden a target against them with either a bulletproof vest or a bunker. But once that trajectory has been established, the target is typically assured of impact barring some counterballistic system. In much the same way it is possible to harden cyber assets against cyber weapons. Network administrators can build firewalls or air gap networks to protect them against incoming bits and bytes. But unlike the bulletproof vest that works against any bullet regardless of type, up to a certain caliber, a firewall only protects against identified threats. And at the time of this writing it is estimated that there are approximately 200 million different types of viruses, Trojans, and worms.\nFurthermore, just as a bulletproof vest offers little protection against a howitzer round, a firewall can be overcome by larger inflows of bits and bytes (a DDoS attack). If a larger round is coming toward an individual, that individual will attempt to fortify himself or herself in a bunker and survive. The same is true of a cyber attack. If it is known that a large-scale DDoS attack will be conducted, network administrators can expand or distribute network infrastructure capacity or engage in other mitigation techniques to weather the attack.⁸ If the network administrators do not know an attack is coming, then they are likely to be casualties, as has been demonstrated in many instances including the 2010 “Operation\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nPayback,\" in which a group of substate actors from the group Anonymous took off-line via DDoS attack multiple websites including MasterCard, PayPal, and Visa. If advance warning on a cyber attack is available, a network administrator can also take systems off-line and remove targets altogether, making an attack ineffective for want of a target, or the administrator can mass defensive resources or prohibit traffic from certain points of origin.\nIf the objective of an attack is to make small changes in the defenses of another state's systems, then the goal is to hide those changes for as long as possible. Not only is it prudent to hide the attacker's identity, but it is prudent to hide the knowledge of the attack as well. Once an opponent knows it is being attacked, its security personnel begin implementing defensive measures as a response. Defenders can increase the robustness of their firewall(s), increase their network capacity, or, in worst-case scenarios, remove the systems altogether. The same is not true of conventional attacks. Once an attack is ongoing, it typically must be weathered or responded to.\nAny probability for success in cyber is dependent largely on a relationship between the objective of an attack and the ability to remain anonymous to the point at which that objective is completed. Furthermore, even if the anonymity of the attack is lost, the anonymity of the attacker can still be preserved. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the victim to retaliate with any meaningful accuracy. The three characteristics of anonymity combine to significantly condition the decision-making process of actors in cyber.\nMany scholars note anonymity is a strong characteristic of the cyber domain. Robert Axelrod and Rumen Illiev indicate that anonymity serves as a fundamental aspect of cyber attacks and define the ability to use a cyber weapon in terms of the ability of a cyber resource to maintain stealth and persistence.[10] Their argument for the importance of anonymity is based on data presented by Bilge and Dumitras suggesting that on average over the course of a three-year period only 3-5 percent of hundreds of vulnerabilities in different browsers were discovered and that the average duration of a zero-day attack is 312 days.[11] This would indicate that not only is anonymity often present as a component in the decision to attack, but that it is also an attribute of the vulnerabilities and viruses associated with the systems being attacked. Axelrod and Iliev's data on when to use a cyber resource indicate that the persistence of an unknown vulnerability is nearly 100 percent when not used, meaning that the life span of vulnerabilities is quite significant.\nBeyond just the long duration of vulnerabilities available for exploit due to their almost inherently anonymous nature and persistence, Cornish et al. argue that anonymity might also make it possible for certain actors to achieve disproportionate amounts of political utility from identical acts conducted in cyberspace.[12] While it is true a small state can create a disproportionate amount\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nof harm in cyberspace in ways not possible using conventional military tactics, it is unclear if this state derives a higher degree of utility for cyber attacks over other forms of asymmetric conflict. Instead, because political utility is compared to various options within the toolbox of state, the actual utility of cyber attacks does not change, only its relative value to other options within the overall decision set. For instance, in the case of Stuxnet, the United States had at least half a dozen options for dealing with potential Iranian nuclear development. Israel had fewer options. Economic sanctions imposed by the United States would be far more harmful than those imposed by Israelis because the United States controls much larger swaths of the global market. Under this logic, the value of a cyber attack does not change based on the size of a state; it simply alters its position within the decision set, making it appear more valuable and thus appear to have greater utility than other options. Moreover, as discussed, cyber power is dependent on many factors, among which are the theoretical capabilities of cyber power. It is a lack of these capabilities that limits the ability to conduct highly complex attacks capable of achieving significant impact.\nAnonymity provides a means by which to achieve political utility and acts as a facilitator for the application of power. Chapter 7 provides a graphical representation of the scale and complexity of attacks in relation to their feasibility. The larger and more complex an attack, the more likely it is to need anonymity over time. One exception would be distributed denial of service attacks conducted by nonstate actors who want public acknowledgment of their attack but have time-limited utility measures resulting from disruption of services. The relationship of complexity and scale with feasibility indicates an inverse relationship. The more difficult an attack, the more likely it is to be significant in either size, complexity, or both. There are only a few select countries with the technical capabilities to conduct a highly complex attack such as Stuxnet or the attack on Syrian air defense systems. There are nearly a hundred countries and large numbers of substate actors capable of conducting the type of attacks used against Estonia in 2007. The disproportionate relationship between the size of a state and anonymity is directly related to the number of potential actors and the ability to remain anonymous. Although the Stuxnet attack has not been publicly claimed, it has been widely reported as emanating from the United States and Israel through official sources within President Obama's administration.[13] Anonymity was a crucial aspect of Stuxnet, and although the attack has not been publicly claimed, particularly in the first few years after its initiation, the range of possible actors based just on factors such as complexity and scale of attack is quite small. If the attack is contextualized in foreign policy and international relations, the range narrows to possibly three and more likely two actors.\nAnonymity is a complex measure. The three characteristics of anonymity are extremely difficult to maintain indefinitely. The key is to prolong a combination\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nof the characteristics long enough to achieve an objective in cyber. Furthermore, if the identity of the attacker remains anonymous, this denies the legal justification for retaliation by the targeted state as well as denying the identification of a proper institutional format for recourse.[14]\n## POLITICAL ACTION AND ANONYMITY\nIs it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? If we follow the logic of Thomas Rid that “history does not know acts of war without eventual attribution,” then do cyber attacks constitute political acts?[15] With anonymity being a central feature that influences the success of cyber attacks, does anonymity remove the political aspect of attacks? Rid goes on to say: “aggressors engaging in subversion, espionage or sabotage do act politically; but in sharp contrast to warfare, they are likely to have a permanent or at least temporary interest in avoiding attribution. This is one of the main reasons why political crime, more than acts of war, has thrived in the cyber domain, where non-attribution may be easier to achieve than waterproof attribution.”[16]\nThis book largely steps over the linguistic gap between what constitutes an act of war and what constitutes a crime or other form of action. For the purposes of understanding anonymity the definition is largely based on the perception of the aggrieved party. However, Rid does make it clear, through linguistic nuance, that certain acts within cyber can contain political utility. Virtually all other scholars agree on this point.[17] While the linguistic distinction between war and political crime has caused a degree of animosity within the subfield, this animosity is likely misplaced and represents different linguistic traditions and conceptualizations of the state of modern conflict in regard to historical frameworks.[18]\nThe focus on the debate over whether anonymous acts that take place constitute different types of conflict is dependent on the framework of definitions a scholar uses. What is evident is that regardless of how cyber attacks are referred to in the conventional typology, they are capable of generating utility, as demonstrated in chapter 3.\n## THE VALUE OF ANONYMITY\nActs that occur in cyberspace are not necessarily anonymous, yet anonymity is a desired characteristic for the conduct of offensive cyber actions. How then can we operationalize the concept of anonymity within a rational choice decision-making model so it is logical to the decision-maker?\nBruce Bueno de Mesquita’s utility theory simply compares the power scores of different states. By using a capability (power) relationship between states he is able to determine the probability of success for the instigator of a potential\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nconflict. It is this probability of success that greatly affects the decision to engage in an act. In theory it would be possible to use Bueno de Mesquita's model to explain any type of decision to engage in interstate interactions ranging from diplomacy to war. It would be possible to rearrange the probability function of the model to incorporate those characteristics that influence successful diplomatic interactions to derive a model for bargaining. However, Bueno de Mesquita's model is focused on overt conflict. He uses power to assess the probability of success. Yet because he works in a domain of interaction where distance has an effect, his power relationship is scaled by distance.[19] Distance, as examined in previous chapters, does not matter in cyberspace as it does in conventional military encounters because cyber attacks can occur with no diminishing capability due to distance. A virus code in China does not need to be resupplied by a virus code in the United States. What does affect the probability of success is time. However, the probability of success affected by time does not interact with the power of a state, as is often the case in conventional conflict. Instead it influences the overall probability of success.\nThere are several ways to represent the relationship to time in mathematical models and probability. One of the more standard statistical methods available to test time to an event is to use a hazard or survivability model. This model is not noting the changes in the power relationship over time; rather, it is examining the probability any given type of attack can remain anonymous within the three above combined characteristics long enough to achieve the objective of the attack. More simply, it examines how long until the target knows it is being attacked, knows the target of the attack, and knows who is doing the attacking.\nThis is important to the development of a decision-making model for the instigation of cyber attacks, as has been mentioned several times. Once a victim recognizes an attack, it can begin taking defensive measures to protect itself. Once it knows the target of the attack, it can harden that target. Once it knows the perpetrator of the attack, it can begin retaliation. The question the decision-maker then asks is what is the probability at a point from time  $t_{i}$  to time  $t_{c}$  or from instigation to completion of the attack that the instigator is able to maintain anonymity. This probability changes over time. At time  $t_{i}$ , the initiation of the attack, the likelihood that anonymity is lost is relatively low. The longer the attack takes to complete, the more likely the attacker is to lose anonymity. This then becomes a fluid measure expressed in moments in time that can be graphed. Because each type of attack is unique, no two hazard models are the same.\nThe hazard model is composed of those factors essential to maintaining anonymity discussed above. It is important to know the scale (S) of an attack. The larger the attack, the more difficult it is to accomplish. Next it is important to understand the complexity (C) of the attack. The more complex an attack, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nTABLE 5.1 Probability of Maintaining Anonymity by Attack\n|  Propaganda | 99%  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Web Vandalism | 95%  |\n|  Denial of Service | 90%  |\n|  Distributed Denial of Service | 85%  |\n|  Cyber Exploitation | 80%  |\n|  Equipment Disruption | 70%  |\n|  Critical Infrastructure | 60%  |\n|  Compromised Hardware Systems | 50%  |\nmore difficult it is to accomplish. These two variables interact as well. A large and complex attack is more difficult than a small, complex attack or a large, simple one. Next, as mentioned above, it is important to contextualize the attack by determining the level of hostility (H) between nations. If state X has only two primary adversaries, it can quickly isolate the instigator of an attack against its interests. By understanding the level of hostility, it is possible to begin narrowing the number of countries in the system. The more potential actors (Q) within a grouping, the more likely a perpetrator is to remain anonymous. The expression of the hazard function is listed below in equation 5.1.\n# Hazard Function for Anonymity\n5.1  $A = \\log h_{1}(t) = a + C_{i}\\beta + S_{i}\\beta + (C_{i}S_{i})\\beta + H_{i}\\beta + Q_{i}\\beta + e$\nUsing this function with complete data, it is possible to isolate at any given point in time from the initiation of an attack to the completion of an attack the probability of maintaining anonymity across the three characteristics of anonymity. As is examined in chapter 7, this model can be greatly influenced by the collection of intelligence. Such intelligence would influence all variables within the above hazard function.\nBecause there is an assumption of anonymity necessary to instigate any attack due to the characteristics of cyber attacks as defined above, the model in this book is not filled in by data. Instead the probability of maintaining anonymity at the point of initial decision to instigate an attack is kept constant at 1. The probability of maintaining anonymity changes over time. Therefore anonymity at time  $t_0$  is always kept at 1. The probability of anonymity at  $t_{0 + n}$  is here defined by the type of attack, rather than using the hazard function for which data are not available. Attacks are broken into eight categories, each with a probability of maintaining anonymity over time. The categories and their corresponding probabilities are listed in table 5.1. These probabilities are anecdotal and as-\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [87]\nsumed. Actual probabilities for each attack would depend on the intricacies of the attack, the hostility between nations, and all of the other features included in the hazard function for anonymity.\nThe above indicates that the more complicated the attack, the more difficult it is to maintain anonymity. Although the numbers are rough, they are meant to illustrate the intersection of all three categories of anonymity. Many groups and organizations can participate in web propaganda, and it is therefore a low-level and common form of attack. Only a few states are currently capable of fully compromising hardware systems; it is therefore more difficult to maintain anonymity during such an attack.\n# ANONYMITY, ATTRIBUTION, AND DECISIONS\nAlthough many works focus on the term \"attribution,\" here the focus is on anonymity. This has been done for several reasons. First, an anonymous actor is one who avoids attribution. Many legal scholars, including Susan Brenner, tend to focus only on the attribution aspect of cyber. They do this primarily because they are concerned with the defensive capabilities of states. The ability for states to respond to cyber attacks and their perpetrators is an important aspect of cyber defense. But when we consider the offensive strategy of a state, the concern is a combination of achieving the objective and avoiding attribution. For an attack to gain political utility, a state must achieve its stated objective. If a state cannot achieve even the minimum threshold of its objective, an attack remains unattributed if it did not gain any political utility. Anonymity is a fundamental aspect of offensive cyber operations (OCOs). Attribution is a fundamental aspect of cyber defense. The focus of this book is on developing a model that examines how states decide to attack; therefore attribution is largely ignored from a defensive orientation except where it affects the probability of success.\nWheeler and Larson define attribution as \"determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker's intermediary.\"20 Once a targeted country begins the attribution process, it is often after an attack has been completed. It is doubtful that the Israelis cared that the Syrians knew they invaded their airspace to bomb the nuclear facilities. They had already gained the benefit they sought. The Syrians did not respond militarily because they had already lost that which they sought to protect. In cyber it is more important to identify that an attack is occurring, what the target of that attack is, and how to prevent the achievement of an attacker's goal, than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack.\nDeterrence does not work the same in cyber as in conventional conflict. Simply identifying the attacker and threatening response is typically not possible. And even when it is possible, it is only feasible with a cross-domain re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nsponse. Such a response would likely escalate a conflict significantly with unforeseen consequences.\nThe response mechanism to a cyber attack is theoretically confined in the short term to cross-domain actions due to an inability to quickly and efficiently plan meaningful on-the-fly attacks against an adversary. Cyber attacks are tailored to specific systems and require extensive planning and development to be successful. Unless the groundwork was laid out in advance, making it possible to conduct retaliatory in-domain attacks, a state's primary function is to remove the first two characteristics of anonymity by determining that an attack is occurring, and second, what the target of that attack is.\nJoel Brenner created a hypothetical scenario in which attribution is attained but matters far less than the recognition that an attack was occurring and a comprehension of the target of that attack.[21] The scenario is one in which the previously laid groundwork for a coordinated attack against U.S. critical infrastructure begins to take down vital U.S. systems coinciding with a foreign policy flap occurring with China. The decision-makers are paralyzed because at first it is not known whether the critical infrastructure malfunctions are due to an attack or normal error. As the malfunctions continue to occur, it becomes apparent the malfunctions are due to an attack and not an error. Although the likely attributable source is China, that is of little importance. The anonymity of the attack and the targets of the attack are more important than pointing fingers. The ability to hide an attack and the target of an attack facilitates it. In Brenner's case, by the time it was recognized as an attack it was too late to do anything, let alone isolate future targets, and the United States didn't have assets in place to retaliate in kind. Brenner notes that a cross-domain response would have been a prelude to all-out war with unforeseen consequences between two nuclear-armed states. The systems affected were such that even the kill switch mechanism once proposed in Congress would not have been of much use.[22]\nMoreover, to publicly attribute the system failures within the U.S. critical infrastructure without having a means to stop them also has many negative side effects. Such an attack could compel the defensive party to work in tandem with the attack initiator to maintain their anonymity. Should information on an attack become known, it could severely degrade public confidence in critical infrastructure and cause widespread panic. Furthermore, without being able to identify the various targets of the attack, the defender risks inciting even more damage against its systems. In this particular case Brenner indicates that the Chinese were using a cyber attack to prevent an armed military response while they asserted control over vast swaths of sea. When engaged in defensive cyber operations (DCOs), it is more important to know that an attack is occurring and what the targets of that attack are than it is to attribute the attack to a particular actor. But because the systems we depend on every day for every aspect\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [89]\nof national security and stability are subject to their own problems, it can be difficult to identify when hostile activity is occurring and when a system is malfunctioning due to purely technical issues not resulting from an attack.\n## SUMMARIZING THE DEBATE\nKenneth Geers accurately sums up the need for attribution when he writes: “The challenge of cyber attack attribution means that decision-makers will likely not have enough information on an adversary’s cyber capabilities, intentions, and operations to respond in a timely fashion.”²³ Attribution is a defensive necessity. Anonymity is an offensive necessity.\nThe probability of maintaining the anonymity of an attack and a target is equally important to maintaining the anonymity of the actor involved. The above analysis attempts to focus on the offensive dynamic of the anonymity-attribution debate and outline a solution for assessing the probability for maintaining anonymity at specific points in time during an attack through social scientific and technical methods. The probability for maintaining anonymity influences the probability of success in a cyber attack as much as the relative cyber power of the state engaging in the cyber attack. Adding a measure of anonymity into the decision-making model adds to the robustness of its findings and facilitates a more accurate understanding of when a state will decide to engage in offensive cyber actions.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

    "# Anonymity and Attribution in Cyberspace": "There is a powerful tension in our relationship to technology. We are excited by egalitarianism and anonymity, but we constantly fight for our identity. David Owens, \"Anonymous 'Takes Down' CIA Website\"\nWe are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us. Quoted in Scott S., \"We Are Anonymous\"\nANONYMITY AND, BY EXTENSION, attribution are two fundamental aspects of the cyber domain. When a state decides to attack another state, it is not concerned solely with its relative power to its adversary. An attacking state is concerned with the power of its adversary and its ability to conduct an attack against an adversary while maintaining anonymity. Anonymity in cyberspace in the initiation and implementation phases of an attack provides the freedom to maneuver. Webster's defines anonymity as follows:\n1: of unknown authorship or origin\n2: not named or identified\n3: lacking individuality, distinction, or recognizability\nThe analysis below focuses on the origin or instigating actor, the target that is not identified, and the recognition that an attack is occurring. Specifically the concept of anonymity is approached from the offensive perspective of a state considering instigating a cyber attack against a potential opponent.\nTo understand anonymity it is necessary to ask basic questions of international politics. First, why is anonymity important to a cyber attacker? Second, is it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? Third, why is attribution important to a cyber defender? These three questions are answered below followed by a summary of the importance of understanding anonymity and attribution in offensive cyber decision-making.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE",
    "# THE IMPORTANCE OF ANONYMITY": "Most of the literature on cyber attacks makes clear that one of the most valuable aspects of the cyber domain is anonymity. Anonymity is a distinctive asset in covert operations, providing political plausible deniability while allowing for the attainment of a strategic or tactical objective. It is difficult to assess the true value of anonymity in cyber. From an offensive perspective the objective is to remain anonymous as long as possible while still achieving an objective. This is likely to lead an attacker to obfuscate his or her operation. As described in earlier chapters, if a target of a potential attack emanating from cyberspace knows where an attack will occur, or who will perpetrate an attack, it is much more likely to be able to defend against that attack.\nAnonymity in cyber is multifaceted. The layers of anonymity are constructed by the following characteristics: the inability to identify a perpetrator (state instigator) of an attack, the inability to recognize an attack is occurring, and the inability to isolate the target or objective of an attack. These characteristics build upon the two characteristics of attribution within Susan Brenner's legal framework for understanding cyber attacks.² These three characteristics are important for both legal and practical reasons. As *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace* accurately notes: \"The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult.\"³ Beyond simply being unable to identify the perpetrator, as is often the case in cyber attacks, it is difficult to recognize when a cyber attack is even occurring.\nTitan Rain, a cyber espionage operation targeting various defense systems, including U.S. Logistics Command, is an example of a cyber attack that stayed beneath the radar.⁴ A defender that does not know an attack is occurring is even less likely to know what the target of that attack is. The Titan Rain incident is particularly difficult to access in its entirety because the stolen data were encrypted on the way out, making it technically difficult to know what the purpose of the attack was and exactly which files were taken.⁵ The only way to judge the significance of the attack was to measure the volume of the data taken in terabytes.\nAnonymity within cyberspace is a valuable tool to both the perpetrators of attacks and the average user alike. Over the last several years I have worked with democracy NGOs around the Middle East and other regions building training platforms for democracy activists. These websites are designed to offer potential democracy activists the maximum amount of anonymity to protect them against government persecution. In this instance anonymity is a tool that safeguards liberties. This same ability to remain anonymous facilitates nefarious groups and nation-states that wish to do harm.\nAlthough this book is primarily concerned with the decision-making processes of state actors, the quote at the beginning of this chapter by the group\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nAnonymous is illustrative of the power a disparate group of nonstate actors can have in cyberspace. If states are unable to prevent ad hoc organizations such as Anonymous from taking down the websites of major governmental agencies such as the FBI or CIA, then how is it possible to defend against state actors with infinitely more resources?⁶\nVarious scholars have indicated that one of the fundamental problems associated with the structure of the Internet is that it was never designed to provide tracking and referencing of users.⁷ It is prudent to remember that the Internet as we know it was started as a private collaboration tool between universities and U.S. laboratories under the control of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In fact, at its beginning commerce was prohibited on the Internet. As the value and the volume of connections has increased, the value of anonymity has been both a blessing and a curse. For a state deciding whether to use cyber as a means of attack against another state, one of its primary considerations should and does often rightly center on anonymity.\nThe value of anonymity is supported by both anecdotal evidence as well as sound political logic. In every major case of state-on-state hostile cyber interaction, ranging from cyber exploitation (CE) to cyber attack (CA), anonymity has been a central feature. The answer as to why anonymity is a central feature of hostile state interactions within cyber is discussed in previous chapters, but it does not hurt to reiterate its central premise and applicability to the decision to instigate offensive cyber operations within cyberspace.\nA bullet or bomb launched from a gun or plane has a defined trajectory. It is possible to harden a target against them with either a bulletproof vest or a bunker. But once that trajectory has been established, the target is typically assured of impact barring some counterballistic system. In much the same way it is possible to harden cyber assets against cyber weapons. Network administrators can build firewalls or air gap networks to protect them against incoming bits and bytes. But unlike the bulletproof vest that works against any bullet regardless of type, up to a certain caliber, a firewall only protects against identified threats. And at the time of this writing it is estimated that there are approximately 200 million different types of viruses, Trojans, and worms.\nFurthermore, just as a bulletproof vest offers little protection against a howitzer round, a firewall can be overcome by larger inflows of bits and bytes (a DDoS attack). If a larger round is coming toward an individual, that individual will attempt to fortify himself or herself in a bunker and survive. The same is true of a cyber attack. If it is known that a large-scale DDoS attack will be conducted, network administrators can expand or distribute network infrastructure capacity or engage in other mitigation techniques to weather the attack.⁸ If the network administrators do not know an attack is coming, then they are likely to be casualties, as has been demonstrated in many instances including the 2010 “Operation\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nPayback,\" in which a group of substate actors from the group Anonymous took off-line via DDoS attack multiple websites including MasterCard, PayPal, and Visa. If advance warning on a cyber attack is available, a network administrator can also take systems off-line and remove targets altogether, making an attack ineffective for want of a target, or the administrator can mass defensive resources or prohibit traffic from certain points of origin.\nIf the objective of an attack is to make small changes in the defenses of another state's systems, then the goal is to hide those changes for as long as possible. Not only is it prudent to hide the attacker's identity, but it is prudent to hide the knowledge of the attack as well. Once an opponent knows it is being attacked, its security personnel begin implementing defensive measures as a response. Defenders can increase the robustness of their firewall(s), increase their network capacity, or, in worst-case scenarios, remove the systems altogether. The same is not true of conventional attacks. Once an attack is ongoing, it typically must be weathered or responded to.\nAny probability for success in cyber is dependent largely on a relationship between the objective of an attack and the ability to remain anonymous to the point at which that objective is completed. Furthermore, even if the anonymity of the attack is lost, the anonymity of the attacker can still be preserved. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the victim to retaliate with any meaningful accuracy. The three characteristics of anonymity combine to significantly condition the decision-making process of actors in cyber.\nMany scholars note anonymity is a strong characteristic of the cyber domain. Robert Axelrod and Rumen Illiev indicate that anonymity serves as a fundamental aspect of cyber attacks and define the ability to use a cyber weapon in terms of the ability of a cyber resource to maintain stealth and persistence. Their argument for the importance of anonymity is based on data presented by Bilge and Dumitras suggesting that on average over the course of a three-year period only 3-5 percent of hundreds of vulnerabilities in different browsers were discovered and that the average duration of a zero-day attack is 312 days. This would indicate that not only is anonymity often present as a component in the decision to attack, but that it is also an attribute of the vulnerabilities and viruses associated with the systems being attacked. Axelrod and Iliev's data on when to use a cyber resource indicate that the persistence of an unknown vulnerability is nearly 100 percent when not used, meaning that the life span of vulnerabilities is quite significant.\nBeyond just the long duration of vulnerabilities available for exploit due to their almost inherently anonymous nature and persistence, Cornish et al. argue that anonymity might also make it possible for certain actors to achieve disproportionate amounts of political utility from identical acts conducted in cyberspace. While it is true a small state can create a disproportionate amount\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nof harm in cyberspace in ways not possible using conventional military tactics, it is unclear if this state derives a higher degree of utility for cyber attacks over other forms of asymmetric conflict. Instead, because political utility is compared to various options within the toolbox of state, the actual utility of cyber attacks does not change, only its relative value to other options within the overall decision set. For instance, in the case of Stuxnet, the United States had at least half a dozen options for dealing with potential Iranian nuclear development. Israel had fewer options. Economic sanctions imposed by the United States would be far more harmful than those imposed by Israelis because the United States controls much larger swaths of the global market. Under this logic, the value of a cyber attack does not change based on the size of a state; it simply alters its position within the decision set, making it appear more valuable and thus appear to have greater utility than other options. Moreover, as discussed, cyber power is dependent on many factors, among which are the theoretical capabilities of cyber power. It is a lack of these capabilities that limits the ability to conduct highly complex attacks capable of achieving significant impact.\nAnonymity provides a means by which to achieve political utility and acts as a facilitator for the application of power. Chapter 7 provides a graphical representation of the scale and complexity of attacks in relation to their feasibility. The larger and more complex an attack, the more likely it is to need anonymity over time. One exception would be distributed denial of service attacks conducted by nonstate actors who want public acknowledgment of their attack but have time-limited utility measures resulting from disruption of services. The relationship of complexity and scale with feasibility indicates an inverse relationship. The more difficult an attack, the more likely it is to be significant in either size, complexity, or both. There are only a few select countries with the technical capabilities to conduct a highly complex attack such as Stuxnet or the attack on Syrian air defense systems. There are nearly a hundred countries and large numbers of substate actors capable of conducting the type of attacks used against Estonia in 2007. The disproportionate relationship between the size of a state and anonymity is directly related to the number of potential actors and the ability to remain anonymous. Although the Stuxnet attack has not been publicly claimed, it has been widely reported as emanating from the United States and Israel through official sources within President Obama's administration. Anonymity was a crucial aspect of Stuxnet, and although the attack has not been publicly claimed, particularly in the first few years after its initiation, the range of possible actors based just on factors such as complexity and scale of attack is quite small. If the attack is contextualized in foreign policy and international relations, the range narrows to possibly three and more likely two actors.\nAnonymity is a complex measure. The three characteristics of anonymity are extremely difficult to maintain indefinitely. The key is to prolong a combination\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nof the characteristics long enough to achieve an objective in cyber. Furthermore, if the identity of the attacker remains anonymous, this denies the legal justification for retaliation by the targeted state as well as denying the identification of a proper institutional format for recourse.\n## POLITICAL ACTION AND ANONYMITY\nIs it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? If we follow the logic of Thomas Rid that “history does not know acts of war without eventual attribution,” then do cyber attacks constitute political acts? With anonymity being a central feature that influences the success of cyber attacks, does anonymity remove the political aspect of attacks? Rid goes on to say: “aggressors engaging in subversion, espionage or sabotage do act politically; but in sharp contrast to warfare, they are likely to have a permanent or at least temporary interest in avoiding attribution. This is one of the main reasons why political crime, more than acts of war, has thrived in the cyber domain, where non-attribution may be easier to achieve than waterproof attribution.”\nThis book largely steps over the linguistic gap between what constitutes an act of war and what constitutes a crime or other form of action. For the purposes of understanding anonymity the definition is largely based on the perception of the aggrieved party. However, Rid does make it clear, through linguistic nuance, that certain acts within cyber can contain political utility. Virtually all other scholars agree on this point. While the linguistic distinction between war and political crime has caused a degree of animosity within the subfield, this animosity is likely misplaced and represents different linguistic traditions and conceptualizations of the state of modern conflict in regard to historical frameworks.\nThe focus on the debate over whether anonymous acts that take place constitute different types of conflict is dependent on the framework of definitions a scholar uses. What is evident is that regardless of how cyber attacks are referred to in the conventional typology, they are capable of generating utility, as demonstrated in chapter 3.\n## THE VALUE OF ANONYMITY\nActs that occur in cyberspace are not necessarily anonymous, yet anonymity is a desired characteristic for the conduct of offensive cyber actions. How then can we operationalize the concept of anonymity within a rational choice decision-making model so it is logical to the decision-maker?\nBruce Bueno de Mesquita’s utility theory simply compares the power scores of different states. By using a capability (power) relationship between states he is able to determine the probability of success for the instigator of a potential\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nconflict. It is this probability of success that greatly affects the decision to engage in an act. In theory it would be possible to use Bueno de Mesquita's model to explain any type of decision to engage in interstate interactions ranging from diplomacy to war. It would be possible to rearrange the probability function of the model to incorporate those characteristics that influence successful diplomatic interactions to derive a model for bargaining. However, Bueno de Mesquita's model is focused on overt conflict. He uses power to assess the probability of success. Yet because he works in a domain of interaction where distance has an effect, his power relationship is scaled by distance. Distance, as examined in previous chapters, does not matter in cyberspace as it does in conventional military encounters because cyber attacks can occur with no diminishing capability due to distance. A virus code in China does not need to be resupplied by a virus code in the United States. What does affect the probability of success is time. However, the probability of success affected by time does not interact with the power of a state, as is often the case in conventional conflict. Instead it influences the overall probability of success.\nThere are several ways to represent the relationship to time in mathematical models and probability. One of the more standard statistical methods available to test time to an event is to use a hazard or survivability model. This model is not noting the changes in the power relationship over time; rather, it is examining the probability any given type of attack can remain anonymous within the three above combined characteristics long enough to achieve the objective of the attack. More simply, it examines how long until the target knows it is being attacked, knows the target of the attack, and knows who is doing the attacking.\nThis is important to the development of a decision-making model for the instigation of cyber attacks, as has been mentioned several times. Once a victim recognizes an attack, it can begin taking defensive measures to protect itself. Once it knows the target of the attack, it can harden that target. Once it knows the perpetrator of the attack, it can begin retaliation. The question the decision-maker then asks is what is the probability at a point from time  $t_{i}$  to time  $t_{c}$  or from instigation to completion of the attack that the instigator is able to maintain anonymity. This probability changes over time. At time  $t_{i}$ , the initiation of the attack, the likelihood that anonymity is lost is relatively low. The longer the attack takes to complete, the more likely the attacker is to lose anonymity. This then becomes a fluid measure expressed in moments in time that can be graphed. Because each type of attack is unique, no two hazard models are the same.\nThe hazard model is composed of those factors essential to maintaining anonymity discussed above. It is important to know the scale (S) of an attack. The larger the attack, the more difficult it is to accomplish. Next it is important to understand the complexity (C) of the attack. The more complex an attack, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nTABLE 5.1 Probability of Maintaining Anonymity by Attack\n|  Propaganda | 99%  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Web Vandalism | 95%  |\n|  Denial of Service | 90%  |\n|  Distributed Denial of Service | 85%  |\n|  Cyber Exploitation | 80%  |\n|  Equipment Disruption | 70%  |\n|  Critical Infrastructure | 60%  |\n|  Compromised Hardware Systems | 50%  |\nmore difficult it is to accomplish. These two variables interact as well. A large and complex attack is more difficult than a small, complex attack or a large, simple one. Next, as mentioned above, it is important to contextualize the attack by determining the level of hostility (H) between nations. If state X has only two primary adversaries, it can quickly isolate the instigator of an attack against its interests. By understanding the level of hostility, it is possible to begin narrowing the number of countries in the system. The more potential actors (Q) within a grouping, the more likely a perpetrator is to remain anonymous. The expression of the hazard function is listed below in equation 5.1.",
    "# Hazard Function for Anonymity": "5.1  $A = \\log h_{1}(t) = a + C_{i}\\beta + S_{i}\\beta + (C_{i}S_{i})\\beta + H_{i}\\beta + Q_{i}\\beta + e$\nUsing this function with complete data, it is possible to isolate at any given point in time from the initiation of an attack to the completion of an attack the probability of maintaining anonymity across the three characteristics of anonymity. As is examined in chapter 7, this model can be greatly influenced by the collection of intelligence. Such intelligence would influence all variables within the above hazard function.\nBecause there is an assumption of anonymity necessary to instigate any attack due to the characteristics of cyber attacks as defined above, the model in this book is not filled in by data. Instead the probability of maintaining anonymity at the point of initial decision to instigate an attack is kept constant at 1. The probability of maintaining anonymity changes over time. Therefore anonymity at time  $t_0$  is always kept at 1. The probability of anonymity at  $t_{0 + n}$  is here defined by the type of attack, rather than using the hazard function for which data are not available. Attacks are broken into eight categories, each with a probability of maintaining anonymity over time. The categories and their corresponding probabilities are listed in table 5.1. These probabilities are anecdotal and as-\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nsumed. Actual probabilities for each attack would depend on the intricacies of the attack, the hostility between nations, and all of the other features included in the hazard function for anonymity.\nThe above indicates that the more complicated the attack, the more difficult it is to maintain anonymity. Although the numbers are rough, they are meant to illustrate the intersection of all three categories of anonymity. Many groups and organizations can participate in web propaganda, and it is therefore a low-level and common form of attack. Only a few states are currently capable of fully compromising hardware systems; it is therefore more difficult to maintain anonymity during such an attack.",
    "# ANONYMITY, ATTRIBUTION, AND DECISIONS": "Although many works focus on the term \"attribution,\" here the focus is on anonymity. This has been done for several reasons. First, an anonymous actor is one who avoids attribution. Many legal scholars, including Susan Brenner, tend to focus only on the attribution aspect of cyber. They do this primarily because they are concerned with the defensive capabilities of states. The ability for states to respond to cyber attacks and their perpetrators is an important aspect of cyber defense. But when we consider the offensive strategy of a state, the concern is a combination of achieving the objective and avoiding attribution. For an attack to gain political utility, a state must achieve its stated objective. If a state cannot achieve even the minimum threshold of its objective, an attack remains unattributed if it did not gain any political utility. Anonymity is a fundamental aspect of offensive cyber operations (OCOs). Attribution is a fundamental aspect of cyber defense. The focus of this book is on developing a model that examines how states decide to attack; therefore attribution is largely ignored from a defensive orientation except where it affects the probability of success.\nWheeler and Larson define attribution as \"determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker's intermediary.\"20 Once a targeted country begins the attribution process, it is often after an attack has been completed. It is doubtful that the Israelis cared that the Syrians knew they invaded their airspace to bomb the nuclear facilities. They had already gained the benefit they sought. The Syrians did not respond militarily because they had already lost that which they sought to protect. In cyber it is more important to identify that an attack is occurring, what the target of that attack is, and how to prevent the achievement of an attacker's goal, than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack.\nDeterrence does not work the same in cyber as in conventional conflict. Simply identifying the attacker and threatening response is typically not possible. And even when it is possible, it is only feasible with a cross-domain re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nsponse. Such a response would likely escalate a conflict significantly with unforeseen consequences.\nThe response mechanism to a cyber attack is theoretically confined in the short term to cross-domain actions due to an inability to quickly and efficiently plan meaningful on-the-fly attacks against an adversary. Cyber attacks are tailored to specific systems and require extensive planning and development to be successful. Unless the groundwork was laid out in advance, making it possible to conduct retaliatory in-domain attacks, a state's primary function is to remove the first two characteristics of anonymity by determining that an attack is occurring, and second, what the target of that attack is.\nJoel Brenner created a hypothetical scenario in which attribution is attained but matters far less than the recognition that an attack was occurring and a comprehension of the target of that attack. The scenario is one in which the previously laid groundwork for a coordinated attack against U.S. critical infrastructure begins to take down vital U.S. systems coinciding with a foreign policy flap occurring with China. The decision-makers are paralyzed because at first it is not known whether the critical infrastructure malfunctions are due to an attack or normal error. As the malfunctions continue to occur, it becomes apparent the malfunctions are due to an attack and not an error. Although the likely attributable source is China, that is of little importance. The anonymity of the attack and the targets of the attack are more important than pointing fingers. The ability to hide an attack and the target of an attack facilitates it. In Brenner's case, by the time it was recognized as an attack it was too late to do anything, let alone isolate future targets, and the United States didn't have assets in place to retaliate in kind. Brenner notes that a cross-domain response would have been a prelude to all-out war with unforeseen consequences between two nuclear-armed states. The systems affected were such that even the kill switch mechanism once proposed in Congress would not have been of much use.\nMoreover, to publicly attribute the system failures within the U.S. critical infrastructure without having a means to stop them also has many negative side effects. Such an attack could compel the defensive party to work in tandem with the attack initiator to maintain their anonymity. Should information on an attack become known, it could severely degrade public confidence in critical infrastructure and cause widespread panic. Furthermore, without being able to identify the various targets of the attack, the defender risks inciting even more damage against its systems. In this particular case Brenner indicates that the Chinese were using a cyber attack to prevent an armed military response while they asserted control over vast swaths of sea. When engaged in defensive cyber operations (DCOs), it is more important to know that an attack is occurring and what the targets of that attack are than it is to attribute the attack to a particular actor. But because the systems we depend on every day for every aspect\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nof national security and stability are subject to their own problems, it can be difficult to identify when hostile activity is occurring and when a system is malfunctioning due to purely technical issues not resulting from an attack.\n## SUMMARIZING THE DEBATE\nKenneth Geers accurately sums up the need for attribution when he writes: “The challenge of cyber attack attribution means that decision-makers will likely not have enough information on an adversary’s cyber capabilities, intentions, and operations to respond in a timely fashion.”²³ Attribution is a defensive necessity. Anonymity is an offensive necessity.\nThe probability of maintaining the anonymity of an attack and a target is equally important to maintaining the anonymity of the actor involved. The above analysis attempts to focus on the offensive dynamic of the anonymity-attribution debate and outline a solution for assessing the probability for maintaining anonymity at specific points in time during an attack through social scientific and technical methods. The probability for maintaining anonymity influences the probability of success in a cyber attack as much as the relative cyber power of the state engaging in the cyber attack. Adding a measure of anonymity into the decision-making model adds to the robustness of its findings and facilitates a more accurate understanding of when a state will decide to engage in offensive cyber actions.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

We are excited by egalitarianism and anonymity, but we constantly fight for our identity. David Owens, \"Anonymous 'Takes Down' CIA Website\"\nWe are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us. Quoted in Scott S., \"We Are Anonymous\"\nANONYMITY AND, BY EXTENSION, attribution are two fundamental aspects of the cyber domain. When a state decides to attack another state, it is not concerned solely with its relative power to its adversary. An attacking state is concerned with the power of its adversary and its ability to conduct an attack against an adversary while maintaining anonymity. Anonymity in cyberspace in the initiation and implementation phases of an attack provides the freedom to maneuver. Webster's defines anonymity as follows:\n1: of unknown authorship or origin\n2: not named or identified\n3: lacking individuality, distinction, or recognizability\nThe analysis below focuses on the origin or instigating actor, the target that is not identified, and the recognition that an attack is occurring. Specifically the concept of anonymity is approached from the offensive perspective of a state considering instigating a cyber attack against a potential opponent.\nTo understand anonymity it is necessary to ask basic questions of international politics. First, why is anonymity important to a cyber attacker? Second, is it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? Third, why is attribution important to a cyber defender? These three questions are answered below followed by a summary of the importance of understanding anonymity and attribution in offensive cyber decision-making.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\n# THE IMPORTANCE OF ANONYMITY\nMost of the literature on cyber attacks makes clear that one of the most valuable aspects of the cyber domain is anonymity. Anonymity is a distinctive asset in covert operations, providing political plausible deniability while allowing for the attainment of a strategic or tactical objective. It is difficult to assess the true value of anonymity in cyber. From an offensive perspective the objective is to remain anonymous as long as possible while still achieving an objective. This is likely to lead an attacker to obfuscate his or her operation. As described in earlier chapters, if a target of a potential attack emanating from cyberspace knows where an attack will occur, or who will perpetrate an attack, it is much more likely to be able to defend against that attack.\nAnonymity in cyber is multifaceted. The layers of anonymity are constructed by the following characteristics: the inability to identify a perpetrator (state instigator) of an attack, the inability to recognize an attack is occurring, and the inability to isolate the target or objective of an attack. These characteristics build upon the two characteristics of attribution within Susan Brenner's legal framework for understanding cyber attacks.² These three characteristics are important for both legal and practical reasons. As *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace* accurately notes: \"The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult.\"³ Beyond simply being unable to identify the perpetrator, as is often the case in cyber attacks, it is difficult to recognize when a cyber attack is even occurring.\nTitan Rain, a cyber espionage operation targeting various defense systems, including U.S. Logistics Command, is an example of a cyber attack that stayed beneath the radar.⁴ A defender that does not know an attack is occurring is even less likely to know what the target of that attack is. The Titan Rain incident is particularly difficult to access in its entirety because the stolen data were encrypted on the way out, making it technically difficult to know what the purpose of the attack was and exactly which files were taken.⁵ The only way to judge the significance of the attack was to measure the volume of the data taken in terabytes.\nAnonymity within cyberspace is a valuable tool to both the perpetrators of attacks and the average user alike. Over the last several years I have worked with democracy NGOs around the Middle East and other regions building training platforms for democracy activists. These websites are designed to offer potential democracy activists the maximum amount of anonymity to protect them against government persecution. In this instance anonymity is a tool that safeguards liberties. This same ability to remain anonymous facilitates nefarious groups and nation-states that wish to do harm.\nAlthough this book is primarily concerned with the decision-making processes of state actors, the quote at the beginning of this chapter by the group\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [81]\nAnonymous is illustrative of the power a disparate group of nonstate actors can have in cyberspace. If states are unable to prevent ad hoc organizations such as Anonymous from taking down the websites of major governmental agencies such as the FBI or CIA, then how is it possible to defend against state actors with infinitely more resources?⁶\nVarious scholars have indicated that one of the fundamental problems associated with the structure of the Internet is that it was never designed to provide tracking and referencing of users.⁷ It is prudent to remember that the Internet as we know it was started as a private collaboration tool between universities and U.S. laboratories under the control of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In fact, at its beginning commerce was prohibited on the Internet. As the value and the volume of connections has increased, the value of anonymity has been both a blessing and a curse. For a state deciding whether to use cyber as a means of attack against another state, one of its primary considerations should and does often rightly center on anonymity.\nThe value of anonymity is supported by both anecdotal evidence as well as sound political logic. In every major case of state-on-state hostile cyber interaction, ranging from cyber exploitation (CE) to cyber attack (CA), anonymity has been a central feature. The answer as to why anonymity is a central feature of hostile state interactions within cyber is discussed in previous chapters, but it does not hurt to reiterate its central premise and applicability to the decision to instigate offensive cyber operations within cyberspace.\nA bullet or bomb launched from a gun or plane has a defined trajectory. It is possible to harden a target against them with either a bulletproof vest or a bunker. But once that trajectory has been established, the target is typically assured of impact barring some counterballistic system. In much the same way it is possible to harden cyber assets against cyber weapons. Network administrators can build firewalls or air gap networks to protect them against incoming bits and bytes. But unlike the bulletproof vest that works against any bullet regardless of type, up to a certain caliber, a firewall only protects against identified threats. And at the time of this writing it is estimated that there are approximately 200 million different types of viruses, Trojans, and worms.\nFurthermore, just as a bulletproof vest offers little protection against a howitzer round, a firewall can be overcome by larger inflows of bits and bytes (a DDoS attack). If a larger round is coming toward an individual, that individual will attempt to fortify himself or herself in a bunker and survive. The same is true of a cyber attack. If it is known that a large-scale DDoS attack will be conducted, network administrators can expand or distribute network infrastructure capacity or engage in other mitigation techniques to weather the attack.⁸ If the network administrators do not know an attack is coming, then they are likely to be casualties, as has been demonstrated in many instances including the 2010 “Operation\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nPayback,\" in which a group of substate actors from the group Anonymous took off-line via DDoS attack multiple websites including MasterCard, PayPal, and Visa. If advance warning on a cyber attack is available, a network administrator can also take systems off-line and remove targets altogether, making an attack ineffective for want of a target, or the administrator can mass defensive resources or prohibit traffic from certain points of origin.\nIf the objective of an attack is to make small changes in the defenses of another state's systems, then the goal is to hide those changes for as long as possible. Not only is it prudent to hide the attacker's identity, but it is prudent to hide the knowledge of the attack as well. Once an opponent knows it is being attacked, its security personnel begin implementing defensive measures as a response. Defenders can increase the robustness of their firewall(s), increase their network capacity, or, in worst-case scenarios, remove the systems altogether. The same is not true of conventional attacks. Once an attack is ongoing, it typically must be weathered or responded to.\nAny probability for success in cyber is dependent largely on a relationship between the objective of an attack and the ability to remain anonymous to the point at which that objective is completed. Furthermore, even if the anonymity of the attack is lost, the anonymity of the attacker can still be preserved. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the victim to retaliate with any meaningful accuracy. The three characteristics of anonymity combine to significantly condition the decision-making process of actors in cyber.\nMany scholars note anonymity is a strong characteristic of the cyber domain. Robert Axelrod and Rumen Illiev indicate that anonymity serves as a fundamental aspect of cyber attacks and define the ability to use a cyber weapon in terms of the ability of a cyber resource to maintain stealth and persistence.[10] Their argument for the importance of anonymity is based on data presented by Bilge and Dumitras suggesting that on average over the course of a three-year period only 3-5 percent of hundreds of vulnerabilities in different browsers were discovered and that the average duration of a zero-day attack is 312 days.[11] This would indicate that not only is anonymity often present as a component in the decision to attack, but that it is also an attribute of the vulnerabilities and viruses associated with the systems being attacked. Axelrod and Iliev's data on when to use a cyber resource indicate that the persistence of an unknown vulnerability is nearly 100 percent when not used, meaning that the life span of vulnerabilities is quite significant.\nBeyond just the long duration of vulnerabilities available for exploit due to their almost inherently anonymous nature and persistence, Cornish et al. argue that anonymity might also make it possible for certain actors to achieve disproportionate amounts of political utility from identical acts conducted in cyberspace.[12] While it is true a small state can create a disproportionate amount\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nof harm in cyberspace in ways not possible using conventional military tactics, it is unclear if this state derives a higher degree of utility for cyber attacks over other forms of asymmetric conflict. Instead, because political utility is compared to various options within the toolbox of state, the actual utility of cyber attacks does not change, only its relative value to other options within the overall decision set. For instance, in the case of Stuxnet, the United States had at least half a dozen options for dealing with potential Iranian nuclear development. Israel had fewer options. Economic sanctions imposed by the United States would be far more harmful than those imposed by Israelis because the United States controls much larger swaths of the global market. Under this logic, the value of a cyber attack does not change based on the size of a state; it simply alters its position within the decision set, making it appear more valuable and thus appear to have greater utility than other options. Moreover, as discussed, cyber power is dependent on many factors, among which are the theoretical capabilities of cyber power. It is a lack of these capabilities that limits the ability to conduct highly complex attacks capable of achieving significant impact.\nAnonymity provides a means by which to achieve political utility and acts as a facilitator for the application of power. Chapter 7 provides a graphical representation of the scale and complexity of attacks in relation to their feasibility. The larger and more complex an attack, the more likely it is to need anonymity over time. One exception would be distributed denial of service attacks conducted by nonstate actors who want public acknowledgment of their attack but have time-limited utility measures resulting from disruption of services. The relationship of complexity and scale with feasibility indicates an inverse relationship. The more difficult an attack, the more likely it is to be significant in either size, complexity, or both. There are only a few select countries with the technical capabilities to conduct a highly complex attack such as Stuxnet or the attack on Syrian air defense systems. There are nearly a hundred countries and large numbers of substate actors capable of conducting the type of attacks used against Estonia in 2007. The disproportionate relationship between the size of a state and anonymity is directly related to the number of potential actors and the ability to remain anonymous. Although the Stuxnet attack has not been publicly claimed, it has been widely reported as emanating from the United States and Israel through official sources within President Obama's administration.[13] Anonymity was a crucial aspect of Stuxnet, and although the attack has not been publicly claimed, particularly in the first few years after its initiation, the range of possible actors based just on factors such as complexity and scale of attack is quite small. If the attack is contextualized in foreign policy and international relations, the range narrows to possibly three and more likely two actors.\nAnonymity is a complex measure. The three characteristics of anonymity are extremely difficult to maintain indefinitely. The key is to prolong a combination\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nof the characteristics long enough to achieve an objective in cyber. Furthermore, if the identity of the attacker remains anonymous, this denies the legal justification for retaliation by the targeted state as well as denying the identification of a proper institutional format for recourse.[14]\n## POLITICAL ACTION AND ANONYMITY\nIs it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? If we follow the logic of Thomas Rid that “history does not know acts of war without eventual attribution,” then do cyber attacks constitute political acts?[15] With anonymity being a central feature that influences the success of cyber attacks, does anonymity remove the political aspect of attacks? Rid goes on to say: “aggressors engaging in subversion, espionage or sabotage do act politically; but in sharp contrast to warfare, they are likely to have a permanent or at least temporary interest in avoiding attribution. This is one of the main reasons why political crime, more than acts of war, has thrived in the cyber domain, where non-attribution may be easier to achieve than waterproof attribution.”[16]\nThis book largely steps over the linguistic gap between what constitutes an act of war and what constitutes a crime or other form of action. For the purposes of understanding anonymity the definition is largely based on the perception of the aggrieved party. However, Rid does make it clear, through linguistic nuance, that certain acts within cyber can contain political utility. Virtually all other scholars agree on this point.[17] While the linguistic distinction between war and political crime has caused a degree of animosity within the subfield, this animosity is likely misplaced and represents different linguistic traditions and conceptualizations of the state of modern conflict in regard to historical frameworks.[18]\nThe focus on the debate over whether anonymous acts that take place constitute different types of conflict is dependent on the framework of definitions a scholar uses. What is evident is that regardless of how cyber attacks are referred to in the conventional typology, they are capable of generating utility, as demonstrated in chapter 3.\n## THE VALUE OF ANONYMITY\nActs that occur in cyberspace are not necessarily anonymous, yet anonymity is a desired characteristic for the conduct of offensive cyber actions. How then can we operationalize the concept of anonymity within a rational choice decision-making model so it is logical to the decision-maker?\nBruce Bueno de Mesquita’s utility theory simply compares the power scores of different states. By using a capability (power) relationship between states he is able to determine the probability of success for the instigator of a potential\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nconflict. It is this probability of success that greatly affects the decision to engage in an act. In theory it would be possible to use Bueno de Mesquita's model to explain any type of decision to engage in interstate interactions ranging from diplomacy to war. It would be possible to rearrange the probability function of the model to incorporate those characteristics that influence successful diplomatic interactions to derive a model for bargaining. However, Bueno de Mesquita's model is focused on overt conflict. He uses power to assess the probability of success. Yet because he works in a domain of interaction where distance has an effect, his power relationship is scaled by distance.[19] Distance, as examined in previous chapters, does not matter in cyberspace as it does in conventional military encounters because cyber attacks can occur with no diminishing capability due to distance. A virus code in China does not need to be resupplied by a virus code in the United States. What does affect the probability of success is time. However, the probability of success affected by time does not interact with the power of a state, as is often the case in conventional conflict. Instead it influences the overall probability of success.\nThere are several ways to represent the relationship to time in mathematical models and probability. One of the more standard statistical methods available to test time to an event is to use a hazard or survivability model. This model is not noting the changes in the power relationship over time; rather, it is examining the probability any given type of attack can remain anonymous within the three above combined characteristics long enough to achieve the objective of the attack. More simply, it examines how long until the target knows it is being attacked, knows the target of the attack, and knows who is doing the attacking.\nThis is important to the development of a decision-making model for the instigation of cyber attacks, as has been mentioned several times. Once a victim recognizes an attack, it can begin taking defensive measures to protect itself. Once it knows the target of the attack, it can harden that target. Once it knows the perpetrator of the attack, it can begin retaliation. The question the decision-maker then asks is what is the probability at a point from time  $t_{i}$  to time  $t_{c}$  or from instigation to completion of the attack that the instigator is able to maintain anonymity. This probability changes over time. At time  $t_{i}$ , the initiation of the attack, the likelihood that anonymity is lost is relatively low. The longer the attack takes to complete, the more likely the attacker is to lose anonymity. This then becomes a fluid measure expressed in moments in time that can be graphed. Because each type of attack is unique, no two hazard models are the same.\nThe hazard model is composed of those factors essential to maintaining anonymity discussed above. It is important to know the scale (S) of an attack. The larger the attack, the more difficult it is to accomplish. Next it is important to understand the complexity (C) of the attack. The more complex an attack, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nTABLE 5.1 Probability of Maintaining Anonymity by Attack\n|  Propaganda | 99%  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Web Vandalism | 95%  |\n|  Denial of Service | 90%  |\n|  Distributed Denial of Service | 85%  |\n|  Cyber Exploitation | 80%  |\n|  Equipment Disruption | 70%  |\n|  Critical Infrastructure | 60%  |\n|  Compromised Hardware Systems | 50%  |\nmore difficult it is to accomplish. These two variables interact as well. A large and complex attack is more difficult than a small, complex attack or a large, simple one. Next, as mentioned above, it is important to contextualize the attack by determining the level of hostility (H) between nations. If state X has only two primary adversaries, it can quickly isolate the instigator of an attack against its interests. By understanding the level of hostility, it is possible to begin narrowing the number of countries in the system. The more potential actors (Q) within a grouping, the more likely a perpetrator is to remain anonymous. The expression of the hazard function is listed below in equation 5.1.\n# Hazard Function for Anonymity\n5.1  $A = \\log h_{1}(t) = a + C_{i}\\beta + S_{i}\\beta + (C_{i}S_{i})\\beta + H_{i}\\beta + Q_{i}\\beta + e$\nUsing this function with complete data, it is possible to isolate at any given point in time from the initiation of an attack to the completion of an attack the probability of maintaining anonymity across the three characteristics of anonymity. As is examined in chapter 7, this model can be greatly influenced by the collection of intelligence. Such intelligence would influence all variables within the above hazard function.\nBecause there is an assumption of anonymity necessary to instigate any attack due to the characteristics of cyber attacks as defined above, the model in this book is not filled in by data. Instead the probability of maintaining anonymity at the point of initial decision to instigate an attack is kept constant at 1. The probability of maintaining anonymity changes over time. Therefore anonymity at time  $t_0$  is always kept at 1. The probability of anonymity at  $t_{0 + n}$  is here defined by the type of attack, rather than using the hazard function for which data are not available. Attacks are broken into eight categories, each with a probability of maintaining anonymity over time. The categories and their corresponding probabilities are listed in table 5.1. These probabilities are anecdotal and as-\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [87]\nsumed. Actual probabilities for each attack would depend on the intricacies of the attack, the hostility between nations, and all of the other features included in the hazard function for anonymity.\nThe above indicates that the more complicated the attack, the more difficult it is to maintain anonymity. Although the numbers are rough, they are meant to illustrate the intersection of all three categories of anonymity. Many groups and organizations can participate in web propaganda, and it is therefore a low-level and common form of attack. Only a few states are currently capable of fully compromising hardware systems; it is therefore more difficult to maintain anonymity during such an attack.\n# ANONYMITY, ATTRIBUTION, AND DECISIONS\nAlthough many works focus on the term \"attribution,\" here the focus is on anonymity. This has been done for several reasons. First, an anonymous actor is one who avoids attribution. Many legal scholars, including Susan Brenner, tend to focus only on the attribution aspect of cyber. They do this primarily because they are concerned with the defensive capabilities of states. The ability for states to respond to cyber attacks and their perpetrators is an important aspect of cyber defense. But when we consider the offensive strategy of a state, the concern is a combination of achieving the objective and avoiding attribution. For an attack to gain political utility, a state must achieve its stated objective. If a state cannot achieve even the minimum threshold of its objective, an attack remains unattributed if it did not gain any political utility. Anonymity is a fundamental aspect of offensive cyber operations (OCOs). Attribution is a fundamental aspect of cyber defense. The focus of this book is on developing a model that examines how states decide to attack; therefore attribution is largely ignored from a defensive orientation except where it affects the probability of success.\nWheeler and Larson define attribution as \"determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker's intermediary.\"20 Once a targeted country begins the attribution process, it is often after an attack has been completed. It is doubtful that the Israelis cared that the Syrians knew they invaded their airspace to bomb the nuclear facilities. They had already gained the benefit they sought. The Syrians did not respond militarily because they had already lost that which they sought to protect. In cyber it is more important to identify that an attack is occurring, what the target of that attack is, and how to prevent the achievement of an attacker's goal, than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack.\nDeterrence does not work the same in cyber as in conventional conflict. Simply identifying the attacker and threatening response is typically not possible. And even when it is possible, it is only feasible with a cross-domain re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nsponse. Such a response would likely escalate a conflict significantly with unforeseen consequences.\nThe response mechanism to a cyber attack is theoretically confined in the short term to cross-domain actions due to an inability to quickly and efficiently plan meaningful on-the-fly attacks against an adversary. Cyber attacks are tailored to specific systems and require extensive planning and development to be successful. Unless the groundwork was laid out in advance, making it possible to conduct retaliatory in-domain attacks, a state's primary function is to remove the first two characteristics of anonymity by determining that an attack is occurring, and second, what the target of that attack is.\nJoel Brenner created a hypothetical scenario in which attribution is attained but matters far less than the recognition that an attack was occurring and a comprehension of the target of that attack.[21] The scenario is one in which the previously laid groundwork for a coordinated attack against U.S. critical infrastructure begins to take down vital U.S. systems coinciding with a foreign policy flap occurring with China. The decision-makers are paralyzed because at first it is not known whether the critical infrastructure malfunctions are due to an attack or normal error. As the malfunctions continue to occur, it becomes apparent the malfunctions are due to an attack and not an error. Although the likely attributable source is China, that is of little importance. The anonymity of the attack and the targets of the attack are more important than pointing fingers. The ability to hide an attack and the target of an attack facilitates it. In Brenner's case, by the time it was recognized as an attack it was too late to do anything, let alone isolate future targets, and the United States didn't have assets in place to retaliate in kind. Brenner notes that a cross-domain response would have been a prelude to all-out war with unforeseen consequences between two nuclear-armed states. The systems affected were such that even the kill switch mechanism once proposed in Congress would not have been of much use.[22]\nMoreover, to publicly attribute the system failures within the U.S. critical infrastructure without having a means to stop them also has many negative side effects. Such an attack could compel the defensive party to work in tandem with the attack initiator to maintain their anonymity. Should information on an attack become known, it could severely degrade public confidence in critical infrastructure and cause widespread panic. Furthermore, without being able to identify the various targets of the attack, the defender risks inciting even more damage against its systems. In this particular case Brenner indicates that the Chinese were using a cyber attack to prevent an armed military response while they asserted control over vast swaths of sea. When engaged in defensive cyber operations (DCOs), it is more important to know that an attack is occurring and what the targets of that attack are than it is to attribute the attack to a particular actor. But because the systems we depend on every day for every aspect\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [89]\nof national security and stability are subject to their own problems, it can be difficult to identify when hostile activity is occurring and when a system is malfunctioning due to purely technical issues not resulting from an attack.\n## SUMMARIZING THE DEBATE\nKenneth Geers accurately sums up the need for attribution when he writes: “The challenge of cyber attack attribution means that decision-makers will likely not have enough information on an adversary’s cyber capabilities, intentions, and operations to respond in a timely fashion.”²³ Attribution is a defensive necessity. Anonymity is an offensive necessity.\nThe probability of maintaining the anonymity of an attack and a target is equally important to maintaining the anonymity of the actor involved. The above analysis attempts to focus on the offensive dynamic of the anonymity-attribution debate and outline a solution for assessing the probability for maintaining anonymity at specific points in time during an attack through social scientific and technical methods. The probability for maintaining anonymity influences the probability of success in a cyber attack as much as the relative cyber power of the state engaging in the cyber attack. Adding a measure of anonymity into the decision-making model adds to the robustness of its findings and facilitates a more accurate understanding of when a state will decide to engage in offensive cyber actions.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

We are excited by egalitarianism and anonymity, but we constantly fight for our identity. David Owens, \"Anonymous 'Takes Down' CIA Website\"\nWe are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us. Quoted in Scott S., \"We Are Anonymous\"\nANONYMITY AND, BY EXTENSION, attribution are two fundamental aspects of the cyber domain. When a state decides to attack another state, it is not concerned solely with its relative power to its adversary. An attacking state is concerned with the power of its adversary and its ability to conduct an attack against an adversary while maintaining anonymity. Anonymity in cyberspace in the initiation and implementation phases of an attack provides the freedom to maneuver. Webster's defines anonymity as follows:\n1: of unknown authorship or origin\n2: not named or identified\n3: lacking individuality, distinction, or recognizability\nThe analysis below focuses on the origin or instigating actor, the target that is not identified, and the recognition that an attack is occurring. Specifically the concept of anonymity is approached from the offensive perspective of a state considering instigating a cyber attack against a potential opponent.\nTo understand anonymity it is necessary to ask basic questions of international politics. First, why is anonymity important to a cyber attacker? Second, is it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? Third, why is attribution important to a cyber defender? These three questions are answered below followed by a summary of the importance of understanding anonymity and attribution in offensive cyber decision-making.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\n# THE IMPORTANCE OF ANONYMITY\nMost of the literature on cyber attacks makes clear that one of the most valuable aspects of the cyber domain is anonymity. Anonymity is a distinctive asset in covert operations, providing political plausible deniability while allowing for the attainment of a strategic or tactical objective. It is difficult to assess the true value of anonymity in cyber. From an offensive perspective the objective is to remain anonymous as long as possible while still achieving an objective. This is likely to lead an attacker to obfuscate his or her operation. As described in earlier chapters, if a target of a potential attack emanating from cyberspace knows where an attack will occur, or who will perpetrate an attack, it is much more likely to be able to defend against that attack.\nAnonymity in cyber is multifaceted. The layers of anonymity are constructed by the following characteristics: the inability to identify a perpetrator (state instigator) of an attack, the inability to recognize an attack is occurring, and the inability to isolate the target or objective of an attack. These characteristics build upon the two characteristics of attribution within Susan Brenner's legal framework for understanding cyber attacks.² These three characteristics are important for both legal and practical reasons. As *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace* accurately notes: \"The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult.\"³ Beyond simply being unable to identify the perpetrator, as is often the case in cyber attacks, it is difficult to recognize when a cyber attack is even occurring.\nTitan Rain, a cyber espionage operation targeting various defense systems, including U.S. Logistics Command, is an example of a cyber attack that stayed beneath the radar.⁴ A defender that does not know an attack is occurring is even less likely to know what the target of that attack is. The Titan Rain incident is particularly difficult to access in its entirety because the stolen data were encrypted on the way out, making it technically difficult to know what the purpose of the attack was and exactly which files were taken.⁵ The only way to judge the significance of the attack was to measure the volume of the data taken in terabytes.\nAnonymity within cyberspace is a valuable tool to both the perpetrators of attacks and the average user alike. Over the last several years I have worked with democracy NGOs around the Middle East and other regions building training platforms for democracy activists. These websites are designed to offer potential democracy activists the maximum amount of anonymity to protect them against government persecution. In this instance anonymity is a tool that safeguards liberties. This same ability to remain anonymous facilitates nefarious groups and nation-states that wish to do harm.\nAlthough this book is primarily concerned with the decision-making processes of state actors, the quote at the beginning of this chapter by the group\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [81]\nAnonymous is illustrative of the power a disparate group of nonstate actors can have in cyberspace. If states are unable to prevent ad hoc organizations such as Anonymous from taking down the websites of major governmental agencies such as the FBI or CIA, then how is it possible to defend against state actors with infinitely more resources?⁶\nVarious scholars have indicated that one of the fundamental problems associated with the structure of the Internet is that it was never designed to provide tracking and referencing of users.⁷ It is prudent to remember that the Internet as we know it was started as a private collaboration tool between universities and U.S. laboratories under the control of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In fact, at its beginning commerce was prohibited on the Internet. As the value and the volume of connections has increased, the value of anonymity has been both a blessing and a curse. For a state deciding whether to use cyber as a means of attack against another state, one of its primary considerations should and does often rightly center on anonymity.\nThe value of anonymity is supported by both anecdotal evidence as well as sound political logic. In every major case of state-on-state hostile cyber interaction, ranging from cyber exploitation (CE) to cyber attack (CA), anonymity has been a central feature. The answer as to why anonymity is a central feature of hostile state interactions within cyber is discussed in previous chapters, but it does not hurt to reiterate its central premise and applicability to the decision to instigate offensive cyber operations within cyberspace.\nA bullet or bomb launched from a gun or plane has a defined trajectory. It is possible to harden a target against them with either a bulletproof vest or a bunker. But once that trajectory has been established, the target is typically assured of impact barring some counterballistic system. In much the same way it is possible to harden cyber assets against cyber weapons. Network administrators can build firewalls or air gap networks to protect them against incoming bits and bytes. But unlike the bulletproof vest that works against any bullet regardless of type, up to a certain caliber, a firewall only protects against identified threats. And at the time of this writing it is estimated that there are approximately 200 million different types of viruses, Trojans, and worms.\nFurthermore, just as a bulletproof vest offers little protection against a howitzer round, a firewall can be overcome by larger inflows of bits and bytes (a DDoS attack). If a larger round is coming toward an individual, that individual will attempt to fortify himself or herself in a bunker and survive. The same is true of a cyber attack. If it is known that a large-scale DDoS attack will be conducted, network administrators can expand or distribute network infrastructure capacity or engage in other mitigation techniques to weather the attack.⁸ If the network administrators do not know an attack is coming, then they are likely to be casualties, as has been demonstrated in many instances including the 2010 “Operation\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nPayback,\" in which a group of substate actors from the group Anonymous took off-line via DDoS attack multiple websites including MasterCard, PayPal, and Visa. If advance warning on a cyber attack is available, a network administrator can also take systems off-line and remove targets altogether, making an attack ineffective for want of a target, or the administrator can mass defensive resources or prohibit traffic from certain points of origin.\nIf the objective of an attack is to make small changes in the defenses of another state's systems, then the goal is to hide those changes for as long as possible. Not only is it prudent to hide the attacker's identity, but it is prudent to hide the knowledge of the attack as well. Once an opponent knows it is being attacked, its security personnel begin implementing defensive measures as a response. Defenders can increase the robustness of their firewall(s), increase their network capacity, or, in worst-case scenarios, remove the systems altogether. The same is not true of conventional attacks. Once an attack is ongoing, it typically must be weathered or responded to.\nAny probability for success in cyber is dependent largely on a relationship between the objective of an attack and the ability to remain anonymous to the point at which that objective is completed. Furthermore, even if the anonymity of the attack is lost, the anonymity of the attacker can still be preserved. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the victim to retaliate with any meaningful accuracy. The three characteristics of anonymity combine to significantly condition the decision-making process of actors in cyber.\nMany scholars note anonymity is a strong characteristic of the cyber domain. Robert Axelrod and Rumen Illiev indicate that anonymity serves as a fundamental aspect of cyber attacks and define the ability to use a cyber weapon in terms of the ability of a cyber resource to maintain stealth and persistence.[10] Their argument for the importance of anonymity is based on data presented by Bilge and Dumitras suggesting that on average over the course of a three-year period only 3-5 percent of hundreds of vulnerabilities in different browsers were discovered and that the average duration of a zero-day attack is 312 days.[11] This would indicate that not only is anonymity often present as a component in the decision to attack, but that it is also an attribute of the vulnerabilities and viruses associated with the systems being attacked. Axelrod and Iliev's data on when to use a cyber resource indicate that the persistence of an unknown vulnerability is nearly 100 percent when not used, meaning that the life span of vulnerabilities is quite significant.\nBeyond just the long duration of vulnerabilities available for exploit due to their almost inherently anonymous nature and persistence, Cornish et al. argue that anonymity might also make it possible for certain actors to achieve disproportionate amounts of political utility from identical acts conducted in cyberspace.[12] While it is true a small state can create a disproportionate amount\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nof harm in cyberspace in ways not possible using conventional military tactics, it is unclear if this state derives a higher degree of utility for cyber attacks over other forms of asymmetric conflict. Instead, because political utility is compared to various options within the toolbox of state, the actual utility of cyber attacks does not change, only its relative value to other options within the overall decision set. For instance, in the case of Stuxnet, the United States had at least half a dozen options for dealing with potential Iranian nuclear development. Israel had fewer options. Economic sanctions imposed by the United States would be far more harmful than those imposed by Israelis because the United States controls much larger swaths of the global market. Under this logic, the value of a cyber attack does not change based on the size of a state; it simply alters its position within the decision set, making it appear more valuable and thus appear to have greater utility than other options. Moreover, as discussed, cyber power is dependent on many factors, among which are the theoretical capabilities of cyber power. It is a lack of these capabilities that limits the ability to conduct highly complex attacks capable of achieving significant impact.\nAnonymity provides a means by which to achieve political utility and acts as a facilitator for the application of power. Chapter 7 provides a graphical representation of the scale and complexity of attacks in relation to their feasibility. The larger and more complex an attack, the more likely it is to need anonymity over time. One exception would be distributed denial of service attacks conducted by nonstate actors who want public acknowledgment of their attack but have time-limited utility measures resulting from disruption of services. The relationship of complexity and scale with feasibility indicates an inverse relationship. The more difficult an attack, the more likely it is to be significant in either size, complexity, or both. There are only a few select countries with the technical capabilities to conduct a highly complex attack such as Stuxnet or the attack on Syrian air defense systems. There are nearly a hundred countries and large numbers of substate actors capable of conducting the type of attacks used against Estonia in 2007. The disproportionate relationship between the size of a state and anonymity is directly related to the number of potential actors and the ability to remain anonymous. Although the Stuxnet attack has not been publicly claimed, it has been widely reported as emanating from the United States and Israel through official sources within President Obama's administration.[13] Anonymity was a crucial aspect of Stuxnet, and although the attack has not been publicly claimed, particularly in the first few years after its initiation, the range of possible actors based just on factors such as complexity and scale of attack is quite small. If the attack is contextualized in foreign policy and international relations, the range narrows to possibly three and more likely two actors.\nAnonymity is a complex measure. The three characteristics of anonymity are extremely difficult to maintain indefinitely. The key is to prolong a combination\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nof the characteristics long enough to achieve an objective in cyber. Furthermore, if the identity of the attacker remains anonymous, this denies the legal justification for retaliation by the targeted state as well as denying the identification of a proper institutional format for recourse.[14]\n## POLITICAL ACTION AND ANONYMITY\nIs it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? If we follow the logic of Thomas Rid that “history does not know acts of war without eventual attribution,” then do cyber attacks constitute political acts?[15] With anonymity being a central feature that influences the success of cyber attacks, does anonymity remove the political aspect of attacks? Rid goes on to say: “aggressors engaging in subversion, espionage or sabotage do act politically; but in sharp contrast to warfare, they are likely to have a permanent or at least temporary interest in avoiding attribution. This is one of the main reasons why political crime, more than acts of war, has thrived in the cyber domain, where non-attribution may be easier to achieve than waterproof attribution.”[16]\nThis book largely steps over the linguistic gap between what constitutes an act of war and what constitutes a crime or other form of action. For the purposes of understanding anonymity the definition is largely based on the perception of the aggrieved party. However, Rid does make it clear, through linguistic nuance, that certain acts within cyber can contain political utility. Virtually all other scholars agree on this point.[17] While the linguistic distinction between war and political crime has caused a degree of animosity within the subfield, this animosity is likely misplaced and represents different linguistic traditions and conceptualizations of the state of modern conflict in regard to historical frameworks.[18]\nThe focus on the debate over whether anonymous acts that take place constitute different types of conflict is dependent on the framework of definitions a scholar uses. What is evident is that regardless of how cyber attacks are referred to in the conventional typology, they are capable of generating utility, as demonstrated in chapter 3.\n## THE VALUE OF ANONYMITY\nActs that occur in cyberspace are not necessarily anonymous, yet anonymity is a desired characteristic for the conduct of offensive cyber actions. How then can we operationalize the concept of anonymity within a rational choice decision-making model so it is logical to the decision-maker?\nBruce Bueno de Mesquita’s utility theory simply compares the power scores of different states. By using a capability (power) relationship between states he is able to determine the probability of success for the instigator of a potential\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nconflict. It is this probability of success that greatly affects the decision to engage in an act. In theory it would be possible to use Bueno de Mesquita's model to explain any type of decision to engage in interstate interactions ranging from diplomacy to war. It would be possible to rearrange the probability function of the model to incorporate those characteristics that influence successful diplomatic interactions to derive a model for bargaining. However, Bueno de Mesquita's model is focused on overt conflict. He uses power to assess the probability of success. Yet because he works in a domain of interaction where distance has an effect, his power relationship is scaled by distance.[19] Distance, as examined in previous chapters, does not matter in cyberspace as it does in conventional military encounters because cyber attacks can occur with no diminishing capability due to distance. A virus code in China does not need to be resupplied by a virus code in the United States. What does affect the probability of success is time. However, the probability of success affected by time does not interact with the power of a state, as is often the case in conventional conflict. Instead it influences the overall probability of success.\nThere are several ways to represent the relationship to time in mathematical models and probability. One of the more standard statistical methods available to test time to an event is to use a hazard or survivability model. This model is not noting the changes in the power relationship over time; rather, it is examining the probability any given type of attack can remain anonymous within the three above combined characteristics long enough to achieve the objective of the attack. More simply, it examines how long until the target knows it is being attacked, knows the target of the attack, and knows who is doing the attacking.\nThis is important to the development of a decision-making model for the instigation of cyber attacks, as has been mentioned several times. Once a victim recognizes an attack, it can begin taking defensive measures to protect itself. Once it knows the target of the attack, it can harden that target. Once it knows the perpetrator of the attack, it can begin retaliation. The question the decision-maker then asks is what is the probability at a point from time  $t_{i}$  to time  $t_{c}$  or from instigation to completion of the attack that the instigator is able to maintain anonymity. This probability changes over time. At time  $t_{i}$ , the initiation of the attack, the likelihood that anonymity is lost is relatively low. The longer the attack takes to complete, the more likely the attacker is to lose anonymity. This then becomes a fluid measure expressed in moments in time that can be graphed. Because each type of attack is unique, no two hazard models are the same.\nThe hazard model is composed of those factors essential to maintaining anonymity discussed above. It is important to know the scale (S) of an attack. The larger the attack, the more difficult it is to accomplish. Next it is important to understand the complexity (C) of the attack. The more complex an attack, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nTABLE 5.1 Probability of Maintaining Anonymity by Attack\n|  Propaganda | 99%  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Web Vandalism | 95%  |\n|  Denial of Service | 90%  |\n|  Distributed Denial of Service | 85%  |\n|  Cyber Exploitation | 80%  |\n|  Equipment Disruption | 70%  |\n|  Critical Infrastructure | 60%  |\n|  Compromised Hardware Systems | 50%  |\nmore difficult it is to accomplish. These two variables interact as well. A large and complex attack is more difficult than a small, complex attack or a large, simple one. Next, as mentioned above, it is important to contextualize the attack by determining the level of hostility (H) between nations. If state X has only two primary adversaries, it can quickly isolate the instigator of an attack against its interests. By understanding the level of hostility, it is possible to begin narrowing the number of countries in the system. The more potential actors (Q) within a grouping, the more likely a perpetrator is to remain anonymous. The expression of the hazard function is listed below in equation 5.1.\n# Hazard Function for Anonymity\n5.1  $A = \\log h_{1}(t) = a + C_{i}\\beta + S_{i}\\beta + (C_{i}S_{i})\\beta + H_{i}\\beta + Q_{i}\\beta + e$\nUsing this function with complete data, it is possible to isolate at any given point in time from the initiation of an attack to the completion of an attack the probability of maintaining anonymity across the three characteristics of anonymity. As is examined in chapter 7, this model can be greatly influenced by the collection of intelligence. Such intelligence would influence all variables within the above hazard function.\nBecause there is an assumption of anonymity necessary to instigate any attack due to the characteristics of cyber attacks as defined above, the model in this book is not filled in by data. Instead the probability of maintaining anonymity at the point of initial decision to instigate an attack is kept constant at 1. The probability of maintaining anonymity changes over time. Therefore anonymity at time  $t_0$  is always kept at 1. The probability of anonymity at  $t_{0 + n}$  is here defined by the type of attack, rather than using the hazard function for which data are not available. Attacks are broken into eight categories, each with a probability of maintaining anonymity over time. The categories and their corresponding probabilities are listed in table 5.1. These probabilities are anecdotal and as-\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [87]\nsumed. Actual probabilities for each attack would depend on the intricacies of the attack, the hostility between nations, and all of the other features included in the hazard function for anonymity.\nThe above indicates that the more complicated the attack, the more difficult it is to maintain anonymity. Although the numbers are rough, they are meant to illustrate the intersection of all three categories of anonymity. Many groups and organizations can participate in web propaganda, and it is therefore a low-level and common form of attack. Only a few states are currently capable of fully compromising hardware systems; it is therefore more difficult to maintain anonymity during such an attack.\n# ANONYMITY, ATTRIBUTION, AND DECISIONS\nAlthough many works focus on the term \"attribution,\" here the focus is on anonymity. This has been done for several reasons. First, an anonymous actor is one who avoids attribution. Many legal scholars, including Susan Brenner, tend to focus only on the attribution aspect of cyber. They do this primarily because they are concerned with the defensive capabilities of states. The ability for states to respond to cyber attacks and their perpetrators is an important aspect of cyber defense. But when we consider the offensive strategy of a state, the concern is a combination of achieving the objective and avoiding attribution. For an attack to gain political utility, a state must achieve its stated objective. If a state cannot achieve even the minimum threshold of its objective, an attack remains unattributed if it did not gain any political utility. Anonymity is a fundamental aspect of offensive cyber operations (OCOs). Attribution is a fundamental aspect of cyber defense. The focus of this book is on developing a model that examines how states decide to attack; therefore attribution is largely ignored from a defensive orientation except where it affects the probability of success.\nWheeler and Larson define attribution as \"determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker's intermediary.\"20 Once a targeted country begins the attribution process, it is often after an attack has been completed. It is doubtful that the Israelis cared that the Syrians knew they invaded their airspace to bomb the nuclear facilities. They had already gained the benefit they sought. The Syrians did not respond militarily because they had already lost that which they sought to protect. In cyber it is more important to identify that an attack is occurring, what the target of that attack is, and how to prevent the achievement of an attacker's goal, than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack.\nDeterrence does not work the same in cyber as in conventional conflict. Simply identifying the attacker and threatening response is typically not possible. And even when it is possible, it is only feasible with a cross-domain re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nsponse. Such a response would likely escalate a conflict significantly with unforeseen consequences.\nThe response mechanism to a cyber attack is theoretically confined in the short term to cross-domain actions due to an inability to quickly and efficiently plan meaningful on-the-fly attacks against an adversary. Cyber attacks are tailored to specific systems and require extensive planning and development to be successful. Unless the groundwork was laid out in advance, making it possible to conduct retaliatory in-domain attacks, a state's primary function is to remove the first two characteristics of anonymity by determining that an attack is occurring, and second, what the target of that attack is.\nJoel Brenner created a hypothetical scenario in which attribution is attained but matters far less than the recognition that an attack was occurring and a comprehension of the target of that attack.[21] The scenario is one in which the previously laid groundwork for a coordinated attack against U.S. critical infrastructure begins to take down vital U.S. systems coinciding with a foreign policy flap occurring with China. The decision-makers are paralyzed because at first it is not known whether the critical infrastructure malfunctions are due to an attack or normal error. As the malfunctions continue to occur, it becomes apparent the malfunctions are due to an attack and not an error. Although the likely attributable source is China, that is of little importance. The anonymity of the attack and the targets of the attack are more important than pointing fingers. The ability to hide an attack and the target of an attack facilitates it. In Brenner's case, by the time it was recognized as an attack it was too late to do anything, let alone isolate future targets, and the United States didn't have assets in place to retaliate in kind. Brenner notes that a cross-domain response would have been a prelude to all-out war with unforeseen consequences between two nuclear-armed states. The systems affected were such that even the kill switch mechanism once proposed in Congress would not have been of much use.[22]\nMoreover, to publicly attribute the system failures within the U.S. critical infrastructure without having a means to stop them also has many negative side effects. Such an attack could compel the defensive party to work in tandem with the attack initiator to maintain their anonymity. Should information on an attack become known, it could severely degrade public confidence in critical infrastructure and cause widespread panic. Furthermore, without being able to identify the various targets of the attack, the defender risks inciting even more damage against its systems. In this particular case Brenner indicates that the Chinese were using a cyber attack to prevent an armed military response while they asserted control over vast swaths of sea. When engaged in defensive cyber operations (DCOs), it is more important to know that an attack is occurring and what the targets of that attack are than it is to attribute the attack to a particular actor. But because the systems we depend on every day for every aspect\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [89]\nof national security and stability are subject to their own problems, it can be difficult to identify when hostile activity is occurring and when a system is malfunctioning due to purely technical issues not resulting from an attack.\n## SUMMARIZING THE DEBATE\nKenneth Geers accurately sums up the need for attribution when he writes: “The challenge of cyber attack attribution means that decision-makers will likely not have enough information on an adversary’s cyber capabilities, intentions, and operations to respond in a timely fashion.”²³ Attribution is a defensive necessity. Anonymity is an offensive necessity.\nThe probability of maintaining the anonymity of an attack and a target is equally important to maintaining the anonymity of the actor involved. The above analysis attempts to focus on the offensive dynamic of the anonymity-attribution debate and outline a solution for assessing the probability for maintaining anonymity at specific points in time during an attack through social scientific and technical methods. The probability for maintaining anonymity influences the probability of success in a cyber attack as much as the relative cyber power of the state engaging in the cyber attack. Adding a measure of anonymity into the decision-making model adds to the robustness of its findings and facilitates a more accurate understanding of when a state will decide to engage in offensive cyber actions.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

We are excited by egalitarianism and anonymity, but we constantly fight for our identity. David Owens, \"Anonymous 'Takes Down' CIA Website\"\nWe are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us. Quoted in Scott S., \"We Are Anonymous\"\nANONYMITY AND, BY EXTENSION, attribution are two fundamental aspects of the cyber domain. When a state decides to attack another state, it is not concerned solely with its relative power to its adversary. An attacking state is concerned with the power of its adversary and its ability to conduct an attack against an adversary while maintaining anonymity. Anonymity in cyberspace in the initiation and implementation phases of an attack provides the freedom to maneuver. Webster's defines anonymity as follows:\n1: of unknown authorship or origin\n2: not named or identified\n3: lacking individuality, distinction, or recognizability\nThe analysis below focuses on the origin or instigating actor, the target that is not identified, and the recognition that an attack is occurring. Specifically the concept of anonymity is approached from the offensive perspective of a state considering instigating a cyber attack against a potential opponent.\nTo understand anonymity it is necessary to ask basic questions of international politics. First, why is anonymity important to a cyber attacker? Second, is it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? Third, why is attribution important to a cyber defender? These three questions are answered below followed by a summary of the importance of understanding anonymity and attribution in offensive cyber decision-making.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\n# THE IMPORTANCE OF ANONYMITY\nMost of the literature on cyber attacks makes clear that one of the most valuable aspects of the cyber domain is anonymity. Anonymity is a distinctive asset in covert operations, providing political plausible deniability while allowing for the attainment of a strategic or tactical objective. It is difficult to assess the true value of anonymity in cyber. From an offensive perspective the objective is to remain anonymous as long as possible while still achieving an objective. This is likely to lead an attacker to obfuscate his or her operation. As described in earlier chapters, if a target of a potential attack emanating from cyberspace knows where an attack will occur, or who will perpetrate an attack, it is much more likely to be able to defend against that attack.\nAnonymity in cyber is multifaceted. The layers of anonymity are constructed by the following characteristics: the inability to identify a perpetrator (state instigator) of an attack, the inability to recognize an attack is occurring, and the inability to isolate the target or objective of an attack. These characteristics build upon the two characteristics of attribution within Susan Brenner's legal framework for understanding cyber attacks.² These three characteristics are important for both legal and practical reasons. As *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace* accurately notes: \"The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult.\"³ Beyond simply being unable to identify the perpetrator, as is often the case in cyber attacks, it is difficult to recognize when a cyber attack is even occurring.\nTitan Rain, a cyber espionage operation targeting various defense systems, including U.S. Logistics Command, is an example of a cyber attack that stayed beneath the radar.⁴ A defender that does not know an attack is occurring is even less likely to know what the target of that attack is. The Titan Rain incident is particularly difficult to access in its entirety because the stolen data were encrypted on the way out, making it technically difficult to know what the purpose of the attack was and exactly which files were taken.⁵ The only way to judge the significance of the attack was to measure the volume of the data taken in terabytes.\nAnonymity within cyberspace is a valuable tool to both the perpetrators of attacks and the average user alike. Over the last several years I have worked with democracy NGOs around the Middle East and other regions building training platforms for democracy activists. These websites are designed to offer potential democracy activists the maximum amount of anonymity to protect them against government persecution. In this instance anonymity is a tool that safeguards liberties. This same ability to remain anonymous facilitates nefarious groups and nation-states that wish to do harm.\nAlthough this book is primarily concerned with the decision-making processes of state actors, the quote at the beginning of this chapter by the group\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nAnonymous is illustrative of the power a disparate group of nonstate actors can have in cyberspace. If states are unable to prevent ad hoc organizations such as Anonymous from taking down the websites of major governmental agencies such as the FBI or CIA, then how is it possible to defend against state actors with infinitely more resources?⁶\nVarious scholars have indicated that one of the fundamental problems associated with the structure of the Internet is that it was never designed to provide tracking and referencing of users.⁷ It is prudent to remember that the Internet as we know it was started as a private collaboration tool between universities and U.S. laboratories under the control of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In fact, at its beginning commerce was prohibited on the Internet. As the value and the volume of connections has increased, the value of anonymity has been both a blessing and a curse. For a state deciding whether to use cyber as a means of attack against another state, one of its primary considerations should and does often rightly center on anonymity.\nThe value of anonymity is supported by both anecdotal evidence as well as sound political logic. In every major case of state-on-state hostile cyber interaction, ranging from cyber exploitation (CE) to cyber attack (CA), anonymity has been a central feature. The answer as to why anonymity is a central feature of hostile state interactions within cyber is discussed in previous chapters, but it does not hurt to reiterate its central premise and applicability to the decision to instigate offensive cyber operations within cyberspace.\nA bullet or bomb launched from a gun or plane has a defined trajectory. It is possible to harden a target against them with either a bulletproof vest or a bunker. But once that trajectory has been established, the target is typically assured of impact barring some counterballistic system. In much the same way it is possible to harden cyber assets against cyber weapons. Network administrators can build firewalls or air gap networks to protect them against incoming bits and bytes. But unlike the bulletproof vest that works against any bullet regardless of type, up to a certain caliber, a firewall only protects against identified threats. And at the time of this writing it is estimated that there are approximately 200 million different types of viruses, Trojans, and worms.\nFurthermore, just as a bulletproof vest offers little protection against a howitzer round, a firewall can be overcome by larger inflows of bits and bytes (a DDoS attack). If a larger round is coming toward an individual, that individual will attempt to fortify himself or herself in a bunker and survive. The same is true of a cyber attack. If it is known that a large-scale DDoS attack will be conducted, network administrators can expand or distribute network infrastructure capacity or engage in other mitigation techniques to weather the attack.⁸ If the network administrators do not know an attack is coming, then they are likely to be casualties, as has been demonstrated in many instances including the 2010 “Operation\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nPayback,\" in which a group of substate actors from the group Anonymous took off-line via DDoS attack multiple websites including MasterCard, PayPal, and Visa. If advance warning on a cyber attack is available, a network administrator can also take systems off-line and remove targets altogether, making an attack ineffective for want of a target, or the administrator can mass defensive resources or prohibit traffic from certain points of origin.\nIf the objective of an attack is to make small changes in the defenses of another state's systems, then the goal is to hide those changes for as long as possible. Not only is it prudent to hide the attacker's identity, but it is prudent to hide the knowledge of the attack as well. Once an opponent knows it is being attacked, its security personnel begin implementing defensive measures as a response. Defenders can increase the robustness of their firewall(s), increase their network capacity, or, in worst-case scenarios, remove the systems altogether. The same is not true of conventional attacks. Once an attack is ongoing, it typically must be weathered or responded to.\nAny probability for success in cyber is dependent largely on a relationship between the objective of an attack and the ability to remain anonymous to the point at which that objective is completed. Furthermore, even if the anonymity of the attack is lost, the anonymity of the attacker can still be preserved. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the victim to retaliate with any meaningful accuracy. The three characteristics of anonymity combine to significantly condition the decision-making process of actors in cyber.\nMany scholars note anonymity is a strong characteristic of the cyber domain. Robert Axelrod and Rumen Illiev indicate that anonymity serves as a fundamental aspect of cyber attacks and define the ability to use a cyber weapon in terms of the ability of a cyber resource to maintain stealth and persistence. Their argument for the importance of anonymity is based on data presented by Bilge and Dumitras suggesting that on average over the course of a three-year period only 3-5 percent of hundreds of vulnerabilities in different browsers were discovered and that the average duration of a zero-day attack is 312 days. This would indicate that not only is anonymity often present as a component in the decision to attack, but that it is also an attribute of the vulnerabilities and viruses associated with the systems being attacked. Axelrod and Iliev's data on when to use a cyber resource indicate that the persistence of an unknown vulnerability is nearly 100 percent when not used, meaning that the life span of vulnerabilities is quite significant.\nBeyond just the long duration of vulnerabilities available for exploit due to their almost inherently anonymous nature and persistence, Cornish et al. argue that anonymity might also make it possible for certain actors to achieve disproportionate amounts of political utility from identical acts conducted in cyberspace. While it is true a small state can create a disproportionate amount\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nof harm in cyberspace in ways not possible using conventional military tactics, it is unclear if this state derives a higher degree of utility for cyber attacks over other forms of asymmetric conflict. Instead, because political utility is compared to various options within the toolbox of state, the actual utility of cyber attacks does not change, only its relative value to other options within the overall decision set. For instance, in the case of Stuxnet, the United States had at least half a dozen options for dealing with potential Iranian nuclear development. Israel had fewer options. Economic sanctions imposed by the United States would be far more harmful than those imposed by Israelis because the United States controls much larger swaths of the global market. Under this logic, the value of a cyber attack does not change based on the size of a state; it simply alters its position within the decision set, making it appear more valuable and thus appear to have greater utility than other options. Moreover, as discussed, cyber power is dependent on many factors, among which are the theoretical capabilities of cyber power. It is a lack of these capabilities that limits the ability to conduct highly complex attacks capable of achieving significant impact.\nAnonymity provides a means by which to achieve political utility and acts as a facilitator for the application of power. Chapter 7 provides a graphical representation of the scale and complexity of attacks in relation to their feasibility. The larger and more complex an attack, the more likely it is to need anonymity over time. One exception would be distributed denial of service attacks conducted by nonstate actors who want public acknowledgment of their attack but have time-limited utility measures resulting from disruption of services. The relationship of complexity and scale with feasibility indicates an inverse relationship. The more difficult an attack, the more likely it is to be significant in either size, complexity, or both. There are only a few select countries with the technical capabilities to conduct a highly complex attack such as Stuxnet or the attack on Syrian air defense systems. There are nearly a hundred countries and large numbers of substate actors capable of conducting the type of attacks used against Estonia in 2007. The disproportionate relationship between the size of a state and anonymity is directly related to the number of potential actors and the ability to remain anonymous. Although the Stuxnet attack has not been publicly claimed, it has been widely reported as emanating from the United States and Israel through official sources within President Obama's administration. Anonymity was a crucial aspect of Stuxnet, and although the attack has not been publicly claimed, particularly in the first few years after its initiation, the range of possible actors based just on factors such as complexity and scale of attack is quite small. If the attack is contextualized in foreign policy and international relations, the range narrows to possibly three and more likely two actors.\nAnonymity is a complex measure. The three characteristics of anonymity are extremely difficult to maintain indefinitely. The key is to prolong a combination\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nof the characteristics long enough to achieve an objective in cyber. Furthermore, if the identity of the attacker remains anonymous, this denies the legal justification for retaliation by the targeted state as well as denying the identification of a proper institutional format for recourse.\n## POLITICAL ACTION AND ANONYMITY\nIs it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? If we follow the logic of Thomas Rid that “history does not know acts of war without eventual attribution,” then do cyber attacks constitute political acts? With anonymity being a central feature that influences the success of cyber attacks, does anonymity remove the political aspect of attacks? Rid goes on to say: “aggressors engaging in subversion, espionage or sabotage do act politically; but in sharp contrast to warfare, they are likely to have a permanent or at least temporary interest in avoiding attribution. This is one of the main reasons why political crime, more than acts of war, has thrived in the cyber domain, where non-attribution may be easier to achieve than waterproof attribution.”\nThis book largely steps over the linguistic gap between what constitutes an act of war and what constitutes a crime or other form of action. For the purposes of understanding anonymity the definition is largely based on the perception of the aggrieved party. However, Rid does make it clear, through linguistic nuance, that certain acts within cyber can contain political utility. Virtually all other scholars agree on this point. While the linguistic distinction between war and political crime has caused a degree of animosity within the subfield, this animosity is likely misplaced and represents different linguistic traditions and conceptualizations of the state of modern conflict in regard to historical frameworks.\nThe focus on the debate over whether anonymous acts that take place constitute different types of conflict is dependent on the framework of definitions a scholar uses. What is evident is that regardless of how cyber attacks are referred to in the conventional typology, they are capable of generating utility, as demonstrated in chapter 3.\n## THE VALUE OF ANONYMITY\nActs that occur in cyberspace are not necessarily anonymous, yet anonymity is a desired characteristic for the conduct of offensive cyber actions. How then can we operationalize the concept of anonymity within a rational choice decision-making model so it is logical to the decision-maker?\nBruce Bueno de Mesquita’s utility theory simply compares the power scores of different states. By using a capability (power) relationship between states he is able to determine the probability of success for the instigator of a potential\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nconflict. It is this probability of success that greatly affects the decision to engage in an act. In theory it would be possible to use Bueno de Mesquita's model to explain any type of decision to engage in interstate interactions ranging from diplomacy to war. It would be possible to rearrange the probability function of the model to incorporate those characteristics that influence successful diplomatic interactions to derive a model for bargaining. However, Bueno de Mesquita's model is focused on overt conflict. He uses power to assess the probability of success. Yet because he works in a domain of interaction where distance has an effect, his power relationship is scaled by distance. Distance, as examined in previous chapters, does not matter in cyberspace as it does in conventional military encounters because cyber attacks can occur with no diminishing capability due to distance. A virus code in China does not need to be resupplied by a virus code in the United States. What does affect the probability of success is time. However, the probability of success affected by time does not interact with the power of a state, as is often the case in conventional conflict. Instead it influences the overall probability of success.\nThere are several ways to represent the relationship to time in mathematical models and probability. One of the more standard statistical methods available to test time to an event is to use a hazard or survivability model. This model is not noting the changes in the power relationship over time; rather, it is examining the probability any given type of attack can remain anonymous within the three above combined characteristics long enough to achieve the objective of the attack. More simply, it examines how long until the target knows it is being attacked, knows the target of the attack, and knows who is doing the attacking.\nThis is important to the development of a decision-making model for the instigation of cyber attacks, as has been mentioned several times. Once a victim recognizes an attack, it can begin taking defensive measures to protect itself. Once it knows the target of the attack, it can harden that target. Once it knows the perpetrator of the attack, it can begin retaliation. The question the decision-maker then asks is what is the probability at a point from time  $t_{i}$  to time  $t_{c}$  or from instigation to completion of the attack that the instigator is able to maintain anonymity. This probability changes over time. At time  $t_{i}$ , the initiation of the attack, the likelihood that anonymity is lost is relatively low. The longer the attack takes to complete, the more likely the attacker is to lose anonymity. This then becomes a fluid measure expressed in moments in time that can be graphed. Because each type of attack is unique, no two hazard models are the same.\nThe hazard model is composed of those factors essential to maintaining anonymity discussed above. It is important to know the scale (S) of an attack. The larger the attack, the more difficult it is to accomplish. Next it is important to understand the complexity (C) of the attack. The more complex an attack, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nTABLE 5.1 Probability of Maintaining Anonymity by Attack\n|  Propaganda | 99%  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Web Vandalism | 95%  |\n|  Denial of Service | 90%  |\n|  Distributed Denial of Service | 85%  |\n|  Cyber Exploitation | 80%  |\n|  Equipment Disruption | 70%  |\n|  Critical Infrastructure | 60%  |\n|  Compromised Hardware Systems | 50%  |\nmore difficult it is to accomplish. These two variables interact as well. A large and complex attack is more difficult than a small, complex attack or a large, simple one. Next, as mentioned above, it is important to contextualize the attack by determining the level of hostility (H) between nations. If state X has only two primary adversaries, it can quickly isolate the instigator of an attack against its interests. By understanding the level of hostility, it is possible to begin narrowing the number of countries in the system. The more potential actors (Q) within a grouping, the more likely a perpetrator is to remain anonymous. The expression of the hazard function is listed below in equation 5.1.\n# Hazard Function for Anonymity\n5.1  $A = \\log h_{1}(t) = a + C_{i}\\beta + S_{i}\\beta + (C_{i}S_{i})\\beta + H_{i}\\beta + Q_{i}\\beta + e$\nUsing this function with complete data, it is possible to isolate at any given point in time from the initiation of an attack to the completion of an attack the probability of maintaining anonymity across the three characteristics of anonymity. As is examined in chapter 7, this model can be greatly influenced by the collection of intelligence. Such intelligence would influence all variables within the above hazard function.\nBecause there is an assumption of anonymity necessary to instigate any attack due to the characteristics of cyber attacks as defined above, the model in this book is not filled in by data. Instead the probability of maintaining anonymity at the point of initial decision to instigate an attack is kept constant at 1. The probability of maintaining anonymity changes over time. Therefore anonymity at time  $t_0$  is always kept at 1. The probability of anonymity at  $t_{0 + n}$  is here defined by the type of attack, rather than using the hazard function for which data are not available. Attacks are broken into eight categories, each with a probability of maintaining anonymity over time. The categories and their corresponding probabilities are listed in table 5.1. These probabilities are anecdotal and as-\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nsumed. Actual probabilities for each attack would depend on the intricacies of the attack, the hostility between nations, and all of the other features included in the hazard function for anonymity.\nThe above indicates that the more complicated the attack, the more difficult it is to maintain anonymity. Although the numbers are rough, they are meant to illustrate the intersection of all three categories of anonymity. Many groups and organizations can participate in web propaganda, and it is therefore a low-level and common form of attack. Only a few states are currently capable of fully compromising hardware systems; it is therefore more difficult to maintain anonymity during such an attack.\n# ANONYMITY, ATTRIBUTION, AND DECISIONS\nAlthough many works focus on the term \"attribution,\" here the focus is on anonymity. This has been done for several reasons. First, an anonymous actor is one who avoids attribution. Many legal scholars, including Susan Brenner, tend to focus only on the attribution aspect of cyber. They do this primarily because they are concerned with the defensive capabilities of states. The ability for states to respond to cyber attacks and their perpetrators is an important aspect of cyber defense. But when we consider the offensive strategy of a state, the concern is a combination of achieving the objective and avoiding attribution. For an attack to gain political utility, a state must achieve its stated objective. If a state cannot achieve even the minimum threshold of its objective, an attack remains unattributed if it did not gain any political utility. Anonymity is a fundamental aspect of offensive cyber operations (OCOs). Attribution is a fundamental aspect of cyber defense. The focus of this book is on developing a model that examines how states decide to attack; therefore attribution is largely ignored from a defensive orientation except where it affects the probability of success.\nWheeler and Larson define attribution as \"determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker's intermediary.\"20 Once a targeted country begins the attribution process, it is often after an attack has been completed. It is doubtful that the Israelis cared that the Syrians knew they invaded their airspace to bomb the nuclear facilities. They had already gained the benefit they sought. The Syrians did not respond militarily because they had already lost that which they sought to protect. In cyber it is more important to identify that an attack is occurring, what the target of that attack is, and how to prevent the achievement of an attacker's goal, than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack.\nDeterrence does not work the same in cyber as in conventional conflict. Simply identifying the attacker and threatening response is typically not possible. And even when it is possible, it is only feasible with a cross-domain re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nsponse. Such a response would likely escalate a conflict significantly with unforeseen consequences.\nThe response mechanism to a cyber attack is theoretically confined in the short term to cross-domain actions due to an inability to quickly and efficiently plan meaningful on-the-fly attacks against an adversary. Cyber attacks are tailored to specific systems and require extensive planning and development to be successful. Unless the groundwork was laid out in advance, making it possible to conduct retaliatory in-domain attacks, a state's primary function is to remove the first two characteristics of anonymity by determining that an attack is occurring, and second, what the target of that attack is.\nJoel Brenner created a hypothetical scenario in which attribution is attained but matters far less than the recognition that an attack was occurring and a comprehension of the target of that attack. The scenario is one in which the previously laid groundwork for a coordinated attack against U.S. critical infrastructure begins to take down vital U.S. systems coinciding with a foreign policy flap occurring with China. The decision-makers are paralyzed because at first it is not known whether the critical infrastructure malfunctions are due to an attack or normal error. As the malfunctions continue to occur, it becomes apparent the malfunctions are due to an attack and not an error. Although the likely attributable source is China, that is of little importance. The anonymity of the attack and the targets of the attack are more important than pointing fingers. The ability to hide an attack and the target of an attack facilitates it. In Brenner's case, by the time it was recognized as an attack it was too late to do anything, let alone isolate future targets, and the United States didn't have assets in place to retaliate in kind. Brenner notes that a cross-domain response would have been a prelude to all-out war with unforeseen consequences between two nuclear-armed states. The systems affected were such that even the kill switch mechanism once proposed in Congress would not have been of much use.\nMoreover, to publicly attribute the system failures within the U.S. critical infrastructure without having a means to stop them also has many negative side effects. Such an attack could compel the defensive party to work in tandem with the attack initiator to maintain their anonymity. Should information on an attack become known, it could severely degrade public confidence in critical infrastructure and cause widespread panic. Furthermore, without being able to identify the various targets of the attack, the defender risks inciting even more damage against its systems. In this particular case Brenner indicates that the Chinese were using a cyber attack to prevent an armed military response while they asserted control over vast swaths of sea. When engaged in defensive cyber operations (DCOs), it is more important to know that an attack is occurring and what the targets of that attack are than it is to attribute the attack to a particular actor. But because the systems we depend on every day for every aspect\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nof national security and stability are subject to their own problems, it can be difficult to identify when hostile activity is occurring and when a system is malfunctioning due to purely technical issues not resulting from an attack.\n## SUMMARIZING THE DEBATE\nKenneth Geers accurately sums up the need for attribution when he writes: “The challenge of cyber attack attribution means that decision-makers will likely not have enough information on an adversary’s cyber capabilities, intentions, and operations to respond in a timely fashion.”²³ Attribution is a defensive necessity. Anonymity is an offensive necessity.\nThe probability of maintaining the anonymity of an attack and a target is equally important to maintaining the anonymity of the actor involved. The above analysis attempts to focus on the offensive dynamic of the anonymity-attribution debate and outline a solution for assessing the probability for maintaining anonymity at specific points in time during an attack through social scientific and technical methods. The probability for maintaining anonymity influences the probability of success in a cyber attack as much as the relative cyber power of the state engaging in the cyber attack. Adding a measure of anonymity into the decision-making model adds to the robustness of its findings and facilitates a more accurate understanding of when a state will decide to engage in offensive cyber actions.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

We are excited by egalitarianism and anonymity, but we constantly fight for our identity. David Owens, \"Anonymous 'Takes Down' CIA Website\"\nWe are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us. Quoted in Scott S., \"We Are Anonymous\"\nANONYMITY AND, BY EXTENSION, attribution are two fundamental aspects of the cyber domain. When a state decides to attack another state, it is not concerned solely with its relative power to its adversary. An attacking state is concerned with the power of its adversary and its ability to conduct an attack against an adversary while maintaining anonymity. Anonymity in cyberspace in the initiation and implementation phases of an attack provides the freedom to maneuver. Webster's defines anonymity as follows:\n1: of unknown authorship or origin\n2: not named or identified\n3: lacking individuality, distinction, or recognizability\nThe analysis below focuses on the origin or instigating actor, the target that is not identified, and the recognition that an attack is occurring. Specifically the concept of anonymity is approached from the offensive perspective of a state considering instigating a cyber attack against a potential opponent.\nTo understand anonymity it is necessary to ask basic questions of international politics. First, why is anonymity important to a cyber attacker? Second, is it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? Third, why is attribution important to a cyber defender? These three questions are answered below followed by a summary of the importance of understanding anonymity and attribution in offensive cyber decision-making.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\n# THE IMPORTANCE OF ANONYMITY\nMost of the literature on cyber attacks makes clear that one of the most valuable aspects of the cyber domain is anonymity. Anonymity is a distinctive asset in covert operations, providing political plausible deniability while allowing for the attainment of a strategic or tactical objective. It is difficult to assess the true value of anonymity in cyber. From an offensive perspective the objective is to remain anonymous as long as possible while still achieving an objective. This is likely to lead an attacker to obfuscate his or her operation. As described in earlier chapters, if a target of a potential attack emanating from cyberspace knows where an attack will occur, or who will perpetrate an attack, it is much more likely to be able to defend against that attack.\nAnonymity in cyber is multifaceted. The layers of anonymity are constructed by the following characteristics: the inability to identify a perpetrator (state instigator) of an attack, the inability to recognize an attack is occurring, and the inability to isolate the target or objective of an attack. These characteristics build upon the two characteristics of attribution within Susan Brenner's legal framework for understanding cyber attacks.² These three characteristics are important for both legal and practical reasons. As *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace* accurately notes: \"The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult.\"³ Beyond simply being unable to identify the perpetrator, as is often the case in cyber attacks, it is difficult to recognize when a cyber attack is even occurring.\nTitan Rain, a cyber espionage operation targeting various defense systems, including U.S. Logistics Command, is an example of a cyber attack that stayed beneath the radar.⁴ A defender that does not know an attack is occurring is even less likely to know what the target of that attack is. The Titan Rain incident is particularly difficult to access in its entirety because the stolen data were encrypted on the way out, making it technically difficult to know what the purpose of the attack was and exactly which files were taken.⁵ The only way to judge the significance of the attack was to measure the volume of the data taken in terabytes.\nAnonymity within cyberspace is a valuable tool to both the perpetrators of attacks and the average user alike. Over the last several years I have worked with democracy NGOs around the Middle East and other regions building training platforms for democracy activists. These websites are designed to offer potential democracy activists the maximum amount of anonymity to protect them against government persecution. In this instance anonymity is a tool that safeguards liberties. This same ability to remain anonymous facilitates nefarious groups and nation-states that wish to do harm.\nAlthough this book is primarily concerned with the decision-making processes of state actors, the quote at the beginning of this chapter by the group\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [81]\nAnonymous is illustrative of the power a disparate group of nonstate actors can have in cyberspace. If states are unable to prevent ad hoc organizations such as Anonymous from taking down the websites of major governmental agencies such as the FBI or CIA, then how is it possible to defend against state actors with infinitely more resources?⁶\nVarious scholars have indicated that one of the fundamental problems associated with the structure of the Internet is that it was never designed to provide tracking and referencing of users.⁷ It is prudent to remember that the Internet as we know it was started as a private collaboration tool between universities and U.S. laboratories under the control of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In fact, at its beginning commerce was prohibited on the Internet. As the value and the volume of connections has increased, the value of anonymity has been both a blessing and a curse. For a state deciding whether to use cyber as a means of attack against another state, one of its primary considerations should and does often rightly center on anonymity.\nThe value of anonymity is supported by both anecdotal evidence as well as sound political logic. In every major case of state-on-state hostile cyber interaction, ranging from cyber exploitation (CE) to cyber attack (CA), anonymity has been a central feature. The answer as to why anonymity is a central feature of hostile state interactions within cyber is discussed in previous chapters, but it does not hurt to reiterate its central premise and applicability to the decision to instigate offensive cyber operations within cyberspace.\nA bullet or bomb launched from a gun or plane has a defined trajectory. It is possible to harden a target against them with either a bulletproof vest or a bunker. But once that trajectory has been established, the target is typically assured of impact barring some counterballistic system. In much the same way it is possible to harden cyber assets against cyber weapons. Network administrators can build firewalls or air gap networks to protect them against incoming bits and bytes. But unlike the bulletproof vest that works against any bullet regardless of type, up to a certain caliber, a firewall only protects against identified threats. And at the time of this writing it is estimated that there are approximately 200 million different types of viruses, Trojans, and worms.\nFurthermore, just as a bulletproof vest offers little protection against a howitzer round, a firewall can be overcome by larger inflows of bits and bytes (a DDoS attack). If a larger round is coming toward an individual, that individual will attempt to fortify himself or herself in a bunker and survive. The same is true of a cyber attack. If it is known that a large-scale DDoS attack will be conducted, network administrators can expand or distribute network infrastructure capacity or engage in other mitigation techniques to weather the attack.⁸ If the network administrators do not know an attack is coming, then they are likely to be casualties, as has been demonstrated in many instances including the 2010 “Operation\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nPayback,\" in which a group of substate actors from the group Anonymous took off-line via DDoS attack multiple websites including MasterCard, PayPal, and Visa. If advance warning on a cyber attack is available, a network administrator can also take systems off-line and remove targets altogether, making an attack ineffective for want of a target, or the administrator can mass defensive resources or prohibit traffic from certain points of origin.\nIf the objective of an attack is to make small changes in the defenses of another state's systems, then the goal is to hide those changes for as long as possible. Not only is it prudent to hide the attacker's identity, but it is prudent to hide the knowledge of the attack as well. Once an opponent knows it is being attacked, its security personnel begin implementing defensive measures as a response. Defenders can increase the robustness of their firewall(s), increase their network capacity, or, in worst-case scenarios, remove the systems altogether. The same is not true of conventional attacks. Once an attack is ongoing, it typically must be weathered or responded to.\nAny probability for success in cyber is dependent largely on a relationship between the objective of an attack and the ability to remain anonymous to the point at which that objective is completed. Furthermore, even if the anonymity of the attack is lost, the anonymity of the attacker can still be preserved. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the victim to retaliate with any meaningful accuracy. The three characteristics of anonymity combine to significantly condition the decision-making process of actors in cyber.\nMany scholars note anonymity is a strong characteristic of the cyber domain. Robert Axelrod and Rumen Illiev indicate that anonymity serves as a fundamental aspect of cyber attacks and define the ability to use a cyber weapon in terms of the ability of a cyber resource to maintain stealth and persistence.[10] Their argument for the importance of anonymity is based on data presented by Bilge and Dumitras suggesting that on average over the course of a three-year period only 3-5 percent of hundreds of vulnerabilities in different browsers were discovered and that the average duration of a zero-day attack is 312 days.[11] This would indicate that not only is anonymity often present as a component in the decision to attack, but that it is also an attribute of the vulnerabilities and viruses associated with the systems being attacked. Axelrod and Iliev's data on when to use a cyber resource indicate that the persistence of an unknown vulnerability is nearly 100 percent when not used, meaning that the life span of vulnerabilities is quite significant.\nBeyond just the long duration of vulnerabilities available for exploit due to their almost inherently anonymous nature and persistence, Cornish et al. argue that anonymity might also make it possible for certain actors to achieve disproportionate amounts of political utility from identical acts conducted in cyberspace.[12] While it is true a small state can create a disproportionate amount\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nof harm in cyberspace in ways not possible using conventional military tactics, it is unclear if this state derives a higher degree of utility for cyber attacks over other forms of asymmetric conflict. Instead, because political utility is compared to various options within the toolbox of state, the actual utility of cyber attacks does not change, only its relative value to other options within the overall decision set. For instance, in the case of Stuxnet, the United States had at least half a dozen options for dealing with potential Iranian nuclear development. Israel had fewer options. Economic sanctions imposed by the United States would be far more harmful than those imposed by Israelis because the United States controls much larger swaths of the global market. Under this logic, the value of a cyber attack does not change based on the size of a state; it simply alters its position within the decision set, making it appear more valuable and thus appear to have greater utility than other options. Moreover, as discussed, cyber power is dependent on many factors, among which are the theoretical capabilities of cyber power. It is a lack of these capabilities that limits the ability to conduct highly complex attacks capable of achieving significant impact.\nAnonymity provides a means by which to achieve political utility and acts as a facilitator for the application of power. Chapter 7 provides a graphical representation of the scale and complexity of attacks in relation to their feasibility. The larger and more complex an attack, the more likely it is to need anonymity over time. One exception would be distributed denial of service attacks conducted by nonstate actors who want public acknowledgment of their attack but have time-limited utility measures resulting from disruption of services. The relationship of complexity and scale with feasibility indicates an inverse relationship. The more difficult an attack, the more likely it is to be significant in either size, complexity, or both. There are only a few select countries with the technical capabilities to conduct a highly complex attack such as Stuxnet or the attack on Syrian air defense systems. There are nearly a hundred countries and large numbers of substate actors capable of conducting the type of attacks used against Estonia in 2007. The disproportionate relationship between the size of a state and anonymity is directly related to the number of potential actors and the ability to remain anonymous. Although the Stuxnet attack has not been publicly claimed, it has been widely reported as emanating from the United States and Israel through official sources within President Obama's administration.[13] Anonymity was a crucial aspect of Stuxnet, and although the attack has not been publicly claimed, particularly in the first few years after its initiation, the range of possible actors based just on factors such as complexity and scale of attack is quite small. If the attack is contextualized in foreign policy and international relations, the range narrows to possibly three and more likely two actors.\nAnonymity is a complex measure. The three characteristics of anonymity are extremely difficult to maintain indefinitely. The key is to prolong a combination\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nof the characteristics long enough to achieve an objective in cyber. Furthermore, if the identity of the attacker remains anonymous, this denies the legal justification for retaliation by the targeted state as well as denying the identification of a proper institutional format for recourse.[14]\n## POLITICAL ACTION AND ANONYMITY\nIs it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? If we follow the logic of Thomas Rid that “history does not know acts of war without eventual attribution,” then do cyber attacks constitute political acts?[15] With anonymity being a central feature that influences the success of cyber attacks, does anonymity remove the political aspect of attacks? Rid goes on to say: “aggressors engaging in subversion, espionage or sabotage do act politically; but in sharp contrast to warfare, they are likely to have a permanent or at least temporary interest in avoiding attribution. This is one of the main reasons why political crime, more than acts of war, has thrived in the cyber domain, where non-attribution may be easier to achieve than waterproof attribution.”[16]\nThis book largely steps over the linguistic gap between what constitutes an act of war and what constitutes a crime or other form of action. For the purposes of understanding anonymity the definition is largely based on the perception of the aggrieved party. However, Rid does make it clear, through linguistic nuance, that certain acts within cyber can contain political utility. Virtually all other scholars agree on this point.[17] While the linguistic distinction between war and political crime has caused a degree of animosity within the subfield, this animosity is likely misplaced and represents different linguistic traditions and conceptualizations of the state of modern conflict in regard to historical frameworks.[18]\nThe focus on the debate over whether anonymous acts that take place constitute different types of conflict is dependent on the framework of definitions a scholar uses. What is evident is that regardless of how cyber attacks are referred to in the conventional typology, they are capable of generating utility, as demonstrated in chapter 3.\n## THE VALUE OF ANONYMITY\nActs that occur in cyberspace are not necessarily anonymous, yet anonymity is a desired characteristic for the conduct of offensive cyber actions. How then can we operationalize the concept of anonymity within a rational choice decision-making model so it is logical to the decision-maker?\nBruce Bueno de Mesquita’s utility theory simply compares the power scores of different states. By using a capability (power) relationship between states he is able to determine the probability of success for the instigator of a potential\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace\nconflict. It is this probability of success that greatly affects the decision to engage in an act. In theory it would be possible to use Bueno de Mesquita's model to explain any type of decision to engage in interstate interactions ranging from diplomacy to war. It would be possible to rearrange the probability function of the model to incorporate those characteristics that influence successful diplomatic interactions to derive a model for bargaining. However, Bueno de Mesquita's model is focused on overt conflict. He uses power to assess the probability of success. Yet because he works in a domain of interaction where distance has an effect, his power relationship is scaled by distance.[19] Distance, as examined in previous chapters, does not matter in cyberspace as it does in conventional military encounters because cyber attacks can occur with no diminishing capability due to distance. A virus code in China does not need to be resupplied by a virus code in the United States. What does affect the probability of success is time. However, the probability of success affected by time does not interact with the power of a state, as is often the case in conventional conflict. Instead it influences the overall probability of success.\nThere are several ways to represent the relationship to time in mathematical models and probability. One of the more standard statistical methods available to test time to an event is to use a hazard or survivability model. This model is not noting the changes in the power relationship over time; rather, it is examining the probability any given type of attack can remain anonymous within the three above combined characteristics long enough to achieve the objective of the attack. More simply, it examines how long until the target knows it is being attacked, knows the target of the attack, and knows who is doing the attacking.\nThis is important to the development of a decision-making model for the instigation of cyber attacks, as has been mentioned several times. Once a victim recognizes an attack, it can begin taking defensive measures to protect itself. Once it knows the target of the attack, it can harden that target. Once it knows the perpetrator of the attack, it can begin retaliation. The question the decision-maker then asks is what is the probability at a point from time  $t_{i}$  to time  $t_{c}$  or from instigation to completion of the attack that the instigator is able to maintain anonymity. This probability changes over time. At time  $t_{i}$ , the initiation of the attack, the likelihood that anonymity is lost is relatively low. The longer the attack takes to complete, the more likely the attacker is to lose anonymity. This then becomes a fluid measure expressed in moments in time that can be graphed. Because each type of attack is unique, no two hazard models are the same.\nThe hazard model is composed of those factors essential to maintaining anonymity discussed above. It is important to know the scale (S) of an attack. The larger the attack, the more difficult it is to accomplish. Next it is important to understand the complexity (C) of the attack. The more complex an attack, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nTABLE 5.1 Probability of Maintaining Anonymity by Attack\n|  Propaganda | 99%  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Web Vandalism | 95%  |\n|  Denial of Service | 90%  |\n|  Distributed Denial of Service | 85%  |\n|  Cyber Exploitation | 80%  |\n|  Equipment Disruption | 70%  |\n|  Critical Infrastructure | 60%  |\n|  Compromised Hardware Systems | 50%  |\nmore difficult it is to accomplish. These two variables interact as well. A large and complex attack is more difficult than a small, complex attack or a large, simple one. Next, as mentioned above, it is important to contextualize the attack by determining the level of hostility (H) between nations. If state X has only two primary adversaries, it can quickly isolate the instigator of an attack against its interests. By understanding the level of hostility, it is possible to begin narrowing the number of countries in the system. The more potential actors (Q) within a grouping, the more likely a perpetrator is to remain anonymous. The expression of the hazard function is listed below in equation 5.1.\n# Hazard Function for Anonymity\n5.1  $A = \\log h_{1}(t) = a + C_{i}\\beta + S_{i}\\beta + (C_{i}S_{i})\\beta + H_{i}\\beta + Q_{i}\\beta + e$\nUsing this function with complete data, it is possible to isolate at any given point in time from the initiation of an attack to the completion of an attack the probability of maintaining anonymity across the three characteristics of anonymity. As is examined in chapter 7, this model can be greatly influenced by the collection of intelligence. Such intelligence would influence all variables within the above hazard function.\nBecause there is an assumption of anonymity necessary to instigate any attack due to the characteristics of cyber attacks as defined above, the model in this book is not filled in by data. Instead the probability of maintaining anonymity at the point of initial decision to instigate an attack is kept constant at 1. The probability of maintaining anonymity changes over time. Therefore anonymity at time  $t_0$  is always kept at 1. The probability of anonymity at  $t_{0 + n}$  is here defined by the type of attack, rather than using the hazard function for which data are not available. Attacks are broken into eight categories, each with a probability of maintaining anonymity over time. The categories and their corresponding probabilities are listed in table 5.1. These probabilities are anecdotal and as-\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [87]\nsumed. Actual probabilities for each attack would depend on the intricacies of the attack, the hostility between nations, and all of the other features included in the hazard function for anonymity.\nThe above indicates that the more complicated the attack, the more difficult it is to maintain anonymity. Although the numbers are rough, they are meant to illustrate the intersection of all three categories of anonymity. Many groups and organizations can participate in web propaganda, and it is therefore a low-level and common form of attack. Only a few states are currently capable of fully compromising hardware systems; it is therefore more difficult to maintain anonymity during such an attack.\n# ANONYMITY, ATTRIBUTION, AND DECISIONS\nAlthough many works focus on the term \"attribution,\" here the focus is on anonymity. This has been done for several reasons. First, an anonymous actor is one who avoids attribution. Many legal scholars, including Susan Brenner, tend to focus only on the attribution aspect of cyber. They do this primarily because they are concerned with the defensive capabilities of states. The ability for states to respond to cyber attacks and their perpetrators is an important aspect of cyber defense. But when we consider the offensive strategy of a state, the concern is a combination of achieving the objective and avoiding attribution. For an attack to gain political utility, a state must achieve its stated objective. If a state cannot achieve even the minimum threshold of its objective, an attack remains unattributed if it did not gain any political utility. Anonymity is a fundamental aspect of offensive cyber operations (OCOs). Attribution is a fundamental aspect of cyber defense. The focus of this book is on developing a model that examines how states decide to attack; therefore attribution is largely ignored from a defensive orientation except where it affects the probability of success.\nWheeler and Larson define attribution as \"determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker's intermediary.\"20 Once a targeted country begins the attribution process, it is often after an attack has been completed. It is doubtful that the Israelis cared that the Syrians knew they invaded their airspace to bomb the nuclear facilities. They had already gained the benefit they sought. The Syrians did not respond militarily because they had already lost that which they sought to protect. In cyber it is more important to identify that an attack is occurring, what the target of that attack is, and how to prevent the achievement of an attacker's goal, than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack.\nDeterrence does not work the same in cyber as in conventional conflict. Simply identifying the attacker and threatening response is typically not possible. And even when it is possible, it is only feasible with a cross-domain re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER FIVE\nsponse. Such a response would likely escalate a conflict significantly with unforeseen consequences.\nThe response mechanism to a cyber attack is theoretically confined in the short term to cross-domain actions due to an inability to quickly and efficiently plan meaningful on-the-fly attacks against an adversary. Cyber attacks are tailored to specific systems and require extensive planning and development to be successful. Unless the groundwork was laid out in advance, making it possible to conduct retaliatory in-domain attacks, a state's primary function is to remove the first two characteristics of anonymity by determining that an attack is occurring, and second, what the target of that attack is.\nJoel Brenner created a hypothetical scenario in which attribution is attained but matters far less than the recognition that an attack was occurring and a comprehension of the target of that attack.[21] The scenario is one in which the previously laid groundwork for a coordinated attack against U.S. critical infrastructure begins to take down vital U.S. systems coinciding with a foreign policy flap occurring with China. The decision-makers are paralyzed because at first it is not known whether the critical infrastructure malfunctions are due to an attack or normal error. As the malfunctions continue to occur, it becomes apparent the malfunctions are due to an attack and not an error. Although the likely attributable source is China, that is of little importance. The anonymity of the attack and the targets of the attack are more important than pointing fingers. The ability to hide an attack and the target of an attack facilitates it. In Brenner's case, by the time it was recognized as an attack it was too late to do anything, let alone isolate future targets, and the United States didn't have assets in place to retaliate in kind. Brenner notes that a cross-domain response would have been a prelude to all-out war with unforeseen consequences between two nuclear-armed states. The systems affected were such that even the kill switch mechanism once proposed in Congress would not have been of much use.[22]\nMoreover, to publicly attribute the system failures within the U.S. critical infrastructure without having a means to stop them also has many negative side effects. Such an attack could compel the defensive party to work in tandem with the attack initiator to maintain their anonymity. Should information on an attack become known, it could severely degrade public confidence in critical infrastructure and cause widespread panic. Furthermore, without being able to identify the various targets of the attack, the defender risks inciting even more damage against its systems. In this particular case Brenner indicates that the Chinese were using a cyber attack to prevent an armed military response while they asserted control over vast swaths of sea. When engaged in defensive cyber operations (DCOs), it is more important to know that an attack is occurring and what the targets of that attack are than it is to attribute the attack to a particular actor. But because the systems we depend on every day for every aspect\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nAttribution in Cyberspace [89]\nof national security and stability are subject to their own problems, it can be difficult to identify when hostile activity is occurring and when a system is malfunctioning due to purely technical issues not resulting from an attack.\n## SUMMARIZING THE DEBATE\nKenneth Geers accurately sums up the need for attribution when he writes: “The challenge of cyber attack attribution means that decision-makers will likely not have enough information on an adversary’s cyber capabilities, intentions, and operations to respond in a timely fashion.”²³ Attribution is a defensive necessity. Anonymity is an offensive necessity.\nThe probability of maintaining the anonymity of an attack and a target is equally important to maintaining the anonymity of the actor involved. The above analysis attempts to focus on the offensive dynamic of the anonymity-attribution debate and outline a solution for assessing the probability for maintaining anonymity at specific points in time during an attack through social scientific and technical methods. The probability for maintaining anonymity influences the probability of success in a cyber attack as much as the relative cyber power of the state engaging in the cyber attack. Adding a measure of anonymity into the decision-making model adds to the robustness of its findings and facilitates a more accurate understanding of when a state will decide to engage in offensive cyber actions.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

We are excited by egalitarianism and anonymity, but we constantly fight for our identity. David Owens, \"Anonymous 'Takes Down' CIA Website\"\n\nWe are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us. Quoted in Scott S., \"We Are Anonymous\"\n\nANONYMITY AND, BY EXTENSION, attribution are two fundamental aspects of the cyber domain. When a state decides to attack another state, it is not concerned solely with its relative power to its adversary. An attacking state is concerned with the power of its adversary and its ability to conduct an attack against an adversary while maintaining anonymity. Anonymity in cyberspace in the initiation and implementation phases of an attack provides the freedom to maneuver. Webster's defines anonymity as follows:\n\n1: of unknown authorship or origin\n2: not named or identified\n3: lacking individuality, distinction, or recognizability\n\nThe analysis below focuses on the origin or instigating actor, the target that is not identified, and the recognition that an attack is occurring. Specifically the concept of anonymity is approached from the offensive perspective of a state considering instigating a cyber attack against a potential opponent.\n\nTo understand anonymity it is necessary to ask basic questions of international politics. First, why is anonymity important to a cyber attacker? Second, is it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? Third, why is attribution important to a cyber defender? These three questions are answered below followed by a summary of the importance of understanding anonymity and attribution in offensive cyber decision-making.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "CHAPTER FIVE\n\n# THE IMPORTANCE OF ANONYMITY\n\nMost of the literature on cyber attacks makes clear that one of the most valuable aspects of the cyber domain is anonymity. Anonymity is a distinctive asset in covert operations, providing political plausible deniability while allowing for the attainment of a strategic or tactical objective. It is difficult to assess the true value of anonymity in cyber. From an offensive perspective the objective is to remain anonymous as long as possible while still achieving an objective. This is likely to lead an attacker to obfuscate his or her operation. As described in earlier chapters, if a target of a potential attack emanating from cyberspace knows where an attack will occur, or who will perpetrate an attack, it is much more likely to be able to defend against that attack.\n\nAnonymity in cyber is multifaceted. The layers of anonymity are constructed by the following characteristics: the inability to identify a perpetrator (state instigator) of an attack, the inability to recognize an attack is occurring, and the inability to isolate the target or objective of an attack. These characteristics build upon the two characteristics of attribution within Susan Brenner's legal framework for understanding cyber attacks.² These three characteristics are important for both legal and practical reasons. As *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace* accurately notes: \"The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult.\"³ Beyond simply being unable to identify the perpetrator, as is often the case in cyber attacks, it is difficult to recognize when a cyber attack is even occurring.\n\nTitan Rain, a cyber espionage operation targeting various defense systems, including U.S. Logistics Command, is an example of a cyber attack that stayed beneath the radar.⁴ A defender that does not know an attack is occurring is even less likely to know what the target of that attack is. The Titan Rain incident is particularly difficult to access in its entirety because the stolen data were encrypted on the way out, making it technically difficult to know what the purpose of the attack was and exactly which files were taken.⁵ The only way to judge the significance of the attack was to measure the volume of the data taken in terabytes.\n\nAnonymity within cyberspace is a valuable tool to both the perpetrators of attacks and the average user alike. Over the last several years I have worked with democracy NGOs around the Middle East and other regions building training platforms for democracy activists. These websites are designed to offer potential democracy activists the maximum amount of anonymity to protect them against government persecution. In this instance anonymity is a tool that safeguards liberties. This same ability to remain anonymous facilitates nefarious groups and nation-states that wish to do harm.\n\nAlthough this book is primarily concerned with the decision-making processes of state actors, the quote at the beginning of this chapter by the group\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "Attribution in Cyberspace [81]\n\nAnonymous is illustrative of the power a disparate group of nonstate actors can have in cyberspace. If states are unable to prevent ad hoc organizations such as Anonymous from taking down the websites of major governmental agencies such as the FBI or CIA, then how is it possible to defend against state actors with infinitely more resources?⁶\n\nVarious scholars have indicated that one of the fundamental problems associated with the structure of the Internet is that it was never designed to provide tracking and referencing of users.⁷ It is prudent to remember that the Internet as we know it was started as a private collaboration tool between universities and U.S. laboratories under the control of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In fact, at its beginning commerce was prohibited on the Internet. As the value and the volume of connections has increased, the value of anonymity has been both a blessing and a curse. For a state deciding whether to use cyber as a means of attack against another state, one of its primary considerations should and does often rightly center on anonymity.\n\nThe value of anonymity is supported by both anecdotal evidence as well as sound political logic. In every major case of state-on-state hostile cyber interaction, ranging from cyber exploitation (CE) to cyber attack (CA), anonymity has been a central feature. The answer as to why anonymity is a central feature of hostile state interactions within cyber is discussed in previous chapters, but it does not hurt to reiterate its central premise and applicability to the decision to instigate offensive cyber operations within cyberspace.\n\nA bullet or bomb launched from a gun or plane has a defined trajectory. It is possible to harden a target against them with either a bulletproof vest or a bunker. But once that trajectory has been established, the target is typically assured of impact barring some counterballistic system. In much the same way it is possible to harden cyber assets against cyber weapons. Network administrators can build firewalls or air gap networks to protect them against incoming bits and bytes. But unlike the bulletproof vest that works against any bullet regardless of type, up to a certain caliber, a firewall only protects against identified threats. And at the time of this writing it is estimated that there are approximately 200 million different types of viruses, Trojans, and worms.\n\nFurthermore, just as a bulletproof vest offers little protection against a howitzer round, a firewall can be overcome by larger inflows of bits and bytes (a DDoS attack). If a larger round is coming toward an individual, that individual will attempt to fortify himself or herself in a bunker and survive. The same is true of a cyber attack. If it is known that a large-scale DDoS attack will be conducted, network administrators can expand or distribute network infrastructure capacity or engage in other mitigation techniques to weather the attack.⁸ If the network administrators do not know an attack is coming, then they are likely to be casualties, as has been demonstrated in many instances including the 2010 “Operation\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "CHAPTER FIVE\n\nPayback,\" in which a group of substate actors from the group Anonymous took off-line via DDoS attack multiple websites including MasterCard, PayPal, and Visa. If advance warning on a cyber attack is available, a network administrator can also take systems off-line and remove targets altogether, making an attack ineffective for want of a target, or the administrator can mass defensive resources or prohibit traffic from certain points of origin.\n\nIf the objective of an attack is to make small changes in the defenses of another state's systems, then the goal is to hide those changes for as long as possible. Not only is it prudent to hide the attacker's identity, but it is prudent to hide the knowledge of the attack as well. Once an opponent knows it is being attacked, its security personnel begin implementing defensive measures as a response. Defenders can increase the robustness of their firewall(s), increase their network capacity, or, in worst-case scenarios, remove the systems altogether. The same is not true of conventional attacks. Once an attack is ongoing, it typically must be weathered or responded to.\n\nAny probability for success in cyber is dependent largely on a relationship between the objective of an attack and the ability to remain anonymous to the point at which that objective is completed. Furthermore, even if the anonymity of the attack is lost, the anonymity of the attacker can still be preserved. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the victim to retaliate with any meaningful accuracy. The three characteristics of anonymity combine to significantly condition the decision-making process of actors in cyber.\n\nMany scholars note anonymity is a strong characteristic of the cyber domain. Robert Axelrod and Rumen Illiev indicate that anonymity serves as a fundamental aspect of cyber attacks and define the ability to use a cyber weapon in terms of the ability of a cyber resource to maintain stealth and persistence.[10] Their argument for the importance of anonymity is based on data presented by Bilge and Dumitras suggesting that on average over the course of a three-year period only 3-5 percent of hundreds of vulnerabilities in different browsers were discovered and that the average duration of a zero-day attack is 312 days.[11] This would indicate that not only is anonymity often present as a component in the decision to attack, but that it is also an attribute of the vulnerabilities and viruses associated with the systems being attacked. Axelrod and Iliev's data on when to use a cyber resource indicate that the persistence of an unknown vulnerability is nearly 100 percent when not used, meaning that the life span of vulnerabilities is quite significant.\n\nBeyond just the long duration of vulnerabilities available for exploit due to their almost inherently anonymous nature and persistence, Cornish et al. argue that anonymity might also make it possible for certain actors to achieve disproportionate amounts of political utility from identical acts conducted in cyberspace.[12] While it is true a small state can create a disproportionate amount\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "Attribution in Cyberspace\n\nof harm in cyberspace in ways not possible using conventional military tactics, it is unclear if this state derives a higher degree of utility for cyber attacks over other forms of asymmetric conflict. Instead, because political utility is compared to various options within the toolbox of state, the actual utility of cyber attacks does not change, only its relative value to other options within the overall decision set. For instance, in the case of Stuxnet, the United States had at least half a dozen options for dealing with potential Iranian nuclear development. Israel had fewer options. Economic sanctions imposed by the United States would be far more harmful than those imposed by Israelis because the United States controls much larger swaths of the global market. Under this logic, the value of a cyber attack does not change based on the size of a state; it simply alters its position within the decision set, making it appear more valuable and thus appear to have greater utility than other options. Moreover, as discussed, cyber power is dependent on many factors, among which are the theoretical capabilities of cyber power. It is a lack of these capabilities that limits the ability to conduct highly complex attacks capable of achieving significant impact.\n\nAnonymity provides a means by which to achieve political utility and acts as a facilitator for the application of power. Chapter 7 provides a graphical representation of the scale and complexity of attacks in relation to their feasibility. The larger and more complex an attack, the more likely it is to need anonymity over time. One exception would be distributed denial of service attacks conducted by nonstate actors who want public acknowledgment of their attack but have time-limited utility measures resulting from disruption of services. The relationship of complexity and scale with feasibility indicates an inverse relationship. The more difficult an attack, the more likely it is to be significant in either size, complexity, or both. There are only a few select countries with the technical capabilities to conduct a highly complex attack such as Stuxnet or the attack on Syrian air defense systems. There are nearly a hundred countries and large numbers of substate actors capable of conducting the type of attacks used against Estonia in 2007. The disproportionate relationship between the size of a state and anonymity is directly related to the number of potential actors and the ability to remain anonymous. Although the Stuxnet attack has not been publicly claimed, it has been widely reported as emanating from the United States and Israel through official sources within President Obama's administration.[13] Anonymity was a crucial aspect of Stuxnet, and although the attack has not been publicly claimed, particularly in the first few years after its initiation, the range of possible actors based just on factors such as complexity and scale of attack is quite small. If the attack is contextualized in foreign policy and international relations, the range narrows to possibly three and more likely two actors.\n\nAnonymity is a complex measure. The three characteristics of anonymity are extremely difficult to maintain indefinitely. The key is to prolong a combination\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "CHAPTER FIVE\n\nof the characteristics long enough to achieve an objective in cyber. Furthermore, if the identity of the attacker remains anonymous, this denies the legal justification for retaliation by the targeted state as well as denying the identification of a proper institutional format for recourse.[14]\n\n## POLITICAL ACTION AND ANONYMITY\n\nIs it possible to conduct a political act and remain anonymous? If we follow the logic of Thomas Rid that “history does not know acts of war without eventual attribution,” then do cyber attacks constitute political acts?[15] With anonymity being a central feature that influences the success of cyber attacks, does anonymity remove the political aspect of attacks? Rid goes on to say: “aggressors engaging in subversion, espionage or sabotage do act politically; but in sharp contrast to warfare, they are likely to have a permanent or at least temporary interest in avoiding attribution. This is one of the main reasons why political crime, more than acts of war, has thrived in the cyber domain, where non-attribution may be easier to achieve than waterproof attribution.”[16]\n\nThis book largely steps over the linguistic gap between what constitutes an act of war and what constitutes a crime or other form of action. For the purposes of understanding anonymity the definition is largely based on the perception of the aggrieved party. However, Rid does make it clear, through linguistic nuance, that certain acts within cyber can contain political utility. Virtually all other scholars agree on this point.[17] While the linguistic distinction between war and political crime has caused a degree of animosity within the subfield, this animosity is likely misplaced and represents different linguistic traditions and conceptualizations of the state of modern conflict in regard to historical frameworks.[18]\n\nThe focus on the debate over whether anonymous acts that take place constitute different types of conflict is dependent on the framework of definitions a scholar uses. What is evident is that regardless of how cyber attacks are referred to in the conventional typology, they are capable of generating utility, as demonstrated in chapter 3.\n\n## THE VALUE OF ANONYMITY\n\nActs that occur in cyberspace are not necessarily anonymous, yet anonymity is a desired characteristic for the conduct of offensive cyber actions. How then can we operationalize the concept of anonymity within a rational choice decision-making model so it is logical to the decision-maker?\n\nBruce Bueno de Mesquita’s utility theory simply compares the power scores of different states. By using a capability (power) relationship between states he is able to determine the probability of success for the instigator of a potential\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "Attribution in Cyberspace\n\nconflict. It is this probability of success that greatly affects the decision to engage in an act. In theory it would be possible to use Bueno de Mesquita's model to explain any type of decision to engage in interstate interactions ranging from diplomacy to war. It would be possible to rearrange the probability function of the model to incorporate those characteristics that influence successful diplomatic interactions to derive a model for bargaining. However, Bueno de Mesquita's model is focused on overt conflict. He uses power to assess the probability of success. Yet because he works in a domain of interaction where distance has an effect, his power relationship is scaled by distance.[19] Distance, as examined in previous chapters, does not matter in cyberspace as it does in conventional military encounters because cyber attacks can occur with no diminishing capability due to distance. A virus code in China does not need to be resupplied by a virus code in the United States. What does affect the probability of success is time. However, the probability of success affected by time does not interact with the power of a state, as is often the case in conventional conflict. Instead it influences the overall probability of success.\n\nThere are several ways to represent the relationship to time in mathematical models and probability. One of the more standard statistical methods available to test time to an event is to use a hazard or survivability model. This model is not noting the changes in the power relationship over time; rather, it is examining the probability any given type of attack can remain anonymous within the three above combined characteristics long enough to achieve the objective of the attack. More simply, it examines how long until the target knows it is being attacked, knows the target of the attack, and knows who is doing the attacking.\n\nThis is important to the development of a decision-making model for the instigation of cyber attacks, as has been mentioned several times. Once a victim recognizes an attack, it can begin taking defensive measures to protect itself. Once it knows the target of the attack, it can harden that target. Once it knows the perpetrator of the attack, it can begin retaliation. The question the decision-maker then asks is what is the probability at a point from time  $t_{i}$  to time  $t_{c}$  or from instigation to completion of the attack that the instigator is able to maintain anonymity. This probability changes over time. At time  $t_{i}$ , the initiation of the attack, the likelihood that anonymity is lost is relatively low. The longer the attack takes to complete, the more likely the attacker is to lose anonymity. This then becomes a fluid measure expressed in moments in time that can be graphed. Because each type of attack is unique, no two hazard models are the same.\n\nThe hazard model is composed of those factors essential to maintaining anonymity discussed above. It is important to know the scale (S) of an attack. The larger the attack, the more difficult it is to accomplish. Next it is important to understand the complexity (C) of the attack. The more complex an attack, the\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

These two variables interact as well. A large and complex attack is more difficult than a small, complex attack or a large, simple one. Next, as mentioned above, it is important to contextualize the attack by determining the level of hostility (H) between nations. If state X has only two primary adversaries, it can quickly isolate the instigator of an attack against its interests. By understanding the level of hostility, it is possible to begin narrowing the number of countries in the system. The more potential actors (Q) within a grouping, the more likely a perpetrator is to remain anonymous. The expression of the hazard function is listed below in equation 5.1.\n\n# Hazard Function for Anonymity\n\n5.1  $A = \\log h_{1}(t) = a + C_{i}\\beta + S_{i}\\beta + (C_{i}S_{i})\\beta + H_{i}\\beta + Q_{i}\\beta + e$\n\nUsing this function with complete data, it is possible to isolate at any given point in time from the initiation of an attack to the completion of an attack the probability of maintaining anonymity across the three characteristics of anonymity. As is examined in chapter 7, this model can be greatly influenced by the collection of intelligence. Such intelligence would influence all variables within the above hazard function.\n\nBecause there is an assumption of anonymity necessary to instigate any attack due to the characteristics of cyber attacks as defined above, the model in this book is not filled in by data. Instead the probability of maintaining anonymity at the point of initial decision to instigate an attack is kept constant at 1. The probability of maintaining anonymity changes over time. Therefore anonymity at time  $t_0$  is always kept at 1. The probability of anonymity at  $t_{0 + n}$  is here defined by the type of attack, rather than using the hazard function for which data are not available. Attacks are broken into eight categories, each with a probability of maintaining anonymity over time. The categories and their corresponding probabilities are listed in table 5.1. These probabilities are anecdotal and as-\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Actual probabilities for each attack would depend on the intricacies of the attack, the hostility between nations, and all of the other features included in the hazard function for anonymity.\n\nThe above indicates that the more complicated the attack, the more difficult it is to maintain anonymity. Although the numbers are rough, they are meant to illustrate the intersection of all three categories of anonymity. Many groups and organizations can participate in web propaganda, and it is therefore a low-level and common form of attack. Only a few states are currently capable of fully compromising hardware systems; it is therefore more difficult to maintain anonymity during such an attack.\n\n# ANONYMITY, ATTRIBUTION, AND DECISIONS\n\nAlthough many works focus on the term \"attribution,\" here the focus is on anonymity. This has been done for several reasons. First, an anonymous actor is one who avoids attribution. Many legal scholars, including Susan Brenner, tend to focus only on the attribution aspect of cyber. They do this primarily because they are concerned with the defensive capabilities of states. The ability for states to respond to cyber attacks and their perpetrators is an important aspect of cyber defense. But when we consider the offensive strategy of a state, the concern is a combination of achieving the objective and avoiding attribution. For an attack to gain political utility, a state must achieve its stated objective. If a state cannot achieve even the minimum threshold of its objective, an attack remains unattributed if it did not gain any political utility. Anonymity is a fundamental aspect of offensive cyber operations (OCOs). Attribution is a fundamental aspect of cyber defense. The focus of this book is on developing a model that examines how states decide to attack; therefore attribution is largely ignored from a defensive orientation except where it affects the probability of success.\n\nWheeler and Larson define attribution as \"determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker's intermediary.\"20 Once a targeted country begins the attribution process, it is often after an attack has been completed. It is doubtful that the Israelis cared that the Syrians knew they invaded their airspace to bomb the nuclear facilities. They had already gained the benefit they sought. The Syrians did not respond militarily because they had already lost that which they sought to protect. In cyber it is more important to identify that an attack is occurring, what the target of that attack is, and how to prevent the achievement of an attacker's goal, than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack.\n\nDeterrence does not work the same in cyber as in conventional conflict. Simply identifying the attacker and threatening response is typically not possible. And even when it is possible, it is only feasible with a cross-domain re\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "CHAPTER FIVE\n\nsponse. Such a response would likely escalate a conflict significantly with unforeseen consequences.\n\nThe response mechanism to a cyber attack is theoretically confined in the short term to cross-domain actions due to an inability to quickly and efficiently plan meaningful on-the-fly attacks against an adversary. Cyber attacks are tailored to specific systems and require extensive planning and development to be successful. Unless the groundwork was laid out in advance, making it possible to conduct retaliatory in-domain attacks, a state's primary function is to remove the first two characteristics of anonymity by determining that an attack is occurring, and second, what the target of that attack is.\n\nJoel Brenner created a hypothetical scenario in which attribution is attained but matters far less than the recognition that an attack was occurring and a comprehension of the target of that attack.[21] The scenario is one in which the previously laid groundwork for a coordinated attack against U.S. critical infrastructure begins to take down vital U.S. systems coinciding with a foreign policy flap occurring with China. The decision-makers are paralyzed because at first it is not known whether the critical infrastructure malfunctions are due to an attack or normal error. As the malfunctions continue to occur, it becomes apparent the malfunctions are due to an attack and not an error. Although the likely attributable source is China, that is of little importance. The anonymity of the attack and the targets of the attack are more important than pointing fingers. The ability to hide an attack and the target of an attack facilitates it. In Brenner's case, by the time it was recognized as an attack it was too late to do anything, let alone isolate future targets, and the United States didn't have assets in place to retaliate in kind. Brenner notes that a cross-domain response would have been a prelude to all-out war with unforeseen consequences between two nuclear-armed states. The systems affected were such that even the kill switch mechanism once proposed in Congress would not have been of much use.[22]\n\nMoreover, to publicly attribute the system failures within the U.S. critical infrastructure without having a means to stop them also has many negative side effects. Such an attack could compel the defensive party to work in tandem with the attack initiator to maintain their anonymity. Should information on an attack become known, it could severely degrade public confidence in critical infrastructure and cause widespread panic. Furthermore, without being able to identify the various targets of the attack, the defender risks inciting even more damage against its systems. In this particular case Brenner indicates that the Chinese were using a cyber attack to prevent an armed military response while they asserted control over vast swaths of sea. When engaged in defensive cyber operations (DCOs), it is more important to know that an attack is occurring and what the targets of that attack are than it is to attribute the attack to a particular actor. But because the systems we depend on every day for every aspect\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "Attribution in Cyberspace [89]\n\nof national security and stability are subject to their own problems, it can be difficult to identify when hostile activity is occurring and when a system is malfunctioning due to purely technical issues not resulting from an attack.\n\n## SUMMARIZING THE DEBATE\n\nKenneth Geers accurately sums up the need for attribution when he writes: “The challenge of cyber attack attribution means that decision-makers will likely not have enough information on an adversary’s cyber capabilities, intentions, and operations to respond in a timely fashion.”²³ Attribution is a defensive necessity. Anonymity is an offensive necessity.\n\nThe probability of maintaining the anonymity of an attack and a target is equally important to maintaining the anonymity of the actor involved. The above analysis attempts to focus on the offensive dynamic of the anonymity-attribution debate and outline a solution for assessing the probability for maintaining anonymity at specific points in time during an attack through social scientific and technical methods. The probability for maintaining anonymity influences the probability of success in a cyber attack as much as the relative cyber power of the state engaging in the cyber attack. Adding a measure of anonymity into the decision-making model adds to the robustness of its findings and facilitates a more accurate understanding of when a state will decide to engage in offensive cyber actions.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 16:01:51 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"
