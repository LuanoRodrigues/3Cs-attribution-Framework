This article argues that China’s resistance to applying some rules of the *jus in bello* to cyberspace is in line with the “wait and see” approach of most States. But there are two distinctive objectives behind this generalized stance: one is to protect its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace from being bound by disfavoured emerging and existing law, and the other is to build up consensus for a treaty regulating uses of cyber force under the United Nations framework.\n## I. Introduction\n1. International law is a generator and a product of the changing global order. China, as “both an aspirational ‘great power’ which plays a key role alongside the West in global governance, and a member of the post-colonial States which views Western hegemony with a critical eye and sees the need to champion the causes of the developing world”, no longer tries to conceal its\n* Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow, Fudan University Law School; S.J.D.

To what extent and how the rise of a new great power will influence international law largely hinges upon the interaction between the rising power and the established powers that have dominated international legal discourse for centuries. The perspectives of China and the established powers differ substantially on many issues, especially those relating to sovereign equality, non-intervention and national security. This can be exemplified by China's perspectives on many issues of cyber warfare in the normative rivalry between the United States (US)-European Union (EU) Camp and the Russia-China Camp, which are competing to influence the making of international law, as well as other countries' domestic policies.²\n2. Through the International Code of Conduct for Information Security (ICCIS) first submitted to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2011³ and joint efforts in other forums such as the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT),⁴ the Russia-China Camp has advanced a sovereignty-based model of Internet governance, which respects cyberspace sovereignty and State independence and legitimizes domestic efforts\nReinterpreting the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and Military Intervention for Humanitarian Purposes, 6 Asian JIL (2016), 114.\n2 See, e.g., Kristen E.

No. A/66/359 (14 September 2011) [hereinafter “ICCIS”].\n4 At the WCIT in December 2012, Russia took the lead to float an enhanced sovereign governance model under the International Telecommunications Regulations and challenged the present management of the domain name system by the Internet Cooperation for Assigned Names and Numbers. The Russian proposal was adopted as a separate resolution attached to the revised treaty text. See Russian Federation, Proposals for the Work of the Conference, Revision 1 to Document 27-E, Proposed Art. 3A.2 (17 November 2012) (www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000188224.pdf); also International Telecommunication Union, Final Acts of the WCIT (Dubai, 2012), art. 1.1(a) (www.itu.int/en/wcit-12/Documents/final-acts-wcit-12.pdf).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 259\nto regulate the content of and access to information.⁵ The US-EU Camp strives to maintain the currently dominant multi-stakeholder model governed by diverse stakeholders, including governments, technical communities, the private sector and other civil society members.⁶ It does not accept the ICCIS, especially the domestic regulation on freedom of expression and association⁷ and the move towards greater sovereign control in cyberspace.⁸\n3. Notably, China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and the digital economy, especially following the 2008 global financial crisis, did not initially bolster its assertiveness in the international lawmaking procedures that seek to identify existing law or generate new law applicable to State behaviour in cyberspace. China was a low-key participant at the early stages of the UN Group of Government Experts on the Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of Security (“UN GGE”). Its behaviour was found to be passive and frequently concurring with Russia’s stance. The Chinese representatives attending earlier UN GGE meetings were technical officers from the Ministry of Communication rather than diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign affairs (MOFA).⁹ But later, China proved to be willing to act more actively and assertively when it was singled out and its fundamental domestic interests were threatened by the disfavoured norms proposed by the established powers.\n4. In reaction to these Western normative attempts, China has transformed from a low-profile, passive team player under the Russian leadership to a proactive actor that had formed its own agenda. China’s active pattern of behaviour was prompted by a 2010 speech by Hillary Clinton, former US Secretary\n⁵ ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(a), (c), (d), (f).\n⁶ US Office of the Secretary of Defense, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2013 (May 2013), 37 (https://fas.org/man/eprint/dod-china-2013.pdf); European Parliament Resolution of 22 November 2012 on the Forthcoming WCIT-12 of the International Telecommunications Union, and the Possible Expansion of the Scope of International Telecommunication Regulations, P7_TA(2012)0451 (22 November 2012), para.5 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52012IP0451).\n⁷ US Department of State, International Cyberspace Policy Strategy (March 2016) (per Public Law 114-113, Division N, Title IV, Section 402), 16-18 (https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/255732.pdf).\n⁸ Ibid.\n⁹ As noted in: Adam Segal, Chinese Cyber Diplomacy in a New Era of Uncertainty, Aegis Paper Series No. 1703, Hoover Institution (2017), 5-6 (www.lawfareblog.com/chinese-cyber-diplomacy-new-era-uncertainty-0).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nof State, that criticized China for limiting the freedom to access the Internet and conducting online censorship. Higher-level officials from the MOFA with expertise in cyber governance started to represent China in diplomatic activities.¹⁰ The ICCIS was developed to counter-balance the diplomatic momentum generated by a series of US activities, including Clinton’s speeches on freedom in cyberspace between 2010-2012, the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the 2011 Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace. Beijing viewed these activities as attempting to militarize cyberspace and maintain the dominance of the US in cyber governance by interfering in other States’ sovereign right to regulate cyberspace.¹¹\n5. In 2011, the first edition of the ICCIS was submitted two months before the London Conference, a United Kingdom (UK)-sponsored attempt in line with those of the US and their allies. The ICCIS called on States “not to use information and communications technologies (ICTs), including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies”, called for “peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security”, and emphasized “the important role of the UN in formulating international norms”.¹² An updated edition of the ICCIS with similar wording was circulated at the UNGA in 2015,¹³ possibly intended to gather wider support in the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures that harmed the US’s credibility in its continuous diplomatic attempts.\n6. The second World Internet Conference in 2015 marked the emergence of China’s own vision of global Internet governance that advocates both respect for sovereignty in cyberspace and international cooperation to “jointly build a community of shared future in cyberspace”. Chinese President XI Jinping highlighted the problems of the current global Internet governance system, including, among other things, the inadequate existing rules governing cyberspace that hardly reflect the perspectives of the majority of countries,\n¹⁰ As noted in ibid., 6.\n¹¹ Ibid., 4-5, 7.\n¹² ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(b), (j).\n¹³ International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the Letter dated 9 January 2015 from the Permanent Representatives of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russia Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations Addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

One proposal explicitly called on all countries to work together to “contain the abuse of information technology, oppose cyber surveillance and cyberattacks and reject arms race in cyberspace” and “push for the formulation of international cyberspace rules accepted by all parties as well as an international convention against terrorism in cyberspace, improve the legal assistance mechanism to fight cybercrimes and jointly uphold peace and security in cyberspace”.¹⁴\n7. The vision of “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” was further elaborated by the Organizing Committee of the World Internet Conference in 2019. It urged countries to oppose hostile activities, acts of aggression, cyberattacks, large-scale surveillance operations, unfounded accusations of cyberattacks against other countries and attempts to politicize cybersecurity issues; prevent arms race and military conflict in cyberspace; and remain committed to resolving disputes by peaceful means.¹⁵ In 2020, the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace was released amid the COVID-19 pandemic that underpinned the urgency of “achieving shared development, ensuring common security, realizing joint governance, and enjoying benefits”. This document emphasized the need to “exert the roles of the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) and the UN GGE, and support formulating codes, norms and principles of responsible State conduct in cyberspace that are acceptable to all parties under the UN framework”.¹⁶\n8. To assess the implications of China’s rise for the evolution of international law governing the use of force by States in cyberspace, this paper studies the normative initiatives and strategies employed by China in identifying rules of existing law and creating new law applicable to cyber warfare. In light of China’s sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance, Part II introduces the general stance of China on the adequacy of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to address cyber warfare. Part III evaluates the Chinese perspectives on\n¹⁴ Remarks by H.E.

Special attention is paid to legal controversies over the rules on cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities, the proportionality of cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and the targetability of certain categories of civilians. Part IV examines the rationales behind China's generalized normative proposal and its vague refusal to confirm the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello, while having recognized the general applicability of these two regimes to cyberspace. The last part concludes with a tentative assessment of the nature and the degree of China's normative influence over international lawmaking governing State behaviour in cyberspace and the possible momentum of China's policy in the future.\n## II. China's general stance on applicable law governing cyber warfare\n## II.A. China's sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance\n9. On 1 March 2017, the MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration jointly issued the first international cyber policy paper of China—the International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (ISCC)—to comprehensively introduce and explain Beijing's policy and position on issues of cyber-related international affairs.¹⁷ At his daily press briefing following the release, the UN Secretary-General Spokesman Stéphane Dujarric described the ISCC as “a very important report” and suggested that “China has a big role to play” in global cyber governance.¹⁸ The linchpin of China’s cyber diplomacy is the idea of cyber sovereignty, around which China formulates its cybersecurity policies towards three primary objectives. The first is to protect its critical information infrastructure, cyber sovereignty, national security and domestic stability from threats posed by digital power disparity among countries, cybercrimes and cyber terrorism, and external interference with China’s internal\n¹⁷ Statement by Ambassador FU Cong in the Assembly Meeting of the UN Conference on Disarmament on International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (9 March 2017) (www.china-un.ch/eng/hom/t1444602.htm); also MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration, International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (1 March 2017) (www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zzjg_663340/jks_665232/kjlc_665236/qtwt_665250/t1442390.shtml) [hereinafter “ISCC”].\n¹⁸ Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General (2 March 2017) (www.un.org/press/en/2017/db170302.doc.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 263\naffairs. The second is to shape the current global Internet governance and promote the formation of a system of international legal norms in China's favour. The third objective is to convert China's increasing cyber capacity into soft power to mobilize and influence other countries' preferences.¹⁹ Chapter II lays out the three elements of China's proposed idea of cyber sovereignty—regulatory authority, non-interference and sovereign equality, and the security-oriented balanced approach.²⁰\n10. The appeal for cyber sovereignty by China and other like-minded countries takes place at a time when governments' sovereign power over cyberspace is in decline for many reasons, including but not limited to the privatization of cyberspace, the rise of non-State actors and the digital gap between the developed and developing countries. As evidenced by the first and second editions of the Tallinn Manual providing that \"a State may exercise control over cyber infrastructure and activity within its sovereign territory\",²¹ sovereignty in cyberspace is not a revisionist idea by itself. According to the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Manual 2.0, this premise, which was confirmed by the 2013 Report of the UN GGE,²² is now \"relatively well accepted by the international community\".²³ The US and its allies have held out to this idea in order to sustain the current platform governed by multi-stakeholders under their control.²⁴\n19 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter I: Opportunities and Challenges, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n20 Ibid., Chapter II: The Principle of Sovereignty.\n21 Michael Schmitt (general ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), Rule 1 [hereinafter \"Tallinn Manual\"]; also Michael Schmitt (general ed.) &amp; Liis Vihul (managing ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on The International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2017), Rule 1 [hereinafter \"Tallinn Manual 2.0\"].\n22 Report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

It is noteworthy that, among all the technical communities developing the \"law\" of the Internet and managing the global distribution of Internet resources in terms of naming and addresses,²⁵ the ISCC exclusively named the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and urged the international community to \"make [ICANN] a truly independent international institution, increase its representations and ensure greater openness and transparency in its decision-making and operation\".²⁶ ICANN has been a highly politicalized organization. It is a Californian corporation created by a 1998 Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Commerce to transfer the power to manage and oversee the domain name system (DNS) coordination from the US government to the global community. This agreement was supposed to terminate on 30 September 2000, while subject to further amendments.²⁷ The US government did not end its supervision until October 2016,²⁸ mainly in response to the calling of major Internet technical organizations for freeing ICANN from unilateral oversight of the US as a backlash from the Snowden Disclosures.²⁹ Yet, it is early to tell whether the globalization of ICANN can be genuinely realized, given that most of its key infrastructures remain in the US territory. The deprivation of the top domain of Iraq, \".iq\", by ICANN in the Iraq war under the undue influence of the US government,³⁰ the Snowden Disclosures, and the \"Vault 7\" documents released by WikiLeaks³¹ have demonstrated the capacity and motivation of the US to abuse its dominant position in global Internet governance under the current multi-stakeholder model.\n25 See generally Milton Mueller, Chapter 25: Communications and The Internet, in: Jacob Katz Cogan, Ian Hurd &amp; Ian Johnstone (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Organizations (2017), 539-542.\n26 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter IV: Plan of Action.\n27 Memorandum of Understanding Between The US Department of Commerce and ICANN (25 November 1998) (www.icann.org/resources/unthemed-pages/icannmou-1998-11-25-en).\n28 Dave Lee, Has the US Just Given Away the Internet?, BBC News (1 October 2016) (www.bbc.com/news/technology-37527719).\n29 Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation (10 October 2013) (www.icann.org/news/announcement-2013-10-07-en).\n30 See LIANG Yabin, Cyberspace is the New Battlefield for Game of States in the Big Data Era, Study Times (20 October 2014) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/1020/c40531-25866183.html).\n31 See, e.g., Wikileaks Exposes CIA Interference in French Presidential Elections, The European Union Times (16 February 2017) (www.eutimes.net/2017/02/wikileaks-exposes-cia-interference-in-french-presidential-elections/).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 265\n12. The label “multi-stakeholder” was only applied to ICANN in the wake of the battles over Internet governance initiated by national governments, which are treated as “stakeholders” on an equal footing with private corporates and members of civil society, during and after the World Summit on the Information Society, as political rhetoric to mobilize non-State actors to help resist governmental interference into Internet governance and to simultaneously make the established self-governance model more palatable to States and the UN system.³² ICANN is a global Internet governance organization possessing monopoly power over the DNS, but it is only subject to the sole jurisdiction of the US under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law.³³ Due to the anticipated objection of the US, to put ICANN under the oversight of the international community of sovereign States³⁴ proves difficult to attain. And an equivalent alternative to ICANN would be not only costly but also highly disruptive for Internet users.³⁵\n13. Aside from open participation, ICANN is not subject to any classic form of internal accountability that commonly exists in private corporations and nonprofit organizations, such as direct accountability mechanisms based on membership or shareholders in the Regional Internet Registries and the open, bottom-up, consensus-based standardization process of the Internet Engineering Task Force.³⁶ Although ICANN self-identifies as championing the bottom-up, consensus-driven, multi-stakeholder model of governance, its policy-making processes manifest a top-down hierarchy, in which issues raised from the grassroots level end up as policy recommendations to be voted at the Board of Directors.³⁷ The Board has “near-absolute” power over the bylaws governing the entirety of processes and can “untrammeled[ly]” decide whether to accept these recommendations in the absence of any binding forms of appeal or review. While anyone can join most of ICANN’s volunteer Working Groups to express their views and have the views considered based\n32 Mueller, above n.25, 546.\n33 Milton Mueller, ICANN, Inc.: Accountability and Participation in the Governance of Critical Internet Resources, Internet Governance Project (2009), 7 (www.internet-governance.org/wp-content/uploads/ICANNInc.pdf).\n34 See, e.g., Political Oversight of ICANN: A Briefing for the WSIS Summit, Concept Paper by the Internet Governance Project (1 November 2005) (www2.world-governance.org/IMG/pdf_political-oversight_internet_governance.pdf).\n35 Mueller, above n.33, 5.\n36 Ibid., 4-5.\n37 How Does ICANN Work?

The critical details and implementations of these contracts are negotiated bilaterally between ICANN and the registrars/registries, largely beyond the influence of general policies developed in the bottom-up representative processes.⁴⁰ To summarize, ICANN seems to employ open participation as a substitute for other missing and more effective accountability mechanisms.⁴¹\n14. In the ISCC, China advocates shifting from the present multi-stakeholder model of global Internet governance to a multilateral State-centric model. In the latter model, a wide range of actors are encouraged to make their respective contributions based on their capacity in the multilateral decision-making processes led by governments, particularly regarding public policies and security.⁴² China favours the UN as the principal forum to coordinate positions of various parties and build international consensus, while other international mechanisms and platforms are called on to complement based on their comparative advantage.⁴³ The establishment of “multilateral, democratic, and transparent international Internet government systems” is listed as a major goal in the Thirteenth Five-Year-Plan for China’s economic and social development from 2016 to 2020.⁴⁴\n## II.B. International normative discourses\n15. The fundamentally divergent approaches to global Internet governance have driven China and the US to contrasting views on the adequacy of existing international law to address cybersecurity issues. The US and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies insist that prevailing\n38 Ibid.\n39 Mueller, above n.33, 2, 15.\n40 Mueller, above n.25, 541.\n41 Mueller, above n.33, 8.\n42 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter II: The Principle of Sovereignty.\n43 Ibid., Chapter II: The Principle of Shared Governance.\n44 National People’s Congress, Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Guomin Jingji he Shehui Fazhan di Shisange Wunian Guihua Gangyao [Outline of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the People’s Republic of China (2016-2020)] (March 2016), Chapter 28: Strengthen Information Security.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 267\ninternational law, including the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello* and relevant rules concerning State responsibility for international wrongful acts apply to cyberspace, and that the existing international legal framework is adequate to accommodate novel situations in the information age.⁴⁵\n16. China’s position on the adequacy of existing international law had not crystalized until the 2013 UN GGE meeting. Since then, China has accepted, in principle, the general applicability of relevant international law to cyberspace.⁴⁶ Despite this, China has maintained that international lawmaking is demanded to address the issues that are not clearly dealt with by existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, as parallel paths to further study the applicability of these two regimes’ established rules to cyber warfare from the perspectives of “maintaining international security, strategic mutual trust and preventing cyber conflicts”.⁴⁷\n17. Although the 2017 ISCC is not written in legal language, it calls for “formulating universally accepted international rules and norms of state behaviour in cyberspace within the framework of the UN” towards the ultimate goal of a “rule-based” global governance system in cyberspace.⁴⁸ Rather than using the word “codifying”, China opted for “formulating” and emphasized the universal acceptance of rules by countries. This wording reveals China’s reluctance to recognize the applicability of some *already existing* rules of international law to cyberspace, mainly because of the under-representation of developing countries in global cyber governance. In its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the Chinese government also stated that it would “take an active role in formulating international rules in areas such as the Internet”.⁴⁹\n⁴⁵ The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World (May 2011), 9 (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf); also Brian J.

In its efforts to achieve these objectives, Beijing has been increasingly active in various multilateral lawmaking forums, particularly major UN platforms such as the UNGA, UN GGE, the UN Expert Group on Combating Cybercrime and International Telecommunication Union. For example, along with the promotion of the concepts of cyber sovereignty and “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” at the World Internet Conference, a State-run annual international forum focusing on the development, use and governance of the Internet, underlying elements of these concepts have also been advocated in China’s Position Paper at the UNGA since 2014 to maintain the momentum and build consensus. These elements include: (1) peaceful use of cyberspace for economic and social development; (2) objection to cyber war and arms race; (3) the development of an international code of conduct for cyberspace under the UN framework that is acceptable to all, such as the two versions of the ICCIS; (4) strengthened international cooperation to combat cybercrimes such as cyber terrorism; and (5) objection to any country’s attempt to overstretch the concept of national security to restrict ICT development and cooperation among other countries or to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs.⁵⁰\n19.

These comprehensive and issue-specific normative initiatives unfold the usage of issue linkage under China's overall scheme of the legal framework governing cyberspace, under which the issues of the development and use of the Internet, cyber and data security, cybercrimes, cyber governance and cyber warfare that transcend different fields of international law are simultaneously placed on the agenda of international lawmaking to keep this bundle of issues at the frontline.\n20. In light of the digital divide between the developed and developing countries and the inequitable order of the existing international legal system, China has been aligning normative efforts at regional and South-South forums such as the BRICS, Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO), the ASEAN Regional Forum, China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in support of lawmaking activities at the UN.⁵³ The progress China has made in enhancing agenda-shaping and coalition-building capacities can be exemplified by the agenda item of \"International Law in Cyberspace\" proposed by China for the 53rd Annual Session of the AALCO⁵⁴ and the data security cooperation initiative signed between the Arab League and China.⁵⁵\n21.

In the context of cyber warfare, the US position is that existing LOAC, including its principles of distinction, necessity, and proportionality, applies in cyberspace.59 By contrast, China, Russia, and other SCO members have not agreed to the US stance and played a rival role. In the 2013 Report of the UN GGE, China and Russia managed to exclude any reference to the applicability of international humanitarian law principles in cyberspace, despite the controversial affirmation of the applicability of \"international law\" and the UN Charter.60 The 2015 UN GGE Report explicitly \"notes\" the possible applicability of \"the established international legal principles, including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction\", while cautiously avoiding making any reference to international humanitarian law.61 The wording of this text fails to clarify whether the UN GGE reached a consensus on the applicability of these LOAC principles to cyber activities or merely noted their existence. Moreover, although the 2015 UN GGE Report mentions the prohibition on the threat or use of force against any State's territorial integrity or political independence,62 it does not refer to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks amounting to use of force as an exception to such general prohibition. Instead, this UN GGE similarly\n57 The White House Office of the Press Secretary, Fact Sheet: President XI Jinping's State Visit to the United States (25 September 2015) (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinping-state-visit-united-states).\n58 US Department of Justice, First China-US Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue, Summary of Outcomes (9 October 2017) (www.justice.gov/opa/pr/first-us-china-law-enforcement-and-cybersecurity-dialogue).\n59 Harold Hongju Koh, International Law in Cyberspace, 54 Harvard ILJ (2012), 4-5.\n60 Above n.22, paras.19, 23.\n61 Report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Development in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the context of International Security, UN Doc.

Without an explicit official position, Beijing's stance on many occasions has been found to be general yet frequently in line with Russia's efforts to negotiate an international arms control treaty on the use and non-proliferation of information weapons.^[64]^ For example, the 2011 ICCIS proposes \"not to use ICTs, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies\", and calls for \"peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security\".^[65]^ In the updated ICCIS circulated at the UNGA in 2015, the controversial terms of \"proliferate information weapons\" is omitted, and the original paragraph is replaced by \"not to use ICTs and information and communications networks to carry out activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security\".^[66]^\n24. The ISCC pronounces China's consistent opposition to certain countries' \"Cold War Mentality\" in characterizing international relations in cyberspace as a \"zero-sum game\" and abusing the predominant position in global Internet governance to secure advantages by militarization and deterrence build-up in cyberspace.^[67]^ By calling the international community to adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, particularly non-use of force and peaceful settlement of disputes, the ISCC articulates the idea of upholding peace through international cooperation and safeguarding a country's own security that underpins \"common security\" of the international community of States \"on the basis of full respect for other countries' security\".^[68]^ Specifically, the ISCC proposes that \"all countries must oppose ICT-backed acts of hostility and aggression, prevent arms race and conflicts in cyberspace and settle disputes through peaceful means\"; China plans to work with other countries to \"curb the abuse of information technology and prevent arms race\n^[63]^ Ibid., para.28(c).\n^[64]^ As noted in: John Markoff and Andrew E.

While the ISCC discourages militarization of cyberspace, China plans to enhance its “defense capability in cyberspace” and “expedite the development of a cyber force” with the aim to “prevent a major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security and maintain national security and social stability”.69\n25. At the UN GGE’s fifth session in 2017, the 25 participating States could not reach a consensus, particularly over the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. It was reported that the US sought “clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States’ use of ICTs”, including international humanitarian law, the right to self-defence, the law of State responsibility, and countermeasures. Cuba, backed by Russia and China which similarly opposed such an explicit affirmation, argued that following the manuscript of the US would militarize cyberspace and “legitimize unilateral punitive force actions” by “States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs”. Consequently, this session concluded without issuing a consensus report.70\n26. In December 2018, the First Committee of the UNGA adopted two resolutions to continue the international discussions of norms on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace by establishing two parallel working processes: one is a new GGE sponsored mainly by the US,71 and the other is the OEWG proposed by Russia that allows all interested Member States to participate in further studying the existing rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour identified by the previous UN GGE reports. The OEWG is also mandated, “if necessary, to introduce changes to them or elaborate additional rules of behaviour”.72 As mentioned previously, China endorsed both the OEWG and the UN GGE in the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community With a Shared Future in Cyberspace released in 2020. Notably, the resolution establishing the OEWG introduces a new issue, namely, “the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives,\n69 Ibid.\n70 See, e.g., Elaine Korzak, UN GGE on Cybersecurity: The End of an Era?, The Diplomat (31 July 2017) (https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/un-gge-on-cybersecurity-have-china-and-russia-just-made-cyberspace-less-safe/).\n71 UNGA, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

In May 2021, the 2019-2020 UN GGE completed its mission by adopting a consensus final report to be subsequently endorsed by the UNGA. China is among the 25 countries from which UN GGE experts were appointed. The final report explicitly notes the applicability of international humanitarian law “only in situations of armed conflict” and recalls “the established international legal principles including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction” noted in the 2015 report. In the same paragraph, what comes alongside the reference to LOAC is the UN GGE’s recognition of “the need for further study on how and when these principles apply to the use of ICTs by States” and emphasis that “these principles by no means legitimizes or encourages conflict”.76 Simultaneously, the report provides that in their use of ICTs, States must not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State and shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN.77 The text of the final UN GGE report seems to have adopted the prudent approach of the OEWG. It also demonstrates that China has\n73 Ibid., 3.\n74 UNGA, Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States, UN Doc.

Possible explanations for China’s opposition\n28. China’s stance on the applicability of LOAC to cyberspace is still evolving with the dynamic international environment, partly explaining why Beijing has refrained from specifying rationales for its resistance to some LOAC rules and how they govern ICT-related activities. Although limited in number, several statements made by Chinese officials on international occasions shed light on this question.\n29. At the 2013 Seoul Conference on Cyberspace, HUANG Huikang, then Legal Adviser of the MOFA, underlined the overemphasis on “making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defence, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized” and “the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace”.78 At the 6th US-China Internet Industry Forum, the Chinese delegation further pointed to the numerous “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” regarding methods and means of cyber warfare, arguing for the incompetence of existing norms to address new sophisticated problems stemming from ICT development.79\n30. At the 7th US-China Internet Industry Forum in 2015, MA Xinmin, then Deputy Director-General of the Department of Treaty and Law of the MOFA, acknowledged that in principle, existing international law, including “the purposes and principles of the [UN] Charter, such as *jus ad bellum* rule of non-use of force except in self-defence or under UN Security Council’s (SC) authorization [...] and international humanitarian law among others shall be directly applicable to cyberspace.”80 However, he emphasized that applying existing LOAC rules to cyber warfare should be conducted “with great caution”, because of the lack of State practice on cyber warfare\n78 MOFA, Working Together to Build a Harmonious and Progressive International Cyberspace Order, Remarks by Dr HUANG Huikang at the Seoul Conference on Cyberspace (17 October 2013), (www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cgmb/chn/wjbxw/P020131021538048406901.doc).\n79 Statement by the Chinese Delegation at the 6th US-China Internet Industrial Forum, 2013 Chinese YIL, 666-67.\n80 MA, above n.46.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 275\nand the peculiarities of cyberspace, including many legal and technical issues, e.g., identification, tracing and establishment of State responsibility, that are yet to be solved for the application of LOAC to cyberspace.⁸¹ MA also warned of the threats of “aggravating cyberspace militarization and arms race” and the corresponding “pushing for the application of laws of war in that scenario”. He argued that the viewpoints of some States and scholars reflected in the Tallinn Manual illustrate the “military paradigm” of “response to cyberattacks that disregards the principle of non-use of force in international law but over-emphasizes such exceptions as the right to self-defence”, which “clearly does not conform to the international reality and actual needs”.⁸²\n31. In a subsequent paper, MA elaborated that the prevailing challenges States need to address are threats to cybersecurity in times of peace, most of which either are launched by non-State actors and fall under the scope of domestic law, or do not qualify as “use of force” or “armed attacks” governed by international law that apply in times of war but constitute international wrongful acts regulated by the law on State responsibility. In the latter situations, the victim State should first resort to peaceful means such as legal countermeasures or UNSC sanctions, rather than use of force. Accordingly, MA called for both further scrutiny of the applicability of existing rules of the jus ad bellum or the jus in bello to cyberspace and international lawmaking designated for the issues not addressed by these two regimes.⁸³\n32. Quasi-authoritative Chinese sources similarly argue that some Western countries attempt to militarize the Internet through insisting on applying existing rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace.⁸⁴ The Liberation Army Daily straightforwardly criticizes the US for utilizing the Tallinn Manual project to “find legal basis for its cyber warfare policies and military customs”, to maintain the dominant control of the West in cyberspace.⁸⁵\n⁸¹ Ibid., para.24.\n⁸² Ibid., paras.20, 23.\n⁸³ MA, above n.47.\n⁸⁴ See, e.g., Zhong Sheng, The United States Bears Primary Responsibility for Halting Cyber War, People’s Daily (7 February 2013) (http://cpc.people.com.cn/pinglun/n/2013/0207/c78779-20456593.html).\n⁸⁵ LI Ying, The NATO to Find Legal Basis for Manipulation of Cyberspace, Liberation Army Daily (24 October 2014) (www.chinanews.com/mil/2014/10-24/6712323.shtml).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n33. China's concern over the significant power disparity in Internet technology and cyber infrastructure between it and developed countries partly explains its long-term resistance to applying existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyber warfare prior to the adoption of the final UN GGE report. For example, the following description frequently appeared on Chinese mainstream media: \"The global Internet is built upon 13 [Internet Protocol version (IPv) 4] root servers, 10 of which, including the only key root server, are located in the US. Theoretically, this gives the US the ultimate power to destroy the entire Internet infrastructure of any country.\"⁸⁶ The deprivation of Iraq's top domain by ICANN during the Iraq war is another frequently cited supporting example.⁸⁷ To tackle the issue, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently approved establishing a DNS root server and a corresponding operating organization by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, along with a plan to upgrade the network infrastructure for the IPv6-based network and encourage large-scale adoption of the IPv6 network.⁸⁸\n34. The mainstream view of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual produced under the auspices of NATO is that: By its essence, the Tallinn Manual is not a re-statement or clarification of existing international law but involves the making of new rules on cyber warfare that reflects the distinctive practice and vested interests of the NATO members.⁸⁹ Chinese scholars also highlighted the geographical limitation in the member selection of the Tallinn\n⁸⁶ See, e.g., LI Yi, Chinese Internet, Please Keep the “Root”, Beijing Daily (24 January 2014) (http://news.sina.com.cn/pl/2014-01-22/015929310615.shtml).\n⁸⁷ LIANG, above n.30.\n⁸⁸ Xinhua, China Greenlights Establishment of Root Server, China.org.cn (8 December 2019) (http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/201912/08/content_WS5dec361ec6d0bcf8c4c1882d.html); Xinhua, China Steps up Deploying IPv6-based Network, China.org.cn (3 May 2019) (www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/03/c_138031821.htm).\n⁸⁹ See, e.g., DING Libai &amp; ZHU Jing, Tallinn Manual Defines and Reflects on Cyber Attack “Force”, 36 Hebei Faxue [Hebei L Sci] (2018), 84; HUANG Zhixiong, Application of International Law in Cyberspace: Establishing Rules of the Game, 38 Huanqiu Falv Pinglun [Global LR] (2016), 13; HUANG Zhixiong, International Legal Issues concerning “Cyber Warfare” and Strategies for China: Focusing on the Field of Jus ad Bellum, 37 Xiandai Faxue [Modern L Sci] (2015), 154; CHEN Qi, Cybersecurity, Cyber War and International Law: From the Perspective of Tallinn Manual, 7 Zhengzhi yu Falv [P Sci L] (2014), 153-56; XU Yijie, Watch Out for the “Tallinn Manual” Used by the NATO to Make “Rules of Cyber War”, 10 Zhongguo Dangzheng Ganbu Luntan [Chinese Cadres Tribune] (2013), 98-99.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 277\nManual independent International Group of Experts.⁹⁰ Critiques of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual concentrate on its *jus ad bellum* part, particularly section 2, “the use of force”. Specifically, many scholars consider that the Tallinn Manual’s threshold on what cyber operations constitute the use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is too low. In their view, the majority of the selected International Group of Experts, who are supporters of Michael Schmitt’s “scale and effects” approach,⁹¹ artificially create some situations that have never taken place to prove that cyberattacks can result in analogous scale and effects of kinetic and non-kinetic forces. A direct transplantation of existing *jus ad bellum* to cyberspace arguably goes beyond the current practice of most States.⁹² Another major concern of Chinese scholars is that, rather than regulating the means and methods of cyber warfare, the sponsors of the Tallinn Manual intend to seek legal bases to initiate cyber or even kinetic wars. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual extensively interprets a country’s right of self-defence against non-State actors and anticipatory self-defence against an imminent threat of cyber operations. They hence argue for a higher bar than the Tallinn Manual requirements for invoking the right of self-defence within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter.⁹³\n35. Given the unique features of cyber operations, it can be observed that China has been hesitant about applying specific LOAC rules to the cyber context. What are the “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” that prevent China from embracing LOAC and the Tallinn Manual at present? In the absence of any official policy, non-authoritative sources shed light on specific controversies focused on the principles of distinction and proportionality in cyberspace.⁹⁴\n⁹⁰ See, e.g., JIANG Yamin, Cyber Great Power Needs to Pay Attention to International Cybersecurity Strategies, People.com, (19 March 2015) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2015/0319/c386965-26716864.html).\n⁹¹ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 11.\n⁹² See, e.g., above n.89, DING &amp; ZHU, 85-86; HUANG (2016), 10-11; HUANG (2015), 150; CHEN, 154.\n⁹³ See, e.g., above n.89, HUANG (2016), 8-9; HUANG (2015), 152; CHEN, 154-55.\n⁹⁴ See, e.g., LI Bojun, Cyber War and the Applicability of the Law of Armed Conflict, 31 Faxue Pinglun [LR] (2013), 62-63; WANG Kongxiang, Legal Questions and Regulation of Civilian Participation in Cyber War, 5 Fazhi Yanjiu [Research on Rule of L] (2013), 100-09; CHEN, above n.89, 158; CAI Lihong, Challenges to the Principle of Distinction by Information Attacks and Strategies, 24 Xian Zhengzhi Xueyuan Xuebao [J Xi’an P Inst PLA] (2011), 95-96.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nFirst, the existence of an armed conflict permits the use of lethal force based solely on the status of an individual or object. Some Chinese scholars argue that cyberattacks, in light of the latest level of technology, are not controllable so as to constrain their effects within the boundaries of military objects and therefore indiscriminate in nature.95 The 2007 nation-wide denial-of-service attacks sweeping over Estonian Internet infrastructure, including the websites and systems of its Parliament, banks, ministries and media, was cited as a typical example of indiscriminate cyberattack,96 although whether there was an armed conflict and whether such activities amounted to attacks within the meaning of LOAC is disputable. Given such practical difficulties in applying the principle of “distinction” in cyberwar, some scholars suspect the application of LOAC will open a gate for illegitimate cyber and kinetic attacks leading to humanitarian disasters.97 For example, despite its title—“Duty of care during attacks on dams, dykes, and nuclear electrical generating stations”, Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, along with the US policy that categorizes enemy “war-sustaining” objects as lawful targets, is framed as a disguised affirmation of the legitimacy of attacks on critical, yet highly dangerous infrastructures.98 The Internet was originally designed in a way capable of being immediately transformed from war-supporting civil facilities to war-fighting objects, making the majority of its components dual-use objects. Overwhelming reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure would dramatically expand the scope of targetable objects under LOAC. Accordingly, recognizing the applicability of the LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks in cyberspace would be tantamount to authorizing attacks against critical dual-use infrastructures, rendering mass civilians vulnerable to the adverse impacts of not only cyberattacks but also kinetic ones.\nSecond, since the civilian aspect of dual-use cyber infrastructures is relevant only to the attack requirements for proportionality and precaution, the “proportionality” of attacks against objects highly dependent upon Internet or computer control systems is another worrying issue. One scholar quotes John\n95 Ibid., WANG, 107; LIANG, above n.30.\n96 Scheherazade Rehman, Estonia’s Lessons in Cyberwarfare, US News (14 January 2013) (www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/01/14/estonia-shows-how-to-build-a-defense-against-cyberwarfare).\n97 CAI, above n.94; CUI Wenbo, The Influence on Chinese Cyber Security Interest of Tallinn Manual, 15 Jiangnan Shehui Xueyuan Xuebao [J Jiangnan Soc U] (2013), 24.\n98 CAI, above n.94, 95; ibid., CUI.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 279\nHamre, former US Deputy Defense Secretary, who is skeptical about the feasibility of using cyber operations to achieve the designated military objectives, to demonstrate the unexpected collateral damages caused by cyberattacks.⁹⁹ This scholar also considers the current rule of the proportionality of attacks, which factors “the incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damages to civilian objects, or a combination thereof” into assessing whether such collateral damages would be excessive in relation to “the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”,¹⁰⁰ as inadequate protection of civilian interests and suggests adding “knock-on effects” into consideration.¹⁰¹\nThird, the distinction between civilian noncombatants and civilians who directly participate in hostilities used to be not an appealing question for Chinese scholars, not only because the Chinese military does not have a tradition of employing civilian contractors, but also because China has not sent its troops to the battlefield for more than thirty years. To reduce costs and obtain technical expertise, the increasing usage of civilians to operate cyberattacks, maintain information weapons, or support cyber combat operations by States has further eroded the distinction between combatants and civilians.¹⁰² It is reasonable for the Chinese military, government and some State-owned-enterprise to recruit civilians for activities related to cyber warfare. Although the law that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities or who adopts a continuous combat function may be lawfully attacked is not in dispute, the targetability of a civilian who assists with cyber operations depends on the answers to two questions: which people are targetable and when they may be targeted. Some Chinese scholars argue that, due to the technical predicament of identity verification and attribution, the applicable LOAC rules fail to provide certainty and predictability for the determination of individual status.¹⁰³\nFourth, another issue closely related to China’s opposition to applying some LOAC rules to cyberspace, namely, what acts may constitute a resort to\n⁹⁹ Ibid., CAI, 96, quoting from Is it Real?

Annex 1 to this Agreement defines “information war” as:\nconfrontation between two or more states in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining political, economic and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to taking decisions in the interest of an opposing party[.].¹⁰⁴\nAlthough it remains unsettled whether and when an armed conflict, international or non-international, can commence based on a single cyber exchange, the SCO Agreement’s definition of war clearly expands the traditional meaning of armed conflict caused by conventional force under LOAC. Assuming that the term “war” in Annex 1 is not utilized as rhetoric, but rather as the reference of “armed conflict” within the meaning of LOAC, we may tentatively argue that the SCO members consider the existing LOAC’s scope of regulation as underinclusive because it fails to include the cyber actions that can generate political, economic, social and even psychological consequences into the realm of LOAC.\n## III. Examining China’s perspectives on specific rules of LOAC\n36. This part examines the legal or practical grounds supporting China’s views on the four mentioned issues of LOAC. In doing so, this part presents the general contour of various opinions on specific topics, encompassing State practice, positions of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and applicable Tallinn rules. Relevant treaty provisions and judgments of international judicial bodies will be referred to, if available.\n¹⁰⁴ Annex 1 to the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (16 June 2009), List of Basic Terms in the Field of International Information Security (http://cn.io.gov.mo/Legis/International/record/1280.aspx) (Chinese only) and (https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf) (non-official English translation).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 281\n## III.A. Cyberattacks regulated by LOAC\n37. Common Article 2 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 defines an international armed conflict as any “declared war or any other armed conflict which may arise two or more States”, regardless of whether any of them recognizes the state of war. In *Tadić*, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found “an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State.”¹⁰⁵ Undoubtedly, cyberattacks accompanying any kinetic use of force fall under the sphere of LOAC. As with cyber warfare, the pertinent question is whether a single cyber exchange in the absence of any conventional use of force can trigger an international armed conflict by itself.\n38. The notion “resort to armed force” is not defined under LOAC and is easily confused with the usage of “use of force” under the *jus ad bellum*. Nevertheless, the different objects and purposes of these two regimes entail distinct legal tests of “force”. The *jus ad bellum* specifically regulates inter-State relations and States’ lawful use of force, seeking to maintain peaceful relations among nations by setting up strict conditions for invoking forceful measures, “when States may move beyond non-forceful measures such as diplomacy, economic sanctions, and countermeasures”.¹⁰⁶ By contrast, the *jus in bello* regulates the behaviour of parties to an armed conflict, and its object and purpose are to protect the military and civilian victims of war by prohibiting the harms caused by armed attacks during a conflict that are either unnecessary to effectively accomplish legitimate military objectives or excessive in relation to them.¹⁰⁷ The *jus in bello* does not govern whether the use of force is legitimate under the *jus ad bellum* but imposes restrictions on methods and means of warfare.\n39. Despite the absence of a treaty definition of the notion “armed forces” under LOAC, Article 49(1) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva\n---\n¹⁰⁵ Prosecutor v. Tadić, ICTY Appeals Chamber, Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction (2 October 1995), Case No. IT-94-1-A, para.70.\n¹⁰⁶ Michael Schmitt, “Attack” as a Term of Art in International Law: The Cyber Operations Context, in: Christine Czosseck, Rain Ottis &amp; Katharina Ziolkowski (eds.), Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (2012), 284.\n¹⁰⁷ Cordula Droege, Get off My Cloud: Cyber Warfare, International Humanitarian Law, and the Protection of Civilians, 94 IR Red Cross (2012), 545.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nConventions defines “attack” within the meaning of LOAC as “acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence”.¹⁰⁸ By concentrating on the term “violence”, Article 49(1) provides a feasible way to access cyberattacks by analogy to the physical violent effects caused by kinetic attacks. The threshold concept of “attack” is selected in light of LOAC’s object and purpose, since only acts that qualify as attacks would be subject to many of its core prohibitions and restrictions. Only qualified attacks would trigger a wide range of legal protections for the civilian population and objects under LOAC. In most cases, an unqualified act beyond the realm of LOAC would fall under the domain of domestic and international human rights law. So far, there appears to be a consensus that as long as a cyber operation attributable to a State has the equivalent effects of kinetic forces, such as death, physical injury to persons, or damages to objects, it would trigger an international armed conflict.¹⁰⁹ Similarly, Rule 30 of the Tallinn Manual suggests that the “armed force” criterion is fulfilled when a cyber operation is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to person or damage or destruction to objects.¹¹⁰ A majority of the independent experts participating in the Tallinn Manual project favour including “loss of functionality” in the definition of damages, although there are various shades of opinions among them.¹¹¹\n40. The ICRC Commentary states that the term “attack” means “combat action”, without further elaboration.¹¹² A paper written by the Head of the ICRC’s Operational Law indicates that the ICRC considers the consequence-based approach as “insufficient to capture the whole range of possible effects of cyber operations and the damage that they can cause, which will not\n108 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 49(1).\n109 Nils Melzer, Cyberwarfare and International Law, UN Institute for Disarmament Research Publications (2011), 24 (https://unidir.org/files/publications/pdfs/cyberwarfare-and-international-law-382.pdf); Michael Schmitt, Classification of Cyber Conflict, 17 JCSL (2012), 251, n.25; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (2012), 131; Droege, above n.107, 546; Knut Dörmann, Applicability of the Additional Protocols to Computer Network Attacks, ICRC Resource Centre (19 November 2004), 3 (www.icrc.org/en/doc/resources/documents/misc/68lg92.htm).\n110 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 30, 106.\n111 Ibid., 108-09.\n112 Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski &amp; Bruno Zimmermann (eds.), Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 (1987), para.1880.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 283\nnecessarily resemble the physical effects of traditional weapons\".¹¹³ Given adequate consideration to the object and purpose of LOAC and the concerns of a gap in protection, especially the protection of civilians from the effects of war, that paper seems to endorse the \"loss of functionality\" approach adopted by the majority view of the Tallinn Manual. Based on this approach, whether a cyber operation amounts to an attack depends on whether it causes the target to lose function, even if the target is not physically damaged.¹¹⁴\n41. States may support the dysfunction approach since cyber operations would be more frequently resorted, not to physically destroy or damage objects, which can be accomplished by using kinetic force, but rather to incapacitate or disrupt the normal functioning of a vital military or dual-use infrastructure.¹¹⁵ For instance, an electrical grid or water supply system might be shut down, and a country's banking or stock-trading system could be manipulated, both without any physical damage. As is demonstrated by the 2007 Estonian denial-of-service attacks, for certain civilian populations, the potential hardship arising from such dysfunction could be far more extensive or severe than the physical destruction of a particular building. Such effects might not be comparable to those caused by physical violence, but they are \"precisely the kind of severe consequences from which [LOAC] seeks to protect the civilian population\".¹¹⁶\n42. According to the dysfunction approach, cyberattacks against military or dual-use infrastructure, such as paralyzing information systems, altering or deleting processes and resources, are attacks that can trigger the application of LOAC, while applying the consequence-based approach would lead to a contrary conclusion. The applicable LOAC rule maintains that cyberattacks resulting in no physical damage are lawful.¹¹⁷ The US-EU camp intends to stay with the existing rule and has codified it in the Tallinn Manual. Although international law evolves to reflect the changing values developed by the international community, most States remain silent on this issue. Whether LOAC should expand its established interpretation of attacks depends on future State practice.\n¹¹³ Droege, above n.107, 546.\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 546-47.\n¹¹⁵ Ibid.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid., 549.\n¹¹⁷ Schmitt, above n.106, 291.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n43. Part of the SCO Agreement defines war as the “confrontation between two or more States in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes, and resources, critical and other structures”. Under this part of the definition, those confrontations that happen without any physical damages would not qualify as attacks and therefore be lawful under LOAC. The remaining part, namely, inter-State confrontations in cyberspace aimed at “undermining political, economic, and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to [take] decisions in the interest of an opposing party”, is unlikely to fall into the scope of attacks under LOAC either.\n44. On Article 49 of Additional Protocol I, the *Bothe, Partsch and Solf Commentary* underlines that attacks refer to “those aspects of military operations that most directly affect the safety of the civilian population and the integrity of civilian objects”.¹¹⁸ It would be difficult to assert that political, economic, social, or even psychological effects of cyber operations could be deemed most directly affecting the personal safety of civilians or the physical integrity of civilian objects. Dissemination of propaganda, espionage, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological or economic warfare does not fall under the concept of attack in LOAC.¹¹⁹\n45. LOAC endeavours to regulate methods and means of war and the treatments of different groups. Under LOAC, a State wants to protect its civilian population and objects, and at the same time, be able to use lethal force against the belligerent party once an armed conflict commences. An overinclusive definition of “attack” will subject the civilian population to catastrophic consequences that would have been avoided by applying the present definition with a high threshold. Such consideration partly explains why most States remain silent in the face of cyberattacks.¹²⁰\n46. The SCO Agreement’s definition of war demonstrates the six countries’ concerns of adverse impacts by acts that do not qualify as attacks and coincides with Russia’s proposal for non-proliferation of information weapons. But, unlike biological and chemical weapons, the usage of so-called information weapons does not necessarily lead to unnecessary suffering of humans\n¹¹⁸ Michael Bothe, Karl Josef Partsch &amp; Waldemar A. Solf, New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts: Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (1982), 325.\n¹¹⁹ Ibid., 289.\n¹²⁰ See, e.g., Gary Brown, Why Iran didn’t admit Stuxnet was an attack, 63 Joint Force Quarterly (2011), 71.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 285\nand might even reduce physical harm compared to the usage of conventional forces regarding the accomplishment of the same military objective. This feature of information weapons makes them not a proper subject matter for a total (or partial) ban. By their features and consequences, unqualified cyberattacks are more suitable to be regulated by regimes other than LOAC for the time being. As demonstrated by the final UN GGE report, leading SCO members, including China, Russia, and Kazakhstan, no longer dispute the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict, although controversies over, for example, the qualification of single cyber exchange as attacks under the meaning of LOAC, remain unsettled. Hence, the SCO members may continue to advance the broad interpretation of “attack” to build up consensus for new norms while resisting the application of the existing LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks.\n## III.B. Dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities\n47. As a “cardinal principle”¹²¹ of LOAC, the principle of distinction requires that a distinction be made between military and civilian persons and objects and prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. Article 52(1) of Additional Protocol I defines “civilian objects” in a negative manner as “all objects which are not military objectives”.¹²² Military objectives are those “by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage”.¹²³ According to Rule 39 of the Tallinn Manual, an object cannot be civilian and military simultaneously; its status is either one or the other.¹²⁴ Therefore, the entire dual-use object becomes a military objective from the moment it is used for military action, even if its military use is only “marginal” compared to its civilian use. Such observation represents today’s prevailing view on the qualification of dual-use objects as targetable military objectives.¹²⁵\n¹²¹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, 257, para.78.\n¹²² Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 52(1).\n¹²³ Ibid., Art. 52(2).\n¹²⁴ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 39 and its Commentary, para.1.\n¹²⁵ See Droege, above n.107, 562; Michael Schmitt, The Law of Cyber Targeting, Tallinn Paper No.7 (2015), 11.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n48. From the perspective of civilian protection, the “potentially non-lethal nature of cyberweapons”¹²⁶ draws concerns over an “expanded target list”¹²⁷ and an obscured assessment of the legality of an attack. In a world where a large part of civilian infrastructure and services are highly reliant on international cyber infrastructure, including the Internet, servers, routers, cables, satellites, and computers, the danger of loss of function, partial damage or complete destruction is evident. For example, approximately 98% of US government communications use civilian-owned and civilian-operated networks.¹²⁸ Under LOAC, belligerent parties can easily target cyber infrastructure as military objectives because mere containing, storing, or transmitting a tiny percentage of military data would render the entire infrastructure a legitimate target.\n49. Several scenarios of consequences of attacks against dual-use cyber infrastructure entail humanitarian concerns for civilian protection. The past decade witnessed the increasing use of cloud computing, the users of which are usually unaware of which server their data is stored on and whether military data is stored on the same server. Cyberspace is an artificial battlefield, where, unlike natural theatres of war, such as land or airspace, travelling military data or weapons (e.g., malware, botnet, or malicious codes) can make not only itself a legitimate target but also the transmitting infrastructure a military objective. It can be a computer system, a communication network, a server or router, a major cable, a satellite, or in the worst case, the entire Internet network system.¹²⁹\n50. The Tallinn Manual provides that “the circumstances under which the Internet in its entirety could be attacked [are] so highly unlikely as to render the possibility purely theoretical at the present time”, and that “virtually any attack against the Internet would have to be limited to certain discrete segments thereof”.¹³⁰ Nevertheless, it also acknowledges that “it may be impossible to know over which part of the network military transmissions, as distinct\n126 Jeffrey T.

Kelsey, Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principle of Distinction and Neutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare, 106 Michigan LR (2007-2008), 1439.\n127 Eric Talbot Jensen, Unexpected Consequences from Knock-on Effects: A Different Standard from Computer Network Operations, 18 Am U ILR (2003), 1149.\n128 Eric Talbot Jensen, Cyber Warfare and Precautions against The Effects of Attacks, 88 Texas LR (2010), 1534.\n129 See, generally, Droege, above n.107, 562-65.\n130 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 39 and its Commentary, para.5.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 287\nfrom civilian ones, will pass. In such cases, the entire network (or at least those aspects in which transmission is reasonably likely) qualifies as a military objective.”¹³¹\n51. In the physical world, the irrelevance of dual-use objects’ civilian part regarding the principle of distinction is no longer in dispute. In cyberspace, the broad interpretation might lead to extreme situations where nothing civilian remains. More importantly, being a military objective will incur not only attacks in cyberspace but also fatal kinetic attacks. As a result, the fundamental rule that civilian population and objects enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations becomes an empty shell, leaving such situations only subject to protection under the principles of proportionality and precaution.\n52. Almost all States and legal commentators agree that the element of “make[s] an effective contribution to military action” in Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I includes a contribution towards “war-fighting” or “war-supporting” capabilities of the belligerent party.¹³² War-fighting objects refer to those used in combat, while war-supporting objects are what military operations rely on in some “relatively direct sense”.¹³³ In the cyber context, typical war-supporting objects are factories producing hardware or software or other kinds of information weapons,¹³⁴ all of which qualify as military objectives. Controversy on this element concentrates on the “war-sustaining” object policy of the US, which has been adopted by a few States so far.¹³⁵ The majority of Tallinn Manual independent experts refused to include war-sustaining objects into military objectives due to the remote relationship between them and military operations.¹³⁶\n53. The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations of the US extends the expression of Article 52(2) to “effectively contribute to the enemy’s war-fighting or war-sustaining capability”.¹³⁷ The term “war-sustaining” encompasses objects within “an economy or governmental financial system”\n¹³¹ Ibid., para.3.\n¹³² Schmitt, above n.125.\n¹³³ Ibid.\n¹³⁴ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n¹³⁵ Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n¹³⁶ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n¹³⁷ Department of the Navy and Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, NWP 1-14M/MCWP 5-12.1/COMDTPUB P5800.7A (July 2007), para.8.2.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nrelied on by the enemy to fund participation in the conflict.¹³⁸ For instance, the revenue from cotton export during the US Civil War enabled the Confederate States to finance and therefore sustain its war.¹³⁹ Contemporary examples are oil industries of the terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Shams, whose funding of war relied on revenues from oil exports.¹⁴⁰ The rationale behind the war-sustaining approach in the sense of traditional warfare is that the destruction of certain economic objects that are not absolutely “indispensable to civilian survival”, yet currently protected under LOAC, would shorten a conflict and therefore reduce the potential casualty toll and generate societal changes.¹⁴¹\n54. The different effects of cyberattacks and kinetic ones might make cyberattacks against war-sustaining objects more effective in achieving the expected military goal. Using cyber operations to paralyze the infrastructure upon which a central banking system is built, or delete funds from accounts, or change account balances, or manipulate the stock market, will lead to a collapse of the enemy’s confidence. According to the applicable law, many of such cyber operations may not even qualify as attacks under LOAC. Despite the unique advantage of cyberattacks, the military advantage of cyber operations on war-sustaining objects might be indefinite and difficult to articulate.¹⁴² Critiques of war-sustaining objects within the sphere of traditional warfare can apply indiscriminately to cyberspace. There would be no limits to warfare, providing that substantially the entire economy of a country can be considered as war-sustaining.¹⁴³ Consequently, a much broader scope of military objectives that include the enemy’s research and development capabilities would devastate the humanitarian values upheld by the principle of distinction.\n55. To sum up, the Chinese scholars’ view that applying some existing rules of LOAC to cyberspace would potentially “open a gate for humanitarian\n138 Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n139 US Naval War College, Annotated Supplement to the Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations (1997), 400, n.11.\n140 Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n141 See Charles J. Dunlap, The End of Innocence, Rethinking Noncombatancy in the Post-Kosovo Era, 28 Strategic R (Summer 2002), 9.\n142 US Department of Defense Office of General Counsel, An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations (May 1999), 8 (https://fas.org/irp/eprint/io-legal.pdf).\n143 Droege, above n.107, 568.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 289\ndisasters” is reasonable, given that attacks against dual-use infrastructure are currently lawful in most cases. Unless there is a breakthrough in law, attacks against major cyber infrastructure would remain subject to the legal safeguards for civilian protection embodied in the principles of proportionality and precaution. As with Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, targeting highly dangerous infrastructure, such as dams, dikes, and nuclear electrical generating stations, violates the established rule enshrined in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I, which explicitly prohibits targeting listed infrastructure even if they constitute military objectives.\n56. Some may argue that, instead of denying the existing law, a government should assume its responsibility to ensure that military data or weapons do not taint civilian facilities. Unfortunately, the present level of technology and the indiscrepable relationship between civilian and military components in global cyberspace holds little promise for such complete separation.\n57. Another alternative proposal pertinent to the Chinese scholars’ argument is to expand the list of “works and installations containing dangerous forces” in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I by analogy so that critical cyber infrastructure could not be made targetable objects.¹⁴⁴ But the hurdle for adequate State support for this effort remains high. It would be difficult to convince States that the potentially nonlethal effects of attacks on cyber infrastructure could be made comparable to that of radioactive materials leak or flood.\n58. China has never embraced the “war-sustaining” approach. As demonstrated by the SCO Agreement’s definition of war, China’s perception of threats to the safety and normal functionality of its cyber infrastructure is more oriented towards cyber operations below the threshold of attacks under LOAC. In other words, a lower bar of attacks capable of triggering the application of LOAC is demanded. Meanwhile, the Chinese scholars who expressed concerns over allowing attacks against dual-use and war-sustaining objects under LOAC might want to remove these objects from LOAC’s list of legitimate military objectives. To simultaneously realize the objectives of the SCO members and the mentioned Chinese scholars would require any cyber operations falling under the SCO Agreement’s definition to only attack objects exclusively used for military purposes and dual-use objects that are neither highly dangerous nor counted as cyber infrastructure. Such handling\n¹⁴⁴ Robin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann, Cyber Warfare: Applying the Principle of Distinction in an Interconnected Space, 45 Israel LR (2012), 390.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nmight significantly reduce the legitimate functioning space for cyberattacks and prevent them from doing what they are best at, namely, accomplishing military advantage precisely without causing non-reversible damages of critical civilian infrastructure and having the potential to stay non-violent and reduce collateral losses. Such consequences turn out to be contrary to the humanitarian intentions of these Chinese scholars to reduce the harms suffered by victims of war.\n## III.C. Proportionality of cyberattacks against infrastructures\n59. Given that the interconnectedness of military networks and their heavy reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure has left the principle of distinction virtually empty of contents, the principle of proportionality becomes an ultimate rule for protecting civilian persons and objects. This principle prohibits attacks “which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.145 In light of the harsh challenges imposed by the unique features of cyber warfare, the actual role that the principle of proportionality can play could not be overstated.\n60. Under LOAC, what can be considered as “excessive” incidental damage to civilian objects in comparison with the expected concrete and direct military advantage remains controversial. The principle of proportionality is “more easily stated than applied in practice”. As a matter of fact, findings of excessive incidental damage to civilian infrastructure are very few and far between as compared to the military advantage.146 Moreover, the proportionality assessment in LOAC is made ex-ante when expected collateral damage is weighed against the anticipated military damage.147 The practical difficulties in ascertaining the expected effects of cyber operations prevent commanders from precisely assessing the potential collateral damages to civilian objects. How to apply this principle in cyberspace hinges on the development of both legal interpretation and technology, the uncertainty of which may jeopardize\n145 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 51(5)(b).\n146 ICTY, Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (13 June 2000), para.19 (www.icty.org/x/file/Press/nato061300.pdf).\n147 Schmitt, above n.125, 19.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 291\nthis principle’s ability to prevent significant collateral damages to civilian objects in cyber warfare.\n61. In the digital era, incidental damages to civilian objects will no longer be limited to physical ones but also the loss of functionality of civilian cyber infrastructure. Therefore, in order to accommodate the special needs of cyber warfare, several opinions calling for modifications of the assessment of “collateral damages to civilian objects” have emerged. For example, it is suggested that more weight should be given to temporary consequences regarding cyberattacks, for the temporary incapacity of critical systems would incur more severe consequences than mere inconvenience, such as in situations where loss of life may be caused by the inability of hospitals to communicate vital information.¹⁴⁸ But existing LOAC fails to provide any legal basis for this. The paradoxical applicable law is described as:\nwhereas the destruction of a single civilian car would amount to legally relevant, albeit rather insignificant, ‘collateral damage’, the disconnection of thousands or millions of households, companies and public services from the Internet or other communication services, or the severance of online financial transactions for a country’s entire economy and the corresponding economic and societal effects as such would not count as relevant elements to be factored into the proportionality calculus.¹⁴⁹\n62. Similarly, some scholars propose to include “knock-on effects” of cyber-attacks in the proportionality calculations when such an effect would not have occurred “but for” the attack.¹⁵⁰ “Knock-on effects” refer to those generated by the initial effects of the attack.¹⁵¹ Both the 1990-1992 Gulf War and the NATO action in the former Yugoslavia illustrate that the knock-on effects of targeting electricity grid may cause more harm to the affected civilians than the direct effect of these attacks themselves.¹⁵² Although existing law has not touched upon this issue, most scholars seem to agree that knock-on effects\n¹⁴⁸ Oona Hathaway, et al., The Law of Cyber-Attack, 100 California LR (2012), 851.\n¹⁴⁹ Geiß &amp; Lahmann, above n.144, 397.\n¹⁵⁰ Michael Schmitt, Heather Harrison Dinniss &amp; Thomas C.

Commentary to Rule 51 of the Tallinn Manual includes both direct and indirect effects of attacks in the proportionality assessment.[154] The former means “the immediate, first-order consequences, unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms”, and the latter refers to “the delayed and/or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms”. Without deliberately using the same term, the Tallinn Manual adopts the “knock-on effects” approach, factoring “any indirect effects that should be expected by those individuals planning, approving, or executing a cyberattack” into the proportionality evaluation.[155] Such indirect effects can be exemplified by accidents involving transportation systems or malware inserted into a military computer system spread to other civilian computer systems and thereafter disables them, where those risks are or should have been expected. Such indirect effects may result from blocking the Global Positioning Satellite data or disrupting the Global Positioning System.[156] Inconvenience, irritation, stress, or fear caused by cyber operations are explicitly excluded from collateral damages to civilian objects.[157]\n64. The Chinese scholars' view on the theoretical and practical difficulties in applying the present law on proportionality concurs with the mainstream view among international law commentators. The Tallinn Manual's rules and commentaries on this principle are early attempts to codify the prevailing treaty interpretation, contributing to an enhanced relief valve of attacks against critical cyber infrastructure. The Chinese scholars' critiques of Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, which permits attacks against highly dangerous infrastructure, were not made in conjunction with Rule 51, becoming an interpretation out of context. The proportionality assessment under existing law disillusions those who wish to use it to make up for the failure of rules regarding the principle of distinction in protecting civilian safety. If the applicable LOAC rules regarding the principles of distinction and proportionality remain unchanged, the principle of precaution would be the only safeguard left.\n153 Schmitt, above n.150.\n154 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 160, para.6.\n155 Ibid.\n156 Ibid.\n157 Ibid., para.5.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 293\n## III.D. Targetable civilians\n65. Article 51(3) of the Additional Protocol I¹⁵⁸ and Article 13(3)¹⁵⁹ of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts provides that, if civilians engage in conducts amounting to “direct participation in hostilities”, their protection against direct military attacks would be suspended. In cyber warfare, “for such time” as civilians directly participate in hostilities, they not only become legitimate targets of military operations but also are bound by LOAC rules governing the conduct of hostilities. Furthermore, such civilians should not be factored into the proportionality calculation. They are not considered for the principle of precaution that aims to avoid or minimize incidental harm to civilians.¹⁶⁰\n66. Civilians may be targeted for direct participation in hostilities. Currently, given the complexity of this issue, there is no authoritative guidance on which activities qualify as direct participation.¹⁶¹ The present State practice, the jurisprudence of international judicial bodies and prevailing academic views adopt a case-by-case determination method through exemplification rather than illustration.¹⁶² To address when civilians may be targeted, the ICRC sponsored a five-year research project in 2003 and produced its *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law* (“Interpretive Guidance”).¹⁶³\n67. In this document, the ICRC proposes three “constitutive elements” of direct participation in hostilities: (1) an act that negatively impacts the enemy’s military effort, or in which harm is intended (threshold of harm); (2) a relatively direct nexus between that act and the resulting harm, or that act constituting an “integral part” of a coordinated military operation likely to cause the said harm (direct causation), and (3) linkage to the armed conflict\n---\n158 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 51(3).\n159 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, 1125 UNTS 609 (7 December 1978), Art. 13(3).\n160 Melzer, above n.109, 27.\n161 Michael Schmitt, Deconstructing Direct Participation in Hostilities: The Constitutive Elements, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 699.\n162 Ibid., 705-09.\n163 ICRC, Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law (prepared by Nils Melzer) (May 2009) (www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n(belligerent nexus).¹⁶⁴ Although these criteria were generally accepted, the Interpretive Guidance has drawn strong criticism from scholars.¹⁶⁵ These scholars argued that it is both underinclusive as to improperly exclude some forms of direct participation and overinclusive as to incorrectly permit attacks against some civilians and civilian property.¹⁶⁶\n68. There is no reason to distinguish cyber operations from kinetic operations regarding how civilian conducts qualify as direct participation in hostilities, as most controversies are not cyber-specific. Critiques of the Interpretive Guidance in conventional warfare do not necessarily stand in cyberspace. According to the “threshold of harm” element, an act amounting to hostility does not have to qualify as an attack within the meaning of LOAC, which indispensably entails the infliction of death, injury, or destruction on military personnel and objects. “Essentially any consequence adversely affecting the military operations or military capacity” of an opposing party would satisfy the test.¹⁶⁷ Compared to the difficulties in arming civilians with traditional weapons, the technical barrier to cyber armed civilians is almost non-existent. It is too easy for civilians to have the know-how to conduct harmful cyber activities.¹⁶⁸ Therefore, in cyber warfare, “the pool of targetable individuals could be extremely large in future conflicts, far more than is the case in classic conflict.”¹⁶⁹\n69. Espionage activities, including gathering and disseminating intelligence of military tactics and operations by cyber means, or hacking into the enemy system to identify enemy vulnerabilities, would both suffice. Engaging in developing cyber defence systems, such as encryption technology, firewalls or anti-virus software, also falls under this category. However, the element of “direct causation” defines them as causing only “indirect harm” because such individual conduct “merely builds up or maintains the capacity of a party to\n164 Ibid., 46.\n165 See, i.e., Kenneth Watkin, Opportunity Lost: Organized Armed Groups and the ICRC “Direct Participation in Hostilities” Interpretive Guidance, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 641-95; Schmitt, above n.161, 697-740; Bill Boothby, “And for Such Time as”: The Time Dimension to Direct Participation in Hostilities, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 741-68; W.

Nevertheless, the unique features of cyber warfare demand particular attention paid to certain issues in cyberspace. Commentators questioned the rationality of the ICRC's interpretation of the term \"for such time\" when a direct participant can be targeted.172 The ICRC provides that this period covers preparatory measures of a specific act of direct participation, deployment to or return from the activity concerned.173 They argued that the restrictive interpretation has dramatically narrowed the window of targetability, rendering this standard particularly impractical in cyber warfare.174 There is usually no deployment to or return from cyber operations since most of them are controlled remotely.\n71. More importantly, the duration of cyber operations can be extremely short, sometimes even too brief to identify the attacker.175 Or, in some cases, for example, a surreptitiously emplaced logic bomb, the effect of cyber operations can be long-delayed.176 A better approach is suggested to cure this deficiency:\nTo characterise an individual who engages in multiple cyber operations that are part of an on-going cyber campaign as a direct participant targetable throughout the period of activity. Once the individual definitively withdraws from participation, he or she regains their protection from attack, and not before.177\nThis approach seems more promising but might still lead to scary consequences. For civilian computer operators working in closed military facilities,\n170 Above n.163, 53.\n171 Michael Schmitt, Cyber Operations and the Jus in Bello: Key Issues, in: Daria P.

As the debate continues, any resolution must grant sufficient consideration to the safety of civilians.\n72. Cyber warfare also presents peculiar questions to the controversy over which members of an organized armed group are targetable between the ICRC and the NATO members. Members of organized armed groups are the other category of civilians that are legitimate targets of military operations.^[178]^ According to the Interpretive Guidance, only those with a “continuous combat function” can be attacked.^[179]^ The NATO members and Israel favour including all members of a group formed to conduct hostilities.^[180]^ These countries criticize the requirement of “continuous combat function” as affording greater protection to members of organized groups than members of the armed forces, whereas the former enjoy no right to engage in hostilities while the latter does.^[181]^ In the human-made theatre in cyberspace, where distinguishing members of organized armed groups from civilians can be far more difficult and uncertain than on physical battlefields, the additional requirement of ensuring that a member performs “continuous combat function” seems impractical and unnecessary. After all, LOAC’s presumption of civilian status in the case of doubt has offered adequate protection for such members.^[182]^\n73. At first sight, the Chinese scholars’ view tends to see the problem as a practical one of attribution and verification rather than one of law. Nonetheless, such difficulties give rise to debates about legal issues specific to cyber warfare. To the degree that the targetability of civilians is concerned, the critiques of the Interpretive Guidance mainly stem from practical difficulties, before or at the moment of targeting, in distinguishing members of armed groups or civilians directly participating in hostilities from civilians.\n74. For capacity-building or -maintaining conduct that involves espionage or development activities by cyber means, it would be premature to argue that China is willing to waive its right to attack civilians that severely harm its military operation or capacity. But given its general defensive stance on security\n178 Melzer, above n.109, 29.\n179 Above n.163, 71.\n180 See Michael Schmitt, The Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities: A Critical Analysis, 1 Harvard Nat’l S J (2010), 21-24.\n181 Schmitt, above n.171, 100.\n182 Additional Protocol I, above n.100, Art. 50(1).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 297\nissues, China is neither likely to embrace the broader approach that covers such “indirect” conduct. If China ends up agreeing with the applicability of LOAC rules on this issue, it might favour the ICRC’s restrictive standard of “for such time” and “continuous combat function”, not only because of China’s defensive rather than offensive approach to the use of force, but also because of its humanitarian considerations to protect the lives of a large number of civilians relate—occupationally to activities that have a bearing on military operations, or personally to someone occasionally carrying out conduct of hostilities—from lethal attacks.\n75. For the purpose of civilian protection, the better approach for States turns out to be recruiting only military personnel, ideally with uniforms and other distinctive marks, for military operations by cyber means. While accessible in theory, the transformation of non-State cyber actors into national forces would be time-consuming. As a reminder, the privateers were not completely abandoned by States until the time when the maritime powers had developed strong navies, which were capable of forcing the armed merchants who refused to integrate into the navy to put down their weapons in exchange for State protection on the high seas and defeating privates and enemy fleets.^[183]^\n## IV. The objectives of China’s normative proposals\n76. Based on its limited number of available official statements and practices, China’s opposition to the applicability of some LOAC rules in cyberspace remains vague and general from a legal perspective. The SCO Agreement’s expansive version of cyber “war” indicates that China’s earlier position did not distinguish armed conflicts from other situations, although the application of LOAC hinges on such a differentiation. Apart from the catchall interpretation of cyberattacks, many Chinese scholars expressed concerns over the adequacy of the LOAC rules governing the targetability of dual-use infrastructure and certain groups of civilians and the principle of proportionality. These concerns are not groundless both in terms of law and practice. In fact, the ICRC’s views on the three issues, or even some corresponding rules of the Tallinn Manual, address their concerns well. The practice of the US and its allies that China opposes has not hardened into customary international law binding on all\n^[183]^ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering: A Historical Analogy, Cyber Studies Programme Working Paper No. 1 (March 2015), 3-6, 9 (www.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/cybersecurity-and-the-age-of-privateering-a-historical-analogy.html).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nStates that fail to maintain persistent objection to it. These facts have contributed to China's incremental acceptance of the general applicability of LOAC to the cyber context despite many remaining controversies over how specific LOAC rules should be interpreted and applied to cyber operations.\n77. As with China's concerns over the Tallinn Manual's overemphasis on the military paradigm of responses to cyberattacks in international legal discourse, which threatens to derogate from the principle of non-use of force and to abuse the right to self-defence, a more diverse group of experts was composed to draft the second version of the Tallinn Manual, to address the criticisms of the limited diversity of the group of experts participating in drafting the first version of the Tallinn Manual[184] and this group's overreliance on Western legal sources.[185] There were three non-Western experts from China, Belarus and Thailand, among the nine experts who participated in the formulation process of Tallinn Manual 2.0.[186] The scope of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 expands from \"above the threshold\" cyber operations whose \"scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force\"[187] or which are \"executed in the context of an armed conflict that [is] subject to the LOAC\"[188] to \"below the threshold\" cyber operations that take place in peacetime and fall outside the regulatory scope of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello.\n78. The threshold of use of force functions as a firewall that separates cyber operations which can trigger the exercise of the right to self-defence by a victim State from cyber operations that can entail only pacific countermeasures. As previously mentioned, a major concern of China points to the Tallinn Manual's threshold on which cyber operations constitute use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The Chinese perspective considers it as a low standard intended to accommodate some States' strategic\n184 Dieter Fleck, Searching for International Rules Applicable to Cyber Warfare—A Critical First Assessment of the New Tallinn Manual, 18 JCSL (2013), 335; Ido Kilovaty, Cyber Warfare and the Jus ad Bellum Challenge: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, 5 Am U Nat'l S L Brief (2014), 108.\n185 Kirsten E.

Rule 69 and Rule 71 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were drafted by the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual and incorporated in the second version without being discussed by the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Rule 69 stipulates the “scale and effects” approach.¹⁸⁹ Rule 71 provides that only “a State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence”.¹⁹⁰ The International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual reached a consensus that the scale of effects of cyber operations causing physical consequences can be considered as comparable to those of kinetic operations and hence the use of force under the *jus ad bellum*.¹⁹¹ But they contested over the status of cyber operations that have no consequences in the physical world but can lead to serious consequences.¹⁹²\n80. Some Western scholars identified the failure of Rule 69 to include cyber operations having no physical consequences but can cause temporary suspension of operational functionality,¹⁹³ result in alteration and destruction of data or code,¹⁹⁴ or involve “psychological operation” and “cyber espionage”,¹⁹⁵ as a major shortcoming of the Tallinn Rules.¹⁹⁶ Accordingly, they considered the definition of “use of force” adopted by the Tallinn Rules\n189 Ibid.\n190 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, Rule 71, 339.\n191 See, e.g., Ido Kilovaty, Virtual Violence-Disruptive Cyberspace Operations as “Attacks” Under International Humanitarian Law, 23 Michigan Telecomm &amp; Tech LR (2016), 145-46.\n192 See above n.184, Fleck, 336-37; Kilovaty, 116.\n193 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, 21; Michael N.

Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice, 112 AJIL (2018), 590.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nas “narrow”, blaming the experts for their overreliance on “a consequence-based gravity test in the jus ad bellum”.¹⁹⁷ In addition to the perceived narrow prohibition against the use of cyber force, they considered the Tallinn Rules’ construction of the right to self-defence as even narrower, given the significant difficulties in establishing causal links between multiple consequences and a cyber operation added to the difficulties of attributing a cyber operation to a State or a non-State actor.¹⁹⁸ Although the notion of anticipatory self-defence, which has long been a concern of China and an old controversy in the international law circle with a new incarnation, was adopted in the Tallinn Rules,¹⁹⁹ the practical difficulties in detecting the preparations for launching a cyberattack and further determining whether a cyberattack is imminent render the requirements for resorting to using force on the ground of anticipatory self-defence highly demanding.²⁰⁰\n81. Consequently, the victim State’s response in most cases would be limited to measures falling below the threshold of use of force, such as countermeasures²⁰¹ or referring the matter to the UNSC.²⁰² By far, the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Rules have identified only the Stuxnet attack as meeting the Tallinn threshold of use of force; some experts considered it as meeting the higher “scale and effects” threshold of an armed attack that can trigger the application of LOAC.²⁰³ Even American military lawyers and scholars, who are deemed by their Chinese counterparts as seeking to militarize cyberspace through lowering the threshold of use of force, have admitted that, “the prevailing view is that most, if not all, documented cyber actions taken by States to date have fallen below the ‘use of force’ threshold.”²⁰⁴ Apart from the narrowly construed right to self-defence in situations of armed conflicts, Rule 20 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides a broader right of States to take countermeasures in time of peace, “whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal\n197 Ibid.\n198 Ibid., 591.\n199 Above n.21, Tallinn Manual, Rule 15; Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 73.\n200 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, 351-53; Eichensehr, above n.185, 587.\n201 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, Rule 20, 161.\n202 Ibid., Rule 76, 357.\n203 Ibid., 342.\n204 Gary Corn &amp; Eric Jensen, The Technicolor Zone of Cyberspace–Part I, Just Security (30 May 2018) (www.justsecurity.org/57217/technicolor-zone-cyberspace-part/).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 301\nobligation that is owned by another State”.²⁰⁵ Nevertheless, the exercise of this right by States is subject to similar difficulties in attribution, in addition to a set of conditions, including notification, proportionality,²⁰⁶ and the exclusion of measures amounting to uses of force.\n82. The narrow construction of the right to self-defence and countermeasures under the Tallinn Rules demonstrates the reluctance of the International Group of Experts to permissibly authorize a State to undertake unilateral acts that would result in effects in the territory of another State, in another word, a strong pro-sovereignty inclination of the Tallinn Rules. In contrast, the US and the UK argued that sovereignty did not by itself constitute a specific rule of international law that cyber operations might violate, but rather a foundational principle of international law that undergirds specific rules of international law, such as the prohibition against the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the rule of non-intervention under customary international law. In these two countries’ view, such a principle has no binding effect, and low-scale cyber operations deployed by a State that generate effects in another State’s territory but do not breach any of these specific rules, do not violate international law merely because of their incompatibility with the abstract principle of sovereignty.²⁰⁷ This controversy over the status of sovereignty remains unsettled in the final UN GGE report mainly due to the UK’s active participation in the UN GGE. Yet NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations released in 2020 has endorsed the status of sovereignty as a rule of international law in a footnote, with the UK as the only NATO member having reserved on that footnote.²⁰⁸\n83. Therefore, although the Tallinn Rules were developed under the auspices of NATO, they represent neither the exceptional perspectives of some States such as the US or the UK nor the collective views of the NATO members. Throughout the Hague Process, during the drafting of the Tallinn Rules, where legal advisors from 50 States were given the opportunity to\n205 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, Rule 38, 111.\n206 Ibid., 120, 127.\n207 As noted in: Michael Schmitt, US Transparency Regarding International Law in Cyberspace, Just Security (15 November 2016) (www.justsecurity.org/34465/transparency-international-law-cyberspace/); also Corn &amp; Jensen, above n.204.\n208 North Atlantic Treaty Organization Allied Joint Publication-3.20, Allied Joint Doctrine For Cyberspace Operations (Edition A Version 1) (29 January 2020), Footnote 26 and GBR’s Reservation (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/899678/doctrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nexpress their legal positions to shape the codification process, many States maintained a persistent policy of silence and ambiguity on the specificities of existing or emerging norms regulating cyberspace.²⁰⁹ Meanwhile, the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, together with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, convened two consultative meetings in April 2015 and February 2016 with representatives from more than one hundred States, including China.²¹⁰\n84. The technological difficulties in credibly attributing responsibility for cyber operations, the ongoing controversies over which existing rules apply to cyberspace, their contents, the suitability of the prevailing international legal framework as the primary method to regulate inter-State behaviour in cyberspace, and political and strategic considerations that have prevented States from making public attributions and invoking their rights to take responsive measures, all have contributed to the “wait and see” approach adopted by most States towards utilizing rules and norms of international law, including the Tallinn Rules, to regulate cyber operations.²¹¹ These factors cast doubt over the ripeness of codifying applicable international law in these areas. The limited State practice and opinio juris partly explain China’s “wait and see” stance, which is in line with the mainstream approach in order to preserve a degree of operational flexibility in the face of technological development and the dynamic international environment.²¹²\n85. To summarize, China’s long-term insistence on the non-applicability of the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules to cyberspace does not only conform to the development trend of international normative discourses but also contributes to fuelling this momentum. Sovereign control of cyberspace has been increasingly reviving, and the focus of international legal discourse has shifted from the military paradigm concentrated on the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to the prism of general rules of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. The current landscape of international law identification and development reflects and underpins most concerns of China\n209 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 588.\n210 HUANG, above n.186, 84-85.\n211 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 584, 588, 633, 639, 648, 653 (2018).\n212 See, e.g., ZHU Lingling, Deduction and Development of State Responsibility Attribution in Cyber Attacks from the Perspective of Tallinn Manual Version 2.0, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 77-78; HUANG Zhixiong, New Trends of International Rule-making for Cyberspace: Some Considerations Based Tallinn Manual 2.0, 1 Xiamen Daxue Xuebao [J Xiamen U] (2018), 5-6.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 303\nand many other like-minded States, while the Tallinn Rules serve as one of the early efforts rather than the concluding remark of ongoing international legal discourses.\n86. However, there are two residual concerns of China not reflected in the mainstream State practice following the publication of the two versions of the Tallinn Manual. They are underscored by the elements of cyber sovereignty proposed by China that call for the prohibition of using ICT, information and communications networks to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression or arms race, and the OEWG resolution's reiteration of the need for introducing additional rules of behaviour regarding States' right to combat interference in their internal affairs through the dissemination of false and distorted news and States' duty to abstain from engaging in such activities. One is external threats posed by more powerful States which may utilize their digital advantages to threaten China's national security and social stability, and the other is external limitations, either from emerging norms of international law or other established powers, of China's exercise of regulatory power over content transmitted in cyberspace to combat such threats.\n87. Therefore, in addition to the mentioned concerns addressed by the mainstream State practice, China has employed its generalized and vague resistance to the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace as bargaining leverage to achieve another two objectives in international legal discourse: (1) to build up consensus for a new treaty regulating all use of cyber forces, or a disarmament treaty banning all or at least some types of information weapons, and (2) to block the formation of new law that would limit its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace and prevent disfavoured existing law from binding on its exercise of sovereign power in cyberspace.\n## IV.A. A disarmament treaty &amp; national security\n88. The first objective of China's opposition to an explicit affirmation of the right to self-defence and the applicability of some LOAC rules to the cyber context, namely, to build up consensus for a disarmament treaty on the use of information weapons under the auspice of the UN, emanates from the nature of States' right to self-defence. It is an inherent right reserved for States to\nChinese JIL (2021)\nresort to force by its own decision after the enshrinement of a general prohibition of uses of force in the UN Charter.²¹³\n89. As evidenced by the controversies over anticipatory self-defence in the drafting processes of the Tallinn Rules, diverse concepts and practices regarding the preconditions for the commencement of self-defence and the limitations to the exercise of this right have been invoked and contested by States. Whether Article 51 of the UN Charter allows anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defence before an armed attack occurs has long been a major point of contention. The US, the UK, Israel and some other States have construed Article 51 in a permissible manner by referring to the Caroline doctrine under customary international law, based on which they have often resorted to force. The UNSC has condemned some of such practices; the International Court of Justice took the restrictive view in the judgments of the Corfu Channel case,²¹⁴ the Nicaragua case,²¹⁵ and other decisions afterwards.²¹⁶ The restrictive approach limits States' right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter to situations where an armed attack has already taken place, excluding anticipatory self-defence. From the perspective of the degree of compliance, the effectiveness of the general prohibition of use of force is questionable. But none of these States supporting permissive interpretations dares to bluntly admit the existence of a violation or defy this universally accepted rule, although they always use various factual and legal arguments to justify their breaches.\n90. In the same vein, it is not practically feasible to ensure effective observance of a norm prohibiting use of force in cyberspace, especially by these States that are frequent invokers of anticipatory self-defence. Therefore, what China and other SCO members seek is rather to influence the norm-formulation process at the UN that reflects how the international community of States characterizes a situation or act in question, e.g., as a violation of the proposed norm, and whether most States have a willingness to suppress such dubious acts. In the interim, China has not come up with a clear and concrete stance on how to develop a standard resembling Article 2(4) and Article 51 of the UN Charter in judging the legality and legitimacy of State behaviour concerning use of cyber force. More importantly, concluding new treaties for\n213 UN Charter, 1 UNTS XVI (24 October 1945), Arts. 2(4).\n214 Corfu Channel Case (UK v.

Cyber disarmament is more unrealistic in today's international political environment than the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in light of the recent backlashes against the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons provoked by the Iran and North Korea nuclear crises. All nuclear-weapon States except China, which abstained, voted against a UNGA resolution proposing to convene the first UN conference aimed at achieving a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons.²¹⁷ On 22 January 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first multilateral agreement that bans nuclear weapons, entered into force. Although 85 States have signed and 50 of them have ratified this treaty, the non-participation of all nine States possessing nuclear weapons renders the efficacy of the treaty questionable.²¹⁸ Additionally, as manifested by Cuba's objection to an endorsement of the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, the States that do not enjoy conventional military superiority over their adversaries may have asymmetric advantages in cyberspace, which they are reluctant to give up.²¹⁹ Therefore, a cyber disarmament treaty would lack the support of both major cyber powers and the rest of the weaker cyber-armed States.\n92. In the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures in 2013 and the WikiLeaks disclosures lasting from mid-2016 to date, a rising trend of nationalism has taken place in many countries that used to stand in line with the US-EU camp, such as Brazil and Germany, pushing these countries to start thinking how to defend their \"data sovereignty\". The rise of cybersecurity nationalism has undermined international norm-making efforts, including trade negotiations between the EU and the US and the US attempts to promote norms of Internet freedom globally.²²⁰ There is no reason that cybersecurity discourse would stay intact.\n²¹⁷ Tariq Rauf, 2017: The Year in Which Nuclear Weapons Could be Banned?, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Commentary (20 March 2017) (www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2017/2017-year-which-nuclear-weapons-could-be-banned).\n²¹⁸ See generally, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (22 January 2021) (www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-on-the-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons/).\n²¹⁹ Arun M.

Given the unique features of cyber operations and the Internet, even a treaty in the style of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons would have little practical significance in deterring the abuse and misuse of force in cyberspace. The refrainment of most States, including the US, in most cyber tensions with other States, from resorting to the prevailing international legal framework in dealing with inter-State cyber relations, highlights the limitations of normative approaches in functioning as a general taboo for irresponsible activities in cyberspace by not only State but also private actors.\n94. Compared to conventional and nuclear weapons, the technical barriers to entry in cyber warfare are so low that non-State actors and countries that are conceivably weak by the standards of hard powers can play a significant role on par with powerful countries at low levels of cost. Cyberattacks can be conducted by any actor having an electronic device and connected to the Internet. The interconnectivity of the network enables any actor to stay geographically remote from where they commit cyberattacks. Simultaneously, unlike classic military operations that rely upon territorial linkages, this interconnectivity severely decreases the degree of State control over actors and activities. The life of a treaty, particularly a disarmament treaty, rests in its enforcement. The construction of a credible monitoring and enforcement mechanism would prove to be the utmost hurdle for a cyber disarmament treaty.\n95. Probably having realized the lack of feasibility and political will among States to negotiate a cyber disarmament treaty, China has softened, to some degree, its stance against the alleged militarization of cyberspace. In the most up-to-date white paper on China's military strategy issued in 2015, China plans to \"expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defence [...] so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability\".[221] The ISCC further confirms that \"enhanced defence capability in cyberspace is an important part of China's endeavour to modernize its national defence and armed forces\",[222] while restricting China's development of a cyber force to defensive capability.[223]\n221 State Council Information Office, China's Military Strategy (May 2015), Chapter IV: Building and Development of China's Armed Forces (www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-05/26/content_20820628_4.htm).\n222 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n223 Ibid., Chapter I: Opportunities and Challenges &amp; Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 307\n## IV.B. Sovereign control over the Internet vs non-intervention\n96. The changes in the global context of disarmament and China's position regarding use of force in the cyber context have rendered the proposed second objective of China more salient. The central bone of contention in the normative competitions between the SCO members and the Western powers rests upon whether information and data transmitted in cyberspace shall be made subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State, although both sides have reached a consensus on the applicability of sovereignty as part of international law in cyberspace. At the core of this debate is how to draw the lines between the realms of domestic law and international law as consensual erosion of State sovereignty to be applied equally to all States.\n97. The US holds the view that, although sovereignty gives a State the right to control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory, the exercise of such jurisdiction by the territorial State, encompassing the use and access to the Internet, must comply with that State's obligations under applicable international law, particularly international human rights law. While noting that the freedom of expression may be restricted in situations such as the incitement of imminent terrorist violence, the US considers \"certain censorship and content control, including blocking websites simply because they contain content that criticizes a leader, a government policy, or an ideology, or because the content espouses particular religious beliefs\" as constituting State violations of international human rights law.²²⁴\n98. China likely views this reference to international human rights law as a pretext for Western attempts to conceptually undermine the scope of sovereign powers by narrowing the content of *domaine réservé* in the context of Internet governance. China claims for cyber sovereignty that includes not only cyber infrastructure within its territory but also its jurisdiction over data and the regulation and monitoring of the content of information flowing over cyberspace.²²⁵ Consciously aware that the scope of a State's internal matters and the international legal limitations to that State's exercise of sovereign power over internal matters evolve over time, China has consistently resisted non-reciprocal and non-voluntary restrictions on its exercise of sovereignty.\n²²⁴ Egan, above n.45, 15-17.\n²²⁵ See, e.g., National Security Law of the People's Republic of China (2015), art. 25; XI Jinping, Keynote Speech at the opening ceremony of the 2nd World Internet Conference (16 December 2015) (www.wuzhenwic.org/2015-12/16/c_47521.htm).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n99. From Beijing's perspective, the nature of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as a product formulated under the domination of Western powers was not changed solely by the increased diversity in the composition of the International Group of Experts participating in the drafting process, because the newly-added matters reflect foremostly Western perspectives and concerns. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 does not touch upon the sovereignty of a State over potential data; it only mentions sovereign power over any cyber infrastructure located within States' territory and activities associated with that cyber infrastructure. Similar problems exist in the Tallinn Rules concerning jurisdiction, which overwhelmingly emphasize the limitations imposed by international human rights law to the exercise of sovereignty in cyberspace.²²⁶\n100. In the domestic sphere, China invokes cyber sovereignty to underpin its regulation over data and information in cyberspace. As shown in the SCO Agreement's wording of \"mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to take decisions to the interest of an opposing party\", China is always wary of potential foreign interference. The propaganda and liaison roles played by online social networking servers, such as Facebook and Twitter, in the \"Arab Spring\" that led to social unrest, political turmoil and regime-changes in Northern African and Western Asian countries, and the exposure of the massive surveillance by the US National Security Agency in the PRISM program have strengthened the Chinese conviction of the need for Internet censorship to block and filter information in cyberspace that is harmful to China's social stability and national security.²²⁷ In the trend of the global revival of cyber sovereignty, China strengthens its sovereignty-based regulatory power by referring to similar censorship practices of other States, such as the US, Australia, Italy, Germany, France, the UK, and Korea that once held opposing views, regarding the information about terrorism, incitement to hate crimes, pornography, violence and other crimes involving the usage of the Internet.²²⁸\n101. In the international sphere, China has employed cyber sovereignty as a shield against some Western States' attempts to compel it to change the\n²²⁶ HUANG, above n.212.\n²²⁷ HUANG Zhixiong, Regulation of Cyber Information: A Component Implicitly Covered by Cyber Sovereignty, 3 Guojia Zhili [Nat'l Governance Wkly] (2016), 33-34.\n²²⁸ Xinlian, From the US to Australia: How States Regulate the Internet, China Daily (17 May 2016) (http://world.chinadaily.com.cn/2016-05/17/content_25321844.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 309\ncurrent model of Internet governance by either resorting to non-legal advocacy for Internet freedom or invoking relevant international law, especially the rules of international human rights law on the right to freedom of expression, association, and the media, and the right to access to information. Google's withdrawal from the Chinese market in 2010 was a representative example of the former means where a leading multinational company threatened the Chinese government for a policy change under the instructions of some Western countries.²²⁹ Additionally, the Chinese government has been alarmed by soft law norms applicable in peacetime that are proposed by some Western countries, such as relevant code of conduct on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace at the 2016-2017 UN GGE meetings. Such non-binding norms are intended to circumvent the advocacy of Russia and China to formulate new rules to regulate State behaviour regarding cybersecurity in the form of a treaty at the forum of the UN and may gradually harden into binding law.²³⁰\n102. This argument likely explains why Cuba, Russia and China refused to explicitly affirm the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law in the cyber context in the 2017 UN GGE report, while having accepted the general applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace since the publication of the 2015 UN GGE consensus report. The crucial factor that prevented these States from reaching a consensus with the Western countries was the opposing camp's intention to introduce \"clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States' use of ICTs\"²³¹ in the UN GGE report, which threatened to restrict States' right to regulate the content of and access to information. The UN GGE report is a non-binding statement, but it may serve as proof of State practice and *opinio juris* in ascertaining whether certain international law applies to a participating State signing onto the consensus report and the extent to which the included law limits the endorsing State's right to regulate domestic affairs. Although these countries have recognized the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict upon the adoption of the final UN GGE report, residual disagreements over how specific LOAC rules apply to ICT-related activities remain prominent between them and the Western countries.\n²²⁹ HUANG, above n.227, 34.\n²³⁰ HUANG Zhixiong, Norms of Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace: Origin, Impact and Response, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 68-69.\n²³¹ Korzak, above n.70.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n103. The law governing the right to self-defence and means and methods of warfare is dominated by the practice of remarkably few established powers because the major ground of resorting to anticipatory self-defence and a large portion of LOAC is customary international law, which has been developed by these “specially affected” States to advance their interests.²³² For newly rising powers such as China, failing to meet the requirements of “persistent objector” before and after the birth of a rule at concern would not relieve their obligation to comply. A successful example where a contrary practice of a large number of weaker States makes a few powerful States switch from an established rule of customary international law to an emerging new rule is rare.²³³ It is extremely difficult for a militarily disadvantaged State that lacks field experience to replicate such a strategy in areas involving force.\n104. To prevent coercive erosions of its sovereignty, China’s strategy is to embed a firewall at the most representative and democratic lawmaking forum to obstruct the convenient transplantation of power disparity from the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to the special regimes of international law that constitute cornerstones of an evolving global system of Internet governance. A treaty negotiated at a more egalitarian forum such as the UNGA would enable the Chinese perspectives to carry greater weight in forming international law among a large number of similarly disadvantaged countries. And lawmaking in the form of treaty allows a less advanced State such as China to pick and choose elastically from treaties and their provisions according to its goals.\nV. Conclusion\n105. To summarize, the above analyses suggest that behind China’s general and vague opposition to an explicit affirmation of the applicability of specific LOAC rules to cyberspace and the right of self-defence in cyberspace is China’s profound concern that doing so would acquiesce to the encroachment of its sovereignty and unlock Pandora’s box of coercive external interferences with its independence in determining the mode of domestic Internet governance and the path of development.\n106. Has China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and digital economy driven it to pursue a more proactive and enterprising approach to reshaping international law governing the domain of cyber\n²³² Alan Boyle &amp; Christine Chinkin, The Making of International Law (2007), 28-29.\n²³³ Ibid., 29.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 311\nwarfare so as to build up a competitive advantage against the established powers? At first glance, Beijing's long-term resistance to confirming the applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace before the adoption of the final UN GGE report, amid the exaggerated normative rivalry between the Russia-China Camp and the US-EU Camp, appeared to corroborate this argument. However, closer scrutiny reveals that, the conceptual generalization and ambiguity in China's resisting stance stems from the same premises underpinning the mainstream \"wait and see\" approach of most States towards utilizing international law as the primary means to regulate or justify their cyberoperations. Following the \"wait and see\" trend of State practice, China has agreed to the general applicability of the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello*, and law on State responsibility for international wrongful acts, but still resists the applicability of some specific rules in cyberspace, e.g., the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules, to allow for flexibility in responding to cyber technology development in attribution and the evolvement of international law.\n107. Despite the recent developments in its cyber defensive capacity, China remains disadvantaged as a rising power with weaker military capacity and less normative influence. China's normative proposals, exemplified by the ICCIS, serves more as bargaining leverage to protect itself from being bound by the existing or emerging law supported by the established powers, but unfavourable to itself, and also to move the focus of international legal discourse from the paradigm of military responses to cyberattacks concentrated in the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to that of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. China's normative efforts are largely defensive, given that Beijing chooses to prioritize its interests in defending against possible use of force either triggered by an alleged cyberattack or carried out in the means of cyber operations, over its offensive interests in staying less constrained in the use of cyber force.\n108. Because of the special features of how existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* were made, the normative influence of China and its SCO allies is not sufficient, at this moment, to change the practice of the frequent users of force, to come up with a norm promising effective observance by these States, or to veto the formation of new law proposed by these States at concern. The return of sovereign control in cyberspace and the focus shift of international legal discourse result from a set of factors, e.g., the limitations of current technologies and existing law, with the normative efforts of the SCO members having contributed to this global trend.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n109. But these countries can still resist the imposition of non-consensual norms upon themselves in the domain of cyberspace, obstruct the codification of disfavoured norms, and influence how other States characterize and respond to a situation involving cyber operations. This is why the seemingly unfeasible idea of an international cyber disarmament treaty concluded under the framework of the UN remains on the table. The UNSC's monopoly of authorizing the use of force and the UNGA's feature as one of the most egalitarian forums for international lawmaking make the UN the favourable forum relied on by rising powers such as China to build resilience against other lawmaking processes where established powers play a greater role, e.g., the development of customary international law or soft law in less representative forums.",

This article argues that China’s resistance to applying some rules of the *jus in bello* to cyberspace is in line with the “wait and see” approach of most States.

Introduction\n1. International law is a generator and a product of the changing global order.

To what extent and how the rise of a new great power will influence international law largely hinges upon the interaction between the rising power and the established powers that have dominated international legal discourse for centuries. The perspectives of China and the established powers differ substantially on many issues, especially those relating to sovereign equality, non-intervention and national security. This can be exemplified by China's perspectives on many issues of cyber warfare in the normative rivalry between the United States (US)-European Union (EU) Camp and the Russia-China Camp, which are competing to influence the making of international law, as well as other countries' domestic policies.\n2. Through the International Code of Conduct for Information Security (ICCIS) first submitted to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2011 and joint efforts in other forums such as the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT), the Russia-China Camp has advanced a sovereignty-based model of Internet governance, which respects cyberspace sovereignty and State independence and legitimizes domestic efforts\nReinterpreting the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and Military Intervention for Humanitarian Purposes, 6 Asian JIL (2016), 114.\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 259\nto regulate the content of and access to information. The US-EU Camp strives to maintain the currently dominant multi-stakeholder model governed by diverse stakeholders, including governments, technical communities, the private sector and other civil society members. It does not accept the ICCIS, especially the domestic regulation on freedom of expression and association and the move towards greater sovereign control in cyberspace.\n3. Notably, China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and the digital economy, especially following the 2008 global financial crisis, did not initially bolster its assertiveness in the international lawmaking procedures that seek to identify existing law or generate new law applicable to State behaviour in cyberspace. China was a low-key participant at the early stages of the UN Group of Government Experts on the Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of Security (“UN GGE”). Its behaviour was found to be passive and frequently concurring with Russia’s stance. The Chinese representatives attending earlier UN GGE meetings were technical officers from the Ministry of Communication rather than diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign affairs (MOFA). But later, China proved to be willing to act more actively and assertively when it was singled out and its fundamental domestic interests were threatened by the disfavoured norms proposed by the established powers.\n4. In reaction to these Western normative attempts, China has transformed from a low-profile, passive team player under the Russian leadership to a proactive actor that had formed its own agenda. China’s active pattern of behaviour was prompted by a 2010 speech by Hillary Clinton, former US Secretary\n ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(a), (c), (d), (f).\n US Office of the Secretary of Defense, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2013 (May 2013), 37 (https://fas.org/man/eprint/dod-china-2013.pdf); European Parliament Resolution of 22 November 2012 on the Forthcoming WCIT-12 of the International Telecommunications Union, and the Possible Expansion of the Scope of International Telecommunication Regulations, P7_TA(2012)0451 (22 November 2012), para.5 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52012IP0451).\n US Department of State, International Cyberspace Policy Strategy (March 2016) (per Public Law 114-113, Division N, Title IV, Section 402), 16-18 (https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/255732.pdf).\n Ibid.\n As noted in: Adam Segal, Chinese Cyber Diplomacy in a New Era of Uncertainty, Aegis Paper Series No. 1703, Hoover Institution (2017), 5-6 (www.lawfareblog.com/chinese-cyber-diplomacy-new-era-uncertainty-0).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nof State, that criticized China for limiting the freedom to access the Internet and conducting online censorship. Higher-level officials from the MOFA with expertise in cyber governance started to represent China in diplomatic activities. The ICCIS was developed to counter-balance the diplomatic momentum generated by a series of US activities, including Clinton’s speeches on freedom in cyberspace between 2010-2012, the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the 2011 Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace. Beijing viewed these activities as attempting to militarize cyberspace and maintain the dominance of the US in cyber governance by interfering in other States’ sovereign right to regulate cyberspace.\n5. In 2011, the first edition of the ICCIS was submitted two months before the London Conference, a United Kingdom (UK)-sponsored attempt in line with those of the US and their allies. The ICCIS called on States “not to use information and communications technologies (ICTs), including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies”, called for “peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security”, and emphasized “the important role of the UN in formulating international norms”. An updated edition of the ICCIS with similar wording was circulated at the UNGA in 2015, possibly intended to gather wider support in the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures that harmed the US’s credibility in its continuous diplomatic attempts.\n6. The second World Internet Conference in 2015 marked the emergence of China’s own vision of global Internet governance that advocates both respect for sovereignty in cyberspace and international cooperation to “jointly build a community of shared future in cyberspace”. Chinese President XI Jinping highlighted the problems of the current global Internet governance system, including, among other things, the inadequate existing rules governing cyberspace that hardly reflect the perspectives of the majority of countries,\n As noted in ibid., 6.\n Ibid., 4-5, 7.\n ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(b), (j).\n International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the Letter dated 9 January 2015 from the Permanent Representatives of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russia Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations Addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

One proposal explicitly called on all countries to work together to “contain the abuse of information technology, oppose cyber surveillance and cyberattacks and reject arms race in cyberspace” and “push for the formulation of international cyberspace rules accepted by all parties as well as an international convention against terrorism in cyberspace, improve the legal assistance mechanism to fight cybercrimes and jointly uphold peace and security in cyberspace”.\n7. The vision of “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” was further elaborated by the Organizing Committee of the World Internet Conference in 2019. It urged countries to oppose hostile activities, acts of aggression, cyberattacks, large-scale surveillance operations, unfounded accusations of cyberattacks against other countries and attempts to politicize cybersecurity issues; prevent arms race and military conflict in cyberspace; and remain committed to resolving disputes by peaceful means. In 2020, the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace was released amid the COVID-19 pandemic that underpinned the urgency of “achieving shared development, ensuring common security, realizing joint governance, and enjoying benefits”. This document emphasized the need to “exert the roles of the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) and the UN GGE, and support formulating codes, norms and principles of responsible State conduct in cyberspace that are acceptable to all parties under the UN framework”.\n8. To assess the implications of China’s rise for the evolution of international law governing the use of force by States in cyberspace, this paper studies the normative initiatives and strategies employed by China in identifying rules of existing law and creating new law applicable to cyber warfare.

Special attention is paid to legal controversies over the rules on cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities, the proportionality of cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and the targetability of certain categories of civilians. Part IV examines the rationales behind China's generalized normative proposal and its vague refusal to confirm the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello, while having recognized the general applicability of these two regimes to cyberspace. The last part concludes with a tentative assessment of the nature and the degree of China's normative influence over international lawmaking governing State behaviour in cyberspace and the possible momentum of China's policy in the future.\n## II. China's general stance on applicable law governing cyber warfare\n## II.A. China's sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance\n9. On 1 March 2017, the MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration jointly issued the first international cyber policy paper of China—the International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (ISCC)—to comprehensively introduce and explain Beijing's policy and position on issues of cyber-related international affairs. At his daily press briefing following the release, the UN Secretary-General Spokesman Stéphane Dujarric described the ISCC as “a very important report” and suggested that “China has a big role to play” in global cyber governance. The linchpin of China’s cyber diplomacy is the idea of cyber sovereignty, around which China formulates its cybersecurity policies towards three primary objectives. The first is to protect its critical information infrastructure, cyber sovereignty, national security and domestic stability from threats posed by digital power disparity among countries, cybercrimes and cyber terrorism, and external interference with China’s internal\n Statement by Ambassador FU Cong in the Assembly Meeting of the UN Conference on Disarmament on International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (9 March 2017) (www.china-un.ch/eng/hom/t1444602.htm); also MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration, International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (1 March 2017) (www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zzjg_663340/jks_665232/kjlc_665236/qtwt_665250/t1442390.shtml) [hereinafter “ISCC”].\n Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General (2 March 2017) (www.un.org/press/en/2017/db170302.doc.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 263\naffairs. The second is to shape the current global Internet governance and promote the formation of a system of international legal norms in China's favour. The third objective is to convert China's increasing cyber capacity into soft power to mobilize and influence other countries' preferences. Chapter II lays out the three elements of China's proposed idea of cyber sovereignty—regulatory authority, non-interference and sovereign equality, and the security-oriented balanced approach.\n10. The appeal for cyber sovereignty by China and other like-minded countries takes place at a time when governments' sovereign power over cyberspace is in decline for many reasons, including but not limited to the privatization of cyberspace, the rise of non-State actors and the digital gap between the developed and developing countries. As evidenced by the first and second editions of the Tallinn Manual providing that \"a State may exercise control over cyber infrastructure and activity within its sovereign territory\", sovereignty in cyberspace is not a revisionist idea by itself. According to the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Manual 2.0, this premise, which was confirmed by the 2013 Report of the UN GGE, is now \"relatively well accepted by the international community\". The US and its allies have held out to this idea in order to sustain the current platform governed by multi-stakeholders under their control.\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\n11. It is noteworthy that, among all the technical communities developing the \"law\" of the Internet and managing the global distribution of Internet resources in terms of naming and addresses, the ISCC exclusively named the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and urged the international community to \"make [ICANN] a truly independent international institution, increase its representations and ensure greater openness and transparency in its decision-making and operation\". ICANN has been a highly politicalized organization. It is a Californian corporation created by a 1998 Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Commerce to transfer the power to manage and oversee the domain name system (DNS) coordination from the US government to the global community. This agreement was supposed to terminate on 30 September 2000, while subject to further amendments. The US government did not end its supervision until October 2016, mainly in response to the calling of major Internet technical organizations for freeing ICANN from unilateral oversight of the US as a backlash from the Snowden Disclosures. Yet, it is early to tell whether the globalization of ICANN can be genuinely realized, given that most of its key infrastructures remain in the US territory. The deprivation of the top domain of Iraq, \".iq\", by ICANN in the Iraq war under the undue influence of the US government, the Snowden Disclosures, and the \"Vault 7\" documents released by WikiLeaks have demonstrated the capacity and motivation of the US to abuse its dominant position in global Internet governance under the current multi-stakeholder model.\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 265\n12. The label “multi-stakeholder” was only applied to ICANN in the wake of the battles over Internet governance initiated by national governments, which are treated as “stakeholders” on an equal footing with private corporates and members of civil society, during and after the World Summit on the Information Society, as political rhetoric to mobilize non-State actors to help resist governmental interference into Internet governance and to simultaneously make the established self-governance model more palatable to States and the UN system. ICANN is a global Internet governance organization possessing monopoly power over the DNS, but it is only subject to the sole jurisdiction of the US under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law. Due to the anticipated objection of the US, to put ICANN under the oversight of the international community of sovereign States proves difficult to attain. And an equivalent alternative to ICANN would be not only costly but also highly disruptive for Internet users.\n13. Aside from open participation, ICANN is not subject to any classic form of internal accountability that commonly exists in private corporations and nonprofit organizations, such as direct accountability mechanisms based on membership or shareholders in the Regional Internet Registries and the open, bottom-up, consensus-based standardization process of the Internet Engineering Task Force. Although ICANN self-identifies as championing the bottom-up, consensus-driven, multi-stakeholder model of governance, its policy-making processes manifest a top-down hierarchy, in which issues raised from the grassroots level end up as policy recommendations to be voted at the Board of Directors. The Board has “near-absolute” power over the bylaws governing the entirety of processes and can “untrammeled[ly]” decide whether to accept these recommendations in the absence of any binding forms of appeal or review. While anyone can join most of ICANN’s volunteer Working Groups to express their views and have the views considered based\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\non merits in the consensus-driven dialogues, “all decision making authority rests solely and exclusively in the hands of a Board of Directors.” Moreover, the Board governs the DNS through private contracts with domain name registrars and registries. The critical details and implementations of these contracts are negotiated bilaterally between ICANN and the registrars/registries, largely beyond the influence of general policies developed in the bottom-up representative processes. To summarize, ICANN seems to employ open participation as a substitute for other missing and more effective accountability mechanisms.\n14. In the ISCC, China advocates shifting from the present multi-stakeholder model of global Internet governance to a multilateral State-centric model. In the latter model, a wide range of actors are encouraged to make their respective contributions based on their capacity in the multilateral decision-making processes led by governments, particularly regarding public policies and security. China favours the UN as the principal forum to coordinate positions of various parties and build international consensus, while other international mechanisms and platforms are called on to complement based on their comparative advantage. The establishment of “multilateral, democratic, and transparent international Internet government systems” is listed as a major goal in the Thirteenth Five-Year-Plan for China’s economic and social development from 2016 to 2020.\n## II.B. International normative discourses\n15. The fundamentally divergent approaches to global Internet governance have driven China and the US to contrasting views on the adequacy of existing international law to address cybersecurity issues. The US and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies insist that prevailing\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 267\ninternational law, including the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello* and relevant rules concerning State responsibility for international wrongful acts apply to cyberspace, and that the existing international legal framework is adequate to accommodate novel situations in the information age.\n16. China’s position on the adequacy of existing international law had not crystalized until the 2013 UN GGE meeting. Since then, China has accepted, in principle, the general applicability of relevant international law to cyberspace. Despite this, China has maintained that international lawmaking is demanded to address the issues that are not clearly dealt with by existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, as parallel paths to further study the applicability of these two regimes’ established rules to cyber warfare from the perspectives of “maintaining international security, strategic mutual trust and preventing cyber conflicts”.\n17. Although the 2017 ISCC is not written in legal language, it calls for “formulating universally accepted international rules and norms of state behaviour in cyberspace within the framework of the UN” towards the ultimate goal of a “rule-based” global governance system in cyberspace. Rather than using the word “codifying”, China opted for “formulating” and emphasized the universal acceptance of rules by countries. This wording reveals China’s reluctance to recognize the applicability of some *already existing* rules of international law to cyberspace, mainly because of the under-representation of developing countries in global cyber governance. In its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the Chinese government also stated that it would “take an active role in formulating international rules in areas such as the Internet”.\n The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World (May 2011), 9 (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf); also Brian J.

In its efforts to achieve these objectives, Beijing has been increasingly active in various multilateral lawmaking forums, particularly major UN platforms such as the UNGA, UN GGE, the UN Expert Group on Combating Cybercrime and International Telecommunication Union. For example, along with the promotion of the concepts of cyber sovereignty and “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” at the World Internet Conference, a State-run annual international forum focusing on the development, use and governance of the Internet, underlying elements of these concepts have also been advocated in China’s Position Paper at the UNGA since 2014 to maintain the momentum and build consensus. These elements include: (1) peaceful use of cyberspace for economic and social development; (2) objection to cyber war and arms race; (3) the development of an international code of conduct for cyberspace under the UN framework that is acceptable to all, such as the two versions of the ICCIS; (4) strengthened international cooperation to combat cybercrimes such as cyber terrorism; and (5) objection to any country’s attempt to overstretch the concept of national security to restrict ICT development and cooperation among other countries or to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs.\n19. Additionally, issue-specific normative initiatives such as the Global Initiative on Data Security and the Comments and Recommendations of China to the 4th Meeting of the UN Open-ended Inter-governmental Expert Group on Cybercrime have also been advanced to gain prominence among\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 269\nagenda items within the UN system. These comprehensive and issue-specific normative initiatives unfold the usage of issue linkage under China's overall scheme of the legal framework governing cyberspace, under which the issues of the development and use of the Internet, cyber and data security, cybercrimes, cyber governance and cyber warfare that transcend different fields of international law are simultaneously placed on the agenda of international lawmaking to keep this bundle of issues at the frontline.\n20. In light of the digital divide between the developed and developing countries and the inequitable order of the existing international legal system, China has been aligning normative efforts at regional and South-South forums such as the BRICS, Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO), the ASEAN Regional Forum, China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in support of lawmaking activities at the UN. The progress China has made in enhancing agenda-shaping and coalition-building capacities can be exemplified by the agenda item of \"International Law in Cyberspace\" proposed by China for the 53rd Annual Session of the AALCO and the data security cooperation initiative signed between the Arab League and China.\n21. Meanwhile, bilateral normative discourses between China and other major powers are ongoing, aiming to figure out common interests and build up consensus for future international lawmaking. Among these, the most\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\nnoticeable landmark is an agreement reached by the US and China in 2015 over mutual refrain from knowingly conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property and further efforts in identifying and promoting appropriate norms of State behaviour in cyberspace.57 The first US-China Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue in 2017 once signalled a possibility for greater cooperation.58 However, since 2018, the deterioration of these countries' bilateral relations has stagnated confidence-building measures towards further coordination and cooperation.\n22. In the context of cyber warfare, the US position is that existing LOAC, including its principles of distinction, necessity, and proportionality, applies in cyberspace.59 By contrast, China, Russia, and other SCO members have not agreed to the US stance and played a rival role. In the 2013 Report of the UN GGE, China and Russia managed to exclude any reference to the applicability of international humanitarian law principles in cyberspace, despite the controversial affirmation of the applicability of \"international law\" and the UN Charter.60 The 2015 UN GGE Report explicitly \"notes\" the possible applicability of \"the established international legal principles, including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction\", while cautiously avoiding making any reference to international humanitarian law.61 The wording of this text fails to clarify whether the UN GGE reached a consensus on the applicability of these LOAC principles to cyber activities or merely noted their existence. Moreover, although the 2015 UN GGE Report mentions the prohibition on the threat or use of force against any State's territorial integrity or political independence,62 it does not refer to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks amounting to use of force as an exception to such general prohibition. Instead, this UN GGE similarly\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 271\n\"noted the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter\", which arguably encompasses the right to self-defence according to most Western countries.^[63]^\n23. Without an explicit official position, Beijing's stance on many occasions has been found to be general yet frequently in line with Russia's efforts to negotiate an international arms control treaty on the use and non-proliferation of information weapons.^[64]^ For example, the 2011 ICCIS proposes \"not to use ICTs, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies\", and calls for \"peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security\".^[65]^ In the updated ICCIS circulated at the UNGA in 2015, the controversial terms of \"proliferate information weapons\" is omitted, and the original paragraph is replaced by \"not to use ICTs and information and communications networks to carry out activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security\".^[66]^\n24. The ISCC pronounces China's consistent opposition to certain countries' \"Cold War Mentality\" in characterizing international relations in cyberspace as a \"zero-sum game\" and abusing the predominant position in global Internet governance to secure advantages by militarization and deterrence build-up in cyberspace.^[67]^ By calling the international community to adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, particularly non-use of force and peaceful settlement of disputes, the ISCC articulates the idea of upholding peace through international cooperation and safeguarding a country's own security that underpins \"common security\" of the international community of States \"on the basis of full respect for other countries' security\".^[68]^ Specifically, the ISCC proposes that \"all countries must oppose ICT-backed acts of hostility and aggression, prevent arms race and conflicts in cyberspace and settle disputes through peaceful means\"; China plans to work with other countries to \"curb the abuse of information technology and prevent arms race\n^[63]^ Ibid., para.28(c).\n^[64]^ As noted in: John Markoff and Andrew E. Kramer, US and Russia Differ on a Treaty for Cyberspace, NY Times (27 June 2009) (www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/world/28cyber.html).\n^[65]^ ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(b), (j).\n^[66]^ Above n.13.\n^[67]^ ISCC, above n.17, Chapter II: The Principle of Peace, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n^[68]^ Ibid., Chapter II: The Principle of Peace.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nin cyberspace”. While the ISCC discourages militarization of cyberspace, China plans to enhance its “defense capability in cyberspace” and “expedite the development of a cyber force” with the aim to “prevent a major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security and maintain national security and social stability”.69\n25. At the UN GGE’s fifth session in 2017, the 25 participating States could not reach a consensus, particularly over the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. It was reported that the US sought “clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States’ use of ICTs”, including international humanitarian law, the right to self-defence, the law of State responsibility, and countermeasures. Cuba, backed by Russia and China which similarly opposed such an explicit affirmation, argued that following the manuscript of the US would militarize cyberspace and “legitimize unilateral punitive force actions” by “States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs”. Consequently, this session concluded without issuing a consensus report.70\n26. In December 2018, the First Committee of the UNGA adopted two resolutions to continue the international discussions of norms on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace by establishing two parallel working processes: one is a new GGE sponsored mainly by the US,71 and the other is the OEWG proposed by Russia that allows all interested Member States to participate in further studying the existing rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour identified by the previous UN GGE reports. The OEWG is also mandated, “if necessary, to introduce changes to them or elaborate additional rules of behaviour”.72 As mentioned previously, China endorsed both the OEWG and the UN GGE in the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community With a Shared Future in Cyberspace released in 2020. Notably, the resolution establishing the OEWG introduces a new issue, namely, “the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives,\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 273\nthe dissemination of false and distorted news, which can be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of other States or as being harmful to the promotion of peace, cooperation and friendly relations among States and nations”.73 The US criticized this resolution’s language borrowed from a controversial 1981 UNGA resolution that declares the duty of a State to “abstain from any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other States”.74 Meanwhile, Russia positioned itself as an advocate for democracy for all UN Member States, given the exclusive club nature of the UN GGE.75\n27. In May 2021, the 2019-2020 UN GGE completed its mission by adopting a consensus final report to be subsequently endorsed by the UNGA. China is among the 25 countries from which UN GGE experts were appointed. The final report explicitly notes the applicability of international humanitarian law “only in situations of armed conflict” and recalls “the established international legal principles including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction” noted in the 2015 report. In the same paragraph, what comes alongside the reference to LOAC is the UN GGE’s recognition of “the need for further study on how and when these principles apply to the use of ICTs by States” and emphasis that “these principles by no means legitimizes or encourages conflict”.76 Simultaneously, the report provides that in their use of ICTs, States must not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State and shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN.77 The text of the final UN GGE report seems to have adopted the prudent approach of the OEWG. It also demonstrates that China has\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\naccepted the applicability of LOAC to cyberspace during an armed conflict while leaving controversial issues of how specific LOAC rules apply to the use of ICTs for further discussions, such as whether cyber-only exchanges can trigger an armed conflict, the scope of cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, the targetability of certain objects in the ICT context, etc.\n## II.C. Possible explanations for China’s opposition\n28. China’s stance on the applicability of LOAC to cyberspace is still evolving with the dynamic international environment, partly explaining why Beijing has refrained from specifying rationales for its resistance to some LOAC rules and how they govern ICT-related activities. Although limited in number, several statements made by Chinese officials on international occasions shed light on this question.\n29. At the 2013 Seoul Conference on Cyberspace, HUANG Huikang, then Legal Adviser of the MOFA, underlined the overemphasis on “making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defence, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized” and “the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace”.78 At the 6th US-China Internet Industry Forum, the Chinese delegation further pointed to the numerous “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” regarding methods and means of cyber warfare, arguing for the incompetence of existing norms to address new sophisticated problems stemming from ICT development.79\n30. At the 7th US-China Internet Industry Forum in 2015, MA Xinmin, then Deputy Director-General of the Department of Treaty and Law of the MOFA, acknowledged that in principle, existing international law, including “the purposes and principles of the [UN] Charter, such as *jus ad bellum* rule of non-use of force except in self-defence or under UN Security Council’s (SC) authorization [...] and international humanitarian law among others shall be directly applicable to cyberspace.”80 However, he emphasized that applying existing LOAC rules to cyber warfare should be conducted “with great caution”, because of the lack of State practice on cyber warfare\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 275\nand the peculiarities of cyberspace, including many legal and technical issues, e.g., identification, tracing and establishment of State responsibility, that are yet to be solved for the application of LOAC to cyberspace. MA also warned of the threats of “aggravating cyberspace militarization and arms race” and the corresponding “pushing for the application of laws of war in that scenario”. He argued that the viewpoints of some States and scholars reflected in the Tallinn Manual illustrate the “military paradigm” of “response to cyberattacks that disregards the principle of non-use of force in international law but over-emphasizes such exceptions as the right to self-defence”, which “clearly does not conform to the international reality and actual needs”.\n31. In a subsequent paper, MA elaborated that the prevailing challenges States need to address are threats to cybersecurity in times of peace, most of which either are launched by non-State actors and fall under the scope of domestic law, or do not qualify as “use of force” or “armed attacks” governed by international law that apply in times of war but constitute international wrongful acts regulated by the law on State responsibility. In the latter situations, the victim State should first resort to peaceful means such as legal countermeasures or UNSC sanctions, rather than use of force. Accordingly, MA called for both further scrutiny of the applicability of existing rules of the jus ad bellum or the jus in bello to cyberspace and international lawmaking designated for the issues not addressed by these two regimes.\n32. Quasi-authoritative Chinese sources similarly argue that some Western countries attempt to militarize the Internet through insisting on applying existing rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace. The Liberation Army Daily straightforwardly criticizes the US for utilizing the Tallinn Manual project to “find legal basis for its cyber warfare policies and military customs”, to maintain the dominant control of the West in cyberspace.\n Ibid., para.24.\n Ibid., paras.20, 23.\n MA, above n.47.\n See, e.g., Zhong Sheng, The United States Bears Primary Responsibility for Halting Cyber War, People’s Daily (7 February 2013) (http://cpc.people.com.cn/pinglun/n/2013/0207/c78779-20456593.html).\n LI Ying, The NATO to Find Legal Basis for Manipulation of Cyberspace, Liberation Army Daily (24 October 2014) (www.chinanews.com/mil/2014/10-24/6712323.shtml).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n33. China's concern over the significant power disparity in Internet technology and cyber infrastructure between it and developed countries partly explains its long-term resistance to applying existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyber warfare prior to the adoption of the final UN GGE report. For example, the following description frequently appeared on Chinese mainstream media: \"The global Internet is built upon 13 [Internet Protocol version (IPv) 4] root servers, 10 of which, including the only key root server, are located in the US. Theoretically, this gives the US the ultimate power to destroy the entire Internet infrastructure of any country.\" The deprivation of Iraq's top domain by ICANN during the Iraq war is another frequently cited supporting example. To tackle the issue, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently approved establishing a DNS root server and a corresponding operating organization by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, along with a plan to upgrade the network infrastructure for the IPv6-based network and encourage large-scale adoption of the IPv6 network.\n34. The mainstream view of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual produced under the auspices of NATO is that: By its essence, the Tallinn Manual is not a re-statement or clarification of existing international law but involves the making of new rules on cyber warfare that reflects the distinctive practice and vested interests of the NATO members. Chinese scholars also highlighted the geographical limitation in the member selection of the Tallinn\n See, e.g., LI Yi, Chinese Internet, Please Keep the “Root”, Beijing Daily (24 January 2014) (http://news.sina.com.cn/pl/2014-01-22/015929310615.shtml).\n LIANG, above n.30.\n Xinhua, China Greenlights Establishment of Root Server, China.org.cn (8 December 2019) (http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/201912/08/content_WS5dec361ec6d0bcf8c4c1882d.html); Xinhua, China Steps up Deploying IPv6-based Network, China.org.cn (3 May 2019) (www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/03/c_138031821.htm).\n See, e.g., DING Libai &amp; ZHU Jing, Tallinn Manual Defines and Reflects on Cyber Attack “Force”, 36 Hebei Faxue [Hebei L Sci] (2018), 84; HUANG Zhixiong, Application of International Law in Cyberspace: Establishing Rules of the Game, 38 Huanqiu Falv Pinglun [Global LR] (2016), 13; HUANG Zhixiong, International Legal Issues concerning “Cyber Warfare” and Strategies for China: Focusing on the Field of Jus ad Bellum, 37 Xiandai Faxue [Modern L Sci] (2015), 154; CHEN Qi, Cybersecurity, Cyber War and International Law: From the Perspective of Tallinn Manual, 7 Zhengzhi yu Falv [P Sci L] (2014), 153-56; XU Yijie, Watch Out for the “Tallinn Manual” Used by the NATO to Make “Rules of Cyber War”, 10 Zhongguo Dangzheng Ganbu Luntan [Chinese Cadres Tribune] (2013), 98-99.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 277\nManual independent International Group of Experts. Critiques of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual concentrate on its *jus ad bellum* part, particularly section 2, “the use of force”. Specifically, many scholars consider that the Tallinn Manual’s threshold on what cyber operations constitute the use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is too low. In their view, the majority of the selected International Group of Experts, who are supporters of Michael Schmitt’s “scale and effects” approach, artificially create some situations that have never taken place to prove that cyberattacks can result in analogous scale and effects of kinetic and non-kinetic forces. A direct transplantation of existing *jus ad bellum* to cyberspace arguably goes beyond the current practice of most States. Another major concern of Chinese scholars is that, rather than regulating the means and methods of cyber warfare, the sponsors of the Tallinn Manual intend to seek legal bases to initiate cyber or even kinetic wars. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual extensively interprets a country’s right of self-defence against non-State actors and anticipatory self-defence against an imminent threat of cyber operations. They hence argue for a higher bar than the Tallinn Manual requirements for invoking the right of self-defence within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n35. Given the unique features of cyber operations, it can be observed that China has been hesitant about applying specific LOAC rules to the cyber context. What are the “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” that prevent China from embracing LOAC and the Tallinn Manual at present? In the absence of any official policy, non-authoritative sources shed light on specific controversies focused on the principles of distinction and proportionality in cyberspace.\n See, e.g., JIANG Yamin, Cyber Great Power Needs to Pay Attention to International Cybersecurity Strategies, People.com, (19 March 2015) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2015/0319/c386965-26716864.html).\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 11.\n See, e.g., above n.89, DING &amp; ZHU, 85-86; HUANG (2016), 10-11; HUANG (2015), 150; CHEN, 154.\n See, e.g., above n.89, HUANG (2016), 8-9; HUANG (2015), 152; CHEN, 154-55.\n See, e.g., LI Bojun, Cyber War and the Applicability of the Law of Armed Conflict, 31 Faxue Pinglun [LR] (2013), 62-63; WANG Kongxiang, Legal Questions and Regulation of Civilian Participation in Cyber War, 5 Fazhi Yanjiu [Research on Rule of L] (2013), 100-09; CHEN, above n.89, 158; CAI Lihong, Challenges to the Principle of Distinction by Information Attacks and Strategies, 24 Xian Zhengzhi Xueyuan Xuebao [J Xi’an P Inst PLA] (2011), 95-96.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nFirst, the existence of an armed conflict permits the use of lethal force based solely on the status of an individual or object. Some Chinese scholars argue that cyberattacks, in light of the latest level of technology, are not controllable so as to constrain their effects within the boundaries of military objects and therefore indiscriminate in nature.95 The 2007 nation-wide denial-of-service attacks sweeping over Estonian Internet infrastructure, including the websites and systems of its Parliament, banks, ministries and media, was cited as a typical example of indiscriminate cyberattack,96 although whether there was an armed conflict and whether such activities amounted to attacks within the meaning of LOAC is disputable. Given such practical difficulties in applying the principle of “distinction” in cyberwar, some scholars suspect the application of LOAC will open a gate for illegitimate cyber and kinetic attacks leading to humanitarian disasters.97 For example, despite its title—“Duty of care during attacks on dams, dykes, and nuclear electrical generating stations”, Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, along with the US policy that categorizes enemy “war-sustaining” objects as lawful targets, is framed as a disguised affirmation of the legitimacy of attacks on critical, yet highly dangerous infrastructures.98 The Internet was originally designed in a way capable of being immediately transformed from war-supporting civil facilities to war-fighting objects, making the majority of its components dual-use objects. Overwhelming reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure would dramatically expand the scope of targetable objects under LOAC. Accordingly, recognizing the applicability of the LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks in cyberspace would be tantamount to authorizing attacks against critical dual-use infrastructures, rendering mass civilians vulnerable to the adverse impacts of not only cyberattacks but also kinetic ones.\nSecond, since the civilian aspect of dual-use cyber infrastructures is relevant only to the attack requirements for proportionality and precaution, the “proportionality” of attacks against objects highly dependent upon Internet or computer control systems is another worrying issue. One scholar quotes John\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 279\nHamre, former US Deputy Defense Secretary, who is skeptical about the feasibility of using cyber operations to achieve the designated military objectives, to demonstrate the unexpected collateral damages caused by cyberattacks. This scholar also considers the current rule of the proportionality of attacks, which factors “the incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damages to civilian objects, or a combination thereof” into assessing whether such collateral damages would be excessive in relation to “the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”, as inadequate protection of civilian interests and suggests adding “knock-on effects” into consideration.\nThird, the distinction between civilian noncombatants and civilians who directly participate in hostilities used to be not an appealing question for Chinese scholars, not only because the Chinese military does not have a tradition of employing civilian contractors, but also because China has not sent its troops to the battlefield for more than thirty years. To reduce costs and obtain technical expertise, the increasing usage of civilians to operate cyberattacks, maintain information weapons, or support cyber combat operations by States has further eroded the distinction between combatants and civilians. It is reasonable for the Chinese military, government and some State-owned-enterprise to recruit civilians for activities related to cyber warfare. Although the law that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities or who adopts a continuous combat function may be lawfully attacked is not in dispute, the targetability of a civilian who assists with cyber operations depends on the answers to two questions: which people are targetable and when they may be targeted. Some Chinese scholars argue that, due to the technical predicament of identity verification and attribution, the applicable LOAC rules fail to provide certainty and predictability for the determination of individual status.\nFourth, another issue closely related to China’s opposition to applying some LOAC rules to cyberspace, namely, what acts may constitute a resort to\n Ibid., CAI, 96, quoting from Is it Real? Is it Hype?, Interview with John Hamre, PBS Frontline (18 February 2003) (www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cyberwar/interviews/hamre.html).\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 1125 UNTS 3, Art. 57(2)(a)(iii) and 57(2)(b) [hereinafter “Additional Protocol I”].\n CAI, above n.94, 96.\n Susan Brenner, Cyber Threats: The Emerging Fault Lines of the Nation State (2009), 197.\n See, e.g., LI, above n.94, 62; WANG, above n.94, 103-09.\nChinese JIL (2021)\narmed force that triggers the application of LOAC, is hinted by the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (“SCO Agreement”). It is a separate question under the jus in bello, without prejudice to the question of “use of force” within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Annex 1 to this Agreement defines “information war” as:\nconfrontation between two or more states in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining political, economic and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to taking decisions in the interest of an opposing party[.].\nAlthough it remains unsettled whether and when an armed conflict, international or non-international, can commence based on a single cyber exchange, the SCO Agreement’s definition of war clearly expands the traditional meaning of armed conflict caused by conventional force under LOAC. Assuming that the term “war” in Annex 1 is not utilized as rhetoric, but rather as the reference of “armed conflict” within the meaning of LOAC, we may tentatively argue that the SCO members consider the existing LOAC’s scope of regulation as underinclusive because it fails to include the cyber actions that can generate political, economic, social and even psychological consequences into the realm of LOAC.\n## III. Examining China’s perspectives on specific rules of LOAC\n36. This part examines the legal or practical grounds supporting China’s views on the four mentioned issues of LOAC. In doing so, this part presents the general contour of various opinions on specific topics, encompassing State practice, positions of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and applicable Tallinn rules. Relevant treaty provisions and judgments of international judicial bodies will be referred to, if available.\n Annex 1 to the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (16 June 2009), List of Basic Terms in the Field of International Information Security (http://cn.io.gov.mo/Legis/International/record/1280.aspx) (Chinese only) and (https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf) (non-official English translation).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 281\n## III.A. Cyberattacks regulated by LOAC\n37. Common Article 2 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 defines an international armed conflict as any “declared war or any other armed conflict which may arise two or more States”, regardless of whether any of them recognizes the state of war. In *Tadić*, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found “an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State.” Undoubtedly, cyberattacks accompanying any kinetic use of force fall under the sphere of LOAC. As with cyber warfare, the pertinent question is whether a single cyber exchange in the absence of any conventional use of force can trigger an international armed conflict by itself.\n38. The notion “resort to armed force” is not defined under LOAC and is easily confused with the usage of “use of force” under the *jus ad bellum*. Nevertheless, the different objects and purposes of these two regimes entail distinct legal tests of “force”. The *jus ad bellum* specifically regulates inter-State relations and States’ lawful use of force, seeking to maintain peaceful relations among nations by setting up strict conditions for invoking forceful measures, “when States may move beyond non-forceful measures such as diplomacy, economic sanctions, and countermeasures”. By contrast, the *jus in bello* regulates the behaviour of parties to an armed conflict, and its object and purpose are to protect the military and civilian victims of war by prohibiting the harms caused by armed attacks during a conflict that are either unnecessary to effectively accomplish legitimate military objectives or excessive in relation to them. The *jus in bello* does not govern whether the use of force is legitimate under the *jus ad bellum* but imposes restrictions on methods and means of warfare.\n39. Despite the absence of a treaty definition of the notion “armed forces” under LOAC, Article 49(1) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva\n---\n Prosecutor v.

By concentrating on the term “violence”, Article 49(1) provides a feasible way to access cyberattacks by analogy to the physical violent effects caused by kinetic attacks. The threshold concept of “attack” is selected in light of LOAC’s object and purpose, since only acts that qualify as attacks would be subject to many of its core prohibitions and restrictions. Only qualified attacks would trigger a wide range of legal protections for the civilian population and objects under LOAC. In most cases, an unqualified act beyond the realm of LOAC would fall under the domain of domestic and international human rights law. So far, there appears to be a consensus that as long as a cyber operation attributable to a State has the equivalent effects of kinetic forces, such as death, physical injury to persons, or damages to objects, it would trigger an international armed conflict. Similarly, Rule 30 of the Tallinn Manual suggests that the “armed force” criterion is fulfilled when a cyber operation is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to person or damage or destruction to objects. A majority of the independent experts participating in the Tallinn Manual project favour including “loss of functionality” in the definition of damages, although there are various shades of opinions among them.\n40. The ICRC Commentary states that the term “attack” means “combat action”, without further elaboration. A paper written by the Head of the ICRC’s Operational Law indicates that the ICRC considers the consequence-based approach as “insufficient to capture the whole range of possible effects of cyber operations and the damage that they can cause, which will not\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 283\nnecessarily resemble the physical effects of traditional weapons\". Given adequate consideration to the object and purpose of LOAC and the concerns of a gap in protection, especially the protection of civilians from the effects of war, that paper seems to endorse the \"loss of functionality\" approach adopted by the majority view of the Tallinn Manual. Based on this approach, whether a cyber operation amounts to an attack depends on whether it causes the target to lose function, even if the target is not physically damaged.\n41. States may support the dysfunction approach since cyber operations would be more frequently resorted, not to physically destroy or damage objects, which can be accomplished by using kinetic force, but rather to incapacitate or disrupt the normal functioning of a vital military or dual-use infrastructure. For instance, an electrical grid or water supply system might be shut down, and a country's banking or stock-trading system could be manipulated, both without any physical damage. As is demonstrated by the 2007 Estonian denial-of-service attacks, for certain civilian populations, the potential hardship arising from such dysfunction could be far more extensive or severe than the physical destruction of a particular building. Such effects might not be comparable to those caused by physical violence, but they are \"precisely the kind of severe consequences from which [LOAC] seeks to protect the civilian population\".\n42. According to the dysfunction approach, cyberattacks against military or dual-use infrastructure, such as paralyzing information systems, altering or deleting processes and resources, are attacks that can trigger the application of LOAC, while applying the consequence-based approach would lead to a contrary conclusion. The applicable LOAC rule maintains that cyberattacks resulting in no physical damage are lawful. The US-EU camp intends to stay with the existing rule and has codified it in the Tallinn Manual. Although international law evolves to reflect the changing values developed by the international community, most States remain silent on this issue. Whether LOAC should expand its established interpretation of attacks depends on future State practice.\n Droege, above n.107, 546.\n Ibid., 546-47.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., 549.\n Schmitt, above n.106, 291.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n43. Part of the SCO Agreement defines war as the “confrontation between two or more States in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes, and resources, critical and other structures”. Under this part of the definition, those confrontations that happen without any physical damages would not qualify as attacks and therefore be lawful under LOAC. The remaining part, namely, inter-State confrontations in cyberspace aimed at “undermining political, economic, and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to [take] decisions in the interest of an opposing party”, is unlikely to fall into the scope of attacks under LOAC either.\n44. On Article 49 of Additional Protocol I, the *Bothe, Partsch and Solf Commentary* underlines that attacks refer to “those aspects of military operations that most directly affect the safety of the civilian population and the integrity of civilian objects”. It would be difficult to assert that political, economic, social, or even psychological effects of cyber operations could be deemed most directly affecting the personal safety of civilians or the physical integrity of civilian objects. Dissemination of propaganda, espionage, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological or economic warfare does not fall under the concept of attack in LOAC.\n45. LOAC endeavours to regulate methods and means of war and the treatments of different groups. Under LOAC, a State wants to protect its civilian population and objects, and at the same time, be able to use lethal force against the belligerent party once an armed conflict commences. An overinclusive definition of “attack” will subject the civilian population to catastrophic consequences that would have been avoided by applying the present definition with a high threshold. Such consideration partly explains why most States remain silent in the face of cyberattacks.\n46. The SCO Agreement’s definition of war demonstrates the six countries’ concerns of adverse impacts by acts that do not qualify as attacks and coincides with Russia’s proposal for non-proliferation of information weapons. But, unlike biological and chemical weapons, the usage of so-called information weapons does not necessarily lead to unnecessary suffering of humans\n Michael Bothe, Karl Josef Partsch &amp; Waldemar A. Solf, New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts: Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (1982), 325.\n Ibid., 289.\n See, e.g., Gary Brown, Why Iran didn’t admit Stuxnet was an attack, 63 Joint Force Quarterly (2011), 71.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 285\nand might even reduce physical harm compared to the usage of conventional forces regarding the accomplishment of the same military objective. This feature of information weapons makes them not a proper subject matter for a total (or partial) ban. By their features and consequences, unqualified cyberattacks are more suitable to be regulated by regimes other than LOAC for the time being. As demonstrated by the final UN GGE report, leading SCO members, including China, Russia, and Kazakhstan, no longer dispute the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict, although controversies over, for example, the qualification of single cyber exchange as attacks under the meaning of LOAC, remain unsettled. Hence, the SCO members may continue to advance the broad interpretation of “attack” to build up consensus for new norms while resisting the application of the existing LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks.\n## III.B. Dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities\n47. As a “cardinal principle” of LOAC, the principle of distinction requires that a distinction be made between military and civilian persons and objects and prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. Article 52(1) of Additional Protocol I defines “civilian objects” in a negative manner as “all objects which are not military objectives”. Military objectives are those “by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage”. According to Rule 39 of the Tallinn Manual, an object cannot be civilian and military simultaneously; its status is either one or the other. Therefore, the entire dual-use object becomes a military objective from the moment it is used for military action, even if its military use is only “marginal” compared to its civilian use. Such observation represents today’s prevailing view on the qualification of dual-use objects as targetable military objectives.\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, 257, para.78.\n Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 52(1).\n Ibid., Art. 52(2).\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 39 and its Commentary, para.1.\n See Droege, above n.107, 562; Michael Schmitt, The Law of Cyber Targeting, Tallinn Paper No.7 (2015), 11.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n48. From the perspective of civilian protection, the “potentially non-lethal nature of cyberweapons” draws concerns over an “expanded target list” and an obscured assessment of the legality of an attack. In a world where a large part of civilian infrastructure and services are highly reliant on international cyber infrastructure, including the Internet, servers, routers, cables, satellites, and computers, the danger of loss of function, partial damage or complete destruction is evident. For example, approximately 98% of US government communications use civilian-owned and civilian-operated networks. Under LOAC, belligerent parties can easily target cyber infrastructure as military objectives because mere containing, storing, or transmitting a tiny percentage of military data would render the entire infrastructure a legitimate target.\n49. Several scenarios of consequences of attacks against dual-use cyber infrastructure entail humanitarian concerns for civilian protection. The past decade witnessed the increasing use of cloud computing, the users of which are usually unaware of which server their data is stored on and whether military data is stored on the same server. Cyberspace is an artificial battlefield, where, unlike natural theatres of war, such as land or airspace, travelling military data or weapons (e.g., malware, botnet, or malicious codes) can make not only itself a legitimate target but also the transmitting infrastructure a military objective. It can be a computer system, a communication network, a server or router, a major cable, a satellite, or in the worst case, the entire Internet network system.\n50. The Tallinn Manual provides that “the circumstances under which the Internet in its entirety could be attacked [are] so highly unlikely as to render the possibility purely theoretical at the present time”, and that “virtually any attack against the Internet would have to be limited to certain discrete segments thereof”. Nevertheless, it also acknowledges that “it may be impossible to know over which part of the network military transmissions, as distinct\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 287\nfrom civilian ones, will pass. In such cases, the entire network (or at least those aspects in which transmission is reasonably likely) qualifies as a military objective.”\n51. In the physical world, the irrelevance of dual-use objects’ civilian part regarding the principle of distinction is no longer in dispute. In cyberspace, the broad interpretation might lead to extreme situations where nothing civilian remains. More importantly, being a military objective will incur not only attacks in cyberspace but also fatal kinetic attacks. As a result, the fundamental rule that civilian population and objects enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations becomes an empty shell, leaving such situations only subject to protection under the principles of proportionality and precaution.\n52. Almost all States and legal commentators agree that the element of “make[s] an effective contribution to military action” in Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I includes a contribution towards “war-fighting” or “war-supporting” capabilities of the belligerent party. War-fighting objects refer to those used in combat, while war-supporting objects are what military operations rely on in some “relatively direct sense”. In the cyber context, typical war-supporting objects are factories producing hardware or software or other kinds of information weapons, all of which qualify as military objectives. Controversy on this element concentrates on the “war-sustaining” object policy of the US, which has been adopted by a few States so far. The majority of Tallinn Manual independent experts refused to include war-sustaining objects into military objectives due to the remote relationship between them and military operations.\n53. The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations of the US extends the expression of Article 52(2) to “effectively contribute to the enemy’s war-fighting or war-sustaining capability”. The term “war-sustaining” encompasses objects within “an economy or governmental financial system”\n Ibid., para.3.\n Schmitt, above n.125.\n Ibid.\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n Department of the Navy and Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, NWP 1-14M/MCWP 5-12.1/COMDTPUB P5800.7A (July 2007), para.8.2.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nrelied on by the enemy to fund participation in the conflict. For instance, the revenue from cotton export during the US Civil War enabled the Confederate States to finance and therefore sustain its war. Contemporary examples are oil industries of the terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Shams, whose funding of war relied on revenues from oil exports. The rationale behind the war-sustaining approach in the sense of traditional warfare is that the destruction of certain economic objects that are not absolutely “indispensable to civilian survival”, yet currently protected under LOAC, would shorten a conflict and therefore reduce the potential casualty toll and generate societal changes.\n54. The different effects of cyberattacks and kinetic ones might make cyberattacks against war-sustaining objects more effective in achieving the expected military goal. Using cyber operations to paralyze the infrastructure upon which a central banking system is built, or delete funds from accounts, or change account balances, or manipulate the stock market, will lead to a collapse of the enemy’s confidence. According to the applicable law, many of such cyber operations may not even qualify as attacks under LOAC. Despite the unique advantage of cyberattacks, the military advantage of cyber operations on war-sustaining objects might be indefinite and difficult to articulate. Critiques of war-sustaining objects within the sphere of traditional warfare can apply indiscriminately to cyberspace. There would be no limits to warfare, providing that substantially the entire economy of a country can be considered as war-sustaining. Consequently, a much broader scope of military objectives that include the enemy’s research and development capabilities would devastate the humanitarian values upheld by the principle of distinction.\n55. To sum up, the Chinese scholars’ view that applying some existing rules of LOAC to cyberspace would potentially “open a gate for humanitarian\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 289\ndisasters” is reasonable, given that attacks against dual-use infrastructure are currently lawful in most cases. Unless there is a breakthrough in law, attacks against major cyber infrastructure would remain subject to the legal safeguards for civilian protection embodied in the principles of proportionality and precaution. As with Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, targeting highly dangerous infrastructure, such as dams, dikes, and nuclear electrical generating stations, violates the established rule enshrined in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I, which explicitly prohibits targeting listed infrastructure even if they constitute military objectives.\n56. Some may argue that, instead of denying the existing law, a government should assume its responsibility to ensure that military data or weapons do not taint civilian facilities. Unfortunately, the present level of technology and the indiscrepable relationship between civilian and military components in global cyberspace holds little promise for such complete separation.\n57. Another alternative proposal pertinent to the Chinese scholars’ argument is to expand the list of “works and installations containing dangerous forces” in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I by analogy so that critical cyber infrastructure could not be made targetable objects. But the hurdle for adequate State support for this effort remains high. It would be difficult to convince States that the potentially nonlethal effects of attacks on cyber infrastructure could be made comparable to that of radioactive materials leak or flood.\n58. China has never embraced the “war-sustaining” approach. As demonstrated by the SCO Agreement’s definition of war, China’s perception of threats to the safety and normal functionality of its cyber infrastructure is more oriented towards cyber operations below the threshold of attacks under LOAC. In other words, a lower bar of attacks capable of triggering the application of LOAC is demanded. Meanwhile, the Chinese scholars who expressed concerns over allowing attacks against dual-use and war-sustaining objects under LOAC might want to remove these objects from LOAC’s list of legitimate military objectives. To simultaneously realize the objectives of the SCO members and the mentioned Chinese scholars would require any cyber operations falling under the SCO Agreement’s definition to only attack objects exclusively used for military purposes and dual-use objects that are neither highly dangerous nor counted as cyber infrastructure. Such handling\n Robin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann, Cyber Warfare: Applying the Principle of Distinction in an Interconnected Space, 45 Israel LR (2012), 390.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nmight significantly reduce the legitimate functioning space for cyberattacks and prevent them from doing what they are best at, namely, accomplishing military advantage precisely without causing non-reversible damages of critical civilian infrastructure and having the potential to stay non-violent and reduce collateral losses. Such consequences turn out to be contrary to the humanitarian intentions of these Chinese scholars to reduce the harms suffered by victims of war.\n## III.C. Proportionality of cyberattacks against infrastructures\n59. Given that the interconnectedness of military networks and their heavy reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure has left the principle of distinction virtually empty of contents, the principle of proportionality becomes an ultimate rule for protecting civilian persons and objects. This principle prohibits attacks “which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.145 In light of the harsh challenges imposed by the unique features of cyber warfare, the actual role that the principle of proportionality can play could not be overstated.\n60. Under LOAC, what can be considered as “excessive” incidental damage to civilian objects in comparison with the expected concrete and direct military advantage remains controversial. The principle of proportionality is “more easily stated than applied in practice”. As a matter of fact, findings of excessive incidental damage to civilian infrastructure are very few and far between as compared to the military advantage.146 Moreover, the proportionality assessment in LOAC is made ex-ante when expected collateral damage is weighed against the anticipated military damage.147 The practical difficulties in ascertaining the expected effects of cyber operations prevent commanders from precisely assessing the potential collateral damages to civilian objects. How to apply this principle in cyberspace hinges on the development of both legal interpretation and technology, the uncertainty of which may jeopardize\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 291\nthis principle’s ability to prevent significant collateral damages to civilian objects in cyber warfare.\n61. In the digital era, incidental damages to civilian objects will no longer be limited to physical ones but also the loss of functionality of civilian cyber infrastructure. Therefore, in order to accommodate the special needs of cyber warfare, several opinions calling for modifications of the assessment of “collateral damages to civilian objects” have emerged. For example, it is suggested that more weight should be given to temporary consequences regarding cyberattacks, for the temporary incapacity of critical systems would incur more severe consequences than mere inconvenience, such as in situations where loss of life may be caused by the inability of hospitals to communicate vital information. But existing LOAC fails to provide any legal basis for this. The paradoxical applicable law is described as:\nwhereas the destruction of a single civilian car would amount to legally relevant, albeit rather insignificant, ‘collateral damage’, the disconnection of thousands or millions of households, companies and public services from the Internet or other communication services, or the severance of online financial transactions for a country’s entire economy and the corresponding economic and societal effects as such would not count as relevant elements to be factored into the proportionality calculus.\n62. Similarly, some scholars propose to include “knock-on effects” of cyber-attacks in the proportionality calculations when such an effect would not have occurred “but for” the attack. “Knock-on effects” refer to those generated by the initial effects of the attack. Both the 1990-1992 Gulf War and the NATO action in the former Yugoslavia illustrate that the knock-on effects of targeting electricity grid may cause more harm to the affected civilians than the direct effect of these attacks themselves. Although existing law has not touched upon this issue, most scholars seem to agree that knock-on effects\n Oona Hathaway, et al., The Law of Cyber-Attack, 100 California LR (2012), 851.\n Geiß &amp; Lahmann, above n.144, 397.\n Michael Schmitt, Heather Harrison Dinniss &amp; Thomas C. Wingfield, Computers and War: The Legal Battlespace, Background Paper Prepared for the Informal High-Level Expert Meeting on Current Challenges to International Humanitarian Law (25-27 June 2004), 8-9 (www.hpcresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/schmittetal.pdf).\n Ibid., 8.\n Dinniss, above n.109, 205.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nshould be part of the proportionality analysis to the extent they are “reasonably foreseeable”,[153] which resonates with the term “expected” in Additional Protocol I.\n63. Commentary to Rule 51 of the Tallinn Manual includes both direct and indirect effects of attacks in the proportionality assessment.[154] The former means “the immediate, first-order consequences, unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms”, and the latter refers to “the delayed and/or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms”. Without deliberately using the same term, the Tallinn Manual adopts the “knock-on effects” approach, factoring “any indirect effects that should be expected by those individuals planning, approving, or executing a cyberattack” into the proportionality evaluation.[155] Such indirect effects can be exemplified by accidents involving transportation systems or malware inserted into a military computer system spread to other civilian computer systems and thereafter disables them, where those risks are or should have been expected. Such indirect effects may result from blocking the Global Positioning Satellite data or disrupting the Global Positioning System.[156] Inconvenience, irritation, stress, or fear caused by cyber operations are explicitly excluded from collateral damages to civilian objects.[157]\n64. The Chinese scholars' view on the theoretical and practical difficulties in applying the present law on proportionality concurs with the mainstream view among international law commentators. The Tallinn Manual's rules and commentaries on this principle are early attempts to codify the prevailing treaty interpretation, contributing to an enhanced relief valve of attacks against critical cyber infrastructure. The Chinese scholars' critiques of Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, which permits attacks against highly dangerous infrastructure, were not made in conjunction with Rule 51, becoming an interpretation out of context. The proportionality assessment under existing law disillusions those who wish to use it to make up for the failure of rules regarding the principle of distinction in protecting civilian safety. If the applicable LOAC rules regarding the principles of distinction and proportionality remain unchanged, the principle of precaution would be the only safeguard left.\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 293\n## III.D. Targetable civilians\n65. Article 51(3) of the Additional Protocol I and Article 13(3) of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts provides that, if civilians engage in conducts amounting to “direct participation in hostilities”, their protection against direct military attacks would be suspended. In cyber warfare, “for such time” as civilians directly participate in hostilities, they not only become legitimate targets of military operations but also are bound by LOAC rules governing the conduct of hostilities. Furthermore, such civilians should not be factored into the proportionality calculation. They are not considered for the principle of precaution that aims to avoid or minimize incidental harm to civilians.\n66. Civilians may be targeted for direct participation in hostilities. Currently, given the complexity of this issue, there is no authoritative guidance on which activities qualify as direct participation. The present State practice, the jurisprudence of international judicial bodies and prevailing academic views adopt a case-by-case determination method through exemplification rather than illustration. To address when civilians may be targeted, the ICRC sponsored a five-year research project in 2003 and produced its *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law* (“Interpretive Guidance”).\n67. In this document, the ICRC proposes three “constitutive elements” of direct participation in hostilities: (1) an act that negatively impacts the enemy’s military effort, or in which harm is intended (threshold of harm); (2) a relatively direct nexus between that act and the resulting harm, or that act constituting an “integral part” of a coordinated military operation likely to cause the said harm (direct causation), and (3) linkage to the armed conflict\n---\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\n(belligerent nexus). Although these criteria were generally accepted, the Interpretive Guidance has drawn strong criticism from scholars. These scholars argued that it is both underinclusive as to improperly exclude some forms of direct participation and overinclusive as to incorrectly permit attacks against some civilians and civilian property.\n68. There is no reason to distinguish cyber operations from kinetic operations regarding how civilian conducts qualify as direct participation in hostilities, as most controversies are not cyber-specific. Critiques of the Interpretive Guidance in conventional warfare do not necessarily stand in cyberspace. According to the “threshold of harm” element, an act amounting to hostility does not have to qualify as an attack within the meaning of LOAC, which indispensably entails the infliction of death, injury, or destruction on military personnel and objects. “Essentially any consequence adversely affecting the military operations or military capacity” of an opposing party would satisfy the test. Compared to the difficulties in arming civilians with traditional weapons, the technical barrier to cyber armed civilians is almost non-existent. It is too easy for civilians to have the know-how to conduct harmful cyber activities. Therefore, in cyber warfare, “the pool of targetable individuals could be extremely large in future conflicts, far more than is the case in classic conflict.”\n69. Espionage activities, including gathering and disseminating intelligence of military tactics and operations by cyber means, or hacking into the enemy system to identify enemy vulnerabilities, would both suffice. Engaging in developing cyber defence systems, such as encryption technology, firewalls or anti-virus software, also falls under this category. However, the element of “direct causation” defines them as causing only “indirect harm” because such individual conduct “merely builds up or maintains the capacity of a party to\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 295\nharm its adversary\".170 Considering the Interpretive Guidance as sacrificing military necessity for exaggerated civilian protection, commentators suggest expanding the current interpretation of direct hostilities to capacity-building acts, namely, those espionage and development activities specific to a particular cyber operation or enemy system.171\n70. Nevertheless, the unique features of cyber warfare demand particular attention paid to certain issues in cyberspace. Commentators questioned the rationality of the ICRC's interpretation of the term \"for such time\" when a direct participant can be targeted.172 The ICRC provides that this period covers preparatory measures of a specific act of direct participation, deployment to or return from the activity concerned.173 They argued that the restrictive interpretation has dramatically narrowed the window of targetability, rendering this standard particularly impractical in cyber warfare.174 There is usually no deployment to or return from cyber operations since most of them are controlled remotely.\n71. More importantly, the duration of cyber operations can be extremely short, sometimes even too brief to identify the attacker.175 Or, in some cases, for example, a surreptitiously emplaced logic bomb, the effect of cyber operations can be long-delayed.176 A better approach is suggested to cure this deficiency:\nTo characterise an individual who engages in multiple cyber operations that are part of an on-going cyber campaign as a direct participant targetable throughout the period of activity. Once the individual definitively withdraws from participation, he or she regains their protection from attack, and not before.177\nThis approach seems more promising but might still lead to scary consequences. For civilian computer operators working in closed military facilities,\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\ntheir targetability would not expire after work but become a portable threat travelling with them and making their family members and neighbours legitimate collateral damage. As the debate continues, any resolution must grant sufficient consideration to the safety of civilians.\n72. Cyber warfare also presents peculiar questions to the controversy over which members of an organized armed group are targetable between the ICRC and the NATO members. Members of organized armed groups are the other category of civilians that are legitimate targets of military operations.^[178]^ According to the Interpretive Guidance, only those with a “continuous combat function” can be attacked.^[179]^ The NATO members and Israel favour including all members of a group formed to conduct hostilities.^[180]^ These countries criticize the requirement of “continuous combat function” as affording greater protection to members of organized groups than members of the armed forces, whereas the former enjoy no right to engage in hostilities while the latter does.^[181]^ In the human-made theatre in cyberspace, where distinguishing members of organized armed groups from civilians can be far more difficult and uncertain than on physical battlefields, the additional requirement of ensuring that a member performs “continuous combat function” seems impractical and unnecessary. After all, LOAC’s presumption of civilian status in the case of doubt has offered adequate protection for such members.^[182]^\n73. At first sight, the Chinese scholars’ view tends to see the problem as a practical one of attribution and verification rather than one of law. Nonetheless, such difficulties give rise to debates about legal issues specific to cyber warfare. To the degree that the targetability of civilians is concerned, the critiques of the Interpretive Guidance mainly stem from practical difficulties, before or at the moment of targeting, in distinguishing members of armed groups or civilians directly participating in hostilities from civilians.\n74. For capacity-building or -maintaining conduct that involves espionage or development activities by cyber means, it would be premature to argue that China is willing to waive its right to attack civilians that severely harm its military operation or capacity. But given its general defensive stance on security\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 297\nissues, China is neither likely to embrace the broader approach that covers such “indirect” conduct. If China ends up agreeing with the applicability of LOAC rules on this issue, it might favour the ICRC’s restrictive standard of “for such time” and “continuous combat function”, not only because of China’s defensive rather than offensive approach to the use of force, but also because of its humanitarian considerations to protect the lives of a large number of civilians relate—occupationally to activities that have a bearing on military operations, or personally to someone occasionally carrying out conduct of hostilities—from lethal attacks.\n75. For the purpose of civilian protection, the better approach for States turns out to be recruiting only military personnel, ideally with uniforms and other distinctive marks, for military operations by cyber means. While accessible in theory, the transformation of non-State cyber actors into national forces would be time-consuming. As a reminder, the privateers were not completely abandoned by States until the time when the maritime powers had developed strong navies, which were capable of forcing the armed merchants who refused to integrate into the navy to put down their weapons in exchange for State protection on the high seas and defeating privates and enemy fleets.^[183]^\n## IV. The objectives of China’s normative proposals\n76. Based on its limited number of available official statements and practices, China’s opposition to the applicability of some LOAC rules in cyberspace remains vague and general from a legal perspective. The SCO Agreement’s expansive version of cyber “war” indicates that China’s earlier position did not distinguish armed conflicts from other situations, although the application of LOAC hinges on such a differentiation. Apart from the catchall interpretation of cyberattacks, many Chinese scholars expressed concerns over the adequacy of the LOAC rules governing the targetability of dual-use infrastructure and certain groups of civilians and the principle of proportionality. These concerns are not groundless both in terms of law and practice. In fact, the ICRC’s views on the three issues, or even some corresponding rules of the Tallinn Manual, address their concerns well. The practice of the US and its allies that China opposes has not hardened into customary international law binding on all\n^[183]^ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering: A Historical Analogy, Cyber Studies Programme Working Paper No. 1 (March 2015), 3-6, 9 (www.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/cybersecurity-and-the-age-of-privateering-a-historical-analogy.html).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nStates that fail to maintain persistent objection to it. These facts have contributed to China's incremental acceptance of the general applicability of LOAC to the cyber context despite many remaining controversies over how specific LOAC rules should be interpreted and applied to cyber operations.\n77. As with China's concerns over the Tallinn Manual's overemphasis on the military paradigm of responses to cyberattacks in international legal discourse, which threatens to derogate from the principle of non-use of force and to abuse the right to self-defence, a more diverse group of experts was composed to draft the second version of the Tallinn Manual, to address the criticisms of the limited diversity of the group of experts participating in drafting the first version of the Tallinn Manual[184] and this group's overreliance on Western legal sources.[185] There were three non-Western experts from China, Belarus and Thailand, among the nine experts who participated in the formulation process of Tallinn Manual 2.0.[186] The scope of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 expands from \"above the threshold\" cyber operations whose \"scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force\"[187] or which are \"executed in the context of an armed conflict that [is] subject to the LOAC\"[188] to \"below the threshold\" cyber operations that take place in peacetime and fall outside the regulatory scope of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello.\n78. The threshold of use of force functions as a firewall that separates cyber operations which can trigger the exercise of the right to self-defence by a victim State from cyber operations that can entail only pacific countermeasures. As previously mentioned, a major concern of China points to the Tallinn Manual's threshold on which cyber operations constitute use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The Chinese perspective considers it as a low standard intended to accommodate some States' strategic\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 299\nneeds to expansively interpret the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter in order to justify their use of force against other States.\n79. Rule 69 and Rule 71 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were drafted by the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual and incorporated in the second version without being discussed by the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Rule 69 stipulates the “scale and effects” approach. Rule 71 provides that only “a State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence”. The International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual reached a consensus that the scale of effects of cyber operations causing physical consequences can be considered as comparable to those of kinetic operations and hence the use of force under the *jus ad bellum*. But they contested over the status of cyber operations that have no consequences in the physical world but can lead to serious consequences.\n80. Some Western scholars identified the failure of Rule 69 to include cyber operations having no physical consequences but can cause temporary suspension of operational functionality, result in alteration and destruction of data or code, or involve “psychological operation” and “cyber espionage”, as a major shortcoming of the Tallinn Rules. Accordingly, they considered the definition of “use of force” adopted by the Tallinn Rules\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\nas “narrow”, blaming the experts for their overreliance on “a consequence-based gravity test in the jus ad bellum”. In addition to the perceived narrow prohibition against the use of cyber force, they considered the Tallinn Rules’ construction of the right to self-defence as even narrower, given the significant difficulties in establishing causal links between multiple consequences and a cyber operation added to the difficulties of attributing a cyber operation to a State or a non-State actor. Although the notion of anticipatory self-defence, which has long been a concern of China and an old controversy in the international law circle with a new incarnation, was adopted in the Tallinn Rules, the practical difficulties in detecting the preparations for launching a cyberattack and further determining whether a cyberattack is imminent render the requirements for resorting to using force on the ground of anticipatory self-defence highly demanding.\n81. Consequently, the victim State’s response in most cases would be limited to measures falling below the threshold of use of force, such as countermeasures or referring the matter to the UNSC. By far, the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Rules have identified only the Stuxnet attack as meeting the Tallinn threshold of use of force; some experts considered it as meeting the higher “scale and effects” threshold of an armed attack that can trigger the application of LOAC. Even American military lawyers and scholars, who are deemed by their Chinese counterparts as seeking to militarize cyberspace through lowering the threshold of use of force, have admitted that, “the prevailing view is that most, if not all, documented cyber actions taken by States to date have fallen below the ‘use of force’ threshold.” Apart from the narrowly construed right to self-defence in situations of armed conflicts, Rule 20 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides a broader right of States to take countermeasures in time of peace, “whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 301\nobligation that is owned by another State”. Nevertheless, the exercise of this right by States is subject to similar difficulties in attribution, in addition to a set of conditions, including notification, proportionality, and the exclusion of measures amounting to uses of force.\n82. The narrow construction of the right to self-defence and countermeasures under the Tallinn Rules demonstrates the reluctance of the International Group of Experts to permissibly authorize a State to undertake unilateral acts that would result in effects in the territory of another State, in another word, a strong pro-sovereignty inclination of the Tallinn Rules. In contrast, the US and the UK argued that sovereignty did not by itself constitute a specific rule of international law that cyber operations might violate, but rather a foundational principle of international law that undergirds specific rules of international law, such as the prohibition against the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the rule of non-intervention under customary international law. In these two countries’ view, such a principle has no binding effect, and low-scale cyber operations deployed by a State that generate effects in another State’s territory but do not breach any of these specific rules, do not violate international law merely because of their incompatibility with the abstract principle of sovereignty. This controversy over the status of sovereignty remains unsettled in the final UN GGE report mainly due to the UK’s active participation in the UN GGE. Yet NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations released in 2020 has endorsed the status of sovereignty as a rule of international law in a footnote, with the UK as the only NATO member having reserved on that footnote.\n83. Therefore, although the Tallinn Rules were developed under the auspices of NATO, they represent neither the exceptional perspectives of some States such as the US or the UK nor the collective views of the NATO members. Throughout the Hague Process, during the drafting of the Tallinn Rules, where legal advisors from 50 States were given the opportunity to\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\nexpress their legal positions to shape the codification process, many States maintained a persistent policy of silence and ambiguity on the specificities of existing or emerging norms regulating cyberspace. Meanwhile, the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, together with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, convened two consultative meetings in April 2015 and February 2016 with representatives from more than one hundred States, including China.\n84. The technological difficulties in credibly attributing responsibility for cyber operations, the ongoing controversies over which existing rules apply to cyberspace, their contents, the suitability of the prevailing international legal framework as the primary method to regulate inter-State behaviour in cyberspace, and political and strategic considerations that have prevented States from making public attributions and invoking their rights to take responsive measures, all have contributed to the “wait and see” approach adopted by most States towards utilizing rules and norms of international law, including the Tallinn Rules, to regulate cyber operations. These factors cast doubt over the ripeness of codifying applicable international law in these areas. The limited State practice and opinio juris partly explain China’s “wait and see” stance, which is in line with the mainstream approach in order to preserve a degree of operational flexibility in the face of technological development and the dynamic international environment.\n85. To summarize, China’s long-term insistence on the non-applicability of the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules to cyberspace does not only conform to the development trend of international normative discourses but also contributes to fuelling this momentum. Sovereign control of cyberspace has been increasingly reviving, and the focus of international legal discourse has shifted from the military paradigm concentrated on the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to the prism of general rules of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. The current landscape of international law identification and development reflects and underpins most concerns of China\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 303\nand many other like-minded States, while the Tallinn Rules serve as one of the early efforts rather than the concluding remark of ongoing international legal discourses.\n86. However, there are two residual concerns of China not reflected in the mainstream State practice following the publication of the two versions of the Tallinn Manual. They are underscored by the elements of cyber sovereignty proposed by China that call for the prohibition of using ICT, information and communications networks to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression or arms race, and the OEWG resolution's reiteration of the need for introducing additional rules of behaviour regarding States' right to combat interference in their internal affairs through the dissemination of false and distorted news and States' duty to abstain from engaging in such activities. One is external threats posed by more powerful States which may utilize their digital advantages to threaten China's national security and social stability, and the other is external limitations, either from emerging norms of international law or other established powers, of China's exercise of regulatory power over content transmitted in cyberspace to combat such threats.\n87. Therefore, in addition to the mentioned concerns addressed by the mainstream State practice, China has employed its generalized and vague resistance to the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace as bargaining leverage to achieve another two objectives in international legal discourse: (1) to build up consensus for a new treaty regulating all use of cyber forces, or a disarmament treaty banning all or at least some types of information weapons, and (2) to block the formation of new law that would limit its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace and prevent disfavoured existing law from binding on its exercise of sovereign power in cyberspace.\n## IV.A. A disarmament treaty &amp; national security\n88. The first objective of China's opposition to an explicit affirmation of the right to self-defence and the applicability of some LOAC rules to the cyber context, namely, to build up consensus for a disarmament treaty on the use of information weapons under the auspice of the UN, emanates from the nature of States' right to self-defence. It is an inherent right reserved for States to\nChinese JIL (2021)\nresort to force by its own decision after the enshrinement of a general prohibition of uses of force in the UN Charter.\n89. As evidenced by the controversies over anticipatory self-defence in the drafting processes of the Tallinn Rules, diverse concepts and practices regarding the preconditions for the commencement of self-defence and the limitations to the exercise of this right have been invoked and contested by States. Whether Article 51 of the UN Charter allows anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defence before an armed attack occurs has long been a major point of contention. The US, the UK, Israel and some other States have construed Article 51 in a permissible manner by referring to the Caroline doctrine under customary international law, based on which they have often resorted to force. The UNSC has condemned some of such practices; the International Court of Justice took the restrictive view in the judgments of the Corfu Channel case, the Nicaragua case, and other decisions afterwards. The restrictive approach limits States' right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter to situations where an armed attack has already taken place, excluding anticipatory self-defence. From the perspective of the degree of compliance, the effectiveness of the general prohibition of use of force is questionable. But none of these States supporting permissive interpretations dares to bluntly admit the existence of a violation or defy this universally accepted rule, although they always use various factual and legal arguments to justify their breaches.\n90. In the same vein, it is not practically feasible to ensure effective observance of a norm prohibiting use of force in cyberspace, especially by these States that are frequent invokers of anticipatory self-defence. Therefore, what China and other SCO members seek is rather to influence the norm-formulation process at the UN that reflects how the international community of States characterizes a situation or act in question, e.g., as a violation of the proposed norm, and whether most States have a willingness to suppress such dubious acts. In the interim, China has not come up with a clear and concrete stance on how to develop a standard resembling Article 2(4) and Article 51 of the UN Charter in judging the legality and legitimacy of State behaviour concerning use of cyber force. More importantly, concluding new treaties for\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 305\nwarfare or a disarmament treaty would be more challenging than adapting existing law through interpretation.\n91. Cyber disarmament is more unrealistic in today's international political environment than the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in light of the recent backlashes against the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons provoked by the Iran and North Korea nuclear crises. All nuclear-weapon States except China, which abstained, voted against a UNGA resolution proposing to convene the first UN conference aimed at achieving a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons. On 22 January 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first multilateral agreement that bans nuclear weapons, entered into force. Although 85 States have signed and 50 of them have ratified this treaty, the non-participation of all nine States possessing nuclear weapons renders the efficacy of the treaty questionable. Additionally, as manifested by Cuba's objection to an endorsement of the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, the States that do not enjoy conventional military superiority over their adversaries may have asymmetric advantages in cyberspace, which they are reluctant to give up. Therefore, a cyber disarmament treaty would lack the support of both major cyber powers and the rest of the weaker cyber-armed States.\n92. In the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures in 2013 and the WikiLeaks disclosures lasting from mid-2016 to date, a rising trend of nationalism has taken place in many countries that used to stand in line with the US-EU camp, such as Brazil and Germany, pushing these countries to start thinking how to defend their \"data sovereignty\". The rise of cybersecurity nationalism has undermined international norm-making efforts, including trade negotiations between the EU and the US and the US attempts to promote norms of Internet freedom globally. There is no reason that cybersecurity discourse would stay intact.\n Tariq Rauf, 2017: The Year in Which Nuclear Weapons Could be Banned?, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Commentary (20 March 2017) (www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2017/2017-year-which-nuclear-weapons-could-be-banned).\n See generally, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (22 January 2021) (www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-on-the-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons/).\n Arun M. Sukumar, The UN GGE Failed: Is International Law in Cyberspace Doomed as Well?, Lawfare (4 July 2017) (www.lawfareblog.com/un-gge-failed-international-law-cyberspace-doomed-well).\n Mueller, above n.25, 555.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n93. Given the unique features of cyber operations and the Internet, even a treaty in the style of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons would have little practical significance in deterring the abuse and misuse of force in cyberspace. The refrainment of most States, including the US, in most cyber tensions with other States, from resorting to the prevailing international legal framework in dealing with inter-State cyber relations, highlights the limitations of normative approaches in functioning as a general taboo for irresponsible activities in cyberspace by not only State but also private actors.\n94. Compared to conventional and nuclear weapons, the technical barriers to entry in cyber warfare are so low that non-State actors and countries that are conceivably weak by the standards of hard powers can play a significant role on par with powerful countries at low levels of cost. Cyberattacks can be conducted by any actor having an electronic device and connected to the Internet. The interconnectivity of the network enables any actor to stay geographically remote from where they commit cyberattacks. Simultaneously, unlike classic military operations that rely upon territorial linkages, this interconnectivity severely decreases the degree of State control over actors and activities. The life of a treaty, particularly a disarmament treaty, rests in its enforcement. The construction of a credible monitoring and enforcement mechanism would prove to be the utmost hurdle for a cyber disarmament treaty.\n95. Probably having realized the lack of feasibility and political will among States to negotiate a cyber disarmament treaty, China has softened, to some degree, its stance against the alleged militarization of cyberspace. In the most up-to-date white paper on China's military strategy issued in 2015, China plans to \"expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defence [...] so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability\".[221] The ISCC further confirms that \"enhanced defence capability in cyberspace is an important part of China's endeavour to modernize its national defence and armed forces\",[222] while restricting China's development of a cyber force to defensive capability.[223]\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 307\n## IV.B. Sovereign control over the Internet vs non-intervention\n96. The changes in the global context of disarmament and China's position regarding use of force in the cyber context have rendered the proposed second objective of China more salient. The central bone of contention in the normative competitions between the SCO members and the Western powers rests upon whether information and data transmitted in cyberspace shall be made subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State, although both sides have reached a consensus on the applicability of sovereignty as part of international law in cyberspace. At the core of this debate is how to draw the lines between the realms of domestic law and international law as consensual erosion of State sovereignty to be applied equally to all States.\n97. The US holds the view that, although sovereignty gives a State the right to control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory, the exercise of such jurisdiction by the territorial State, encompassing the use and access to the Internet, must comply with that State's obligations under applicable international law, particularly international human rights law. While noting that the freedom of expression may be restricted in situations such as the incitement of imminent terrorist violence, the US considers \"certain censorship and content control, including blocking websites simply because they contain content that criticizes a leader, a government policy, or an ideology, or because the content espouses particular religious beliefs\" as constituting State violations of international human rights law.\n98. China likely views this reference to international human rights law as a pretext for Western attempts to conceptually undermine the scope of sovereign powers by narrowing the content of *domaine réservé* in the context of Internet governance. China claims for cyber sovereignty that includes not only cyber infrastructure within its territory but also its jurisdiction over data and the regulation and monitoring of the content of information flowing over cyberspace. Consciously aware that the scope of a State's internal matters and the international legal limitations to that State's exercise of sovereign power over internal matters evolve over time, China has consistently resisted non-reciprocal and non-voluntary restrictions on its exercise of sovereignty.\n Egan, above n.45, 15-17.\n See, e.g., National Security Law of the People's Republic of China (2015), art. 25; XI Jinping, Keynote Speech at the opening ceremony of the 2nd World Internet Conference (16 December 2015) (www.wuzhenwic.org/2015-12/16/c_47521.htm).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n99. From Beijing's perspective, the nature of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as a product formulated under the domination of Western powers was not changed solely by the increased diversity in the composition of the International Group of Experts participating in the drafting process, because the newly-added matters reflect foremostly Western perspectives and concerns. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 does not touch upon the sovereignty of a State over potential data; it only mentions sovereign power over any cyber infrastructure located within States' territory and activities associated with that cyber infrastructure. Similar problems exist in the Tallinn Rules concerning jurisdiction, which overwhelmingly emphasize the limitations imposed by international human rights law to the exercise of sovereignty in cyberspace.\n100. In the domestic sphere, China invokes cyber sovereignty to underpin its regulation over data and information in cyberspace. As shown in the SCO Agreement's wording of \"mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to take decisions to the interest of an opposing party\", China is always wary of potential foreign interference. The propaganda and liaison roles played by online social networking servers, such as Facebook and Twitter, in the \"Arab Spring\" that led to social unrest, political turmoil and regime-changes in Northern African and Western Asian countries, and the exposure of the massive surveillance by the US National Security Agency in the PRISM program have strengthened the Chinese conviction of the need for Internet censorship to block and filter information in cyberspace that is harmful to China's social stability and national security. In the trend of the global revival of cyber sovereignty, China strengthens its sovereignty-based regulatory power by referring to similar censorship practices of other States, such as the US, Australia, Italy, Germany, France, the UK, and Korea that once held opposing views, regarding the information about terrorism, incitement to hate crimes, pornography, violence and other crimes involving the usage of the Internet.\n101. In the international sphere, China has employed cyber sovereignty as a shield against some Western States' attempts to compel it to change the\n HUANG, above n.212.\n HUANG Zhixiong, Regulation of Cyber Information: A Component Implicitly Covered by Cyber Sovereignty, 3 Guojia Zhili [Nat'l Governance Wkly] (2016), 33-34.\n Xinlian, From the US to Australia: How States Regulate the Internet, China Daily (17 May 2016) (http://world.chinadaily.com.cn/2016-05/17/content_25321844.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 309\ncurrent model of Internet governance by either resorting to non-legal advocacy for Internet freedom or invoking relevant international law, especially the rules of international human rights law on the right to freedom of expression, association, and the media, and the right to access to information. Google's withdrawal from the Chinese market in 2010 was a representative example of the former means where a leading multinational company threatened the Chinese government for a policy change under the instructions of some Western countries. Additionally, the Chinese government has been alarmed by soft law norms applicable in peacetime that are proposed by some Western countries, such as relevant code of conduct on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace at the 2016-2017 UN GGE meetings. Such non-binding norms are intended to circumvent the advocacy of Russia and China to formulate new rules to regulate State behaviour regarding cybersecurity in the form of a treaty at the forum of the UN and may gradually harden into binding law.\n102. This argument likely explains why Cuba, Russia and China refused to explicitly affirm the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law in the cyber context in the 2017 UN GGE report, while having accepted the general applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace since the publication of the 2015 UN GGE consensus report. The crucial factor that prevented these States from reaching a consensus with the Western countries was the opposing camp's intention to introduce \"clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States' use of ICTs\" in the UN GGE report, which threatened to restrict States' right to regulate the content of and access to information. The UN GGE report is a non-binding statement, but it may serve as proof of State practice and *opinio juris* in ascertaining whether certain international law applies to a participating State signing onto the consensus report and the extent to which the included law limits the endorsing State's right to regulate domestic affairs. Although these countries have recognized the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict upon the adoption of the final UN GGE report, residual disagreements over how specific LOAC rules apply to ICT-related activities remain prominent between them and the Western countries.\n HUANG, above n.227, 34.\n HUANG Zhixiong, Norms of Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace: Origin, Impact and Response, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 68-69.\n Korzak, above n.70.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n103. The law governing the right to self-defence and means and methods of warfare is dominated by the practice of remarkably few established powers because the major ground of resorting to anticipatory self-defence and a large portion of LOAC is customary international law, which has been developed by these “specially affected” States to advance their interests. For newly rising powers such as China, failing to meet the requirements of “persistent objector” before and after the birth of a rule at concern would not relieve their obligation to comply. A successful example where a contrary practice of a large number of weaker States makes a few powerful States switch from an established rule of customary international law to an emerging new rule is rare. It is extremely difficult for a militarily disadvantaged State that lacks field experience to replicate such a strategy in areas involving force.\n104. To prevent coercive erosions of its sovereignty, China’s strategy is to embed a firewall at the most representative and democratic lawmaking forum to obstruct the convenient transplantation of power disparity from the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to the special regimes of international law that constitute cornerstones of an evolving global system of Internet governance. A treaty negotiated at a more egalitarian forum such as the UNGA would enable the Chinese perspectives to carry greater weight in forming international law among a large number of similarly disadvantaged countries. And lawmaking in the form of treaty allows a less advanced State such as China to pick and choose elastically from treaties and their provisions according to its goals.\nV. Conclusion\n105. To summarize, the above analyses suggest that behind China’s general and vague opposition to an explicit affirmation of the applicability of specific LOAC rules to cyberspace and the right of self-defence in cyberspace is China’s profound concern that doing so would acquiesce to the encroachment of its sovereignty and unlock Pandora’s box of coercive external interferences with its independence in determining the mode of domestic Internet governance and the path of development.\n106. Has China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and digital economy driven it to pursue a more proactive and enterprising approach to reshaping international law governing the domain of cyber\n Alan Boyle &amp; Christine Chinkin, The Making of International Law (2007), 28-29.\n Ibid., 29.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 311\nwarfare so as to build up a competitive advantage against the established powers? At first glance, Beijing's long-term resistance to confirming the applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace before the adoption of the final UN GGE report, amid the exaggerated normative rivalry between the Russia-China Camp and the US-EU Camp, appeared to corroborate this argument. However, closer scrutiny reveals that, the conceptual generalization and ambiguity in China's resisting stance stems from the same premises underpinning the mainstream \"wait and see\" approach of most States towards utilizing international law as the primary means to regulate or justify their cyberoperations. Following the \"wait and see\" trend of State practice, China has agreed to the general applicability of the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello*, and law on State responsibility for international wrongful acts, but still resists the applicability of some specific rules in cyberspace, e.g., the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules, to allow for flexibility in responding to cyber technology development in attribution and the evolvement of international law.\n107. Despite the recent developments in its cyber defensive capacity, China remains disadvantaged as a rising power with weaker military capacity and less normative influence. China's normative proposals, exemplified by the ICCIS, serves more as bargaining leverage to protect itself from being bound by the existing or emerging law supported by the established powers, but unfavourable to itself, and also to move the focus of international legal discourse from the paradigm of military responses to cyberattacks concentrated in the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to that of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. China's normative efforts are largely defensive, given that Beijing chooses to prioritize its interests in defending against possible use of force either triggered by an alleged cyberattack or carried out in the means of cyber operations, over its offensive interests in staying less constrained in the use of cyber force.\n108. Because of the special features of how existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* were made, the normative influence of China and its SCO allies is not sufficient, at this moment, to change the practice of the frequent users of force, to come up with a norm promising effective observance by these States, or to veto the formation of new law proposed by these States at concern. The return of sovereign control in cyberspace and the focus shift of international legal discourse result from a set of factors, e.g., the limitations of current technologies and existing law, with the normative efforts of the SCO members having contributed to this global trend.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n109. But these countries can still resist the imposition of non-consensual norms upon themselves in the domain of cyberspace, obstruct the codification of disfavoured norms, and influence how other States characterize and respond to a situation involving cyber operations. This is why the seemingly unfeasible idea of an international cyber disarmament treaty concluded under the framework of the UN remains on the table. The UNSC's monopoly of authorizing the use of force and the UNGA's feature as one of the most egalitarian forums for international lawmaking make the UN the favourable forum relied on by rising powers such as China to build resilience against other lawmaking processes where established powers play a greater role, e.g., the development of customary international law or soft law in less representative forums.",

To what extent and how the rise of a new great power will influence international law largely hinges upon the interaction between the rising power and the established powers that have dominated international legal discourse for centuries. The perspectives of China and the established powers differ substantially on many issues, especially those relating to sovereign equality, non-intervention and national security. This can be exemplified by China's perspectives on many issues of cyber warfare in the normative rivalry between the United States (US)-European Union (EU) Camp and the Russia-China Camp, which are competing to influence the making of international law, as well as other countries' domestic policies.²\n2. Through the International Code of Conduct for Information Security (ICCIS) first submitted to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2011³ and joint efforts in other forums such as the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT),⁴ the Russia-China Camp has advanced a sovereignty-based model of Internet governance, which respects cyberspace sovereignty and State independence and legitimizes domestic efforts\nReinterpreting the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and Military Intervention for Humanitarian Purposes, 6 Asian JIL (2016), 114.\n2 See, e.g., Kristen E.

The Russian proposal was adopted as a separate resolution attached to the revised treaty text. See Russian Federation, Proposals for the Work of the Conference, Revision 1 to Document 27-E, Proposed Art. 3A.2 (17 November 2012) (www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000188224.pdf); also International Telecommunication Union, Final Acts of the WCIT (Dubai, 2012), art. 1.1(a) (www.itu.int/en/wcit-12/Documents/final-acts-wcit-12.pdf).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 259\nto regulate the content of and access to information.⁵ The US-EU Camp strives to maintain the currently dominant multi-stakeholder model governed by diverse stakeholders, including governments, technical communities, the private sector and other civil society members.⁶ It does not accept the ICCIS, especially the domestic regulation on freedom of expression and association⁷ and the move towards greater sovereign control in cyberspace.⁸\n3. Notably, China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and the digital economy, especially following the 2008 global financial crisis, did not initially bolster its assertiveness in the international lawmaking procedures that seek to identify existing law or generate new law applicable to State behaviour in cyberspace. China was a low-key participant at the early stages of the UN Group of Government Experts on the Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of Security (“UN GGE”). Its behaviour was found to be passive and frequently concurring with Russia’s stance. The Chinese representatives attending earlier UN GGE meetings were technical officers from the Ministry of Communication rather than diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign affairs (MOFA).⁹ But later, China proved to be willing to act more actively and assertively when it was singled out and its fundamental domestic interests were threatened by the disfavoured norms proposed by the established powers.\n4. In reaction to these Western normative attempts, China has transformed from a low-profile, passive team player under the Russian leadership to a proactive actor that had formed its own agenda. China’s active pattern of behaviour was prompted by a 2010 speech by Hillary Clinton, former US Secretary\n⁵ ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(a), (c), (d), (f).\n⁶ US Office of the Secretary of Defense, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2013 (May 2013), 37 (https://fas.org/man/eprint/dod-china-2013.pdf); European Parliament Resolution of 22 November 2012 on the Forthcoming WCIT-12 of the International Telecommunications Union, and the Possible Expansion of the Scope of International Telecommunication Regulations, P7_TA(2012)0451 (22 November 2012), para.5 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52012IP0451).\n⁷ US Department of State, International Cyberspace Policy Strategy (March 2016) (per Public Law 114-113, Division N, Title IV, Section 402), 16-18 (https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/255732.pdf).\n⁸ Ibid.\n⁹ As noted in: Adam Segal, Chinese Cyber Diplomacy in a New Era of Uncertainty, Aegis Paper Series No. 1703, Hoover Institution (2017), 5-6 (www.lawfareblog.com/chinese-cyber-diplomacy-new-era-uncertainty-0).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nof State, that criticized China for limiting the freedom to access the Internet and conducting online censorship. Higher-level officials from the MOFA with expertise in cyber governance started to represent China in diplomatic activities.¹⁰ The ICCIS was developed to counter-balance the diplomatic momentum generated by a series of US activities, including Clinton’s speeches on freedom in cyberspace between 2010-2012, the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the 2011 Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace. Beijing viewed these activities as attempting to militarize cyberspace and maintain the dominance of the US in cyber governance by interfering in other States’ sovereign right to regulate cyberspace.¹¹\n5. In 2011, the first edition of the ICCIS was submitted two months before the London Conference, a United Kingdom (UK)-sponsored attempt in line with those of the US and their allies. The ICCIS called on States “not to use information and communications technologies (ICTs), including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies”, called for “peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security”, and emphasized “the important role of the UN in formulating international norms”.¹² An updated edition of the ICCIS with similar wording was circulated at the UNGA in 2015,¹³ possibly intended to gather wider support in the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures that harmed the US’s credibility in its continuous diplomatic attempts.\n6. The second World Internet Conference in 2015 marked the emergence of China’s own vision of global Internet governance that advocates both respect for sovereignty in cyberspace and international cooperation to “jointly build a community of shared future in cyberspace”. Chinese President XI Jinping highlighted the problems of the current global Internet governance system, including, among other things, the inadequate existing rules governing cyberspace that hardly reflect the perspectives of the majority of countries,\n¹⁰ As noted in ibid., 6.\n¹¹ Ibid., 4-5, 7.\n¹² ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(b), (j).\n¹³ International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the Letter dated 9 January 2015 from the Permanent Representatives of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russia Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations Addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

One proposal explicitly called on all countries to work together to “contain the abuse of information technology, oppose cyber surveillance and cyberattacks and reject arms race in cyberspace” and “push for the formulation of international cyberspace rules accepted by all parties as well as an international convention against terrorism in cyberspace, improve the legal assistance mechanism to fight cybercrimes and jointly uphold peace and security in cyberspace”.¹⁴\n7. The vision of “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” was further elaborated by the Organizing Committee of the World Internet Conference in 2019. It urged countries to oppose hostile activities, acts of aggression, cyberattacks, large-scale surveillance operations, unfounded accusations of cyberattacks against other countries and attempts to politicize cybersecurity issues; prevent arms race and military conflict in cyberspace; and remain committed to resolving disputes by peaceful means.¹⁵ In 2020, the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace was released amid the COVID-19 pandemic that underpinned the urgency of “achieving shared development, ensuring common security, realizing joint governance, and enjoying benefits”. This document emphasized the need to “exert the roles of the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) and the UN GGE, and support formulating codes, norms and principles of responsible State conduct in cyberspace that are acceptable to all parties under the UN framework”.¹⁶\n8. To assess the implications of China’s rise for the evolution of international law governing the use of force by States in cyberspace, this paper studies the normative initiatives and strategies employed by China in identifying rules of existing law and creating new law applicable to cyber warfare. In light of China’s sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance, Part II introduces the general stance of China on the adequacy of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to address cyber warfare.

Special attention is paid to legal controversies over the rules on cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities, the proportionality of cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and the targetability of certain categories of civilians. Part IV examines the rationales behind China's generalized normative proposal and its vague refusal to confirm the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello, while having recognized the general applicability of these two regimes to cyberspace. The last part concludes with a tentative assessment of the nature and the degree of China's normative influence over international lawmaking governing State behaviour in cyberspace and the possible momentum of China's policy in the future.",
    "II. China's general stance on applicable law governing cyber warfare": "## II.A. China's sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance\n9. On 1 March 2017, the MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration jointly issued the first international cyber policy paper of China—the International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (ISCC)—to comprehensively introduce and explain Beijing's policy and position on issues of cyber-related international affairs.¹⁷ At his daily press briefing following the release, the UN Secretary-General Spokesman Stéphane Dujarric described the ISCC as “a very important report” and suggested that “China has a big role to play” in global cyber governance.¹⁸ The linchpin of China’s cyber diplomacy is the idea of cyber sovereignty, around which China formulates its cybersecurity policies towards three primary objectives. The first is to protect its critical information infrastructure, cyber sovereignty, national security and domestic stability from threats posed by digital power disparity among countries, cybercrimes and cyber terrorism, and external interference with China’s internal\n¹⁷ Statement by Ambassador FU Cong in the Assembly Meeting of the UN Conference on Disarmament on International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (9 March 2017) (www.china-un.ch/eng/hom/t1444602.htm); also MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration, International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (1 March 2017) (www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zzjg_663340/jks_665232/kjlc_665236/qtwt_665250/t1442390.shtml) [hereinafter “ISCC”].\n¹⁸ Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General (2 March 2017) (www.un.org/press/en/2017/db170302.doc.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 263\naffairs. The second is to shape the current global Internet governance and promote the formation of a system of international legal norms in China's favour. The third objective is to convert China's increasing cyber capacity into soft power to mobilize and influence other countries' preferences.¹⁹ Chapter II lays out the three elements of China's proposed idea of cyber sovereignty—regulatory authority, non-interference and sovereign equality, and the security-oriented balanced approach.²⁰\n10. The appeal for cyber sovereignty by China and other like-minded countries takes place at a time when governments' sovereign power over cyberspace is in decline for many reasons, including but not limited to the privatization of cyberspace, the rise of non-State actors and the digital gap between the developed and developing countries. As evidenced by the first and second editions of the Tallinn Manual providing that \"a State may exercise control over cyber infrastructure and activity within its sovereign territory\",²¹ sovereignty in cyberspace is not a revisionist idea by itself. According to the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Manual 2.0, this premise, which was confirmed by the 2013 Report of the UN GGE,²² is now \"relatively well accepted by the international community\".²³ The US and its allies have held out to this idea in order to sustain the current platform governed by multi-stakeholders under their control.²⁴\n19 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter I: Opportunities and Challenges, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n20 Ibid., Chapter II: The Principle of Sovereignty.\n21 Michael Schmitt (general ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), Rule 1 [hereinafter \"Tallinn Manual\"]; also Michael Schmitt (general ed.) &amp; Liis Vihul (managing ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on The International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2017), Rule 1 [hereinafter \"Tallinn Manual 2.0\"].\n22 Report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

It is noteworthy that, among all the technical communities developing the \"law\" of the Internet and managing the global distribution of Internet resources in terms of naming and addresses,²⁵ the ISCC exclusively named the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and urged the international community to \"make [ICANN] a truly independent international institution, increase its representations and ensure greater openness and transparency in its decision-making and operation\".²⁶ ICANN has been a highly politicalized organization. It is a Californian corporation created by a 1998 Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Commerce to transfer the power to manage and oversee the domain name system (DNS) coordination from the US government to the global community. This agreement was supposed to terminate on 30 September 2000, while subject to further amendments.²⁷ The US government did not end its supervision until October 2016,²⁸ mainly in response to the calling of major Internet technical organizations for freeing ICANN from unilateral oversight of the US as a backlash from the Snowden Disclosures.²⁹ Yet, it is early to tell whether the globalization of ICANN can be genuinely realized, given that most of its key infrastructures remain in the US territory. The deprivation of the top domain of Iraq, \".iq\", by ICANN in the Iraq war under the undue influence of the US government,³⁰ the Snowden Disclosures, and the \"Vault 7\" documents released by WikiLeaks³¹ have demonstrated the capacity and motivation of the US to abuse its dominant position in global Internet governance under the current multi-stakeholder model.\n25 See generally Milton Mueller, Chapter 25: Communications and The Internet, in: Jacob Katz Cogan, Ian Hurd &amp; Ian Johnstone (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Organizations (2017), 539-542.\n26 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter IV: Plan of Action.\n27 Memorandum of Understanding Between The US Department of Commerce and ICANN (25 November 1998) (www.icann.org/resources/unthemed-pages/icannmou-1998-11-25-en).\n28 Dave Lee, Has the US Just Given Away the Internet?, BBC News (1 October 2016) (www.bbc.com/news/technology-37527719).\n29 Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation (10 October 2013) (www.icann.org/news/announcement-2013-10-07-en).\n30 See LIANG Yabin, Cyberspace is the New Battlefield for Game of States in the Big Data Era, Study Times (20 October 2014) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/1020/c40531-25866183.html).\n31 See, e.g., Wikileaks Exposes CIA Interference in French Presidential Elections, The European Union Times (16 February 2017) (www.eutimes.net/2017/02/wikileaks-exposes-cia-interference-in-french-presidential-elections/).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 265\n12. The label “multi-stakeholder” was only applied to ICANN in the wake of the battles over Internet governance initiated by national governments, which are treated as “stakeholders” on an equal footing with private corporates and members of civil society, during and after the World Summit on the Information Society, as political rhetoric to mobilize non-State actors to help resist governmental interference into Internet governance and to simultaneously make the established self-governance model more palatable to States and the UN system.³² ICANN is a global Internet governance organization possessing monopoly power over the DNS, but it is only subject to the sole jurisdiction of the US under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law.³³ Due to the anticipated objection of the US, to put ICANN under the oversight of the international community of sovereign States³⁴ proves difficult to attain. And an equivalent alternative to ICANN would be not only costly but also highly disruptive for Internet users.³⁵\n13. Aside from open participation, ICANN is not subject to any classic form of internal accountability that commonly exists in private corporations and nonprofit organizations, such as direct accountability mechanisms based on membership or shareholders in the Regional Internet Registries and the open, bottom-up, consensus-based standardization process of the Internet Engineering Task Force.³⁶ Although ICANN self-identifies as championing the bottom-up, consensus-driven, multi-stakeholder model of governance, its policy-making processes manifest a top-down hierarchy, in which issues raised from the grassroots level end up as policy recommendations to be voted at the Board of Directors.³⁷ The Board has “near-absolute” power over the bylaws governing the entirety of processes and can “untrammeled[ly]” decide whether to accept these recommendations in the absence of any binding forms of appeal or review. While anyone can join most of ICANN’s volunteer Working Groups to express their views and have the views considered based\n32 Mueller, above n.25, 546.\n33 Milton Mueller, ICANN, Inc.: Accountability and Participation in the Governance of Critical Internet Resources, Internet Governance Project (2009), 7 (www.internet-governance.org/wp-content/uploads/ICANNInc.pdf).\n34 See, e.g., Political Oversight of ICANN: A Briefing for the WSIS Summit, Concept Paper by the Internet Governance Project (1 November 2005) (www2.world-governance.org/IMG/pdf_political-oversight_internet_governance.pdf).\n35 Mueller, above n.33, 5.\n36 Ibid., 4-5.\n37 How Does ICANN Work?

The critical details and implementations of these contracts are negotiated bilaterally between ICANN and the registrars/registries, largely beyond the influence of general policies developed in the bottom-up representative processes.⁴⁰ To summarize, ICANN seems to employ open participation as a substitute for other missing and more effective accountability mechanisms.⁴¹\n14. In the ISCC, China advocates shifting from the present multi-stakeholder model of global Internet governance to a multilateral State-centric model. In the latter model, a wide range of actors are encouraged to make their respective contributions based on their capacity in the multilateral decision-making processes led by governments, particularly regarding public policies and security.⁴² China favours the UN as the principal forum to coordinate positions of various parties and build international consensus, while other international mechanisms and platforms are called on to complement based on their comparative advantage.⁴³ The establishment of “multilateral, democratic, and transparent international Internet government systems” is listed as a major goal in the Thirteenth Five-Year-Plan for China’s economic and social development from 2016 to 2020.⁴⁴\n## II.B. International normative discourses\n15. The fundamentally divergent approaches to global Internet governance have driven China and the US to contrasting views on the adequacy of existing international law to address cybersecurity issues. The US and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies insist that prevailing\n38 Ibid.\n39 Mueller, above n.33, 2, 15.\n40 Mueller, above n.25, 541.\n41 Mueller, above n.33, 8.\n42 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter II: The Principle of Sovereignty.\n43 Ibid., Chapter II: The Principle of Shared Governance.\n44 National People’s Congress, Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Guomin Jingji he Shehui Fazhan di Shisange Wunian Guihua Gangyao [Outline of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the People’s Republic of China (2016-2020)] (March 2016), Chapter 28: Strengthen Information Security.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 267\ninternational law, including the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello* and relevant rules concerning State responsibility for international wrongful acts apply to cyberspace, and that the existing international legal framework is adequate to accommodate novel situations in the information age.⁴⁵\n16. China’s position on the adequacy of existing international law had not crystalized until the 2013 UN GGE meeting. Since then, China has accepted, in principle, the general applicability of relevant international law to cyberspace.⁴⁶ Despite this, China has maintained that international lawmaking is demanded to address the issues that are not clearly dealt with by existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, as parallel paths to further study the applicability of these two regimes’ established rules to cyber warfare from the perspectives of “maintaining international security, strategic mutual trust and preventing cyber conflicts”.⁴⁷\n17. Although the 2017 ISCC is not written in legal language, it calls for “formulating universally accepted international rules and norms of state behaviour in cyberspace within the framework of the UN” towards the ultimate goal of a “rule-based” global governance system in cyberspace.⁴⁸ Rather than using the word “codifying”, China opted for “formulating” and emphasized the universal acceptance of rules by countries. This wording reveals China’s reluctance to recognize the applicability of some *already existing* rules of international law to cyberspace, mainly because of the under-representation of developing countries in global cyber governance. In its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the Chinese government also stated that it would “take an active role in formulating international rules in areas such as the Internet”.⁴⁹\n⁴⁵ The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World (May 2011), 9 (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf); also Brian J.

In its efforts to achieve these objectives, Beijing has been increasingly active in various multilateral lawmaking forums, particularly major UN platforms such as the UNGA, UN GGE, the UN Expert Group on Combating Cybercrime and International Telecommunication Union. For example, along with the promotion of the concepts of cyber sovereignty and “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” at the World Internet Conference, a State-run annual international forum focusing on the development, use and governance of the Internet, underlying elements of these concepts have also been advocated in China’s Position Paper at the UNGA since 2014 to maintain the momentum and build consensus. These elements include: (1) peaceful use of cyberspace for economic and social development; (2) objection to cyber war and arms race; (3) the development of an international code of conduct for cyberspace under the UN framework that is acceptable to all, such as the two versions of the ICCIS; (4) strengthened international cooperation to combat cybercrimes such as cyber terrorism; and (5) objection to any country’s attempt to overstretch the concept of national security to restrict ICT development and cooperation among other countries or to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs.⁵⁰\n19.

These comprehensive and issue-specific normative initiatives unfold the usage of issue linkage under China's overall scheme of the legal framework governing cyberspace, under which the issues of the development and use of the Internet, cyber and data security, cybercrimes, cyber governance and cyber warfare that transcend different fields of international law are simultaneously placed on the agenda of international lawmaking to keep this bundle of issues at the frontline.\n20. In light of the digital divide between the developed and developing countries and the inequitable order of the existing international legal system, China has been aligning normative efforts at regional and South-South forums such as the BRICS, Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO), the ASEAN Regional Forum, China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in support of lawmaking activities at the UN.⁵³ The progress China has made in enhancing agenda-shaping and coalition-building capacities can be exemplified by the agenda item of \"International Law in Cyberspace\" proposed by China for the 53rd Annual Session of the AALCO⁵⁴ and the data security cooperation initiative signed between the Arab League and China.⁵⁵\n21.

In the context of cyber warfare, the US position is that existing LOAC, including its principles of distinction, necessity, and proportionality, applies in cyberspace.59 By contrast, China, Russia, and other SCO members have not agreed to the US stance and played a rival role. In the 2013 Report of the UN GGE, China and Russia managed to exclude any reference to the applicability of international humanitarian law principles in cyberspace, despite the controversial affirmation of the applicability of \"international law\" and the UN Charter.60 The 2015 UN GGE Report explicitly \"notes\" the possible applicability of \"the established international legal principles, including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction\", while cautiously avoiding making any reference to international humanitarian law.61 The wording of this text fails to clarify whether the UN GGE reached a consensus on the applicability of these LOAC principles to cyber activities or merely noted their existence. Moreover, although the 2015 UN GGE Report mentions the prohibition on the threat or use of force against any State's territorial integrity or political independence,62 it does not refer to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks amounting to use of force as an exception to such general prohibition. Instead, this UN GGE similarly\n57 The White House Office of the Press Secretary, Fact Sheet: President XI Jinping's State Visit to the United States (25 September 2015) (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinping-state-visit-united-states).\n58 US Department of Justice, First China-US Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue, Summary of Outcomes (9 October 2017) (www.justice.gov/opa/pr/first-us-china-law-enforcement-and-cybersecurity-dialogue).\n59 Harold Hongju Koh, International Law in Cyberspace, 54 Harvard ILJ (2012), 4-5.\n60 Above n.22, paras.19, 23.\n61 Report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Development in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the context of International Security, UN Doc.

Without an explicit official position, Beijing's stance on many occasions has been found to be general yet frequently in line with Russia's efforts to negotiate an international arms control treaty on the use and non-proliferation of information weapons.^^ For example, the 2011 ICCIS proposes \"not to use ICTs, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies\", and calls for \"peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security\".^^ In the updated ICCIS circulated at the UNGA in 2015, the controversial terms of \"proliferate information weapons\" is omitted, and the original paragraph is replaced by \"not to use ICTs and information and communications networks to carry out activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security\".^^\n24. The ISCC pronounces China's consistent opposition to certain countries' \"Cold War Mentality\" in characterizing international relations in cyberspace as a \"zero-sum game\" and abusing the predominant position in global Internet governance to secure advantages by militarization and deterrence build-up in cyberspace.^^ By calling the international community to adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, particularly non-use of force and peaceful settlement of disputes, the ISCC articulates the idea of upholding peace through international cooperation and safeguarding a country's own security that underpins \"common security\" of the international community of States \"on the basis of full respect for other countries' security\".^^ Specifically, the ISCC proposes that \"all countries must oppose ICT-backed acts of hostility and aggression, prevent arms race and conflicts in cyberspace and settle disputes through peaceful means\"; China plans to work with other countries to \"curb the abuse of information technology and prevent arms race\n^^ Ibid., para.28(c).\n^^ As noted in: John Markoff and Andrew E.

While the ISCC discourages militarization of cyberspace, China plans to enhance its “defense capability in cyberspace” and “expedite the development of a cyber force” with the aim to “prevent a major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security and maintain national security and social stability”.69\n25. At the UN GGE’s fifth session in 2017, the 25 participating States could not reach a consensus, particularly over the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. It was reported that the US sought “clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States’ use of ICTs”, including international humanitarian law, the right to self-defence, the law of State responsibility, and countermeasures. Cuba, backed by Russia and China which similarly opposed such an explicit affirmation, argued that following the manuscript of the US would militarize cyberspace and “legitimize unilateral punitive force actions” by “States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs”. Consequently, this session concluded without issuing a consensus report.70\n26. In December 2018, the First Committee of the UNGA adopted two resolutions to continue the international discussions of norms on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace by establishing two parallel working processes: one is a new GGE sponsored mainly by the US,71 and the other is the OEWG proposed by Russia that allows all interested Member States to participate in further studying the existing rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour identified by the previous UN GGE reports. The OEWG is also mandated, “if necessary, to introduce changes to them or elaborate additional rules of behaviour”.72 As mentioned previously, China endorsed both the OEWG and the UN GGE in the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community With a Shared Future in Cyberspace released in 2020. Notably, the resolution establishing the OEWG introduces a new issue, namely, “the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives,\n69 Ibid.\n70 See, e.g., Elaine Korzak, UN GGE on Cybersecurity: The End of an Era?, The Diplomat (31 July 2017) (https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/un-gge-on-cybersecurity-have-china-and-russia-just-made-cyberspace-less-safe/).\n71 UNGA, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

In May 2021, the 2019-2020 UN GGE completed its mission by adopting a consensus final report to be subsequently endorsed by the UNGA. China is among the 25 countries from which UN GGE experts were appointed. The final report explicitly notes the applicability of international humanitarian law “only in situations of armed conflict” and recalls “the established international legal principles including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction” noted in the 2015 report. In the same paragraph, what comes alongside the reference to LOAC is the UN GGE’s recognition of “the need for further study on how and when these principles apply to the use of ICTs by States” and emphasis that “these principles by no means legitimizes or encourages conflict”.76 Simultaneously, the report provides that in their use of ICTs, States must not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State and shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN.77 The text of the final UN GGE report seems to have adopted the prudent approach of the OEWG. It also demonstrates that China has\n73 Ibid., 3.\n74 UNGA, Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States, UN Doc.

Possible explanations for China’s opposition\n28. China’s stance on the applicability of LOAC to cyberspace is still evolving with the dynamic international environment, partly explaining why Beijing has refrained from specifying rationales for its resistance to some LOAC rules and how they govern ICT-related activities. Although limited in number, several statements made by Chinese officials on international occasions shed light on this question.\n29. At the 2013 Seoul Conference on Cyberspace, HUANG Huikang, then Legal Adviser of the MOFA, underlined the overemphasis on “making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defence, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized” and “the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace”.78 At the 6th US-China Internet Industry Forum, the Chinese delegation further pointed to the numerous “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” regarding methods and means of cyber warfare, arguing for the incompetence of existing norms to address new sophisticated problems stemming from ICT development.79\n30. At the 7th US-China Internet Industry Forum in 2015, MA Xinmin, then Deputy Director-General of the Department of Treaty and Law of the MOFA, acknowledged that in principle, existing international law, including “the purposes and principles of the [UN] Charter, such as *jus ad bellum* rule of non-use of force except in self-defence or under UN Security Council’s (SC) authorization [...] and international humanitarian law among others shall be directly applicable to cyberspace.”80 However, he emphasized that applying existing LOAC rules to cyber warfare should be conducted “with great caution”, because of the lack of State practice on cyber warfare\n78 MOFA, Working Together to Build a Harmonious and Progressive International Cyberspace Order, Remarks by Dr HUANG Huikang at the Seoul Conference on Cyberspace (17 October 2013), (www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cgmb/chn/wjbxw/P020131021538048406901.doc).\n79 Statement by the Chinese Delegation at the 6th US-China Internet Industrial Forum, 2013 Chinese YIL, 666-67.\n80 MA, above n.46.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 275\nand the peculiarities of cyberspace, including many legal and technical issues, e.g., identification, tracing and establishment of State responsibility, that are yet to be solved for the application of LOAC to cyberspace.⁸¹ MA also warned of the threats of “aggravating cyberspace militarization and arms race” and the corresponding “pushing for the application of laws of war in that scenario”. He argued that the viewpoints of some States and scholars reflected in the Tallinn Manual illustrate the “military paradigm” of “response to cyberattacks that disregards the principle of non-use of force in international law but over-emphasizes such exceptions as the right to self-defence”, which “clearly does not conform to the international reality and actual needs”.⁸²\n31. In a subsequent paper, MA elaborated that the prevailing challenges States need to address are threats to cybersecurity in times of peace, most of which either are launched by non-State actors and fall under the scope of domestic law, or do not qualify as “use of force” or “armed attacks” governed by international law that apply in times of war but constitute international wrongful acts regulated by the law on State responsibility. In the latter situations, the victim State should first resort to peaceful means such as legal countermeasures or UNSC sanctions, rather than use of force. Accordingly, MA called for both further scrutiny of the applicability of existing rules of the jus ad bellum or the jus in bello to cyberspace and international lawmaking designated for the issues not addressed by these two regimes.⁸³\n32. Quasi-authoritative Chinese sources similarly argue that some Western countries attempt to militarize the Internet through insisting on applying existing rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace.⁸⁴ The Liberation Army Daily straightforwardly criticizes the US for utilizing the Tallinn Manual project to “find legal basis for its cyber warfare policies and military customs”, to maintain the dominant control of the West in cyberspace.⁸⁵\n⁸¹ Ibid., para.24.\n⁸² Ibid., paras.20, 23.\n⁸³ MA, above n.47.\n⁸⁴ See, e.g., Zhong Sheng, The United States Bears Primary Responsibility for Halting Cyber War, People’s Daily (7 February 2013) (http://cpc.people.com.cn/pinglun/n/2013/0207/c78779-20456593.html).\n⁸⁵ LI Ying, The NATO to Find Legal Basis for Manipulation of Cyberspace, Liberation Army Daily (24 October 2014) (www.chinanews.com/mil/2014/10-24/6712323.shtml).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n33. China's concern over the significant power disparity in Internet technology and cyber infrastructure between it and developed countries partly explains its long-term resistance to applying existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyber warfare prior to the adoption of the final UN GGE report. For example, the following description frequently appeared on Chinese mainstream media: \"The global Internet is built upon 13 [Internet Protocol version (IPv) 4] root servers, 10 of which, including the only key root server, are located in the US. Theoretically, this gives the US the ultimate power to destroy the entire Internet infrastructure of any country.\"⁸⁶ The deprivation of Iraq's top domain by ICANN during the Iraq war is another frequently cited supporting example.⁸⁷ To tackle the issue, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently approved establishing a DNS root server and a corresponding operating organization by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, along with a plan to upgrade the network infrastructure for the IPv6-based network and encourage large-scale adoption of the IPv6 network.⁸⁸\n34. The mainstream view of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual produced under the auspices of NATO is that: By its essence, the Tallinn Manual is not a re-statement or clarification of existing international law but involves the making of new rules on cyber warfare that reflects the distinctive practice and vested interests of the NATO members.⁸⁹ Chinese scholars also highlighted the geographical limitation in the member selection of the Tallinn\n⁸⁶ See, e.g., LI Yi, Chinese Internet, Please Keep the “Root”, Beijing Daily (24 January 2014) (http://news.sina.com.cn/pl/2014-01-22/015929310615.shtml).\n⁸⁷ LIANG, above n.30.\n⁸⁸ Xinhua, China Greenlights Establishment of Root Server, China.org.cn (8 December 2019) (http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/201912/08/content_WS5dec361ec6d0bcf8c4c1882d.html); Xinhua, China Steps up Deploying IPv6-based Network, China.org.cn (3 May 2019) (www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/03/c_138031821.htm).\n⁸⁹ See, e.g., DING Libai &amp; ZHU Jing, Tallinn Manual Defines and Reflects on Cyber Attack “Force”, 36 Hebei Faxue [Hebei L Sci] (2018), 84; HUANG Zhixiong, Application of International Law in Cyberspace: Establishing Rules of the Game, 38 Huanqiu Falv Pinglun [Global LR] (2016), 13; HUANG Zhixiong, International Legal Issues concerning “Cyber Warfare” and Strategies for China: Focusing on the Field of Jus ad Bellum, 37 Xiandai Faxue [Modern L Sci] (2015), 154; CHEN Qi, Cybersecurity, Cyber War and International Law: From the Perspective of Tallinn Manual, 7 Zhengzhi yu Falv [P Sci L] (2014), 153-56; XU Yijie, Watch Out for the “Tallinn Manual” Used by the NATO to Make “Rules of Cyber War”, 10 Zhongguo Dangzheng Ganbu Luntan [Chinese Cadres Tribune] (2013), 98-99.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 277\nManual independent International Group of Experts.⁹⁰ Critiques of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual concentrate on its *jus ad bellum* part, particularly section 2, “the use of force”. Specifically, many scholars consider that the Tallinn Manual’s threshold on what cyber operations constitute the use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is too low. In their view, the majority of the selected International Group of Experts, who are supporters of Michael Schmitt’s “scale and effects” approach,⁹¹ artificially create some situations that have never taken place to prove that cyberattacks can result in analogous scale and effects of kinetic and non-kinetic forces. A direct transplantation of existing *jus ad bellum* to cyberspace arguably goes beyond the current practice of most States.⁹² Another major concern of Chinese scholars is that, rather than regulating the means and methods of cyber warfare, the sponsors of the Tallinn Manual intend to seek legal bases to initiate cyber or even kinetic wars. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual extensively interprets a country’s right of self-defence against non-State actors and anticipatory self-defence against an imminent threat of cyber operations. They hence argue for a higher bar than the Tallinn Manual requirements for invoking the right of self-defence within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter.⁹³\n35. Given the unique features of cyber operations, it can be observed that China has been hesitant about applying specific LOAC rules to the cyber context. What are the “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” that prevent China from embracing LOAC and the Tallinn Manual at present? In the absence of any official policy, non-authoritative sources shed light on specific controversies focused on the principles of distinction and proportionality in cyberspace.⁹⁴\n⁹⁰ See, e.g., JIANG Yamin, Cyber Great Power Needs to Pay Attention to International Cybersecurity Strategies, People.com, (19 March 2015) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2015/0319/c386965-26716864.html).\n⁹¹ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 11.\n⁹² See, e.g., above n.89, DING &amp; ZHU, 85-86; HUANG (2016), 10-11; HUANG (2015), 150; CHEN, 154.\n⁹³ See, e.g., above n.89, HUANG (2016), 8-9; HUANG (2015), 152; CHEN, 154-55.\n⁹⁴ See, e.g., LI Bojun, Cyber War and the Applicability of the Law of Armed Conflict, 31 Faxue Pinglun [LR] (2013), 62-63; WANG Kongxiang, Legal Questions and Regulation of Civilian Participation in Cyber War, 5 Fazhi Yanjiu [Research on Rule of L] (2013), 100-09; CHEN, above n.89, 158; CAI Lihong, Challenges to the Principle of Distinction by Information Attacks and Strategies, 24 Xian Zhengzhi Xueyuan Xuebao [J Xi’an P Inst PLA] (2011), 95-96.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nFirst, the existence of an armed conflict permits the use of lethal force based solely on the status of an individual or object. Some Chinese scholars argue that cyberattacks, in light of the latest level of technology, are not controllable so as to constrain their effects within the boundaries of military objects and therefore indiscriminate in nature.95 The 2007 nation-wide denial-of-service attacks sweeping over Estonian Internet infrastructure, including the websites and systems of its Parliament, banks, ministries and media, was cited as a typical example of indiscriminate cyberattack,96 although whether there was an armed conflict and whether such activities amounted to attacks within the meaning of LOAC is disputable. Given such practical difficulties in applying the principle of “distinction” in cyberwar, some scholars suspect the application of LOAC will open a gate for illegitimate cyber and kinetic attacks leading to humanitarian disasters.97 For example, despite its title—“Duty of care during attacks on dams, dykes, and nuclear electrical generating stations”, Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, along with the US policy that categorizes enemy “war-sustaining” objects as lawful targets, is framed as a disguised affirmation of the legitimacy of attacks on critical, yet highly dangerous infrastructures.98 The Internet was originally designed in a way capable of being immediately transformed from war-supporting civil facilities to war-fighting objects, making the majority of its components dual-use objects. Overwhelming reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure would dramatically expand the scope of targetable objects under LOAC. Accordingly, recognizing the applicability of the LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks in cyberspace would be tantamount to authorizing attacks against critical dual-use infrastructures, rendering mass civilians vulnerable to the adverse impacts of not only cyberattacks but also kinetic ones.\nSecond, since the civilian aspect of dual-use cyber infrastructures is relevant only to the attack requirements for proportionality and precaution, the “proportionality” of attacks against objects highly dependent upon Internet or computer control systems is another worrying issue. One scholar quotes John\n95 Ibid., WANG, 107; LIANG, above n.30.\n96 Scheherazade Rehman, Estonia’s Lessons in Cyberwarfare, US News (14 January 2013) (www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/01/14/estonia-shows-how-to-build-a-defense-against-cyberwarfare).\n97 CAI, above n.94; CUI Wenbo, The Influence on Chinese Cyber Security Interest of Tallinn Manual, 15 Jiangnan Shehui Xueyuan Xuebao [J Jiangnan Soc U] (2013), 24.\n98 CAI, above n.94, 95; ibid., CUI.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 279\nHamre, former US Deputy Defense Secretary, who is skeptical about the feasibility of using cyber operations to achieve the designated military objectives, to demonstrate the unexpected collateral damages caused by cyberattacks.⁹⁹ This scholar also considers the current rule of the proportionality of attacks, which factors “the incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damages to civilian objects, or a combination thereof” into assessing whether such collateral damages would be excessive in relation to “the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”,¹⁰⁰ as inadequate protection of civilian interests and suggests adding “knock-on effects” into consideration.¹⁰¹\nThird, the distinction between civilian noncombatants and civilians who directly participate in hostilities used to be not an appealing question for Chinese scholars, not only because the Chinese military does not have a tradition of employing civilian contractors, but also because China has not sent its troops to the battlefield for more than thirty years. To reduce costs and obtain technical expertise, the increasing usage of civilians to operate cyberattacks, maintain information weapons, or support cyber combat operations by States has further eroded the distinction between combatants and civilians.¹⁰² It is reasonable for the Chinese military, government and some State-owned-enterprise to recruit civilians for activities related to cyber warfare. Although the law that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities or who adopts a continuous combat function may be lawfully attacked is not in dispute, the targetability of a civilian who assists with cyber operations depends on the answers to two questions: which people are targetable and when they may be targeted. Some Chinese scholars argue that, due to the technical predicament of identity verification and attribution, the applicable LOAC rules fail to provide certainty and predictability for the determination of individual status.¹⁰³\nFourth, another issue closely related to China’s opposition to applying some LOAC rules to cyberspace, namely, what acts may constitute a resort to\n⁹⁹ Ibid., CAI, 96, quoting from Is it Real?

It is a separate question under the jus in bello, without prejudice to the question of “use of force” within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Annex 1 to this Agreement defines “information war” as:\nconfrontation between two or more states in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining political, economic and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to taking decisions in the interest of an opposing party[.].¹⁰⁴\nAlthough it remains unsettled whether and when an armed conflict, international or non-international, can commence based on a single cyber exchange, the SCO Agreement’s definition of war clearly expands the traditional meaning of armed conflict caused by conventional force under LOAC. Assuming that the term “war” in Annex 1 is not utilized as rhetoric, but rather as the reference of “armed conflict” within the meaning of LOAC, we may tentatively argue that the SCO members consider the existing LOAC’s scope of regulation as underinclusive because it fails to include the cyber actions that can generate political, economic, social and even psychological consequences into the realm of LOAC.",
    "III. Examining China’s perspectives on specific rules of LOAC": "36. This part examines the legal or practical grounds supporting China’s views on the four mentioned issues of LOAC. In doing so, this part presents the general contour of various opinions on specific topics, encompassing State practice, positions of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and applicable Tallinn rules. Relevant treaty provisions and judgments of international judicial bodies will be referred to, if available.\n¹⁰⁴ Annex 1 to the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (16 June 2009), List of Basic Terms in the Field of International Information Security (http://cn.io.gov.mo/Legis/International/record/1280.aspx) (Chinese only) and (https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf) (non-official English translation).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 281\n## III.A. Cyberattacks regulated by LOAC\n37. Common Article 2 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 defines an international armed conflict as any “declared war or any other armed conflict which may arise two or more States”, regardless of whether any of them recognizes the state of war. In *Tadić*, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found “an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State.”¹⁰⁵ Undoubtedly, cyberattacks accompanying any kinetic use of force fall under the sphere of LOAC. As with cyber warfare, the pertinent question is whether a single cyber exchange in the absence of any conventional use of force can trigger an international armed conflict by itself.\n38. The notion “resort to armed force” is not defined under LOAC and is easily confused with the usage of “use of force” under the *jus ad bellum*. Nevertheless, the different objects and purposes of these two regimes entail distinct legal tests of “force”. The *jus ad bellum* specifically regulates inter-State relations and States’ lawful use of force, seeking to maintain peaceful relations among nations by setting up strict conditions for invoking forceful measures, “when States may move beyond non-forceful measures such as diplomacy, economic sanctions, and countermeasures”.¹⁰⁶ By contrast, the *jus in bello* regulates the behaviour of parties to an armed conflict, and its object and purpose are to protect the military and civilian victims of war by prohibiting the harms caused by armed attacks during a conflict that are either unnecessary to effectively accomplish legitimate military objectives or excessive in relation to them.¹⁰⁷ The *jus in bello* does not govern whether the use of force is legitimate under the *jus ad bellum* but imposes restrictions on methods and means of warfare.\n39.

Tadić, ICTY Appeals Chamber, Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction (2 October 1995), Case No. IT-94-1-A, para.70.\n¹⁰⁶ Michael Schmitt, “Attack” as a Term of Art in International Law: The Cyber Operations Context, in: Christine Czosseck, Rain Ottis &amp; Katharina Ziolkowski (eds.), Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (2012), 284.\n¹⁰⁷ Cordula Droege, Get off My Cloud: Cyber Warfare, International Humanitarian Law, and the Protection of Civilians, 94 IR Red Cross (2012), 545.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nConventions defines “attack” within the meaning of LOAC as “acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence”.¹⁰⁸ By concentrating on the term “violence”, Article 49(1) provides a feasible way to access cyberattacks by analogy to the physical violent effects caused by kinetic attacks. The threshold concept of “attack” is selected in light of LOAC’s object and purpose, since only acts that qualify as attacks would be subject to many of its core prohibitions and restrictions. Only qualified attacks would trigger a wide range of legal protections for the civilian population and objects under LOAC. In most cases, an unqualified act beyond the realm of LOAC would fall under the domain of domestic and international human rights law. So far, there appears to be a consensus that as long as a cyber operation attributable to a State has the equivalent effects of kinetic forces, such as death, physical injury to persons, or damages to objects, it would trigger an international armed conflict.¹⁰⁹ Similarly, Rule 30 of the Tallinn Manual suggests that the “armed force” criterion is fulfilled when a cyber operation is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to person or damage or destruction to objects.¹¹⁰ A majority of the independent experts participating in the Tallinn Manual project favour including “loss of functionality” in the definition of damages, although there are various shades of opinions among them.¹¹¹\n40. The ICRC Commentary states that the term “attack” means “combat action”, without further elaboration.¹¹² A paper written by the Head of the ICRC’s Operational Law indicates that the ICRC considers the consequence-based approach as “insufficient to capture the whole range of possible effects of cyber operations and the damage that they can cause, which will not\n108 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 49(1).\n109 Nils Melzer, Cyberwarfare and International Law, UN Institute for Disarmament Research Publications (2011), 24 (https://unidir.org/files/publications/pdfs/cyberwarfare-and-international-law-382.pdf); Michael Schmitt, Classification of Cyber Conflict, 17 JCSL (2012), 251, n.25; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (2012), 131; Droege, above n.107, 546; Knut Dörmann, Applicability of the Additional Protocols to Computer Network Attacks, ICRC Resource Centre (19 November 2004), 3 (www.icrc.org/en/doc/resources/documents/misc/68lg92.htm).\n110 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 30, 106.\n111 Ibid., 108-09.\n112 Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski &amp; Bruno Zimmermann (eds.), Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 (1987), para.1880.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 283\nnecessarily resemble the physical effects of traditional weapons\".¹¹³ Given adequate consideration to the object and purpose of LOAC and the concerns of a gap in protection, especially the protection of civilians from the effects of war, that paper seems to endorse the \"loss of functionality\" approach adopted by the majority view of the Tallinn Manual. Based on this approach, whether a cyber operation amounts to an attack depends on whether it causes the target to lose function, even if the target is not physically damaged.¹¹⁴\n41. States may support the dysfunction approach since cyber operations would be more frequently resorted, not to physically destroy or damage objects, which can be accomplished by using kinetic force, but rather to incapacitate or disrupt the normal functioning of a vital military or dual-use infrastructure.¹¹⁵ For instance, an electrical grid or water supply system might be shut down, and a country's banking or stock-trading system could be manipulated, both without any physical damage. As is demonstrated by the 2007 Estonian denial-of-service attacks, for certain civilian populations, the potential hardship arising from such dysfunction could be far more extensive or severe than the physical destruction of a particular building. Such effects might not be comparable to those caused by physical violence, but they are \"precisely the kind of severe consequences from which [LOAC] seeks to protect the civilian population\".¹¹⁶\n42. According to the dysfunction approach, cyberattacks against military or dual-use infrastructure, such as paralyzing information systems, altering or deleting processes and resources, are attacks that can trigger the application of LOAC, while applying the consequence-based approach would lead to a contrary conclusion. The applicable LOAC rule maintains that cyberattacks resulting in no physical damage are lawful.¹¹⁷ The US-EU camp intends to stay with the existing rule and has codified it in the Tallinn Manual. Although international law evolves to reflect the changing values developed by the international community, most States remain silent on this issue. Whether LOAC should expand its established interpretation of attacks depends on future State practice.\n¹¹³ Droege, above n.107, 546.\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 546-47.\n¹¹⁵ Ibid.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid., 549.\n¹¹⁷ Schmitt, above n.106, 291.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n43. Part of the SCO Agreement defines war as the “confrontation between two or more States in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes, and resources, critical and other structures”. Under this part of the definition, those confrontations that happen without any physical damages would not qualify as attacks and therefore be lawful under LOAC. The remaining part, namely, inter-State confrontations in cyberspace aimed at “undermining political, economic, and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to [take] decisions in the interest of an opposing party”, is unlikely to fall into the scope of attacks under LOAC either.\n44. On Article 49 of Additional Protocol I, the *Bothe, Partsch and Solf Commentary* underlines that attacks refer to “those aspects of military operations that most directly affect the safety of the civilian population and the integrity of civilian objects”.¹¹⁸ It would be difficult to assert that political, economic, social, or even psychological effects of cyber operations could be deemed most directly affecting the personal safety of civilians or the physical integrity of civilian objects. Dissemination of propaganda, espionage, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological or economic warfare does not fall under the concept of attack in LOAC.¹¹⁹\n45. LOAC endeavours to regulate methods and means of war and the treatments of different groups. Under LOAC, a State wants to protect its civilian population and objects, and at the same time, be able to use lethal force against the belligerent party once an armed conflict commences. An overinclusive definition of “attack” will subject the civilian population to catastrophic consequences that would have been avoided by applying the present definition with a high threshold. Such consideration partly explains why most States remain silent in the face of cyberattacks.¹²⁰\n46. The SCO Agreement’s definition of war demonstrates the six countries’ concerns of adverse impacts by acts that do not qualify as attacks and coincides with Russia’s proposal for non-proliferation of information weapons. But, unlike biological and chemical weapons, the usage of so-called information weapons does not necessarily lead to unnecessary suffering of humans\n¹¹⁸ Michael Bothe, Karl Josef Partsch &amp; Waldemar A. Solf, New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts: Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (1982), 325.\n¹¹⁹ Ibid., 289.\n¹²⁰ See, e.g., Gary Brown, Why Iran didn’t admit Stuxnet was an attack, 63 Joint Force Quarterly (2011), 71.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 285\nand might even reduce physical harm compared to the usage of conventional forces regarding the accomplishment of the same military objective. This feature of information weapons makes them not a proper subject matter for a total (or partial) ban. By their features and consequences, unqualified cyberattacks are more suitable to be regulated by regimes other than LOAC for the time being. As demonstrated by the final UN GGE report, leading SCO members, including China, Russia, and Kazakhstan, no longer dispute the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict, although controversies over, for example, the qualification of single cyber exchange as attacks under the meaning of LOAC, remain unsettled. Hence, the SCO members may continue to advance the broad interpretation of “attack” to build up consensus for new norms while resisting the application of the existing LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks.\n## III.B. Dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities\n47. As a “cardinal principle”¹²¹ of LOAC, the principle of distinction requires that a distinction be made between military and civilian persons and objects and prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. Article 52(1) of Additional Protocol I defines “civilian objects” in a negative manner as “all objects which are not military objectives”.¹²² Military objectives are those “by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage”.¹²³ According to Rule 39 of the Tallinn Manual, an object cannot be civilian and military simultaneously; its status is either one or the other.¹²⁴ Therefore, the entire dual-use object becomes a military objective from the moment it is used for military action, even if its military use is only “marginal” compared to its civilian use. Such observation represents today’s prevailing view on the qualification of dual-use objects as targetable military objectives.¹²⁵\n¹²¹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, 257, para.78.\n¹²² Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 52(1).\n¹²³ Ibid., Art. 52(2).\n¹²⁴ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 39 and its Commentary, para.1.\n¹²⁵ See Droege, above n.107, 562; Michael Schmitt, The Law of Cyber Targeting, Tallinn Paper No.7 (2015), 11.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n48. From the perspective of civilian protection, the “potentially non-lethal nature of cyberweapons”¹²⁶ draws concerns over an “expanded target list”¹²⁷ and an obscured assessment of the legality of an attack. In a world where a large part of civilian infrastructure and services are highly reliant on international cyber infrastructure, including the Internet, servers, routers, cables, satellites, and computers, the danger of loss of function, partial damage or complete destruction is evident. For example, approximately 98% of US government communications use civilian-owned and civilian-operated networks.¹²⁸ Under LOAC, belligerent parties can easily target cyber infrastructure as military objectives because mere containing, storing, or transmitting a tiny percentage of military data would render the entire infrastructure a legitimate target.\n49. Several scenarios of consequences of attacks against dual-use cyber infrastructure entail humanitarian concerns for civilian protection. The past decade witnessed the increasing use of cloud computing, the users of which are usually unaware of which server their data is stored on and whether military data is stored on the same server. Cyberspace is an artificial battlefield, where, unlike natural theatres of war, such as land or airspace, travelling military data or weapons (e.g., malware, botnet, or malicious codes) can make not only itself a legitimate target but also the transmitting infrastructure a military objective. It can be a computer system, a communication network, a server or router, a major cable, a satellite, or in the worst case, the entire Internet network system.¹²⁹\n50. The Tallinn Manual provides that “the circumstances under which the Internet in its entirety could be attacked [are] so highly unlikely as to render the possibility purely theoretical at the present time”, and that “virtually any attack against the Internet would have to be limited to certain discrete segments thereof”.¹³⁰ Nevertheless, it also acknowledges that “it may be impossible to know over which part of the network military transmissions, as distinct\n126 Jeffrey T.

In such cases, the entire network (or at least those aspects in which transmission is reasonably likely) qualifies as a military objective.”¹³¹\n51. In the physical world, the irrelevance of dual-use objects’ civilian part regarding the principle of distinction is no longer in dispute. In cyberspace, the broad interpretation might lead to extreme situations where nothing civilian remains. More importantly, being a military objective will incur not only attacks in cyberspace but also fatal kinetic attacks. As a result, the fundamental rule that civilian population and objects enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations becomes an empty shell, leaving such situations only subject to protection under the principles of proportionality and precaution.\n52. Almost all States and legal commentators agree that the element of “make[s] an effective contribution to military action” in Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I includes a contribution towards “war-fighting” or “war-supporting” capabilities of the belligerent party.¹³² War-fighting objects refer to those used in combat, while war-supporting objects are what military operations rely on in some “relatively direct sense”.¹³³ In the cyber context, typical war-supporting objects are factories producing hardware or software or other kinds of information weapons,¹³⁴ all of which qualify as military objectives. Controversy on this element concentrates on the “war-sustaining” object policy of the US, which has been adopted by a few States so far.¹³⁵ The majority of Tallinn Manual independent experts refused to include war-sustaining objects into military objectives due to the remote relationship between them and military operations.¹³⁶\n53. The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations of the US extends the expression of Article 52(2) to “effectively contribute to the enemy’s war-fighting or war-sustaining capability”.¹³⁷ The term “war-sustaining” encompasses objects within “an economy or governmental financial system”\n¹³¹ Ibid., para.3.\n¹³² Schmitt, above n.125.\n¹³³ Ibid.\n¹³⁴ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n¹³⁵ Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n¹³⁶ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n¹³⁷ Department of the Navy and Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, NWP 1-14M/MCWP 5-12.1/COMDTPUB P5800.7A (July 2007), para.8.2.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nrelied on by the enemy to fund participation in the conflict.¹³⁸ For instance, the revenue from cotton export during the US Civil War enabled the Confederate States to finance and therefore sustain its war.¹³⁹ Contemporary examples are oil industries of the terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Shams, whose funding of war relied on revenues from oil exports.¹⁴⁰ The rationale behind the war-sustaining approach in the sense of traditional warfare is that the destruction of certain economic objects that are not absolutely “indispensable to civilian survival”, yet currently protected under LOAC, would shorten a conflict and therefore reduce the potential casualty toll and generate societal changes.¹⁴¹\n54. The different effects of cyberattacks and kinetic ones might make cyberattacks against war-sustaining objects more effective in achieving the expected military goal. Using cyber operations to paralyze the infrastructure upon which a central banking system is built, or delete funds from accounts, or change account balances, or manipulate the stock market, will lead to a collapse of the enemy’s confidence. According to the applicable law, many of such cyber operations may not even qualify as attacks under LOAC. Despite the unique advantage of cyberattacks, the military advantage of cyber operations on war-sustaining objects might be indefinite and difficult to articulate.¹⁴² Critiques of war-sustaining objects within the sphere of traditional warfare can apply indiscriminately to cyberspace. There would be no limits to warfare, providing that substantially the entire economy of a country can be considered as war-sustaining.¹⁴³ Consequently, a much broader scope of military objectives that include the enemy’s research and development capabilities would devastate the humanitarian values upheld by the principle of distinction.\n55. To sum up, the Chinese scholars’ view that applying some existing rules of LOAC to cyberspace would potentially “open a gate for humanitarian\n138 Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n139 US Naval War College, Annotated Supplement to the Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations (1997), 400, n.11.\n140 Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n141 See Charles J.

Unless there is a breakthrough in law, attacks against major cyber infrastructure would remain subject to the legal safeguards for civilian protection embodied in the principles of proportionality and precaution. As with Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, targeting highly dangerous infrastructure, such as dams, dikes, and nuclear electrical generating stations, violates the established rule enshrined in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I, which explicitly prohibits targeting listed infrastructure even if they constitute military objectives.\n56. Some may argue that, instead of denying the existing law, a government should assume its responsibility to ensure that military data or weapons do not taint civilian facilities. Unfortunately, the present level of technology and the indiscrepable relationship between civilian and military components in global cyberspace holds little promise for such complete separation.\n57. Another alternative proposal pertinent to the Chinese scholars’ argument is to expand the list of “works and installations containing dangerous forces” in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I by analogy so that critical cyber infrastructure could not be made targetable objects.¹⁴⁴ But the hurdle for adequate State support for this effort remains high. It would be difficult to convince States that the potentially nonlethal effects of attacks on cyber infrastructure could be made comparable to that of radioactive materials leak or flood.\n58. China has never embraced the “war-sustaining” approach. As demonstrated by the SCO Agreement’s definition of war, China’s perception of threats to the safety and normal functionality of its cyber infrastructure is more oriented towards cyber operations below the threshold of attacks under LOAC. In other words, a lower bar of attacks capable of triggering the application of LOAC is demanded. Meanwhile, the Chinese scholars who expressed concerns over allowing attacks against dual-use and war-sustaining objects under LOAC might want to remove these objects from LOAC’s list of legitimate military objectives. To simultaneously realize the objectives of the SCO members and the mentioned Chinese scholars would require any cyber operations falling under the SCO Agreement’s definition to only attack objects exclusively used for military purposes and dual-use objects that are neither highly dangerous nor counted as cyber infrastructure. Such handling\n¹⁴⁴ Robin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann, Cyber Warfare: Applying the Principle of Distinction in an Interconnected Space, 45 Israel LR (2012), 390.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nmight significantly reduce the legitimate functioning space for cyberattacks and prevent them from doing what they are best at, namely, accomplishing military advantage precisely without causing non-reversible damages of critical civilian infrastructure and having the potential to stay non-violent and reduce collateral losses. Such consequences turn out to be contrary to the humanitarian intentions of these Chinese scholars to reduce the harms suffered by victims of war.\n## III.C. Proportionality of cyberattacks against infrastructures\n59. Given that the interconnectedness of military networks and their heavy reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure has left the principle of distinction virtually empty of contents, the principle of proportionality becomes an ultimate rule for protecting civilian persons and objects. This principle prohibits attacks “which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.145 In light of the harsh challenges imposed by the unique features of cyber warfare, the actual role that the principle of proportionality can play could not be overstated.\n60. Under LOAC, what can be considered as “excessive” incidental damage to civilian objects in comparison with the expected concrete and direct military advantage remains controversial. The principle of proportionality is “more easily stated than applied in practice”. As a matter of fact, findings of excessive incidental damage to civilian infrastructure are very few and far between as compared to the military advantage.146 Moreover, the proportionality assessment in LOAC is made ex-ante when expected collateral damage is weighed against the anticipated military damage.147 The practical difficulties in ascertaining the expected effects of cyber operations prevent commanders from precisely assessing the potential collateral damages to civilian objects. How to apply this principle in cyberspace hinges on the development of both legal interpretation and technology, the uncertainty of which may jeopardize\n145 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 51(5)(b).\n146 ICTY, Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (13 June 2000), para.19 (www.icty.org/x/file/Press/nato061300.pdf).\n147 Schmitt, above n.125, 19.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 291\nthis principle’s ability to prevent significant collateral damages to civilian objects in cyber warfare.\n61. In the digital era, incidental damages to civilian objects will no longer be limited to physical ones but also the loss of functionality of civilian cyber infrastructure. Therefore, in order to accommodate the special needs of cyber warfare, several opinions calling for modifications of the assessment of “collateral damages to civilian objects” have emerged. For example, it is suggested that more weight should be given to temporary consequences regarding cyberattacks, for the temporary incapacity of critical systems would incur more severe consequences than mere inconvenience, such as in situations where loss of life may be caused by the inability of hospitals to communicate vital information.¹⁴⁸ But existing LOAC fails to provide any legal basis for this. The paradoxical applicable law is described as:\nwhereas the destruction of a single civilian car would amount to legally relevant, albeit rather insignificant, ‘collateral damage’, the disconnection of thousands or millions of households, companies and public services from the Internet or other communication services, or the severance of online financial transactions for a country’s entire economy and the corresponding economic and societal effects as such would not count as relevant elements to be factored into the proportionality calculus.¹⁴⁹\n62. Similarly, some scholars propose to include “knock-on effects” of cyber-attacks in the proportionality calculations when such an effect would not have occurred “but for” the attack.¹⁵⁰ “Knock-on effects” refer to those generated by the initial effects of the attack.¹⁵¹ Both the 1990-1992 Gulf War and the NATO action in the former Yugoslavia illustrate that the knock-on effects of targeting electricity grid may cause more harm to the affected civilians than the direct effect of these attacks themselves.¹⁵² Although existing law has not touched upon this issue, most scholars seem to agree that knock-on effects\n¹⁴⁸ Oona Hathaway, et al., The Law of Cyber-Attack, 100 California LR (2012), 851.\n¹⁴⁹ Geiß &amp; Lahmann, above n.144, 397.\n¹⁵⁰ Michael Schmitt, Heather Harrison Dinniss &amp; Thomas C.

Commentary to Rule 51 of the Tallinn Manual includes both direct and indirect effects of attacks in the proportionality assessment. The former means “the immediate, first-order consequences, unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms”, and the latter refers to “the delayed and/or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms”. Without deliberately using the same term, the Tallinn Manual adopts the “knock-on effects” approach, factoring “any indirect effects that should be expected by those individuals planning, approving, or executing a cyberattack” into the proportionality evaluation. Such indirect effects can be exemplified by accidents involving transportation systems or malware inserted into a military computer system spread to other civilian computer systems and thereafter disables them, where those risks are or should have been expected. Such indirect effects may result from blocking the Global Positioning Satellite data or disrupting the Global Positioning System. Inconvenience, irritation, stress, or fear caused by cyber operations are explicitly excluded from collateral damages to civilian objects.\n64. The Chinese scholars' view on the theoretical and practical difficulties in applying the present law on proportionality concurs with the mainstream view among international law commentators. The Tallinn Manual's rules and commentaries on this principle are early attempts to codify the prevailing treaty interpretation, contributing to an enhanced relief valve of attacks against critical cyber infrastructure. The Chinese scholars' critiques of Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, which permits attacks against highly dangerous infrastructure, were not made in conjunction with Rule 51, becoming an interpretation out of context. The proportionality assessment under existing law disillusions those who wish to use it to make up for the failure of rules regarding the principle of distinction in protecting civilian safety. If the applicable LOAC rules regarding the principles of distinction and proportionality remain unchanged, the principle of precaution would be the only safeguard left.\n153 Schmitt, above n.150.\n154 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 160, para.6.\n155 Ibid.\n156 Ibid.\n157 Ibid., para.5.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 293\n## III.D. Targetable civilians\n65. Article 51(3) of the Additional Protocol I¹⁵⁸ and Article 13(3)¹⁵⁹ of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts provides that, if civilians engage in conducts amounting to “direct participation in hostilities”, their protection against direct military attacks would be suspended. In cyber warfare, “for such time” as civilians directly participate in hostilities, they not only become legitimate targets of military operations but also are bound by LOAC rules governing the conduct of hostilities. Furthermore, such civilians should not be factored into the proportionality calculation. They are not considered for the principle of precaution that aims to avoid or minimize incidental harm to civilians.¹⁶⁰\n66. Civilians may be targeted for direct participation in hostilities. Currently, given the complexity of this issue, there is no authoritative guidance on which activities qualify as direct participation.¹⁶¹ The present State practice, the jurisprudence of international judicial bodies and prevailing academic views adopt a case-by-case determination method through exemplification rather than illustration.¹⁶² To address when civilians may be targeted, the ICRC sponsored a five-year research project in 2003 and produced its *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law* (“Interpretive Guidance”).¹⁶³\n67. In this document, the ICRC proposes three “constitutive elements” of direct participation in hostilities: (1) an act that negatively impacts the enemy’s military effort, or in which harm is intended (threshold of harm); (2) a relatively direct nexus between that act and the resulting harm, or that act constituting an “integral part” of a coordinated military operation likely to cause the said harm (direct causation), and (3) linkage to the armed conflict\n---\n158 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 51(3).\n159 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, 1125 UNTS 609 (7 December 1978), Art. 13(3).\n160 Melzer, above n.109, 27.\n161 Michael Schmitt, Deconstructing Direct Participation in Hostilities: The Constitutive Elements, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 699.\n162 Ibid., 705-09.\n163 ICRC, Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law (prepared by Nils Melzer) (May 2009) (www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n(belligerent nexus).¹⁶⁴ Although these criteria were generally accepted, the Interpretive Guidance has drawn strong criticism from scholars.¹⁶⁵ These scholars argued that it is both underinclusive as to improperly exclude some forms of direct participation and overinclusive as to incorrectly permit attacks against some civilians and civilian property.¹⁶⁶\n68. There is no reason to distinguish cyber operations from kinetic operations regarding how civilian conducts qualify as direct participation in hostilities, as most controversies are not cyber-specific. Critiques of the Interpretive Guidance in conventional warfare do not necessarily stand in cyberspace. According to the “threshold of harm” element, an act amounting to hostility does not have to qualify as an attack within the meaning of LOAC, which indispensably entails the infliction of death, injury, or destruction on military personnel and objects. “Essentially any consequence adversely affecting the military operations or military capacity” of an opposing party would satisfy the test.¹⁶⁷ Compared to the difficulties in arming civilians with traditional weapons, the technical barrier to cyber armed civilians is almost non-existent. It is too easy for civilians to have the know-how to conduct harmful cyber activities.¹⁶⁸ Therefore, in cyber warfare, “the pool of targetable individuals could be extremely large in future conflicts, far more than is the case in classic conflict.”¹⁶⁹\n69. Espionage activities, including gathering and disseminating intelligence of military tactics and operations by cyber means, or hacking into the enemy system to identify enemy vulnerabilities, would both suffice. Engaging in developing cyber defence systems, such as encryption technology, firewalls or anti-virus software, also falls under this category. However, the element of “direct causation” defines them as causing only “indirect harm” because such individual conduct “merely builds up or maintains the capacity of a party to\n164 Ibid., 46.\n165 See, i.e., Kenneth Watkin, Opportunity Lost: Organized Armed Groups and the ICRC “Direct Participation in Hostilities” Interpretive Guidance, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 641-95; Schmitt, above n.161, 697-740; Bill Boothby, “And for Such Time as”: The Time Dimension to Direct Participation in Hostilities, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 741-68; W.

Nevertheless, the unique features of cyber warfare demand particular attention paid to certain issues in cyberspace. Commentators questioned the rationality of the ICRC's interpretation of the term \"for such time\" when a direct participant can be targeted.172 The ICRC provides that this period covers preparatory measures of a specific act of direct participation, deployment to or return from the activity concerned.173 They argued that the restrictive interpretation has dramatically narrowed the window of targetability, rendering this standard particularly impractical in cyber warfare.174 There is usually no deployment to or return from cyber operations since most of them are controlled remotely.\n71. More importantly, the duration of cyber operations can be extremely short, sometimes even too brief to identify the attacker.175 Or, in some cases, for example, a surreptitiously emplaced logic bomb, the effect of cyber operations can be long-delayed.176 A better approach is suggested to cure this deficiency:\nTo characterise an individual who engages in multiple cyber operations that are part of an on-going cyber campaign as a direct participant targetable throughout the period of activity. Once the individual definitively withdraws from participation, he or she regains their protection from attack, and not before.177\nThis approach seems more promising but might still lead to scary consequences. For civilian computer operators working in closed military facilities,\n170 Above n.163, 53.\n171 Michael Schmitt, Cyber Operations and the Jus in Bello: Key Issues, in: Daria P.

As the debate continues, any resolution must grant sufficient consideration to the safety of civilians.\n72. Cyber warfare also presents peculiar questions to the controversy over which members of an organized armed group are targetable between the ICRC and the NATO members. Members of organized armed groups are the other category of civilians that are legitimate targets of military operations.^^ According to the Interpretive Guidance, only those with a “continuous combat function” can be attacked.^^ The NATO members and Israel favour including all members of a group formed to conduct hostilities.^^ These countries criticize the requirement of “continuous combat function” as affording greater protection to members of organized groups than members of the armed forces, whereas the former enjoy no right to engage in hostilities while the latter does.^^ In the human-made theatre in cyberspace, where distinguishing members of organized armed groups from civilians can be far more difficult and uncertain than on physical battlefields, the additional requirement of ensuring that a member performs “continuous combat function” seems impractical and unnecessary. After all, LOAC’s presumption of civilian status in the case of doubt has offered adequate protection for such members.^^\n73. At first sight, the Chinese scholars’ view tends to see the problem as a practical one of attribution and verification rather than one of law. Nonetheless, such difficulties give rise to debates about legal issues specific to cyber warfare. To the degree that the targetability of civilians is concerned, the critiques of the Interpretive Guidance mainly stem from practical difficulties, before or at the moment of targeting, in distinguishing members of armed groups or civilians directly participating in hostilities from civilians.\n74. For capacity-building or -maintaining conduct that involves espionage or development activities by cyber means, it would be premature to argue that China is willing to waive its right to attack civilians that severely harm its military operation or capacity. But given its general defensive stance on security\n178 Melzer, above n.109, 29.\n179 Above n.163, 71.\n180 See Michael Schmitt, The Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities: A Critical Analysis, 1 Harvard Nat’l S J (2010), 21-24.\n181 Schmitt, above n.171, 100.\n182 Additional Protocol I, above n.100, Art. 50(1).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 297\nissues, China is neither likely to embrace the broader approach that covers such “indirect” conduct. If China ends up agreeing with the applicability of LOAC rules on this issue, it might favour the ICRC’s restrictive standard of “for such time” and “continuous combat function”, not only because of China’s defensive rather than offensive approach to the use of force, but also because of its humanitarian considerations to protect the lives of a large number of civilians relate—occupationally to activities that have a bearing on military operations, or personally to someone occasionally carrying out conduct of hostilities—from lethal attacks.\n75. For the purpose of civilian protection, the better approach for States turns out to be recruiting only military personnel, ideally with uniforms and other distinctive marks, for military operations by cyber means. While accessible in theory, the transformation of non-State cyber actors into national forces would be time-consuming. As a reminder, the privateers were not completely abandoned by States until the time when the maritime powers had developed strong navies, which were capable of forcing the armed merchants who refused to integrate into the navy to put down their weapons in exchange for State protection on the high seas and defeating privates and enemy fleets.^^",
    "IV. The objectives of China’s normative proposals": "76. Based on its limited number of available official statements and practices, China’s opposition to the applicability of some LOAC rules in cyberspace remains vague and general from a legal perspective. The SCO Agreement’s expansive version of cyber “war” indicates that China’s earlier position did not distinguish armed conflicts from other situations, although the application of LOAC hinges on such a differentiation. Apart from the catchall interpretation of cyberattacks, many Chinese scholars expressed concerns over the adequacy of the LOAC rules governing the targetability of dual-use infrastructure and certain groups of civilians and the principle of proportionality. These concerns are not groundless both in terms of law and practice. In fact, the ICRC’s views on the three issues, or even some corresponding rules of the Tallinn Manual, address their concerns well. The practice of the US and its allies that China opposes has not hardened into customary international law binding on all\n^^ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering: A Historical Analogy, Cyber Studies Programme Working Paper No. 1 (March 2015), 3-6, 9 (www.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/cybersecurity-and-the-age-of-privateering-a-historical-analogy.html).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nStates that fail to maintain persistent objection to it. These facts have contributed to China's incremental acceptance of the general applicability of LOAC to the cyber context despite many remaining controversies over how specific LOAC rules should be interpreted and applied to cyber operations.\n77. As with China's concerns over the Tallinn Manual's overemphasis on the military paradigm of responses to cyberattacks in international legal discourse, which threatens to derogate from the principle of non-use of force and to abuse the right to self-defence, a more diverse group of experts was composed to draft the second version of the Tallinn Manual, to address the criticisms of the limited diversity of the group of experts participating in drafting the first version of the Tallinn Manual and this group's overreliance on Western legal sources. There were three non-Western experts from China, Belarus and Thailand, among the nine experts who participated in the formulation process of Tallinn Manual 2.0. The scope of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 expands from \"above the threshold\" cyber operations whose \"scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force\" or which are \"executed in the context of an armed conflict that [is] subject to the LOAC\" to \"below the threshold\" cyber operations that take place in peacetime and fall outside the regulatory scope of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello.\n78. The threshold of use of force functions as a firewall that separates cyber operations which can trigger the exercise of the right to self-defence by a victim State from cyber operations that can entail only pacific countermeasures. As previously mentioned, a major concern of China points to the Tallinn Manual's threshold on which cyber operations constitute use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The Chinese perspective considers it as a low standard intended to accommodate some States' strategic\n184 Dieter Fleck, Searching for International Rules Applicable to Cyber Warfare—A Critical First Assessment of the New Tallinn Manual, 18 JCSL (2013), 335; Ido Kilovaty, Cyber Warfare and the Jus ad Bellum Challenge: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, 5 Am U Nat'l S L Brief (2014), 108.\n185 Kirsten E.

Rule 69 and Rule 71 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were drafted by the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual and incorporated in the second version without being discussed by the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Rule 69 stipulates the “scale and effects” approach.¹⁸⁹ Rule 71 provides that only “a State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence”.¹⁹⁰ The International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual reached a consensus that the scale of effects of cyber operations causing physical consequences can be considered as comparable to those of kinetic operations and hence the use of force under the *jus ad bellum*.¹⁹¹ But they contested over the status of cyber operations that have no consequences in the physical world but can lead to serious consequences.¹⁹²\n80. Some Western scholars identified the failure of Rule 69 to include cyber operations having no physical consequences but can cause temporary suspension of operational functionality,¹⁹³ result in alteration and destruction of data or code,¹⁹⁴ or involve “psychological operation” and “cyber espionage”,¹⁹⁵ as a major shortcoming of the Tallinn Rules.¹⁹⁶ Accordingly, they considered the definition of “use of force” adopted by the Tallinn Rules\n189 Ibid.\n190 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, Rule 71, 339.\n191 See, e.g., Ido Kilovaty, Virtual Violence-Disruptive Cyberspace Operations as “Attacks” Under International Humanitarian Law, 23 Michigan Telecomm &amp; Tech LR (2016), 145-46.\n192 See above n.184, Fleck, 336-37; Kilovaty, 116.\n193 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, 21; Michael N.

Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice, 112 AJIL (2018), 590.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nas “narrow”, blaming the experts for their overreliance on “a consequence-based gravity test in the jus ad bellum”.¹⁹⁷ In addition to the perceived narrow prohibition against the use of cyber force, they considered the Tallinn Rules’ construction of the right to self-defence as even narrower, given the significant difficulties in establishing causal links between multiple consequences and a cyber operation added to the difficulties of attributing a cyber operation to a State or a non-State actor.¹⁹⁸ Although the notion of anticipatory self-defence, which has long been a concern of China and an old controversy in the international law circle with a new incarnation, was adopted in the Tallinn Rules,¹⁹⁹ the practical difficulties in detecting the preparations for launching a cyberattack and further determining whether a cyberattack is imminent render the requirements for resorting to using force on the ground of anticipatory self-defence highly demanding.²⁰⁰\n81. Consequently, the victim State’s response in most cases would be limited to measures falling below the threshold of use of force, such as countermeasures²⁰¹ or referring the matter to the UNSC.²⁰² By far, the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Rules have identified only the Stuxnet attack as meeting the Tallinn threshold of use of force; some experts considered it as meeting the higher “scale and effects” threshold of an armed attack that can trigger the application of LOAC.²⁰³ Even American military lawyers and scholars, who are deemed by their Chinese counterparts as seeking to militarize cyberspace through lowering the threshold of use of force, have admitted that, “the prevailing view is that most, if not all, documented cyber actions taken by States to date have fallen below the ‘use of force’ threshold.”²⁰⁴ Apart from the narrowly construed right to self-defence in situations of armed conflicts, Rule 20 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides a broader right of States to take countermeasures in time of peace, “whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal\n197 Ibid.\n198 Ibid., 591.\n199 Above n.21, Tallinn Manual, Rule 15; Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 73.\n200 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, 351-53; Eichensehr, above n.185, 587.\n201 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, Rule 20, 161.\n202 Ibid., Rule 76, 357.\n203 Ibid., 342.\n204 Gary Corn &amp; Eric Jensen, The Technicolor Zone of Cyberspace–Part I, Just Security (30 May 2018) (www.justsecurity.org/57217/technicolor-zone-cyberspace-part/).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 301\nobligation that is owned by another State”.²⁰⁵ Nevertheless, the exercise of this right by States is subject to similar difficulties in attribution, in addition to a set of conditions, including notification, proportionality,²⁰⁶ and the exclusion of measures amounting to uses of force.\n82. The narrow construction of the right to self-defence and countermeasures under the Tallinn Rules demonstrates the reluctance of the International Group of Experts to permissibly authorize a State to undertake unilateral acts that would result in effects in the territory of another State, in another word, a strong pro-sovereignty inclination of the Tallinn Rules. In contrast, the US and the UK argued that sovereignty did not by itself constitute a specific rule of international law that cyber operations might violate, but rather a foundational principle of international law that undergirds specific rules of international law, such as the prohibition against the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the rule of non-intervention under customary international law. In these two countries’ view, such a principle has no binding effect, and low-scale cyber operations deployed by a State that generate effects in another State’s territory but do not breach any of these specific rules, do not violate international law merely because of their incompatibility with the abstract principle of sovereignty.²⁰⁷ This controversy over the status of sovereignty remains unsettled in the final UN GGE report mainly due to the UK’s active participation in the UN GGE. Yet NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations released in 2020 has endorsed the status of sovereignty as a rule of international law in a footnote, with the UK as the only NATO member having reserved on that footnote.²⁰⁸\n83. Therefore, although the Tallinn Rules were developed under the auspices of NATO, they represent neither the exceptional perspectives of some States such as the US or the UK nor the collective views of the NATO members. Throughout the Hague Process, during the drafting of the Tallinn Rules, where legal advisors from 50 States were given the opportunity to\n205 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, Rule 38, 111.\n206 Ibid., 120, 127.\n207 As noted in: Michael Schmitt, US Transparency Regarding International Law in Cyberspace, Just Security (15 November 2016) (www.justsecurity.org/34465/transparency-international-law-cyberspace/); also Corn &amp; Jensen, above n.204.\n208 North Atlantic Treaty Organization Allied Joint Publication-3.20, Allied Joint Doctrine For Cyberspace Operations (Edition A Version 1) (29 January 2020), Footnote 26 and GBR’s Reservation (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/899678/doctrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nexpress their legal positions to shape the codification process, many States maintained a persistent policy of silence and ambiguity on the specificities of existing or emerging norms regulating cyberspace.²⁰⁹ Meanwhile, the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, together with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, convened two consultative meetings in April 2015 and February 2016 with representatives from more than one hundred States, including China.²¹⁰\n84. The technological difficulties in credibly attributing responsibility for cyber operations, the ongoing controversies over which existing rules apply to cyberspace, their contents, the suitability of the prevailing international legal framework as the primary method to regulate inter-State behaviour in cyberspace, and political and strategic considerations that have prevented States from making public attributions and invoking their rights to take responsive measures, all have contributed to the “wait and see” approach adopted by most States towards utilizing rules and norms of international law, including the Tallinn Rules, to regulate cyber operations.²¹¹ These factors cast doubt over the ripeness of codifying applicable international law in these areas. The limited State practice and opinio juris partly explain China’s “wait and see” stance, which is in line with the mainstream approach in order to preserve a degree of operational flexibility in the face of technological development and the dynamic international environment.²¹²\n85. To summarize, China’s long-term insistence on the non-applicability of the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules to cyberspace does not only conform to the development trend of international normative discourses but also contributes to fuelling this momentum. Sovereign control of cyberspace has been increasingly reviving, and the focus of international legal discourse has shifted from the military paradigm concentrated on the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to the prism of general rules of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. The current landscape of international law identification and development reflects and underpins most concerns of China\n209 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 588.\n210 HUANG, above n.186, 84-85.\n211 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 584, 588, 633, 639, 648, 653 (2018).\n212 See, e.g., ZHU Lingling, Deduction and Development of State Responsibility Attribution in Cyber Attacks from the Perspective of Tallinn Manual Version 2.0, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 77-78; HUANG Zhixiong, New Trends of International Rule-making for Cyberspace: Some Considerations Based Tallinn Manual 2.0, 1 Xiamen Daxue Xuebao [J Xiamen U] (2018), 5-6.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 303\nand many other like-minded States, while the Tallinn Rules serve as one of the early efforts rather than the concluding remark of ongoing international legal discourses.\n86. However, there are two residual concerns of China not reflected in the mainstream State practice following the publication of the two versions of the Tallinn Manual. They are underscored by the elements of cyber sovereignty proposed by China that call for the prohibition of using ICT, information and communications networks to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression or arms race, and the OEWG resolution's reiteration of the need for introducing additional rules of behaviour regarding States' right to combat interference in their internal affairs through the dissemination of false and distorted news and States' duty to abstain from engaging in such activities. One is external threats posed by more powerful States which may utilize their digital advantages to threaten China's national security and social stability, and the other is external limitations, either from emerging norms of international law or other established powers, of China's exercise of regulatory power over content transmitted in cyberspace to combat such threats.\n87. Therefore, in addition to the mentioned concerns addressed by the mainstream State practice, China has employed its generalized and vague resistance to the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace as bargaining leverage to achieve another two objectives in international legal discourse: (1) to build up consensus for a new treaty regulating all use of cyber forces, or a disarmament treaty banning all or at least some types of information weapons, and (2) to block the formation of new law that would limit its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace and prevent disfavoured existing law from binding on its exercise of sovereign power in cyberspace.\n## IV.A. A disarmament treaty &amp; national security\n88. The first objective of China's opposition to an explicit affirmation of the right to self-defence and the applicability of some LOAC rules to the cyber context, namely, to build up consensus for a disarmament treaty on the use of information weapons under the auspice of the UN, emanates from the nature of States' right to self-defence. It is an inherent right reserved for States to\nChinese JIL (2021)\nresort to force by its own decision after the enshrinement of a general prohibition of uses of force in the UN Charter.²¹³\n89. As evidenced by the controversies over anticipatory self-defence in the drafting processes of the Tallinn Rules, diverse concepts and practices regarding the preconditions for the commencement of self-defence and the limitations to the exercise of this right have been invoked and contested by States. Whether Article 51 of the UN Charter allows anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defence before an armed attack occurs has long been a major point of contention. The US, the UK, Israel and some other States have construed Article 51 in a permissible manner by referring to the Caroline doctrine under customary international law, based on which they have often resorted to force. The UNSC has condemned some of such practices; the International Court of Justice took the restrictive view in the judgments of the Corfu Channel case,²¹⁴ the Nicaragua case,²¹⁵ and other decisions afterwards.²¹⁶ The restrictive approach limits States' right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter to situations where an armed attack has already taken place, excluding anticipatory self-defence. From the perspective of the degree of compliance, the effectiveness of the general prohibition of use of force is questionable. But none of these States supporting permissive interpretations dares to bluntly admit the existence of a violation or defy this universally accepted rule, although they always use various factual and legal arguments to justify their breaches.\n90. In the same vein, it is not practically feasible to ensure effective observance of a norm prohibiting use of force in cyberspace, especially by these States that are frequent invokers of anticipatory self-defence. Therefore, what China and other SCO members seek is rather to influence the norm-formulation process at the UN that reflects how the international community of States characterizes a situation or act in question, e.g., as a violation of the proposed norm, and whether most States have a willingness to suppress such dubious acts. In the interim, China has not come up with a clear and concrete stance on how to develop a standard resembling Article 2(4) and Article 51 of the UN Charter in judging the legality and legitimacy of State behaviour concerning use of cyber force. More importantly, concluding new treaties for\n213 UN Charter, 1 UNTS XVI (24 October 1945), Arts. 2(4).\n214 Corfu Channel Case (UK v.

Cyber disarmament is more unrealistic in today's international political environment than the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in light of the recent backlashes against the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons provoked by the Iran and North Korea nuclear crises. All nuclear-weapon States except China, which abstained, voted against a UNGA resolution proposing to convene the first UN conference aimed at achieving a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons.²¹⁷ On 22 January 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first multilateral agreement that bans nuclear weapons, entered into force. Although 85 States have signed and 50 of them have ratified this treaty, the non-participation of all nine States possessing nuclear weapons renders the efficacy of the treaty questionable.²¹⁸ Additionally, as manifested by Cuba's objection to an endorsement of the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, the States that do not enjoy conventional military superiority over their adversaries may have asymmetric advantages in cyberspace, which they are reluctant to give up.²¹⁹ Therefore, a cyber disarmament treaty would lack the support of both major cyber powers and the rest of the weaker cyber-armed States.\n92. In the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures in 2013 and the WikiLeaks disclosures lasting from mid-2016 to date, a rising trend of nationalism has taken place in many countries that used to stand in line with the US-EU camp, such as Brazil and Germany, pushing these countries to start thinking how to defend their \"data sovereignty\". The rise of cybersecurity nationalism has undermined international norm-making efforts, including trade negotiations between the EU and the US and the US attempts to promote norms of Internet freedom globally.²²⁰ There is no reason that cybersecurity discourse would stay intact.\n²¹⁷ Tariq Rauf, 2017: The Year in Which Nuclear Weapons Could be Banned?, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Commentary (20 March 2017) (www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2017/2017-year-which-nuclear-weapons-could-be-banned).\n²¹⁸ See generally, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (22 January 2021) (www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-on-the-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons/).\n²¹⁹ Arun M.

Given the unique features of cyber operations and the Internet, even a treaty in the style of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons would have little practical significance in deterring the abuse and misuse of force in cyberspace. The refrainment of most States, including the US, in most cyber tensions with other States, from resorting to the prevailing international legal framework in dealing with inter-State cyber relations, highlights the limitations of normative approaches in functioning as a general taboo for irresponsible activities in cyberspace by not only State but also private actors.\n94. Compared to conventional and nuclear weapons, the technical barriers to entry in cyber warfare are so low that non-State actors and countries that are conceivably weak by the standards of hard powers can play a significant role on par with powerful countries at low levels of cost. Cyberattacks can be conducted by any actor having an electronic device and connected to the Internet. The interconnectivity of the network enables any actor to stay geographically remote from where they commit cyberattacks. Simultaneously, unlike classic military operations that rely upon territorial linkages, this interconnectivity severely decreases the degree of State control over actors and activities. The life of a treaty, particularly a disarmament treaty, rests in its enforcement. The construction of a credible monitoring and enforcement mechanism would prove to be the utmost hurdle for a cyber disarmament treaty.\n95. Probably having realized the lack of feasibility and political will among States to negotiate a cyber disarmament treaty, China has softened, to some degree, its stance against the alleged militarization of cyberspace. In the most up-to-date white paper on China's military strategy issued in 2015, China plans to \"expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defence [...] so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability\". The ISCC further confirms that \"enhanced defence capability in cyberspace is an important part of China's endeavour to modernize its national defence and armed forces\", while restricting China's development of a cyber force to defensive capability.\n221 State Council Information Office, China's Military Strategy (May 2015), Chapter IV: Building and Development of China's Armed Forces (www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-05/26/content_20820628_4.htm).\n222 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n223 Ibid., Chapter I: Opportunities and Challenges &amp; Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 307\n## IV.B. Sovereign control over the Internet vs non-intervention\n96. The changes in the global context of disarmament and China's position regarding use of force in the cyber context have rendered the proposed second objective of China more salient. The central bone of contention in the normative competitions between the SCO members and the Western powers rests upon whether information and data transmitted in cyberspace shall be made subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State, although both sides have reached a consensus on the applicability of sovereignty as part of international law in cyberspace. At the core of this debate is how to draw the lines between the realms of domestic law and international law as consensual erosion of State sovereignty to be applied equally to all States.\n97. The US holds the view that, although sovereignty gives a State the right to control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory, the exercise of such jurisdiction by the territorial State, encompassing the use and access to the Internet, must comply with that State's obligations under applicable international law, particularly international human rights law. While noting that the freedom of expression may be restricted in situations such as the incitement of imminent terrorist violence, the US considers \"certain censorship and content control, including blocking websites simply because they contain content that criticizes a leader, a government policy, or an ideology, or because the content espouses particular religious beliefs\" as constituting State violations of international human rights law.²²⁴\n98. China likely views this reference to international human rights law as a pretext for Western attempts to conceptually undermine the scope of sovereign powers by narrowing the content of *domaine réservé* in the context of Internet governance. China claims for cyber sovereignty that includes not only cyber infrastructure within its territory but also its jurisdiction over data and the regulation and monitoring of the content of information flowing over cyberspace.²²⁵ Consciously aware that the scope of a State's internal matters and the international legal limitations to that State's exercise of sovereign power over internal matters evolve over time, China has consistently resisted non-reciprocal and non-voluntary restrictions on its exercise of sovereignty.\n²²⁴ Egan, above n.45, 15-17.\n²²⁵ See, e.g., National Security Law of the People's Republic of China (2015), art. 25; XI Jinping, Keynote Speech at the opening ceremony of the 2nd World Internet Conference (16 December 2015) (www.wuzhenwic.org/2015-12/16/c_47521.htm).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n99. From Beijing's perspective, the nature of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as a product formulated under the domination of Western powers was not changed solely by the increased diversity in the composition of the International Group of Experts participating in the drafting process, because the newly-added matters reflect foremostly Western perspectives and concerns. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 does not touch upon the sovereignty of a State over potential data; it only mentions sovereign power over any cyber infrastructure located within States' territory and activities associated with that cyber infrastructure. Similar problems exist in the Tallinn Rules concerning jurisdiction, which overwhelmingly emphasize the limitations imposed by international human rights law to the exercise of sovereignty in cyberspace.²²⁶\n100. In the domestic sphere, China invokes cyber sovereignty to underpin its regulation over data and information in cyberspace. As shown in the SCO Agreement's wording of \"mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to take decisions to the interest of an opposing party\", China is always wary of potential foreign interference. The propaganda and liaison roles played by online social networking servers, such as Facebook and Twitter, in the \"Arab Spring\" that led to social unrest, political turmoil and regime-changes in Northern African and Western Asian countries, and the exposure of the massive surveillance by the US National Security Agency in the PRISM program have strengthened the Chinese conviction of the need for Internet censorship to block and filter information in cyberspace that is harmful to China's social stability and national security.²²⁷ In the trend of the global revival of cyber sovereignty, China strengthens its sovereignty-based regulatory power by referring to similar censorship practices of other States, such as the US, Australia, Italy, Germany, France, the UK, and Korea that once held opposing views, regarding the information about terrorism, incitement to hate crimes, pornography, violence and other crimes involving the usage of the Internet.²²⁸\n101. In the international sphere, China has employed cyber sovereignty as a shield against some Western States' attempts to compel it to change the\n²²⁶ HUANG, above n.212.\n²²⁷ HUANG Zhixiong, Regulation of Cyber Information: A Component Implicitly Covered by Cyber Sovereignty, 3 Guojia Zhili [Nat'l Governance Wkly] (2016), 33-34.\n²²⁸ Xinlian, From the US to Australia: How States Regulate the Internet, China Daily (17 May 2016) (http://world.chinadaily.com.cn/2016-05/17/content_25321844.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 309\ncurrent model of Internet governance by either resorting to non-legal advocacy for Internet freedom or invoking relevant international law, especially the rules of international human rights law on the right to freedom of expression, association, and the media, and the right to access to information. Google's withdrawal from the Chinese market in 2010 was a representative example of the former means where a leading multinational company threatened the Chinese government for a policy change under the instructions of some Western countries.²²⁹ Additionally, the Chinese government has been alarmed by soft law norms applicable in peacetime that are proposed by some Western countries, such as relevant code of conduct on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace at the 2016-2017 UN GGE meetings. Such non-binding norms are intended to circumvent the advocacy of Russia and China to formulate new rules to regulate State behaviour regarding cybersecurity in the form of a treaty at the forum of the UN and may gradually harden into binding law.²³⁰\n102. This argument likely explains why Cuba, Russia and China refused to explicitly affirm the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law in the cyber context in the 2017 UN GGE report, while having accepted the general applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace since the publication of the 2015 UN GGE consensus report. The crucial factor that prevented these States from reaching a consensus with the Western countries was the opposing camp's intention to introduce \"clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States' use of ICTs\"²³¹ in the UN GGE report, which threatened to restrict States' right to regulate the content of and access to information. The UN GGE report is a non-binding statement, but it may serve as proof of State practice and *opinio juris* in ascertaining whether certain international law applies to a participating State signing onto the consensus report and the extent to which the included law limits the endorsing State's right to regulate domestic affairs. Although these countries have recognized the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict upon the adoption of the final UN GGE report, residual disagreements over how specific LOAC rules apply to ICT-related activities remain prominent between them and the Western countries.\n²²⁹ HUANG, above n.227, 34.\n²³⁰ HUANG Zhixiong, Norms of Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace: Origin, Impact and Response, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 68-69.\n²³¹ Korzak, above n.70.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n103. The law governing the right to self-defence and means and methods of warfare is dominated by the practice of remarkably few established powers because the major ground of resorting to anticipatory self-defence and a large portion of LOAC is customary international law, which has been developed by these “specially affected” States to advance their interests.²³² For newly rising powers such as China, failing to meet the requirements of “persistent objector” before and after the birth of a rule at concern would not relieve their obligation to comply. A successful example where a contrary practice of a large number of weaker States makes a few powerful States switch from an established rule of customary international law to an emerging new rule is rare.²³³ It is extremely difficult for a militarily disadvantaged State that lacks field experience to replicate such a strategy in areas involving force.\n104. To prevent coercive erosions of its sovereignty, China’s strategy is to embed a firewall at the most representative and democratic lawmaking forum to obstruct the convenient transplantation of power disparity from the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to the special regimes of international law that constitute cornerstones of an evolving global system of Internet governance. A treaty negotiated at a more egalitarian forum such as the UNGA would enable the Chinese perspectives to carry greater weight in forming international law among a large number of similarly disadvantaged countries. And lawmaking in the form of treaty allows a less advanced State such as China to pick and choose elastically from treaties and their provisions according to its goals.\nV. Conclusion\n105. To summarize, the above analyses suggest that behind China’s general and vague opposition to an explicit affirmation of the applicability of specific LOAC rules to cyberspace and the right of self-defence in cyberspace is China’s profound concern that doing so would acquiesce to the encroachment of its sovereignty and unlock Pandora’s box of coercive external interferences with its independence in determining the mode of domestic Internet governance and the path of development.\n106. Has China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and digital economy driven it to pursue a more proactive and enterprising approach to reshaping international law governing the domain of cyber\n²³² Alan Boyle &amp; Christine Chinkin, The Making of International Law (2007), 28-29.\n²³³ Ibid., 29.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 311\nwarfare so as to build up a competitive advantage against the established powers? At first glance, Beijing's long-term resistance to confirming the applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace before the adoption of the final UN GGE report, amid the exaggerated normative rivalry between the Russia-China Camp and the US-EU Camp, appeared to corroborate this argument. However, closer scrutiny reveals that, the conceptual generalization and ambiguity in China's resisting stance stems from the same premises underpinning the mainstream \"wait and see\" approach of most States towards utilizing international law as the primary means to regulate or justify their cyberoperations. Following the \"wait and see\" trend of State practice, China has agreed to the general applicability of the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello*, and law on State responsibility for international wrongful acts, but still resists the applicability of some specific rules in cyberspace, e.g., the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules, to allow for flexibility in responding to cyber technology development in attribution and the evolvement of international law.\n107. Despite the recent developments in its cyber defensive capacity, China remains disadvantaged as a rising power with weaker military capacity and less normative influence. China's normative proposals, exemplified by the ICCIS, serves more as bargaining leverage to protect itself from being bound by the existing or emerging law supported by the established powers, but unfavourable to itself, and also to move the focus of international legal discourse from the paradigm of military responses to cyberattacks concentrated in the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to that of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. China's normative efforts are largely defensive, given that Beijing chooses to prioritize its interests in defending against possible use of force either triggered by an alleged cyberattack or carried out in the means of cyber operations, over its offensive interests in staying less constrained in the use of cyber force.\n108. Because of the special features of how existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* were made, the normative influence of China and its SCO allies is not sufficient, at this moment, to change the practice of the frequent users of force, to come up with a norm promising effective observance by these States, or to veto the formation of new law proposed by these States at concern. The return of sovereign control in cyberspace and the focus shift of international legal discourse result from a set of factors, e.g., the limitations of current technologies and existing law, with the normative efforts of the SCO members having contributed to this global trend.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n109. But these countries can still resist the imposition of non-consensual norms upon themselves in the domain of cyberspace, obstruct the codification of disfavoured norms, and influence how other States characterize and respond to a situation involving cyber operations. This is why the seemingly unfeasible idea of an international cyber disarmament treaty concluded under the framework of the UN remains on the table. The UNSC's monopoly of authorizing the use of force and the UNGA's feature as one of the most egalitarian forums for international lawmaking make the UN the favourable forum relied on by rising powers such as China to build resilience against other lawmaking processes where established powers play a greater role, e.g., the development of customary international law or soft law in less representative forums.",
    "__postscript__": "76. Based on its limited number of available official statements and practices, China’s opposition to the applicability of some LOAC rules in cyberspace remains vague and general from a legal perspective. The SCO Agreement’s expansive version of cyber “war” indicates that China’s earlier position did not distinguish armed conflicts from other situations, although the application of LOAC hinges on such a differentiation. Apart from the catchall interpretation of cyberattacks, many Chinese scholars expressed concerns over the adequacy of the LOAC rules governing the targetability of dual-use infrastructure and certain groups of civilians and the principle of proportionality. These concerns are not groundless both in terms of law and practice. In fact, the ICRC’s views on the three issues, or even some corresponding rules of the Tallinn Manual, address their concerns well. The practice of the US and its allies that China opposes has not hardened into customary international law binding on all\n^^ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering: A Historical Analogy, Cyber Studies Programme Working Paper No. 1 (March 2015), 3-6, 9 (www.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/cybersecurity-and-the-age-of-privateering-a-historical-analogy.html).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nStates that fail to maintain persistent objection to it. These facts have contributed to China's incremental acceptance of the general applicability of LOAC to the cyber context despite many remaining controversies over how specific LOAC rules should be interpreted and applied to cyber operations.\n77. As with China's concerns over the Tallinn Manual's overemphasis on the military paradigm of responses to cyberattacks in international legal discourse, which threatens to derogate from the principle of non-use of force and to abuse the right to self-defence, a more diverse group of experts was composed to draft the second version of the Tallinn Manual, to address the criticisms of the limited diversity of the group of experts participating in drafting the first version of the Tallinn Manual and this group's overreliance on Western legal sources. There were three non-Western experts from China, Belarus and Thailand, among the nine experts who participated in the formulation process of Tallinn Manual 2.0. The scope of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 expands from \"above the threshold\" cyber operations whose \"scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force\" or which are \"executed in the context of an armed conflict that [is] subject to the LOAC\" to \"below the threshold\" cyber operations that take place in peacetime and fall outside the regulatory scope of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello.\n78. The threshold of use of force functions as a firewall that separates cyber operations which can trigger the exercise of the right to self-defence by a victim State from cyber operations that can entail only pacific countermeasures. As previously mentioned, a major concern of China points to the Tallinn Manual's threshold on which cyber operations constitute use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The Chinese perspective considers it as a low standard intended to accommodate some States' strategic\n184 Dieter Fleck, Searching for International Rules Applicable to Cyber Warfare—A Critical First Assessment of the New Tallinn Manual, 18 JCSL (2013), 335; Ido Kilovaty, Cyber Warfare and the Jus ad Bellum Challenge: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, 5 Am U Nat'l S L Brief (2014), 108.\n185 Kirsten E.

Rule 69 and Rule 71 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were drafted by the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual and incorporated in the second version without being discussed by the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Rule 69 stipulates the “scale and effects” approach.¹⁸⁹ Rule 71 provides that only “a State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence”.¹⁹⁰ The International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual reached a consensus that the scale of effects of cyber operations causing physical consequences can be considered as comparable to those of kinetic operations and hence the use of force under the *jus ad bellum*.¹⁹¹ But they contested over the status of cyber operations that have no consequences in the physical world but can lead to serious consequences.¹⁹²\n80. Some Western scholars identified the failure of Rule 69 to include cyber operations having no physical consequences but can cause temporary suspension of operational functionality,¹⁹³ result in alteration and destruction of data or code,¹⁹⁴ or involve “psychological operation” and “cyber espionage”,¹⁹⁵ as a major shortcoming of the Tallinn Rules.¹⁹⁶ Accordingly, they considered the definition of “use of force” adopted by the Tallinn Rules\n189 Ibid.\n190 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, Rule 71, 339.\n191 See, e.g., Ido Kilovaty, Virtual Violence-Disruptive Cyberspace Operations as “Attacks” Under International Humanitarian Law, 23 Michigan Telecomm &amp; Tech LR (2016), 145-46.\n192 See above n.184, Fleck, 336-37; Kilovaty, 116.\n193 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, 21; Michael N.

Consequently, the victim State’s response in most cases would be limited to measures falling below the threshold of use of force, such as countermeasures²⁰¹ or referring the matter to the UNSC.²⁰² By far, the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Rules have identified only the Stuxnet attack as meeting the Tallinn threshold of use of force; some experts considered it as meeting the higher “scale and effects” threshold of an armed attack that can trigger the application of LOAC.²⁰³ Even American military lawyers and scholars, who are deemed by their Chinese counterparts as seeking to militarize cyberspace through lowering the threshold of use of force, have admitted that, “the prevailing view is that most, if not all, documented cyber actions taken by States to date have fallen below the ‘use of force’ threshold.”²⁰⁴ Apart from the narrowly construed right to self-defence in situations of armed conflicts, Rule 20 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides a broader right of States to take countermeasures in time of peace, “whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal\n197 Ibid.\n198 Ibid., 591.\n199 Above n.21, Tallinn Manual, Rule 15; Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 73.\n200 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, 351-53; Eichensehr, above n.185, 587.\n201 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, Rule 20, 161.\n202 Ibid., Rule 76, 357.\n203 Ibid., 342.\n204 Gary Corn &amp; Eric Jensen, The Technicolor Zone of Cyberspace–Part I, Just Security (30 May 2018) (www.justsecurity.org/57217/technicolor-zone-cyberspace-part/).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 301\nobligation that is owned by another State”.²⁰⁵ Nevertheless, the exercise of this right by States is subject to similar difficulties in attribution, in addition to a set of conditions, including notification, proportionality,²⁰⁶ and the exclusion of measures amounting to uses of force.\n82. The narrow construction of the right to self-defence and countermeasures under the Tallinn Rules demonstrates the reluctance of the International Group of Experts to permissibly authorize a State to undertake unilateral acts that would result in effects in the territory of another State, in another word, a strong pro-sovereignty inclination of the Tallinn Rules. In contrast, the US and the UK argued that sovereignty did not by itself constitute a specific rule of international law that cyber operations might violate, but rather a foundational principle of international law that undergirds specific rules of international law, such as the prohibition against the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the rule of non-intervention under customary international law. In these two countries’ view, such a principle has no binding effect, and low-scale cyber operations deployed by a State that generate effects in another State’s territory but do not breach any of these specific rules, do not violate international law merely because of their incompatibility with the abstract principle of sovereignty.²⁰⁷ This controversy over the status of sovereignty remains unsettled in the final UN GGE report mainly due to the UK’s active participation in the UN GGE. Yet NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations released in 2020 has endorsed the status of sovereignty as a rule of international law in a footnote, with the UK as the only NATO member having reserved on that footnote.²⁰⁸\n83. Therefore, although the Tallinn Rules were developed under the auspices of NATO, they represent neither the exceptional perspectives of some States such as the US or the UK nor the collective views of the NATO members. Throughout the Hague Process, during the drafting of the Tallinn Rules, where legal advisors from 50 States were given the opportunity to\n205 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, Rule 38, 111.\n206 Ibid., 120, 127.\n207 As noted in: Michael Schmitt, US Transparency Regarding International Law in Cyberspace, Just Security (15 November 2016) (www.justsecurity.org/34465/transparency-international-law-cyberspace/); also Corn &amp; Jensen, above n.204.\n208 North Atlantic Treaty Organization Allied Joint Publication-3.20, Allied Joint Doctrine For Cyberspace Operations (Edition A Version 1) (29 January 2020), Footnote 26 and GBR’s Reservation (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/899678/doctrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nexpress their legal positions to shape the codification process, many States maintained a persistent policy of silence and ambiguity on the specificities of existing or emerging norms regulating cyberspace.²⁰⁹ Meanwhile, the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, together with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, convened two consultative meetings in April 2015 and February 2016 with representatives from more than one hundred States, including China.²¹⁰\n84. The technological difficulties in credibly attributing responsibility for cyber operations, the ongoing controversies over which existing rules apply to cyberspace, their contents, the suitability of the prevailing international legal framework as the primary method to regulate inter-State behaviour in cyberspace, and political and strategic considerations that have prevented States from making public attributions and invoking their rights to take responsive measures, all have contributed to the “wait and see” approach adopted by most States towards utilizing rules and norms of international law, including the Tallinn Rules, to regulate cyber operations.²¹¹ These factors cast doubt over the ripeness of codifying applicable international law in these areas. The limited State practice and opinio juris partly explain China’s “wait and see” stance, which is in line with the mainstream approach in order to preserve a degree of operational flexibility in the face of technological development and the dynamic international environment.²¹²\n85. To summarize, China’s long-term insistence on the non-applicability of the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules to cyberspace does not only conform to the development trend of international normative discourses but also contributes to fuelling this momentum. Sovereign control of cyberspace has been increasingly reviving, and the focus of international legal discourse has shifted from the military paradigm concentrated on the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to the prism of general rules of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. The current landscape of international law identification and development reflects and underpins most concerns of China\n209 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 588.\n210 HUANG, above n.186, 84-85.\n211 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 584, 588, 633, 639, 648, 653 (2018).\n212 See, e.g., ZHU Lingling, Deduction and Development of State Responsibility Attribution in Cyber Attacks from the Perspective of Tallinn Manual Version 2.0, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 77-78; HUANG Zhixiong, New Trends of International Rule-making for Cyberspace: Some Considerations Based Tallinn Manual 2.0, 1 Xiamen Daxue Xuebao [J Xiamen U] (2018), 5-6.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 303\nand many other like-minded States, while the Tallinn Rules serve as one of the early efforts rather than the concluding remark of ongoing international legal discourses.\n86. However, there are two residual concerns of China not reflected in the mainstream State practice following the publication of the two versions of the Tallinn Manual. They are underscored by the elements of cyber sovereignty proposed by China that call for the prohibition of using ICT, information and communications networks to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression or arms race, and the OEWG resolution's reiteration of the need for introducing additional rules of behaviour regarding States' right to combat interference in their internal affairs through the dissemination of false and distorted news and States' duty to abstain from engaging in such activities. One is external threats posed by more powerful States which may utilize their digital advantages to threaten China's national security and social stability, and the other is external limitations, either from emerging norms of international law or other established powers, of China's exercise of regulatory power over content transmitted in cyberspace to combat such threats.\n87. Therefore, in addition to the mentioned concerns addressed by the mainstream State practice, China has employed its generalized and vague resistance to the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace as bargaining leverage to achieve another two objectives in international legal discourse: (1) to build up consensus for a new treaty regulating all use of cyber forces, or a disarmament treaty banning all or at least some types of information weapons, and (2) to block the formation of new law that would limit its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace and prevent disfavoured existing law from binding on its exercise of sovereign power in cyberspace.\n## IV.A. A disarmament treaty &amp; national security\n88. The first objective of China's opposition to an explicit affirmation of the right to self-defence and the applicability of some LOAC rules to the cyber context, namely, to build up consensus for a disarmament treaty on the use of information weapons under the auspice of the UN, emanates from the nature of States' right to self-defence. It is an inherent right reserved for States to\nChinese JIL (2021)\nresort to force by its own decision after the enshrinement of a general prohibition of uses of force in the UN Charter.²¹³\n89. As evidenced by the controversies over anticipatory self-defence in the drafting processes of the Tallinn Rules, diverse concepts and practices regarding the preconditions for the commencement of self-defence and the limitations to the exercise of this right have been invoked and contested by States. Whether Article 51 of the UN Charter allows anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defence before an armed attack occurs has long been a major point of contention. The US, the UK, Israel and some other States have construed Article 51 in a permissible manner by referring to the Caroline doctrine under customary international law, based on which they have often resorted to force. The UNSC has condemned some of such practices; the International Court of Justice took the restrictive view in the judgments of the Corfu Channel case,²¹⁴ the Nicaragua case,²¹⁵ and other decisions afterwards.²¹⁶ The restrictive approach limits States' right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter to situations where an armed attack has already taken place, excluding anticipatory self-defence. From the perspective of the degree of compliance, the effectiveness of the general prohibition of use of force is questionable. But none of these States supporting permissive interpretations dares to bluntly admit the existence of a violation or defy this universally accepted rule, although they always use various factual and legal arguments to justify their breaches.\n90. In the same vein, it is not practically feasible to ensure effective observance of a norm prohibiting use of force in cyberspace, especially by these States that are frequent invokers of anticipatory self-defence. Therefore, what China and other SCO members seek is rather to influence the norm-formulation process at the UN that reflects how the international community of States characterizes a situation or act in question, e.g., as a violation of the proposed norm, and whether most States have a willingness to suppress such dubious acts. In the interim, China has not come up with a clear and concrete stance on how to develop a standard resembling Article 2(4) and Article 51 of the UN Charter in judging the legality and legitimacy of State behaviour concerning use of cyber force. More importantly, concluding new treaties for\n213 UN Charter, 1 UNTS XVI (24 October 1945), Arts. 2(4).\n214 Corfu Channel Case (UK v.

Cyber disarmament is more unrealistic in today's international political environment than the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in light of the recent backlashes against the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons provoked by the Iran and North Korea nuclear crises. All nuclear-weapon States except China, which abstained, voted against a UNGA resolution proposing to convene the first UN conference aimed at achieving a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons.²¹⁷ On 22 January 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first multilateral agreement that bans nuclear weapons, entered into force. Although 85 States have signed and 50 of them have ratified this treaty, the non-participation of all nine States possessing nuclear weapons renders the efficacy of the treaty questionable.²¹⁸ Additionally, as manifested by Cuba's objection to an endorsement of the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, the States that do not enjoy conventional military superiority over their adversaries may have asymmetric advantages in cyberspace, which they are reluctant to give up.²¹⁹ Therefore, a cyber disarmament treaty would lack the support of both major cyber powers and the rest of the weaker cyber-armed States.\n92. In the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures in 2013 and the WikiLeaks disclosures lasting from mid-2016 to date, a rising trend of nationalism has taken place in many countries that used to stand in line with the US-EU camp, such as Brazil and Germany, pushing these countries to start thinking how to defend their \"data sovereignty\". The rise of cybersecurity nationalism has undermined international norm-making efforts, including trade negotiations between the EU and the US and the US attempts to promote norms of Internet freedom globally.²²⁰ There is no reason that cybersecurity discourse would stay intact.\n²¹⁷ Tariq Rauf, 2017: The Year in Which Nuclear Weapons Could be Banned?, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Commentary (20 March 2017) (www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2017/2017-year-which-nuclear-weapons-could-be-banned).\n²¹⁸ See generally, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (22 January 2021) (www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-on-the-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons/).\n²¹⁹ Arun M.

Given the unique features of cyber operations and the Internet, even a treaty in the style of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons would have little practical significance in deterring the abuse and misuse of force in cyberspace. The refrainment of most States, including the US, in most cyber tensions with other States, from resorting to the prevailing international legal framework in dealing with inter-State cyber relations, highlights the limitations of normative approaches in functioning as a general taboo for irresponsible activities in cyberspace by not only State but also private actors.\n94. Compared to conventional and nuclear weapons, the technical barriers to entry in cyber warfare are so low that non-State actors and countries that are conceivably weak by the standards of hard powers can play a significant role on par with powerful countries at low levels of cost. Cyberattacks can be conducted by any actor having an electronic device and connected to the Internet. The interconnectivity of the network enables any actor to stay geographically remote from where they commit cyberattacks. Simultaneously, unlike classic military operations that rely upon territorial linkages, this interconnectivity severely decreases the degree of State control over actors and activities. The life of a treaty, particularly a disarmament treaty, rests in its enforcement. The construction of a credible monitoring and enforcement mechanism would prove to be the utmost hurdle for a cyber disarmament treaty.\n95. Probably having realized the lack of feasibility and political will among States to negotiate a cyber disarmament treaty, China has softened, to some degree, its stance against the alleged militarization of cyberspace. In the most up-to-date white paper on China's military strategy issued in 2015, China plans to \"expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defence [...] so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability\". The ISCC further confirms that \"enhanced defence capability in cyberspace is an important part of China's endeavour to modernize its national defence and armed forces\", while restricting China's development of a cyber force to defensive capability.\n221 State Council Information Office, China's Military Strategy (May 2015), Chapter IV: Building and Development of China's Armed Forces (www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-05/26/content_20820628_4.htm).\n222 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n223 Ibid., Chapter I: Opportunities and Challenges &amp; Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 307\n## IV.B. Sovereign control over the Internet vs non-intervention\n96. The changes in the global context of disarmament and China's position regarding use of force in the cyber context have rendered the proposed second objective of China more salient. The central bone of contention in the normative competitions between the SCO members and the Western powers rests upon whether information and data transmitted in cyberspace shall be made subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State, although both sides have reached a consensus on the applicability of sovereignty as part of international law in cyberspace. At the core of this debate is how to draw the lines between the realms of domestic law and international law as consensual erosion of State sovereignty to be applied equally to all States.\n97. The US holds the view that, although sovereignty gives a State the right to control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory, the exercise of such jurisdiction by the territorial State, encompassing the use and access to the Internet, must comply with that State's obligations under applicable international law, particularly international human rights law. While noting that the freedom of expression may be restricted in situations such as the incitement of imminent terrorist violence, the US considers \"certain censorship and content control, including blocking websites simply because they contain content that criticizes a leader, a government policy, or an ideology, or because the content espouses particular religious beliefs\" as constituting State violations of international human rights law.²²⁴\n98. China likely views this reference to international human rights law as a pretext for Western attempts to conceptually undermine the scope of sovereign powers by narrowing the content of *domaine réservé* in the context of Internet governance. China claims for cyber sovereignty that includes not only cyber infrastructure within its territory but also its jurisdiction over data and the regulation and monitoring of the content of information flowing over cyberspace.²²⁵ Consciously aware that the scope of a State's internal matters and the international legal limitations to that State's exercise of sovereign power over internal matters evolve over time, China has consistently resisted non-reciprocal and non-voluntary restrictions on its exercise of sovereignty.\n²²⁴ Egan, above n.45, 15-17.\n²²⁵ See, e.g., National Security Law of the People's Republic of China (2015), art. 25; XI Jinping, Keynote Speech at the opening ceremony of the 2nd World Internet Conference (16 December 2015) (www.wuzhenwic.org/2015-12/16/c_47521.htm).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n99. From Beijing's perspective, the nature of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as a product formulated under the domination of Western powers was not changed solely by the increased diversity in the composition of the International Group of Experts participating in the drafting process, because the newly-added matters reflect foremostly Western perspectives and concerns. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 does not touch upon the sovereignty of a State over potential data; it only mentions sovereign power over any cyber infrastructure located within States' territory and activities associated with that cyber infrastructure. Similar problems exist in the Tallinn Rules concerning jurisdiction, which overwhelmingly emphasize the limitations imposed by international human rights law to the exercise of sovereignty in cyberspace.²²⁶\n100. In the domestic sphere, China invokes cyber sovereignty to underpin its regulation over data and information in cyberspace. As shown in the SCO Agreement's wording of \"mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to take decisions to the interest of an opposing party\", China is always wary of potential foreign interference. The propaganda and liaison roles played by online social networking servers, such as Facebook and Twitter, in the \"Arab Spring\" that led to social unrest, political turmoil and regime-changes in Northern African and Western Asian countries, and the exposure of the massive surveillance by the US National Security Agency in the PRISM program have strengthened the Chinese conviction of the need for Internet censorship to block and filter information in cyberspace that is harmful to China's social stability and national security.²²⁷ In the trend of the global revival of cyber sovereignty, China strengthens its sovereignty-based regulatory power by referring to similar censorship practices of other States, such as the US, Australia, Italy, Germany, France, the UK, and Korea that once held opposing views, regarding the information about terrorism, incitement to hate crimes, pornography, violence and other crimes involving the usage of the Internet.²²⁸\n101. In the international sphere, China has employed cyber sovereignty as a shield against some Western States' attempts to compel it to change the\n²²⁶ HUANG, above n.212.\n²²⁷ HUANG Zhixiong, Regulation of Cyber Information: A Component Implicitly Covered by Cyber Sovereignty, 3 Guojia Zhili [Nat'l Governance Wkly] (2016), 33-34.\n²²⁸ Xinlian, From the US to Australia: How States Regulate the Internet, China Daily (17 May 2016) (http://world.chinadaily.com.cn/2016-05/17/content_25321844.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 309\ncurrent model of Internet governance by either resorting to non-legal advocacy for Internet freedom or invoking relevant international law, especially the rules of international human rights law on the right to freedom of expression, association, and the media, and the right to access to information. Google's withdrawal from the Chinese market in 2010 was a representative example of the former means where a leading multinational company threatened the Chinese government for a policy change under the instructions of some Western countries.²²⁹ Additionally, the Chinese government has been alarmed by soft law norms applicable in peacetime that are proposed by some Western countries, such as relevant code of conduct on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace at the 2016-2017 UN GGE meetings. Such non-binding norms are intended to circumvent the advocacy of Russia and China to formulate new rules to regulate State behaviour regarding cybersecurity in the form of a treaty at the forum of the UN and may gradually harden into binding law.²³⁰\n102. This argument likely explains why Cuba, Russia and China refused to explicitly affirm the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law in the cyber context in the 2017 UN GGE report, while having accepted the general applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace since the publication of the 2015 UN GGE consensus report. The crucial factor that prevented these States from reaching a consensus with the Western countries was the opposing camp's intention to introduce \"clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States' use of ICTs\"²³¹ in the UN GGE report, which threatened to restrict States' right to regulate the content of and access to information. The UN GGE report is a non-binding statement, but it may serve as proof of State practice and *opinio juris* in ascertaining whether certain international law applies to a participating State signing onto the consensus report and the extent to which the included law limits the endorsing State's right to regulate domestic affairs. Although these countries have recognized the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict upon the adoption of the final UN GGE report, residual disagreements over how specific LOAC rules apply to ICT-related activities remain prominent between them and the Western countries.\n²²⁹ HUANG, above n.227, 34.\n²³⁰ HUANG Zhixiong, Norms of Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace: Origin, Impact and Response, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 68-69.\n²³¹ Korzak, above n.70.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n103. The law governing the right to self-defence and means and methods of warfare is dominated by the practice of remarkably few established powers because the major ground of resorting to anticipatory self-defence and a large portion of LOAC is customary international law, which has been developed by these “specially affected” States to advance their interests.²³² For newly rising powers such as China, failing to meet the requirements of “persistent objector” before and after the birth of a rule at concern would not relieve their obligation to comply. A successful example where a contrary practice of a large number of weaker States makes a few powerful States switch from an established rule of customary international law to an emerging new rule is rare.²³³ It is extremely difficult for a militarily disadvantaged State that lacks field experience to replicate such a strategy in areas involving force.\n104. To prevent coercive erosions of its sovereignty, China’s strategy is to embed a firewall at the most representative and democratic lawmaking forum to obstruct the convenient transplantation of power disparity from the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to the special regimes of international law that constitute cornerstones of an evolving global system of Internet governance. A treaty negotiated at a more egalitarian forum such as the UNGA would enable the Chinese perspectives to carry greater weight in forming international law among a large number of similarly disadvantaged countries. And lawmaking in the form of treaty allows a less advanced State such as China to pick and choose elastically from treaties and their provisions according to its goals.\nV. Conclusion\n105. To summarize, the above analyses suggest that behind China’s general and vague opposition to an explicit affirmation of the applicability of specific LOAC rules to cyberspace and the right of self-defence in cyberspace is China’s profound concern that doing so would acquiesce to the encroachment of its sovereignty and unlock Pandora’s box of coercive external interferences with its independence in determining the mode of domestic Internet governance and the path of development.\n106. Has China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and digital economy driven it to pursue a more proactive and enterprising approach to reshaping international law governing the domain of cyber\n²³² Alan Boyle &amp; Christine Chinkin, The Making of International Law (2007), 28-29.\n²³³ Ibid., 29.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 311\nwarfare so as to build up a competitive advantage against the established powers? At first glance, Beijing's long-term resistance to confirming the applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace before the adoption of the final UN GGE report, amid the exaggerated normative rivalry between the Russia-China Camp and the US-EU Camp, appeared to corroborate this argument. However, closer scrutiny reveals that, the conceptual generalization and ambiguity in China's resisting stance stems from the same premises underpinning the mainstream \"wait and see\" approach of most States towards utilizing international law as the primary means to regulate or justify their cyberoperations. Following the \"wait and see\" trend of State practice, China has agreed to the general applicability of the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello*, and law on State responsibility for international wrongful acts, but still resists the applicability of some specific rules in cyberspace, e.g., the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules, to allow for flexibility in responding to cyber technology development in attribution and the evolvement of international law.\n107. Despite the recent developments in its cyber defensive capacity, China remains disadvantaged as a rising power with weaker military capacity and less normative influence. China's normative proposals, exemplified by the ICCIS, serves more as bargaining leverage to protect itself from being bound by the existing or emerging law supported by the established powers, but unfavourable to itself, and also to move the focus of international legal discourse from the paradigm of military responses to cyberattacks concentrated in the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to that of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. China's normative efforts are largely defensive, given that Beijing chooses to prioritize its interests in defending against possible use of force either triggered by an alleged cyberattack or carried out in the means of cyber operations, over its offensive interests in staying less constrained in the use of cyber force.\n108. Because of the special features of how existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* were made, the normative influence of China and its SCO allies is not sufficient, at this moment, to change the practice of the frequent users of force, to come up with a norm promising effective observance by these States, or to veto the formation of new law proposed by these States at concern. The return of sovereign control in cyberspace and the focus shift of international legal discourse result from a set of factors, e.g., the limitations of current technologies and existing law, with the normative efforts of the SCO members having contributed to this global trend.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n109. But these countries can still resist the imposition of non-consensual norms upon themselves in the domain of cyberspace, obstruct the codification of disfavoured norms, and influence how other States characterize and respond to a situation involving cyber operations. This is why the seemingly unfeasible idea of an international cyber disarmament treaty concluded under the framework of the UN remains on the table. The UNSC's monopoly of authorizing the use of force and the UNGA's feature as one of the most egalitarian forums for international lawmaking make the UN the favourable forum relied on by rising powers such as China to build resilience against other lawmaking processes where established powers play a greater role, e.g., the development of customary international law or soft law in less representative forums."

This article argues that China’s resistance to applying some rules of the *jus in bello* to cyberspace is in line with the “wait and see” approach of most States. But there are two distinctive objectives behind this generalized stance: one is to protect its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace from being bound by disfavoured emerging and existing law, and the other is to build up consensus for a treaty regulating uses of cyber force under the United Nations framework.\n## I. Introduction\n1. International law is a generator and a product of the changing global order. China, as “both an aspirational ‘great power’ which plays a key role alongside the West in global governance, and a member of the post-colonial States which views Western hegemony with a critical eye and sees the need to champion the causes of the developing world”, no longer tries to conceal its\n* Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow, Fudan University Law School; S.J.D.

To what extent and how the rise of a new great power will influence international law largely hinges upon the interaction between the rising power and the established powers that have dominated international legal discourse for centuries. The perspectives of China and the established powers differ substantially on many issues, especially those relating to sovereign equality, non-intervention and national security. This can be exemplified by China's perspectives on many issues of cyber warfare in the normative rivalry between the United States (US)-European Union (EU) Camp and the Russia-China Camp, which are competing to influence the making of international law, as well as other countries' domestic policies.\n2. Through the International Code of Conduct for Information Security (ICCIS) first submitted to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2011 and joint efforts in other forums such as the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT), the Russia-China Camp has advanced a sovereignty-based model of Internet governance, which respects cyberspace sovereignty and State independence and legitimizes domestic efforts\nReinterpreting the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and Military Intervention for Humanitarian Purposes, 6 Asian JIL (2016), 114.\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 259\nto regulate the content of and access to information. The US-EU Camp strives to maintain the currently dominant multi-stakeholder model governed by diverse stakeholders, including governments, technical communities, the private sector and other civil society members. It does not accept the ICCIS, especially the domestic regulation on freedom of expression and association and the move towards greater sovereign control in cyberspace.\n3. Notably, China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and the digital economy, especially following the 2008 global financial crisis, did not initially bolster its assertiveness in the international lawmaking procedures that seek to identify existing law or generate new law applicable to State behaviour in cyberspace. China was a low-key participant at the early stages of the UN Group of Government Experts on the Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of Security (“UN GGE”). Its behaviour was found to be passive and frequently concurring with Russia’s stance. The Chinese representatives attending earlier UN GGE meetings were technical officers from the Ministry of Communication rather than diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign affairs (MOFA). But later, China proved to be willing to act more actively and assertively when it was singled out and its fundamental domestic interests were threatened by the disfavoured norms proposed by the established powers.\n4. In reaction to these Western normative attempts, China has transformed from a low-profile, passive team player under the Russian leadership to a proactive actor that had formed its own agenda. China’s active pattern of behaviour was prompted by a 2010 speech by Hillary Clinton, former US Secretary\n ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(a), (c), (d), (f).\n US Office of the Secretary of Defense, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2013 (May 2013), 37 (https://fas.org/man/eprint/dod-china-2013.pdf); European Parliament Resolution of 22 November 2012 on the Forthcoming WCIT-12 of the International Telecommunications Union, and the Possible Expansion of the Scope of International Telecommunication Regulations, P7_TA(2012)0451 (22 November 2012), para.5 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52012IP0451).\n US Department of State, International Cyberspace Policy Strategy (March 2016) (per Public Law 114-113, Division N, Title IV, Section 402), 16-18 (https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/255732.pdf).\n Ibid.\n As noted in: Adam Segal, Chinese Cyber Diplomacy in a New Era of Uncertainty, Aegis Paper Series No. 1703, Hoover Institution (2017), 5-6 (www.lawfareblog.com/chinese-cyber-diplomacy-new-era-uncertainty-0).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nof State, that criticized China for limiting the freedom to access the Internet and conducting online censorship. Higher-level officials from the MOFA with expertise in cyber governance started to represent China in diplomatic activities. The ICCIS was developed to counter-balance the diplomatic momentum generated by a series of US activities, including Clinton’s speeches on freedom in cyberspace between 2010-2012, the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the 2011 Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace. Beijing viewed these activities as attempting to militarize cyberspace and maintain the dominance of the US in cyber governance by interfering in other States’ sovereign right to regulate cyberspace.\n5. In 2011, the first edition of the ICCIS was submitted two months before the London Conference, a United Kingdom (UK)-sponsored attempt in line with those of the US and their allies. The ICCIS called on States “not to use information and communications technologies (ICTs), including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies”, called for “peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security”, and emphasized “the important role of the UN in formulating international norms”. An updated edition of the ICCIS with similar wording was circulated at the UNGA in 2015, possibly intended to gather wider support in the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures that harmed the US’s credibility in its continuous diplomatic attempts.\n6. The second World Internet Conference in 2015 marked the emergence of China’s own vision of global Internet governance that advocates both respect for sovereignty in cyberspace and international cooperation to “jointly build a community of shared future in cyberspace”. Chinese President XI Jinping highlighted the problems of the current global Internet governance system, including, among other things, the inadequate existing rules governing cyberspace that hardly reflect the perspectives of the majority of countries,\n As noted in ibid., 6.\n Ibid., 4-5, 7.\n ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(b), (j).\n International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the Letter dated 9 January 2015 from the Permanent Representatives of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russia Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations Addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

One proposal explicitly called on all countries to work together to “contain the abuse of information technology, oppose cyber surveillance and cyberattacks and reject arms race in cyberspace” and “push for the formulation of international cyberspace rules accepted by all parties as well as an international convention against terrorism in cyberspace, improve the legal assistance mechanism to fight cybercrimes and jointly uphold peace and security in cyberspace”.\n7. The vision of “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” was further elaborated by the Organizing Committee of the World Internet Conference in 2019. It urged countries to oppose hostile activities, acts of aggression, cyberattacks, large-scale surveillance operations, unfounded accusations of cyberattacks against other countries and attempts to politicize cybersecurity issues; prevent arms race and military conflict in cyberspace; and remain committed to resolving disputes by peaceful means. In 2020, the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace was released amid the COVID-19 pandemic that underpinned the urgency of “achieving shared development, ensuring common security, realizing joint governance, and enjoying benefits”. This document emphasized the need to “exert the roles of the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) and the UN GGE, and support formulating codes, norms and principles of responsible State conduct in cyberspace that are acceptable to all parties under the UN framework”.\n8. To assess the implications of China’s rise for the evolution of international law governing the use of force by States in cyberspace, this paper studies the normative initiatives and strategies employed by China in identifying rules of existing law and creating new law applicable to cyber warfare.

Special attention is paid to legal controversies over the rules on cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities, the proportionality of cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and the targetability of certain categories of civilians. Part IV examines the rationales behind China's generalized normative proposal and its vague refusal to confirm the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello, while having recognized the general applicability of these two regimes to cyberspace. The last part concludes with a tentative assessment of the nature and the degree of China's normative influence over international lawmaking governing State behaviour in cyberspace and the possible momentum of China's policy in the future.\n## II. China's general stance on applicable law governing cyber warfare\n## II.A. China's sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance\n9. On 1 March 2017, the MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration jointly issued the first international cyber policy paper of China—the International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (ISCC)—to comprehensively introduce and explain Beijing's policy and position on issues of cyber-related international affairs. At his daily press briefing following the release, the UN Secretary-General Spokesman Stéphane Dujarric described the ISCC as “a very important report” and suggested that “China has a big role to play” in global cyber governance. The linchpin of China’s cyber diplomacy is the idea of cyber sovereignty, around which China formulates its cybersecurity policies towards three primary objectives. The first is to protect its critical information infrastructure, cyber sovereignty, national security and domestic stability from threats posed by digital power disparity among countries, cybercrimes and cyber terrorism, and external interference with China’s internal\n Statement by Ambassador FU Cong in the Assembly Meeting of the UN Conference on Disarmament on International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (9 March 2017) (www.china-un.ch/eng/hom/t1444602.htm); also MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration, International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (1 March 2017) (www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zzjg_663340/jks_665232/kjlc_665236/qtwt_665250/t1442390.shtml) [hereinafter “ISCC”].\n Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General (2 March 2017) (www.un.org/press/en/2017/db170302.doc.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 263\naffairs. The second is to shape the current global Internet governance and promote the formation of a system of international legal norms in China's favour. The third objective is to convert China's increasing cyber capacity into soft power to mobilize and influence other countries' preferences. Chapter II lays out the three elements of China's proposed idea of cyber sovereignty—regulatory authority, non-interference and sovereign equality, and the security-oriented balanced approach.\n10. The appeal for cyber sovereignty by China and other like-minded countries takes place at a time when governments' sovereign power over cyberspace is in decline for many reasons, including but not limited to the privatization of cyberspace, the rise of non-State actors and the digital gap between the developed and developing countries. As evidenced by the first and second editions of the Tallinn Manual providing that \"a State may exercise control over cyber infrastructure and activity within its sovereign territory\", sovereignty in cyberspace is not a revisionist idea by itself. According to the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Manual 2.0, this premise, which was confirmed by the 2013 Report of the UN GGE, is now \"relatively well accepted by the international community\". The US and its allies have held out to this idea in order to sustain the current platform governed by multi-stakeholders under their control.\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\n11. It is noteworthy that, among all the technical communities developing the \"law\" of the Internet and managing the global distribution of Internet resources in terms of naming and addresses, the ISCC exclusively named the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and urged the international community to \"make [ICANN] a truly independent international institution, increase its representations and ensure greater openness and transparency in its decision-making and operation\". ICANN has been a highly politicalized organization. It is a Californian corporation created by a 1998 Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Commerce to transfer the power to manage and oversee the domain name system (DNS) coordination from the US government to the global community. This agreement was supposed to terminate on 30 September 2000, while subject to further amendments. The US government did not end its supervision until October 2016, mainly in response to the calling of major Internet technical organizations for freeing ICANN from unilateral oversight of the US as a backlash from the Snowden Disclosures. Yet, it is early to tell whether the globalization of ICANN can be genuinely realized, given that most of its key infrastructures remain in the US territory. The deprivation of the top domain of Iraq, \".iq\", by ICANN in the Iraq war under the undue influence of the US government, the Snowden Disclosures, and the \"Vault 7\" documents released by WikiLeaks have demonstrated the capacity and motivation of the US to abuse its dominant position in global Internet governance under the current multi-stakeholder model.\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 265\n12. The label “multi-stakeholder” was only applied to ICANN in the wake of the battles over Internet governance initiated by national governments, which are treated as “stakeholders” on an equal footing with private corporates and members of civil society, during and after the World Summit on the Information Society, as political rhetoric to mobilize non-State actors to help resist governmental interference into Internet governance and to simultaneously make the established self-governance model more palatable to States and the UN system. ICANN is a global Internet governance organization possessing monopoly power over the DNS, but it is only subject to the sole jurisdiction of the US under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law. Due to the anticipated objection of the US, to put ICANN under the oversight of the international community of sovereign States proves difficult to attain. And an equivalent alternative to ICANN would be not only costly but also highly disruptive for Internet users.\n13. Aside from open participation, ICANN is not subject to any classic form of internal accountability that commonly exists in private corporations and nonprofit organizations, such as direct accountability mechanisms based on membership or shareholders in the Regional Internet Registries and the open, bottom-up, consensus-based standardization process of the Internet Engineering Task Force. Although ICANN self-identifies as championing the bottom-up, consensus-driven, multi-stakeholder model of governance, its policy-making processes manifest a top-down hierarchy, in which issues raised from the grassroots level end up as policy recommendations to be voted at the Board of Directors. The Board has “near-absolute” power over the bylaws governing the entirety of processes and can “untrammeled[ly]” decide whether to accept these recommendations in the absence of any binding forms of appeal or review. While anyone can join most of ICANN’s volunteer Working Groups to express their views and have the views considered based\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\non merits in the consensus-driven dialogues, “all decision making authority rests solely and exclusively in the hands of a Board of Directors.” Moreover, the Board governs the DNS through private contracts with domain name registrars and registries. The critical details and implementations of these contracts are negotiated bilaterally between ICANN and the registrars/registries, largely beyond the influence of general policies developed in the bottom-up representative processes. To summarize, ICANN seems to employ open participation as a substitute for other missing and more effective accountability mechanisms.\n14. In the ISCC, China advocates shifting from the present multi-stakeholder model of global Internet governance to a multilateral State-centric model. In the latter model, a wide range of actors are encouraged to make their respective contributions based on their capacity in the multilateral decision-making processes led by governments, particularly regarding public policies and security. China favours the UN as the principal forum to coordinate positions of various parties and build international consensus, while other international mechanisms and platforms are called on to complement based on their comparative advantage. The establishment of “multilateral, democratic, and transparent international Internet government systems” is listed as a major goal in the Thirteenth Five-Year-Plan for China’s economic and social development from 2016 to 2020.\n## II.B. International normative discourses\n15. The fundamentally divergent approaches to global Internet governance have driven China and the US to contrasting views on the adequacy of existing international law to address cybersecurity issues. The US and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies insist that prevailing\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 267\ninternational law, including the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello* and relevant rules concerning State responsibility for international wrongful acts apply to cyberspace, and that the existing international legal framework is adequate to accommodate novel situations in the information age.\n16. China’s position on the adequacy of existing international law had not crystalized until the 2013 UN GGE meeting. Since then, China has accepted, in principle, the general applicability of relevant international law to cyberspace. Despite this, China has maintained that international lawmaking is demanded to address the issues that are not clearly dealt with by existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, as parallel paths to further study the applicability of these two regimes’ established rules to cyber warfare from the perspectives of “maintaining international security, strategic mutual trust and preventing cyber conflicts”.\n17. Although the 2017 ISCC is not written in legal language, it calls for “formulating universally accepted international rules and norms of state behaviour in cyberspace within the framework of the UN” towards the ultimate goal of a “rule-based” global governance system in cyberspace. Rather than using the word “codifying”, China opted for “formulating” and emphasized the universal acceptance of rules by countries. This wording reveals China’s reluctance to recognize the applicability of some *already existing* rules of international law to cyberspace, mainly because of the under-representation of developing countries in global cyber governance. In its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the Chinese government also stated that it would “take an active role in formulating international rules in areas such as the Internet”.\n The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World (May 2011), 9 (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf); also Brian J.

In its efforts to achieve these objectives, Beijing has been increasingly active in various multilateral lawmaking forums, particularly major UN platforms such as the UNGA, UN GGE, the UN Expert Group on Combating Cybercrime and International Telecommunication Union. For example, along with the promotion of the concepts of cyber sovereignty and “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” at the World Internet Conference, a State-run annual international forum focusing on the development, use and governance of the Internet, underlying elements of these concepts have also been advocated in China’s Position Paper at the UNGA since 2014 to maintain the momentum and build consensus. These elements include: (1) peaceful use of cyberspace for economic and social development; (2) objection to cyber war and arms race; (3) the development of an international code of conduct for cyberspace under the UN framework that is acceptable to all, such as the two versions of the ICCIS; (4) strengthened international cooperation to combat cybercrimes such as cyber terrorism; and (5) objection to any country’s attempt to overstretch the concept of national security to restrict ICT development and cooperation among other countries or to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs.\n19. Additionally, issue-specific normative initiatives such as the Global Initiative on Data Security and the Comments and Recommendations of China to the 4th Meeting of the UN Open-ended Inter-governmental Expert Group on Cybercrime have also been advanced to gain prominence among\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 269\nagenda items within the UN system. These comprehensive and issue-specific normative initiatives unfold the usage of issue linkage under China's overall scheme of the legal framework governing cyberspace, under which the issues of the development and use of the Internet, cyber and data security, cybercrimes, cyber governance and cyber warfare that transcend different fields of international law are simultaneously placed on the agenda of international lawmaking to keep this bundle of issues at the frontline.\n20. In light of the digital divide between the developed and developing countries and the inequitable order of the existing international legal system, China has been aligning normative efforts at regional and South-South forums such as the BRICS, Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO), the ASEAN Regional Forum, China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in support of lawmaking activities at the UN. The progress China has made in enhancing agenda-shaping and coalition-building capacities can be exemplified by the agenda item of \"International Law in Cyberspace\" proposed by China for the 53rd Annual Session of the AALCO and the data security cooperation initiative signed between the Arab League and China.\n21. Meanwhile, bilateral normative discourses between China and other major powers are ongoing, aiming to figure out common interests and build up consensus for future international lawmaking. Among these, the most\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\nnoticeable landmark is an agreement reached by the US and China in 2015 over mutual refrain from knowingly conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property and further efforts in identifying and promoting appropriate norms of State behaviour in cyberspace.57 The first US-China Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue in 2017 once signalled a possibility for greater cooperation.58 However, since 2018, the deterioration of these countries' bilateral relations has stagnated confidence-building measures towards further coordination and cooperation.\n22. In the context of cyber warfare, the US position is that existing LOAC, including its principles of distinction, necessity, and proportionality, applies in cyberspace.59 By contrast, China, Russia, and other SCO members have not agreed to the US stance and played a rival role. In the 2013 Report of the UN GGE, China and Russia managed to exclude any reference to the applicability of international humanitarian law principles in cyberspace, despite the controversial affirmation of the applicability of \"international law\" and the UN Charter.60 The 2015 UN GGE Report explicitly \"notes\" the possible applicability of \"the established international legal principles, including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction\", while cautiously avoiding making any reference to international humanitarian law.61 The wording of this text fails to clarify whether the UN GGE reached a consensus on the applicability of these LOAC principles to cyber activities or merely noted their existence. Moreover, although the 2015 UN GGE Report mentions the prohibition on the threat or use of force against any State's territorial integrity or political independence,62 it does not refer to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks amounting to use of force as an exception to such general prohibition. Instead, this UN GGE similarly\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 271\n\"noted the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter\", which arguably encompasses the right to self-defence according to most Western countries.^[63]^\n23. Without an explicit official position, Beijing's stance on many occasions has been found to be general yet frequently in line with Russia's efforts to negotiate an international arms control treaty on the use and non-proliferation of information weapons.^[64]^ For example, the 2011 ICCIS proposes \"not to use ICTs, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies\", and calls for \"peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security\".^[65]^ In the updated ICCIS circulated at the UNGA in 2015, the controversial terms of \"proliferate information weapons\" is omitted, and the original paragraph is replaced by \"not to use ICTs and information and communications networks to carry out activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security\".^[66]^\n24. The ISCC pronounces China's consistent opposition to certain countries' \"Cold War Mentality\" in characterizing international relations in cyberspace as a \"zero-sum game\" and abusing the predominant position in global Internet governance to secure advantages by militarization and deterrence build-up in cyberspace.^[67]^ By calling the international community to adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, particularly non-use of force and peaceful settlement of disputes, the ISCC articulates the idea of upholding peace through international cooperation and safeguarding a country's own security that underpins \"common security\" of the international community of States \"on the basis of full respect for other countries' security\".^[68]^ Specifically, the ISCC proposes that \"all countries must oppose ICT-backed acts of hostility and aggression, prevent arms race and conflicts in cyberspace and settle disputes through peaceful means\"; China plans to work with other countries to \"curb the abuse of information technology and prevent arms race\n^[63]^ Ibid., para.28(c).\n^[64]^ As noted in: John Markoff and Andrew E. Kramer, US and Russia Differ on a Treaty for Cyberspace, NY Times (27 June 2009) (www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/world/28cyber.html).\n^[65]^ ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(b), (j).\n^[66]^ Above n.13.\n^[67]^ ISCC, above n.17, Chapter II: The Principle of Peace, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n^[68]^ Ibid., Chapter II: The Principle of Peace.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nin cyberspace”. While the ISCC discourages militarization of cyberspace, China plans to enhance its “defense capability in cyberspace” and “expedite the development of a cyber force” with the aim to “prevent a major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security and maintain national security and social stability”.69\n25. At the UN GGE’s fifth session in 2017, the 25 participating States could not reach a consensus, particularly over the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. It was reported that the US sought “clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States’ use of ICTs”, including international humanitarian law, the right to self-defence, the law of State responsibility, and countermeasures. Cuba, backed by Russia and China which similarly opposed such an explicit affirmation, argued that following the manuscript of the US would militarize cyberspace and “legitimize unilateral punitive force actions” by “States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs”. Consequently, this session concluded without issuing a consensus report.70\n26. In December 2018, the First Committee of the UNGA adopted two resolutions to continue the international discussions of norms on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace by establishing two parallel working processes: one is a new GGE sponsored mainly by the US,71 and the other is the OEWG proposed by Russia that allows all interested Member States to participate in further studying the existing rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour identified by the previous UN GGE reports. The OEWG is also mandated, “if necessary, to introduce changes to them or elaborate additional rules of behaviour”.72 As mentioned previously, China endorsed both the OEWG and the UN GGE in the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community With a Shared Future in Cyberspace released in 2020. Notably, the resolution establishing the OEWG introduces a new issue, namely, “the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives,\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 273\nthe dissemination of false and distorted news, which can be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of other States or as being harmful to the promotion of peace, cooperation and friendly relations among States and nations”.73 The US criticized this resolution’s language borrowed from a controversial 1981 UNGA resolution that declares the duty of a State to “abstain from any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other States”.74 Meanwhile, Russia positioned itself as an advocate for democracy for all UN Member States, given the exclusive club nature of the UN GGE.75\n27. In May 2021, the 2019-2020 UN GGE completed its mission by adopting a consensus final report to be subsequently endorsed by the UNGA. China is among the 25 countries from which UN GGE experts were appointed. The final report explicitly notes the applicability of international humanitarian law “only in situations of armed conflict” and recalls “the established international legal principles including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction” noted in the 2015 report. In the same paragraph, what comes alongside the reference to LOAC is the UN GGE’s recognition of “the need for further study on how and when these principles apply to the use of ICTs by States” and emphasis that “these principles by no means legitimizes or encourages conflict”.76 Simultaneously, the report provides that in their use of ICTs, States must not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State and shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN.77 The text of the final UN GGE report seems to have adopted the prudent approach of the OEWG. It also demonstrates that China has\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\naccepted the applicability of LOAC to cyberspace during an armed conflict while leaving controversial issues of how specific LOAC rules apply to the use of ICTs for further discussions, such as whether cyber-only exchanges can trigger an armed conflict, the scope of cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, the targetability of certain objects in the ICT context, etc.\n## II.C. Possible explanations for China’s opposition\n28. China’s stance on the applicability of LOAC to cyberspace is still evolving with the dynamic international environment, partly explaining why Beijing has refrained from specifying rationales for its resistance to some LOAC rules and how they govern ICT-related activities. Although limited in number, several statements made by Chinese officials on international occasions shed light on this question.\n29. At the 2013 Seoul Conference on Cyberspace, HUANG Huikang, then Legal Adviser of the MOFA, underlined the overemphasis on “making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defence, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized” and “the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace”.78 At the 6th US-China Internet Industry Forum, the Chinese delegation further pointed to the numerous “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” regarding methods and means of cyber warfare, arguing for the incompetence of existing norms to address new sophisticated problems stemming from ICT development.79\n30. At the 7th US-China Internet Industry Forum in 2015, MA Xinmin, then Deputy Director-General of the Department of Treaty and Law of the MOFA, acknowledged that in principle, existing international law, including “the purposes and principles of the [UN] Charter, such as *jus ad bellum* rule of non-use of force except in self-defence or under UN Security Council’s (SC) authorization [...] and international humanitarian law among others shall be directly applicable to cyberspace.”80 However, he emphasized that applying existing LOAC rules to cyber warfare should be conducted “with great caution”, because of the lack of State practice on cyber warfare\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 275\nand the peculiarities of cyberspace, including many legal and technical issues, e.g., identification, tracing and establishment of State responsibility, that are yet to be solved for the application of LOAC to cyberspace. MA also warned of the threats of “aggravating cyberspace militarization and arms race” and the corresponding “pushing for the application of laws of war in that scenario”. He argued that the viewpoints of some States and scholars reflected in the Tallinn Manual illustrate the “military paradigm” of “response to cyberattacks that disregards the principle of non-use of force in international law but over-emphasizes such exceptions as the right to self-defence”, which “clearly does not conform to the international reality and actual needs”.\n31. In a subsequent paper, MA elaborated that the prevailing challenges States need to address are threats to cybersecurity in times of peace, most of which either are launched by non-State actors and fall under the scope of domestic law, or do not qualify as “use of force” or “armed attacks” governed by international law that apply in times of war but constitute international wrongful acts regulated by the law on State responsibility. In the latter situations, the victim State should first resort to peaceful means such as legal countermeasures or UNSC sanctions, rather than use of force. Accordingly, MA called for both further scrutiny of the applicability of existing rules of the jus ad bellum or the jus in bello to cyberspace and international lawmaking designated for the issues not addressed by these two regimes.\n32. Quasi-authoritative Chinese sources similarly argue that some Western countries attempt to militarize the Internet through insisting on applying existing rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace. The Liberation Army Daily straightforwardly criticizes the US for utilizing the Tallinn Manual project to “find legal basis for its cyber warfare policies and military customs”, to maintain the dominant control of the West in cyberspace.\n Ibid., para.24.\n Ibid., paras.20, 23.\n MA, above n.47.\n See, e.g., Zhong Sheng, The United States Bears Primary Responsibility for Halting Cyber War, People’s Daily (7 February 2013) (http://cpc.people.com.cn/pinglun/n/2013/0207/c78779-20456593.html).\n LI Ying, The NATO to Find Legal Basis for Manipulation of Cyberspace, Liberation Army Daily (24 October 2014) (www.chinanews.com/mil/2014/10-24/6712323.shtml).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n33. China's concern over the significant power disparity in Internet technology and cyber infrastructure between it and developed countries partly explains its long-term resistance to applying existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyber warfare prior to the adoption of the final UN GGE report. For example, the following description frequently appeared on Chinese mainstream media: \"The global Internet is built upon 13 [Internet Protocol version (IPv) 4] root servers, 10 of which, including the only key root server, are located in the US. Theoretically, this gives the US the ultimate power to destroy the entire Internet infrastructure of any country.\" The deprivation of Iraq's top domain by ICANN during the Iraq war is another frequently cited supporting example. To tackle the issue, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently approved establishing a DNS root server and a corresponding operating organization by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, along with a plan to upgrade the network infrastructure for the IPv6-based network and encourage large-scale adoption of the IPv6 network.\n34. The mainstream view of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual produced under the auspices of NATO is that: By its essence, the Tallinn Manual is not a re-statement or clarification of existing international law but involves the making of new rules on cyber warfare that reflects the distinctive practice and vested interests of the NATO members. Chinese scholars also highlighted the geographical limitation in the member selection of the Tallinn\n See, e.g., LI Yi, Chinese Internet, Please Keep the “Root”, Beijing Daily (24 January 2014) (http://news.sina.com.cn/pl/2014-01-22/015929310615.shtml).\n LIANG, above n.30.\n Xinhua, China Greenlights Establishment of Root Server, China.org.cn (8 December 2019) (http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/201912/08/content_WS5dec361ec6d0bcf8c4c1882d.html); Xinhua, China Steps up Deploying IPv6-based Network, China.org.cn (3 May 2019) (www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/03/c_138031821.htm).\n See, e.g., DING Libai &amp; ZHU Jing, Tallinn Manual Defines and Reflects on Cyber Attack “Force”, 36 Hebei Faxue [Hebei L Sci] (2018), 84; HUANG Zhixiong, Application of International Law in Cyberspace: Establishing Rules of the Game, 38 Huanqiu Falv Pinglun [Global LR] (2016), 13; HUANG Zhixiong, International Legal Issues concerning “Cyber Warfare” and Strategies for China: Focusing on the Field of Jus ad Bellum, 37 Xiandai Faxue [Modern L Sci] (2015), 154; CHEN Qi, Cybersecurity, Cyber War and International Law: From the Perspective of Tallinn Manual, 7 Zhengzhi yu Falv [P Sci L] (2014), 153-56; XU Yijie, Watch Out for the “Tallinn Manual” Used by the NATO to Make “Rules of Cyber War”, 10 Zhongguo Dangzheng Ganbu Luntan [Chinese Cadres Tribune] (2013), 98-99.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 277\nManual independent International Group of Experts. Critiques of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual concentrate on its *jus ad bellum* part, particularly section 2, “the use of force”. Specifically, many scholars consider that the Tallinn Manual’s threshold on what cyber operations constitute the use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is too low. In their view, the majority of the selected International Group of Experts, who are supporters of Michael Schmitt’s “scale and effects” approach, artificially create some situations that have never taken place to prove that cyberattacks can result in analogous scale and effects of kinetic and non-kinetic forces. A direct transplantation of existing *jus ad bellum* to cyberspace arguably goes beyond the current practice of most States. Another major concern of Chinese scholars is that, rather than regulating the means and methods of cyber warfare, the sponsors of the Tallinn Manual intend to seek legal bases to initiate cyber or even kinetic wars. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual extensively interprets a country’s right of self-defence against non-State actors and anticipatory self-defence against an imminent threat of cyber operations. They hence argue for a higher bar than the Tallinn Manual requirements for invoking the right of self-defence within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n35. Given the unique features of cyber operations, it can be observed that China has been hesitant about applying specific LOAC rules to the cyber context. What are the “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” that prevent China from embracing LOAC and the Tallinn Manual at present? In the absence of any official policy, non-authoritative sources shed light on specific controversies focused on the principles of distinction and proportionality in cyberspace.\n See, e.g., JIANG Yamin, Cyber Great Power Needs to Pay Attention to International Cybersecurity Strategies, People.com, (19 March 2015) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2015/0319/c386965-26716864.html).\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 11.\n See, e.g., above n.89, DING &amp; ZHU, 85-86; HUANG (2016), 10-11; HUANG (2015), 150; CHEN, 154.\n See, e.g., above n.89, HUANG (2016), 8-9; HUANG (2015), 152; CHEN, 154-55.\n See, e.g., LI Bojun, Cyber War and the Applicability of the Law of Armed Conflict, 31 Faxue Pinglun [LR] (2013), 62-63; WANG Kongxiang, Legal Questions and Regulation of Civilian Participation in Cyber War, 5 Fazhi Yanjiu [Research on Rule of L] (2013), 100-09; CHEN, above n.89, 158; CAI Lihong, Challenges to the Principle of Distinction by Information Attacks and Strategies, 24 Xian Zhengzhi Xueyuan Xuebao [J Xi’an P Inst PLA] (2011), 95-96.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nFirst, the existence of an armed conflict permits the use of lethal force based solely on the status of an individual or object. Some Chinese scholars argue that cyberattacks, in light of the latest level of technology, are not controllable so as to constrain their effects within the boundaries of military objects and therefore indiscriminate in nature.95 The 2007 nation-wide denial-of-service attacks sweeping over Estonian Internet infrastructure, including the websites and systems of its Parliament, banks, ministries and media, was cited as a typical example of indiscriminate cyberattack,96 although whether there was an armed conflict and whether such activities amounted to attacks within the meaning of LOAC is disputable. Given such practical difficulties in applying the principle of “distinction” in cyberwar, some scholars suspect the application of LOAC will open a gate for illegitimate cyber and kinetic attacks leading to humanitarian disasters.97 For example, despite its title—“Duty of care during attacks on dams, dykes, and nuclear electrical generating stations”, Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, along with the US policy that categorizes enemy “war-sustaining” objects as lawful targets, is framed as a disguised affirmation of the legitimacy of attacks on critical, yet highly dangerous infrastructures.98 The Internet was originally designed in a way capable of being immediately transformed from war-supporting civil facilities to war-fighting objects, making the majority of its components dual-use objects. Overwhelming reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure would dramatically expand the scope of targetable objects under LOAC. Accordingly, recognizing the applicability of the LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks in cyberspace would be tantamount to authorizing attacks against critical dual-use infrastructures, rendering mass civilians vulnerable to the adverse impacts of not only cyberattacks but also kinetic ones.\nSecond, since the civilian aspect of dual-use cyber infrastructures is relevant only to the attack requirements for proportionality and precaution, the “proportionality” of attacks against objects highly dependent upon Internet or computer control systems is another worrying issue. One scholar quotes John\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 279\nHamre, former US Deputy Defense Secretary, who is skeptical about the feasibility of using cyber operations to achieve the designated military objectives, to demonstrate the unexpected collateral damages caused by cyberattacks. This scholar also considers the current rule of the proportionality of attacks, which factors “the incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damages to civilian objects, or a combination thereof” into assessing whether such collateral damages would be excessive in relation to “the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”, as inadequate protection of civilian interests and suggests adding “knock-on effects” into consideration.\nThird, the distinction between civilian noncombatants and civilians who directly participate in hostilities used to be not an appealing question for Chinese scholars, not only because the Chinese military does not have a tradition of employing civilian contractors, but also because China has not sent its troops to the battlefield for more than thirty years. To reduce costs and obtain technical expertise, the increasing usage of civilians to operate cyberattacks, maintain information weapons, or support cyber combat operations by States has further eroded the distinction between combatants and civilians. It is reasonable for the Chinese military, government and some State-owned-enterprise to recruit civilians for activities related to cyber warfare. Although the law that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities or who adopts a continuous combat function may be lawfully attacked is not in dispute, the targetability of a civilian who assists with cyber operations depends on the answers to two questions: which people are targetable and when they may be targeted. Some Chinese scholars argue that, due to the technical predicament of identity verification and attribution, the applicable LOAC rules fail to provide certainty and predictability for the determination of individual status.\nFourth, another issue closely related to China’s opposition to applying some LOAC rules to cyberspace, namely, what acts may constitute a resort to\n Ibid., CAI, 96, quoting from Is it Real? Is it Hype?, Interview with John Hamre, PBS Frontline (18 February 2003) (www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cyberwar/interviews/hamre.html).\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 1125 UNTS 3, Art. 57(2)(a)(iii) and 57(2)(b) [hereinafter “Additional Protocol I”].\n CAI, above n.94, 96.\n Susan Brenner, Cyber Threats: The Emerging Fault Lines of the Nation State (2009), 197.\n See, e.g., LI, above n.94, 62; WANG, above n.94, 103-09.\nChinese JIL (2021)\narmed force that triggers the application of LOAC, is hinted by the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (“SCO Agreement”). It is a separate question under the jus in bello, without prejudice to the question of “use of force” within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Annex 1 to this Agreement defines “information war” as:\nconfrontation between two or more states in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining political, economic and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to taking decisions in the interest of an opposing party[.].\nAlthough it remains unsettled whether and when an armed conflict, international or non-international, can commence based on a single cyber exchange, the SCO Agreement’s definition of war clearly expands the traditional meaning of armed conflict caused by conventional force under LOAC. Assuming that the term “war” in Annex 1 is not utilized as rhetoric, but rather as the reference of “armed conflict” within the meaning of LOAC, we may tentatively argue that the SCO members consider the existing LOAC’s scope of regulation as underinclusive because it fails to include the cyber actions that can generate political, economic, social and even psychological consequences into the realm of LOAC.\n## III. Examining China’s perspectives on specific rules of LOAC\n36. This part examines the legal or practical grounds supporting China’s views on the four mentioned issues of LOAC. In doing so, this part presents the general contour of various opinions on specific topics, encompassing State practice, positions of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and applicable Tallinn rules. Relevant treaty provisions and judgments of international judicial bodies will be referred to, if available.\n Annex 1 to the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (16 June 2009), List of Basic Terms in the Field of International Information Security (http://cn.io.gov.mo/Legis/International/record/1280.aspx) (Chinese only) and (https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf) (non-official English translation).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 281\n## III.A. Cyberattacks regulated by LOAC\n37. Common Article 2 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 defines an international armed conflict as any “declared war or any other armed conflict which may arise two or more States”, regardless of whether any of them recognizes the state of war. In *Tadić*, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found “an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State.” Undoubtedly, cyberattacks accompanying any kinetic use of force fall under the sphere of LOAC. As with cyber warfare, the pertinent question is whether a single cyber exchange in the absence of any conventional use of force can trigger an international armed conflict by itself.\n38. The notion “resort to armed force” is not defined under LOAC and is easily confused with the usage of “use of force” under the *jus ad bellum*. Nevertheless, the different objects and purposes of these two regimes entail distinct legal tests of “force”. The *jus ad bellum* specifically regulates inter-State relations and States’ lawful use of force, seeking to maintain peaceful relations among nations by setting up strict conditions for invoking forceful measures, “when States may move beyond non-forceful measures such as diplomacy, economic sanctions, and countermeasures”. By contrast, the *jus in bello* regulates the behaviour of parties to an armed conflict, and its object and purpose are to protect the military and civilian victims of war by prohibiting the harms caused by armed attacks during a conflict that are either unnecessary to effectively accomplish legitimate military objectives or excessive in relation to them. The *jus in bello* does not govern whether the use of force is legitimate under the *jus ad bellum* but imposes restrictions on methods and means of warfare.\n39. Despite the absence of a treaty definition of the notion “armed forces” under LOAC, Article 49(1) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva\n---\n Prosecutor v.

By concentrating on the term “violence”, Article 49(1) provides a feasible way to access cyberattacks by analogy to the physical violent effects caused by kinetic attacks. The threshold concept of “attack” is selected in light of LOAC’s object and purpose, since only acts that qualify as attacks would be subject to many of its core prohibitions and restrictions. Only qualified attacks would trigger a wide range of legal protections for the civilian population and objects under LOAC. In most cases, an unqualified act beyond the realm of LOAC would fall under the domain of domestic and international human rights law. So far, there appears to be a consensus that as long as a cyber operation attributable to a State has the equivalent effects of kinetic forces, such as death, physical injury to persons, or damages to objects, it would trigger an international armed conflict. Similarly, Rule 30 of the Tallinn Manual suggests that the “armed force” criterion is fulfilled when a cyber operation is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to person or damage or destruction to objects. A majority of the independent experts participating in the Tallinn Manual project favour including “loss of functionality” in the definition of damages, although there are various shades of opinions among them.\n40. The ICRC Commentary states that the term “attack” means “combat action”, without further elaboration. A paper written by the Head of the ICRC’s Operational Law indicates that the ICRC considers the consequence-based approach as “insufficient to capture the whole range of possible effects of cyber operations and the damage that they can cause, which will not\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 283\nnecessarily resemble the physical effects of traditional weapons\". Given adequate consideration to the object and purpose of LOAC and the concerns of a gap in protection, especially the protection of civilians from the effects of war, that paper seems to endorse the \"loss of functionality\" approach adopted by the majority view of the Tallinn Manual. Based on this approach, whether a cyber operation amounts to an attack depends on whether it causes the target to lose function, even if the target is not physically damaged.\n41. States may support the dysfunction approach since cyber operations would be more frequently resorted, not to physically destroy or damage objects, which can be accomplished by using kinetic force, but rather to incapacitate or disrupt the normal functioning of a vital military or dual-use infrastructure. For instance, an electrical grid or water supply system might be shut down, and a country's banking or stock-trading system could be manipulated, both without any physical damage. As is demonstrated by the 2007 Estonian denial-of-service attacks, for certain civilian populations, the potential hardship arising from such dysfunction could be far more extensive or severe than the physical destruction of a particular building. Such effects might not be comparable to those caused by physical violence, but they are \"precisely the kind of severe consequences from which [LOAC] seeks to protect the civilian population\".\n42. According to the dysfunction approach, cyberattacks against military or dual-use infrastructure, such as paralyzing information systems, altering or deleting processes and resources, are attacks that can trigger the application of LOAC, while applying the consequence-based approach would lead to a contrary conclusion. The applicable LOAC rule maintains that cyberattacks resulting in no physical damage are lawful. The US-EU camp intends to stay with the existing rule and has codified it in the Tallinn Manual. Although international law evolves to reflect the changing values developed by the international community, most States remain silent on this issue. Whether LOAC should expand its established interpretation of attacks depends on future State practice.\n Droege, above n.107, 546.\n Ibid., 546-47.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., 549.\n Schmitt, above n.106, 291.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n43. Part of the SCO Agreement defines war as the “confrontation between two or more States in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes, and resources, critical and other structures”. Under this part of the definition, those confrontations that happen without any physical damages would not qualify as attacks and therefore be lawful under LOAC. The remaining part, namely, inter-State confrontations in cyberspace aimed at “undermining political, economic, and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to [take] decisions in the interest of an opposing party”, is unlikely to fall into the scope of attacks under LOAC either.\n44. On Article 49 of Additional Protocol I, the *Bothe, Partsch and Solf Commentary* underlines that attacks refer to “those aspects of military operations that most directly affect the safety of the civilian population and the integrity of civilian objects”. It would be difficult to assert that political, economic, social, or even psychological effects of cyber operations could be deemed most directly affecting the personal safety of civilians or the physical integrity of civilian objects. Dissemination of propaganda, espionage, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological or economic warfare does not fall under the concept of attack in LOAC.\n45. LOAC endeavours to regulate methods and means of war and the treatments of different groups. Under LOAC, a State wants to protect its civilian population and objects, and at the same time, be able to use lethal force against the belligerent party once an armed conflict commences. An overinclusive definition of “attack” will subject the civilian population to catastrophic consequences that would have been avoided by applying the present definition with a high threshold. Such consideration partly explains why most States remain silent in the face of cyberattacks.\n46. The SCO Agreement’s definition of war demonstrates the six countries’ concerns of adverse impacts by acts that do not qualify as attacks and coincides with Russia’s proposal for non-proliferation of information weapons. But, unlike biological and chemical weapons, the usage of so-called information weapons does not necessarily lead to unnecessary suffering of humans\n Michael Bothe, Karl Josef Partsch &amp; Waldemar A. Solf, New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts: Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (1982), 325.\n Ibid., 289.\n See, e.g., Gary Brown, Why Iran didn’t admit Stuxnet was an attack, 63 Joint Force Quarterly (2011), 71.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 285\nand might even reduce physical harm compared to the usage of conventional forces regarding the accomplishment of the same military objective. This feature of information weapons makes them not a proper subject matter for a total (or partial) ban. By their features and consequences, unqualified cyberattacks are more suitable to be regulated by regimes other than LOAC for the time being. As demonstrated by the final UN GGE report, leading SCO members, including China, Russia, and Kazakhstan, no longer dispute the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict, although controversies over, for example, the qualification of single cyber exchange as attacks under the meaning of LOAC, remain unsettled. Hence, the SCO members may continue to advance the broad interpretation of “attack” to build up consensus for new norms while resisting the application of the existing LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks.\n## III.B. Dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities\n47. As a “cardinal principle” of LOAC, the principle of distinction requires that a distinction be made between military and civilian persons and objects and prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. Article 52(1) of Additional Protocol I defines “civilian objects” in a negative manner as “all objects which are not military objectives”. Military objectives are those “by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage”. According to Rule 39 of the Tallinn Manual, an object cannot be civilian and military simultaneously; its status is either one or the other. Therefore, the entire dual-use object becomes a military objective from the moment it is used for military action, even if its military use is only “marginal” compared to its civilian use. Such observation represents today’s prevailing view on the qualification of dual-use objects as targetable military objectives.\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, 257, para.78.\n Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 52(1).\n Ibid., Art. 52(2).\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 39 and its Commentary, para.1.\n See Droege, above n.107, 562; Michael Schmitt, The Law of Cyber Targeting, Tallinn Paper No.7 (2015), 11.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n48. From the perspective of civilian protection, the “potentially non-lethal nature of cyberweapons” draws concerns over an “expanded target list” and an obscured assessment of the legality of an attack. In a world where a large part of civilian infrastructure and services are highly reliant on international cyber infrastructure, including the Internet, servers, routers, cables, satellites, and computers, the danger of loss of function, partial damage or complete destruction is evident. For example, approximately 98% of US government communications use civilian-owned and civilian-operated networks. Under LOAC, belligerent parties can easily target cyber infrastructure as military objectives because mere containing, storing, or transmitting a tiny percentage of military data would render the entire infrastructure a legitimate target.\n49. Several scenarios of consequences of attacks against dual-use cyber infrastructure entail humanitarian concerns for civilian protection. The past decade witnessed the increasing use of cloud computing, the users of which are usually unaware of which server their data is stored on and whether military data is stored on the same server. Cyberspace is an artificial battlefield, where, unlike natural theatres of war, such as land or airspace, travelling military data or weapons (e.g., malware, botnet, or malicious codes) can make not only itself a legitimate target but also the transmitting infrastructure a military objective. It can be a computer system, a communication network, a server or router, a major cable, a satellite, or in the worst case, the entire Internet network system.\n50. The Tallinn Manual provides that “the circumstances under which the Internet in its entirety could be attacked [are] so highly unlikely as to render the possibility purely theoretical at the present time”, and that “virtually any attack against the Internet would have to be limited to certain discrete segments thereof”. Nevertheless, it also acknowledges that “it may be impossible to know over which part of the network military transmissions, as distinct\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 287\nfrom civilian ones, will pass. In such cases, the entire network (or at least those aspects in which transmission is reasonably likely) qualifies as a military objective.”\n51. In the physical world, the irrelevance of dual-use objects’ civilian part regarding the principle of distinction is no longer in dispute. In cyberspace, the broad interpretation might lead to extreme situations where nothing civilian remains. More importantly, being a military objective will incur not only attacks in cyberspace but also fatal kinetic attacks. As a result, the fundamental rule that civilian population and objects enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations becomes an empty shell, leaving such situations only subject to protection under the principles of proportionality and precaution.\n52. Almost all States and legal commentators agree that the element of “make[s] an effective contribution to military action” in Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I includes a contribution towards “war-fighting” or “war-supporting” capabilities of the belligerent party. War-fighting objects refer to those used in combat, while war-supporting objects are what military operations rely on in some “relatively direct sense”. In the cyber context, typical war-supporting objects are factories producing hardware or software or other kinds of information weapons, all of which qualify as military objectives. Controversy on this element concentrates on the “war-sustaining” object policy of the US, which has been adopted by a few States so far. The majority of Tallinn Manual independent experts refused to include war-sustaining objects into military objectives due to the remote relationship between them and military operations.\n53. The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations of the US extends the expression of Article 52(2) to “effectively contribute to the enemy’s war-fighting or war-sustaining capability”. The term “war-sustaining” encompasses objects within “an economy or governmental financial system”\n Ibid., para.3.\n Schmitt, above n.125.\n Ibid.\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n Department of the Navy and Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, NWP 1-14M/MCWP 5-12.1/COMDTPUB P5800.7A (July 2007), para.8.2.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nrelied on by the enemy to fund participation in the conflict. For instance, the revenue from cotton export during the US Civil War enabled the Confederate States to finance and therefore sustain its war. Contemporary examples are oil industries of the terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Shams, whose funding of war relied on revenues from oil exports. The rationale behind the war-sustaining approach in the sense of traditional warfare is that the destruction of certain economic objects that are not absolutely “indispensable to civilian survival”, yet currently protected under LOAC, would shorten a conflict and therefore reduce the potential casualty toll and generate societal changes.\n54. The different effects of cyberattacks and kinetic ones might make cyberattacks against war-sustaining objects more effective in achieving the expected military goal. Using cyber operations to paralyze the infrastructure upon which a central banking system is built, or delete funds from accounts, or change account balances, or manipulate the stock market, will lead to a collapse of the enemy’s confidence. According to the applicable law, many of such cyber operations may not even qualify as attacks under LOAC. Despite the unique advantage of cyberattacks, the military advantage of cyber operations on war-sustaining objects might be indefinite and difficult to articulate. Critiques of war-sustaining objects within the sphere of traditional warfare can apply indiscriminately to cyberspace. There would be no limits to warfare, providing that substantially the entire economy of a country can be considered as war-sustaining. Consequently, a much broader scope of military objectives that include the enemy’s research and development capabilities would devastate the humanitarian values upheld by the principle of distinction.\n55. To sum up, the Chinese scholars’ view that applying some existing rules of LOAC to cyberspace would potentially “open a gate for humanitarian\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 289\ndisasters” is reasonable, given that attacks against dual-use infrastructure are currently lawful in most cases. Unless there is a breakthrough in law, attacks against major cyber infrastructure would remain subject to the legal safeguards for civilian protection embodied in the principles of proportionality and precaution. As with Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, targeting highly dangerous infrastructure, such as dams, dikes, and nuclear electrical generating stations, violates the established rule enshrined in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I, which explicitly prohibits targeting listed infrastructure even if they constitute military objectives.\n56. Some may argue that, instead of denying the existing law, a government should assume its responsibility to ensure that military data or weapons do not taint civilian facilities. Unfortunately, the present level of technology and the indiscrepable relationship between civilian and military components in global cyberspace holds little promise for such complete separation.\n57. Another alternative proposal pertinent to the Chinese scholars’ argument is to expand the list of “works and installations containing dangerous forces” in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I by analogy so that critical cyber infrastructure could not be made targetable objects. But the hurdle for adequate State support for this effort remains high. It would be difficult to convince States that the potentially nonlethal effects of attacks on cyber infrastructure could be made comparable to that of radioactive materials leak or flood.\n58. China has never embraced the “war-sustaining” approach. As demonstrated by the SCO Agreement’s definition of war, China’s perception of threats to the safety and normal functionality of its cyber infrastructure is more oriented towards cyber operations below the threshold of attacks under LOAC. In other words, a lower bar of attacks capable of triggering the application of LOAC is demanded. Meanwhile, the Chinese scholars who expressed concerns over allowing attacks against dual-use and war-sustaining objects under LOAC might want to remove these objects from LOAC’s list of legitimate military objectives. To simultaneously realize the objectives of the SCO members and the mentioned Chinese scholars would require any cyber operations falling under the SCO Agreement’s definition to only attack objects exclusively used for military purposes and dual-use objects that are neither highly dangerous nor counted as cyber infrastructure. Such handling\n Robin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann, Cyber Warfare: Applying the Principle of Distinction in an Interconnected Space, 45 Israel LR (2012), 390.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nmight significantly reduce the legitimate functioning space for cyberattacks and prevent them from doing what they are best at, namely, accomplishing military advantage precisely without causing non-reversible damages of critical civilian infrastructure and having the potential to stay non-violent and reduce collateral losses. Such consequences turn out to be contrary to the humanitarian intentions of these Chinese scholars to reduce the harms suffered by victims of war.\n## III.C. Proportionality of cyberattacks against infrastructures\n59. Given that the interconnectedness of military networks and their heavy reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure has left the principle of distinction virtually empty of contents, the principle of proportionality becomes an ultimate rule for protecting civilian persons and objects. This principle prohibits attacks “which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.145 In light of the harsh challenges imposed by the unique features of cyber warfare, the actual role that the principle of proportionality can play could not be overstated.\n60. Under LOAC, what can be considered as “excessive” incidental damage to civilian objects in comparison with the expected concrete and direct military advantage remains controversial. The principle of proportionality is “more easily stated than applied in practice”. As a matter of fact, findings of excessive incidental damage to civilian infrastructure are very few and far between as compared to the military advantage.146 Moreover, the proportionality assessment in LOAC is made ex-ante when expected collateral damage is weighed against the anticipated military damage.147 The practical difficulties in ascertaining the expected effects of cyber operations prevent commanders from precisely assessing the potential collateral damages to civilian objects. How to apply this principle in cyberspace hinges on the development of both legal interpretation and technology, the uncertainty of which may jeopardize\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 291\nthis principle’s ability to prevent significant collateral damages to civilian objects in cyber warfare.\n61. In the digital era, incidental damages to civilian objects will no longer be limited to physical ones but also the loss of functionality of civilian cyber infrastructure. Therefore, in order to accommodate the special needs of cyber warfare, several opinions calling for modifications of the assessment of “collateral damages to civilian objects” have emerged. For example, it is suggested that more weight should be given to temporary consequences regarding cyberattacks, for the temporary incapacity of critical systems would incur more severe consequences than mere inconvenience, such as in situations where loss of life may be caused by the inability of hospitals to communicate vital information. But existing LOAC fails to provide any legal basis for this. The paradoxical applicable law is described as:\nwhereas the destruction of a single civilian car would amount to legally relevant, albeit rather insignificant, ‘collateral damage’, the disconnection of thousands or millions of households, companies and public services from the Internet or other communication services, or the severance of online financial transactions for a country’s entire economy and the corresponding economic and societal effects as such would not count as relevant elements to be factored into the proportionality calculus.\n62. Similarly, some scholars propose to include “knock-on effects” of cyber-attacks in the proportionality calculations when such an effect would not have occurred “but for” the attack. “Knock-on effects” refer to those generated by the initial effects of the attack. Both the 1990-1992 Gulf War and the NATO action in the former Yugoslavia illustrate that the knock-on effects of targeting electricity grid may cause more harm to the affected civilians than the direct effect of these attacks themselves. Although existing law has not touched upon this issue, most scholars seem to agree that knock-on effects\n Oona Hathaway, et al., The Law of Cyber-Attack, 100 California LR (2012), 851.\n Geiß &amp; Lahmann, above n.144, 397.\n Michael Schmitt, Heather Harrison Dinniss &amp; Thomas C. Wingfield, Computers and War: The Legal Battlespace, Background Paper Prepared for the Informal High-Level Expert Meeting on Current Challenges to International Humanitarian Law (25-27 June 2004), 8-9 (www.hpcresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/schmittetal.pdf).\n Ibid., 8.\n Dinniss, above n.109, 205.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nshould be part of the proportionality analysis to the extent they are “reasonably foreseeable”,[153] which resonates with the term “expected” in Additional Protocol I.\n63. Commentary to Rule 51 of the Tallinn Manual includes both direct and indirect effects of attacks in the proportionality assessment.[154] The former means “the immediate, first-order consequences, unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms”, and the latter refers to “the delayed and/or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms”. Without deliberately using the same term, the Tallinn Manual adopts the “knock-on effects” approach, factoring “any indirect effects that should be expected by those individuals planning, approving, or executing a cyberattack” into the proportionality evaluation.[155] Such indirect effects can be exemplified by accidents involving transportation systems or malware inserted into a military computer system spread to other civilian computer systems and thereafter disables them, where those risks are or should have been expected. Such indirect effects may result from blocking the Global Positioning Satellite data or disrupting the Global Positioning System.[156] Inconvenience, irritation, stress, or fear caused by cyber operations are explicitly excluded from collateral damages to civilian objects.[157]\n64. The Chinese scholars' view on the theoretical and practical difficulties in applying the present law on proportionality concurs with the mainstream view among international law commentators. The Tallinn Manual's rules and commentaries on this principle are early attempts to codify the prevailing treaty interpretation, contributing to an enhanced relief valve of attacks against critical cyber infrastructure. The Chinese scholars' critiques of Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, which permits attacks against highly dangerous infrastructure, were not made in conjunction with Rule 51, becoming an interpretation out of context. The proportionality assessment under existing law disillusions those who wish to use it to make up for the failure of rules regarding the principle of distinction in protecting civilian safety. If the applicable LOAC rules regarding the principles of distinction and proportionality remain unchanged, the principle of precaution would be the only safeguard left.\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 293\n## III.D. Targetable civilians\n65. Article 51(3) of the Additional Protocol I and Article 13(3) of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts provides that, if civilians engage in conducts amounting to “direct participation in hostilities”, their protection against direct military attacks would be suspended. In cyber warfare, “for such time” as civilians directly participate in hostilities, they not only become legitimate targets of military operations but also are bound by LOAC rules governing the conduct of hostilities. Furthermore, such civilians should not be factored into the proportionality calculation. They are not considered for the principle of precaution that aims to avoid or minimize incidental harm to civilians.\n66. Civilians may be targeted for direct participation in hostilities. Currently, given the complexity of this issue, there is no authoritative guidance on which activities qualify as direct participation. The present State practice, the jurisprudence of international judicial bodies and prevailing academic views adopt a case-by-case determination method through exemplification rather than illustration. To address when civilians may be targeted, the ICRC sponsored a five-year research project in 2003 and produced its *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law* (“Interpretive Guidance”).\n67. In this document, the ICRC proposes three “constitutive elements” of direct participation in hostilities: (1) an act that negatively impacts the enemy’s military effort, or in which harm is intended (threshold of harm); (2) a relatively direct nexus between that act and the resulting harm, or that act constituting an “integral part” of a coordinated military operation likely to cause the said harm (direct causation), and (3) linkage to the armed conflict\n---\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\n(belligerent nexus). Although these criteria were generally accepted, the Interpretive Guidance has drawn strong criticism from scholars. These scholars argued that it is both underinclusive as to improperly exclude some forms of direct participation and overinclusive as to incorrectly permit attacks against some civilians and civilian property.\n68. There is no reason to distinguish cyber operations from kinetic operations regarding how civilian conducts qualify as direct participation in hostilities, as most controversies are not cyber-specific. Critiques of the Interpretive Guidance in conventional warfare do not necessarily stand in cyberspace. According to the “threshold of harm” element, an act amounting to hostility does not have to qualify as an attack within the meaning of LOAC, which indispensably entails the infliction of death, injury, or destruction on military personnel and objects. “Essentially any consequence adversely affecting the military operations or military capacity” of an opposing party would satisfy the test. Compared to the difficulties in arming civilians with traditional weapons, the technical barrier to cyber armed civilians is almost non-existent. It is too easy for civilians to have the know-how to conduct harmful cyber activities. Therefore, in cyber warfare, “the pool of targetable individuals could be extremely large in future conflicts, far more than is the case in classic conflict.”\n69. Espionage activities, including gathering and disseminating intelligence of military tactics and operations by cyber means, or hacking into the enemy system to identify enemy vulnerabilities, would both suffice. Engaging in developing cyber defence systems, such as encryption technology, firewalls or anti-virus software, also falls under this category. However, the element of “direct causation” defines them as causing only “indirect harm” because such individual conduct “merely builds up or maintains the capacity of a party to\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 295\nharm its adversary\".170 Considering the Interpretive Guidance as sacrificing military necessity for exaggerated civilian protection, commentators suggest expanding the current interpretation of direct hostilities to capacity-building acts, namely, those espionage and development activities specific to a particular cyber operation or enemy system.171\n70. Nevertheless, the unique features of cyber warfare demand particular attention paid to certain issues in cyberspace. Commentators questioned the rationality of the ICRC's interpretation of the term \"for such time\" when a direct participant can be targeted.172 The ICRC provides that this period covers preparatory measures of a specific act of direct participation, deployment to or return from the activity concerned.173 They argued that the restrictive interpretation has dramatically narrowed the window of targetability, rendering this standard particularly impractical in cyber warfare.174 There is usually no deployment to or return from cyber operations since most of them are controlled remotely.\n71. More importantly, the duration of cyber operations can be extremely short, sometimes even too brief to identify the attacker.175 Or, in some cases, for example, a surreptitiously emplaced logic bomb, the effect of cyber operations can be long-delayed.176 A better approach is suggested to cure this deficiency:\nTo characterise an individual who engages in multiple cyber operations that are part of an on-going cyber campaign as a direct participant targetable throughout the period of activity. Once the individual definitively withdraws from participation, he or she regains their protection from attack, and not before.177\nThis approach seems more promising but might still lead to scary consequences. For civilian computer operators working in closed military facilities,\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\ntheir targetability would not expire after work but become a portable threat travelling with them and making their family members and neighbours legitimate collateral damage. As the debate continues, any resolution must grant sufficient consideration to the safety of civilians.\n72. Cyber warfare also presents peculiar questions to the controversy over which members of an organized armed group are targetable between the ICRC and the NATO members. Members of organized armed groups are the other category of civilians that are legitimate targets of military operations.^[178]^ According to the Interpretive Guidance, only those with a “continuous combat function” can be attacked.^[179]^ The NATO members and Israel favour including all members of a group formed to conduct hostilities.^[180]^ These countries criticize the requirement of “continuous combat function” as affording greater protection to members of organized groups than members of the armed forces, whereas the former enjoy no right to engage in hostilities while the latter does.^[181]^ In the human-made theatre in cyberspace, where distinguishing members of organized armed groups from civilians can be far more difficult and uncertain than on physical battlefields, the additional requirement of ensuring that a member performs “continuous combat function” seems impractical and unnecessary. After all, LOAC’s presumption of civilian status in the case of doubt has offered adequate protection for such members.^[182]^\n73. At first sight, the Chinese scholars’ view tends to see the problem as a practical one of attribution and verification rather than one of law. Nonetheless, such difficulties give rise to debates about legal issues specific to cyber warfare. To the degree that the targetability of civilians is concerned, the critiques of the Interpretive Guidance mainly stem from practical difficulties, before or at the moment of targeting, in distinguishing members of armed groups or civilians directly participating in hostilities from civilians.\n74. For capacity-building or -maintaining conduct that involves espionage or development activities by cyber means, it would be premature to argue that China is willing to waive its right to attack civilians that severely harm its military operation or capacity. But given its general defensive stance on security\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 297\nissues, China is neither likely to embrace the broader approach that covers such “indirect” conduct. If China ends up agreeing with the applicability of LOAC rules on this issue, it might favour the ICRC’s restrictive standard of “for such time” and “continuous combat function”, not only because of China’s defensive rather than offensive approach to the use of force, but also because of its humanitarian considerations to protect the lives of a large number of civilians relate—occupationally to activities that have a bearing on military operations, or personally to someone occasionally carrying out conduct of hostilities—from lethal attacks.\n75. For the purpose of civilian protection, the better approach for States turns out to be recruiting only military personnel, ideally with uniforms and other distinctive marks, for military operations by cyber means. While accessible in theory, the transformation of non-State cyber actors into national forces would be time-consuming. As a reminder, the privateers were not completely abandoned by States until the time when the maritime powers had developed strong navies, which were capable of forcing the armed merchants who refused to integrate into the navy to put down their weapons in exchange for State protection on the high seas and defeating privates and enemy fleets.^[183]^\n## IV. The objectives of China’s normative proposals\n76. Based on its limited number of available official statements and practices, China’s opposition to the applicability of some LOAC rules in cyberspace remains vague and general from a legal perspective. The SCO Agreement’s expansive version of cyber “war” indicates that China’s earlier position did not distinguish armed conflicts from other situations, although the application of LOAC hinges on such a differentiation. Apart from the catchall interpretation of cyberattacks, many Chinese scholars expressed concerns over the adequacy of the LOAC rules governing the targetability of dual-use infrastructure and certain groups of civilians and the principle of proportionality. These concerns are not groundless both in terms of law and practice. In fact, the ICRC’s views on the three issues, or even some corresponding rules of the Tallinn Manual, address their concerns well. The practice of the US and its allies that China opposes has not hardened into customary international law binding on all\n^[183]^ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering: A Historical Analogy, Cyber Studies Programme Working Paper No. 1 (March 2015), 3-6, 9 (www.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/cybersecurity-and-the-age-of-privateering-a-historical-analogy.html).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nStates that fail to maintain persistent objection to it. These facts have contributed to China's incremental acceptance of the general applicability of LOAC to the cyber context despite many remaining controversies over how specific LOAC rules should be interpreted and applied to cyber operations.\n77. As with China's concerns over the Tallinn Manual's overemphasis on the military paradigm of responses to cyberattacks in international legal discourse, which threatens to derogate from the principle of non-use of force and to abuse the right to self-defence, a more diverse group of experts was composed to draft the second version of the Tallinn Manual, to address the criticisms of the limited diversity of the group of experts participating in drafting the first version of the Tallinn Manual[184] and this group's overreliance on Western legal sources.[185] There were three non-Western experts from China, Belarus and Thailand, among the nine experts who participated in the formulation process of Tallinn Manual 2.0.[186] The scope of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 expands from \"above the threshold\" cyber operations whose \"scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force\"[187] or which are \"executed in the context of an armed conflict that [is] subject to the LOAC\"[188] to \"below the threshold\" cyber operations that take place in peacetime and fall outside the regulatory scope of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello.\n78. The threshold of use of force functions as a firewall that separates cyber operations which can trigger the exercise of the right to self-defence by a victim State from cyber operations that can entail only pacific countermeasures. As previously mentioned, a major concern of China points to the Tallinn Manual's threshold on which cyber operations constitute use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The Chinese perspective considers it as a low standard intended to accommodate some States' strategic\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 299\nneeds to expansively interpret the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter in order to justify their use of force against other States.\n79. Rule 69 and Rule 71 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were drafted by the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual and incorporated in the second version without being discussed by the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Rule 69 stipulates the “scale and effects” approach. Rule 71 provides that only “a State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence”. The International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual reached a consensus that the scale of effects of cyber operations causing physical consequences can be considered as comparable to those of kinetic operations and hence the use of force under the *jus ad bellum*. But they contested over the status of cyber operations that have no consequences in the physical world but can lead to serious consequences.\n80. Some Western scholars identified the failure of Rule 69 to include cyber operations having no physical consequences but can cause temporary suspension of operational functionality, result in alteration and destruction of data or code, or involve “psychological operation” and “cyber espionage”, as a major shortcoming of the Tallinn Rules. Accordingly, they considered the definition of “use of force” adopted by the Tallinn Rules\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\nas “narrow”, blaming the experts for their overreliance on “a consequence-based gravity test in the jus ad bellum”. In addition to the perceived narrow prohibition against the use of cyber force, they considered the Tallinn Rules’ construction of the right to self-defence as even narrower, given the significant difficulties in establishing causal links between multiple consequences and a cyber operation added to the difficulties of attributing a cyber operation to a State or a non-State actor. Although the notion of anticipatory self-defence, which has long been a concern of China and an old controversy in the international law circle with a new incarnation, was adopted in the Tallinn Rules, the practical difficulties in detecting the preparations for launching a cyberattack and further determining whether a cyberattack is imminent render the requirements for resorting to using force on the ground of anticipatory self-defence highly demanding.\n81. Consequently, the victim State’s response in most cases would be limited to measures falling below the threshold of use of force, such as countermeasures or referring the matter to the UNSC. By far, the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Rules have identified only the Stuxnet attack as meeting the Tallinn threshold of use of force; some experts considered it as meeting the higher “scale and effects” threshold of an armed attack that can trigger the application of LOAC. Even American military lawyers and scholars, who are deemed by their Chinese counterparts as seeking to militarize cyberspace through lowering the threshold of use of force, have admitted that, “the prevailing view is that most, if not all, documented cyber actions taken by States to date have fallen below the ‘use of force’ threshold.” Apart from the narrowly construed right to self-defence in situations of armed conflicts, Rule 20 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides a broader right of States to take countermeasures in time of peace, “whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 301\nobligation that is owned by another State”. Nevertheless, the exercise of this right by States is subject to similar difficulties in attribution, in addition to a set of conditions, including notification, proportionality, and the exclusion of measures amounting to uses of force.\n82. The narrow construction of the right to self-defence and countermeasures under the Tallinn Rules demonstrates the reluctance of the International Group of Experts to permissibly authorize a State to undertake unilateral acts that would result in effects in the territory of another State, in another word, a strong pro-sovereignty inclination of the Tallinn Rules. In contrast, the US and the UK argued that sovereignty did not by itself constitute a specific rule of international law that cyber operations might violate, but rather a foundational principle of international law that undergirds specific rules of international law, such as the prohibition against the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the rule of non-intervention under customary international law. In these two countries’ view, such a principle has no binding effect, and low-scale cyber operations deployed by a State that generate effects in another State’s territory but do not breach any of these specific rules, do not violate international law merely because of their incompatibility with the abstract principle of sovereignty. This controversy over the status of sovereignty remains unsettled in the final UN GGE report mainly due to the UK’s active participation in the UN GGE. Yet NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations released in 2020 has endorsed the status of sovereignty as a rule of international law in a footnote, with the UK as the only NATO member having reserved on that footnote.\n83. Therefore, although the Tallinn Rules were developed under the auspices of NATO, they represent neither the exceptional perspectives of some States such as the US or the UK nor the collective views of the NATO members. Throughout the Hague Process, during the drafting of the Tallinn Rules, where legal advisors from 50 States were given the opportunity to\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\nexpress their legal positions to shape the codification process, many States maintained a persistent policy of silence and ambiguity on the specificities of existing or emerging norms regulating cyberspace. Meanwhile, the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, together with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, convened two consultative meetings in April 2015 and February 2016 with representatives from more than one hundred States, including China.\n84. The technological difficulties in credibly attributing responsibility for cyber operations, the ongoing controversies over which existing rules apply to cyberspace, their contents, the suitability of the prevailing international legal framework as the primary method to regulate inter-State behaviour in cyberspace, and political and strategic considerations that have prevented States from making public attributions and invoking their rights to take responsive measures, all have contributed to the “wait and see” approach adopted by most States towards utilizing rules and norms of international law, including the Tallinn Rules, to regulate cyber operations. These factors cast doubt over the ripeness of codifying applicable international law in these areas. The limited State practice and opinio juris partly explain China’s “wait and see” stance, which is in line with the mainstream approach in order to preserve a degree of operational flexibility in the face of technological development and the dynamic international environment.\n85. To summarize, China’s long-term insistence on the non-applicability of the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules to cyberspace does not only conform to the development trend of international normative discourses but also contributes to fuelling this momentum. Sovereign control of cyberspace has been increasingly reviving, and the focus of international legal discourse has shifted from the military paradigm concentrated on the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to the prism of general rules of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. The current landscape of international law identification and development reflects and underpins most concerns of China\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 303\nand many other like-minded States, while the Tallinn Rules serve as one of the early efforts rather than the concluding remark of ongoing international legal discourses.\n86. However, there are two residual concerns of China not reflected in the mainstream State practice following the publication of the two versions of the Tallinn Manual. They are underscored by the elements of cyber sovereignty proposed by China that call for the prohibition of using ICT, information and communications networks to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression or arms race, and the OEWG resolution's reiteration of the need for introducing additional rules of behaviour regarding States' right to combat interference in their internal affairs through the dissemination of false and distorted news and States' duty to abstain from engaging in such activities. One is external threats posed by more powerful States which may utilize their digital advantages to threaten China's national security and social stability, and the other is external limitations, either from emerging norms of international law or other established powers, of China's exercise of regulatory power over content transmitted in cyberspace to combat such threats.\n87. Therefore, in addition to the mentioned concerns addressed by the mainstream State practice, China has employed its generalized and vague resistance to the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace as bargaining leverage to achieve another two objectives in international legal discourse: (1) to build up consensus for a new treaty regulating all use of cyber forces, or a disarmament treaty banning all or at least some types of information weapons, and (2) to block the formation of new law that would limit its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace and prevent disfavoured existing law from binding on its exercise of sovereign power in cyberspace.\n## IV.A. A disarmament treaty &amp; national security\n88. The first objective of China's opposition to an explicit affirmation of the right to self-defence and the applicability of some LOAC rules to the cyber context, namely, to build up consensus for a disarmament treaty on the use of information weapons under the auspice of the UN, emanates from the nature of States' right to self-defence. It is an inherent right reserved for States to\nChinese JIL (2021)\nresort to force by its own decision after the enshrinement of a general prohibition of uses of force in the UN Charter.\n89. As evidenced by the controversies over anticipatory self-defence in the drafting processes of the Tallinn Rules, diverse concepts and practices regarding the preconditions for the commencement of self-defence and the limitations to the exercise of this right have been invoked and contested by States. Whether Article 51 of the UN Charter allows anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defence before an armed attack occurs has long been a major point of contention. The US, the UK, Israel and some other States have construed Article 51 in a permissible manner by referring to the Caroline doctrine under customary international law, based on which they have often resorted to force. The UNSC has condemned some of such practices; the International Court of Justice took the restrictive view in the judgments of the Corfu Channel case, the Nicaragua case, and other decisions afterwards. The restrictive approach limits States' right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter to situations where an armed attack has already taken place, excluding anticipatory self-defence. From the perspective of the degree of compliance, the effectiveness of the general prohibition of use of force is questionable. But none of these States supporting permissive interpretations dares to bluntly admit the existence of a violation or defy this universally accepted rule, although they always use various factual and legal arguments to justify their breaches.\n90. In the same vein, it is not practically feasible to ensure effective observance of a norm prohibiting use of force in cyberspace, especially by these States that are frequent invokers of anticipatory self-defence. Therefore, what China and other SCO members seek is rather to influence the norm-formulation process at the UN that reflects how the international community of States characterizes a situation or act in question, e.g., as a violation of the proposed norm, and whether most States have a willingness to suppress such dubious acts. In the interim, China has not come up with a clear and concrete stance on how to develop a standard resembling Article 2(4) and Article 51 of the UN Charter in judging the legality and legitimacy of State behaviour concerning use of cyber force. More importantly, concluding new treaties for\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 305\nwarfare or a disarmament treaty would be more challenging than adapting existing law through interpretation.\n91. Cyber disarmament is more unrealistic in today's international political environment than the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in light of the recent backlashes against the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons provoked by the Iran and North Korea nuclear crises. All nuclear-weapon States except China, which abstained, voted against a UNGA resolution proposing to convene the first UN conference aimed at achieving a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons. On 22 January 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first multilateral agreement that bans nuclear weapons, entered into force. Although 85 States have signed and 50 of them have ratified this treaty, the non-participation of all nine States possessing nuclear weapons renders the efficacy of the treaty questionable. Additionally, as manifested by Cuba's objection to an endorsement of the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, the States that do not enjoy conventional military superiority over their adversaries may have asymmetric advantages in cyberspace, which they are reluctant to give up. Therefore, a cyber disarmament treaty would lack the support of both major cyber powers and the rest of the weaker cyber-armed States.\n92. In the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures in 2013 and the WikiLeaks disclosures lasting from mid-2016 to date, a rising trend of nationalism has taken place in many countries that used to stand in line with the US-EU camp, such as Brazil and Germany, pushing these countries to start thinking how to defend their \"data sovereignty\". The rise of cybersecurity nationalism has undermined international norm-making efforts, including trade negotiations between the EU and the US and the US attempts to promote norms of Internet freedom globally. There is no reason that cybersecurity discourse would stay intact.\n Tariq Rauf, 2017: The Year in Which Nuclear Weapons Could be Banned?, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Commentary (20 March 2017) (www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2017/2017-year-which-nuclear-weapons-could-be-banned).\n See generally, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (22 January 2021) (www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-on-the-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons/).\n Arun M. Sukumar, The UN GGE Failed: Is International Law in Cyberspace Doomed as Well?, Lawfare (4 July 2017) (www.lawfareblog.com/un-gge-failed-international-law-cyberspace-doomed-well).\n Mueller, above n.25, 555.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n93. Given the unique features of cyber operations and the Internet, even a treaty in the style of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons would have little practical significance in deterring the abuse and misuse of force in cyberspace. The refrainment of most States, including the US, in most cyber tensions with other States, from resorting to the prevailing international legal framework in dealing with inter-State cyber relations, highlights the limitations of normative approaches in functioning as a general taboo for irresponsible activities in cyberspace by not only State but also private actors.\n94. Compared to conventional and nuclear weapons, the technical barriers to entry in cyber warfare are so low that non-State actors and countries that are conceivably weak by the standards of hard powers can play a significant role on par with powerful countries at low levels of cost. Cyberattacks can be conducted by any actor having an electronic device and connected to the Internet. The interconnectivity of the network enables any actor to stay geographically remote from where they commit cyberattacks. Simultaneously, unlike classic military operations that rely upon territorial linkages, this interconnectivity severely decreases the degree of State control over actors and activities. The life of a treaty, particularly a disarmament treaty, rests in its enforcement. The construction of a credible monitoring and enforcement mechanism would prove to be the utmost hurdle for a cyber disarmament treaty.\n95. Probably having realized the lack of feasibility and political will among States to negotiate a cyber disarmament treaty, China has softened, to some degree, its stance against the alleged militarization of cyberspace. In the most up-to-date white paper on China's military strategy issued in 2015, China plans to \"expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defence [...] so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability\".[221] The ISCC further confirms that \"enhanced defence capability in cyberspace is an important part of China's endeavour to modernize its national defence and armed forces\",[222] while restricting China's development of a cyber force to defensive capability.[223]\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 307\n## IV.B. Sovereign control over the Internet vs non-intervention\n96. The changes in the global context of disarmament and China's position regarding use of force in the cyber context have rendered the proposed second objective of China more salient. The central bone of contention in the normative competitions between the SCO members and the Western powers rests upon whether information and data transmitted in cyberspace shall be made subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State, although both sides have reached a consensus on the applicability of sovereignty as part of international law in cyberspace. At the core of this debate is how to draw the lines between the realms of domestic law and international law as consensual erosion of State sovereignty to be applied equally to all States.\n97. The US holds the view that, although sovereignty gives a State the right to control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory, the exercise of such jurisdiction by the territorial State, encompassing the use and access to the Internet, must comply with that State's obligations under applicable international law, particularly international human rights law. While noting that the freedom of expression may be restricted in situations such as the incitement of imminent terrorist violence, the US considers \"certain censorship and content control, including blocking websites simply because they contain content that criticizes a leader, a government policy, or an ideology, or because the content espouses particular religious beliefs\" as constituting State violations of international human rights law.\n98. China likely views this reference to international human rights law as a pretext for Western attempts to conceptually undermine the scope of sovereign powers by narrowing the content of *domaine réservé* in the context of Internet governance. China claims for cyber sovereignty that includes not only cyber infrastructure within its territory but also its jurisdiction over data and the regulation and monitoring of the content of information flowing over cyberspace. Consciously aware that the scope of a State's internal matters and the international legal limitations to that State's exercise of sovereign power over internal matters evolve over time, China has consistently resisted non-reciprocal and non-voluntary restrictions on its exercise of sovereignty.\n Egan, above n.45, 15-17.\n See, e.g., National Security Law of the People's Republic of China (2015), art. 25; XI Jinping, Keynote Speech at the opening ceremony of the 2nd World Internet Conference (16 December 2015) (www.wuzhenwic.org/2015-12/16/c_47521.htm).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n99. From Beijing's perspective, the nature of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as a product formulated under the domination of Western powers was not changed solely by the increased diversity in the composition of the International Group of Experts participating in the drafting process, because the newly-added matters reflect foremostly Western perspectives and concerns. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 does not touch upon the sovereignty of a State over potential data; it only mentions sovereign power over any cyber infrastructure located within States' territory and activities associated with that cyber infrastructure. Similar problems exist in the Tallinn Rules concerning jurisdiction, which overwhelmingly emphasize the limitations imposed by international human rights law to the exercise of sovereignty in cyberspace.\n100. In the domestic sphere, China invokes cyber sovereignty to underpin its regulation over data and information in cyberspace. As shown in the SCO Agreement's wording of \"mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to take decisions to the interest of an opposing party\", China is always wary of potential foreign interference. The propaganda and liaison roles played by online social networking servers, such as Facebook and Twitter, in the \"Arab Spring\" that led to social unrest, political turmoil and regime-changes in Northern African and Western Asian countries, and the exposure of the massive surveillance by the US National Security Agency in the PRISM program have strengthened the Chinese conviction of the need for Internet censorship to block and filter information in cyberspace that is harmful to China's social stability and national security. In the trend of the global revival of cyber sovereignty, China strengthens its sovereignty-based regulatory power by referring to similar censorship practices of other States, such as the US, Australia, Italy, Germany, France, the UK, and Korea that once held opposing views, regarding the information about terrorism, incitement to hate crimes, pornography, violence and other crimes involving the usage of the Internet.\n101. In the international sphere, China has employed cyber sovereignty as a shield against some Western States' attempts to compel it to change the\n HUANG, above n.212.\n HUANG Zhixiong, Regulation of Cyber Information: A Component Implicitly Covered by Cyber Sovereignty, 3 Guojia Zhili [Nat'l Governance Wkly] (2016), 33-34.\n Xinlian, From the US to Australia: How States Regulate the Internet, China Daily (17 May 2016) (http://world.chinadaily.com.cn/2016-05/17/content_25321844.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 309\ncurrent model of Internet governance by either resorting to non-legal advocacy for Internet freedom or invoking relevant international law, especially the rules of international human rights law on the right to freedom of expression, association, and the media, and the right to access to information. Google's withdrawal from the Chinese market in 2010 was a representative example of the former means where a leading multinational company threatened the Chinese government for a policy change under the instructions of some Western countries. Additionally, the Chinese government has been alarmed by soft law norms applicable in peacetime that are proposed by some Western countries, such as relevant code of conduct on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace at the 2016-2017 UN GGE meetings. Such non-binding norms are intended to circumvent the advocacy of Russia and China to formulate new rules to regulate State behaviour regarding cybersecurity in the form of a treaty at the forum of the UN and may gradually harden into binding law.\n102. This argument likely explains why Cuba, Russia and China refused to explicitly affirm the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law in the cyber context in the 2017 UN GGE report, while having accepted the general applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace since the publication of the 2015 UN GGE consensus report. The crucial factor that prevented these States from reaching a consensus with the Western countries was the opposing camp's intention to introduce \"clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States' use of ICTs\" in the UN GGE report, which threatened to restrict States' right to regulate the content of and access to information. The UN GGE report is a non-binding statement, but it may serve as proof of State practice and *opinio juris* in ascertaining whether certain international law applies to a participating State signing onto the consensus report and the extent to which the included law limits the endorsing State's right to regulate domestic affairs. Although these countries have recognized the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict upon the adoption of the final UN GGE report, residual disagreements over how specific LOAC rules apply to ICT-related activities remain prominent between them and the Western countries.\n HUANG, above n.227, 34.\n HUANG Zhixiong, Norms of Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace: Origin, Impact and Response, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 68-69.\n Korzak, above n.70.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n103. The law governing the right to self-defence and means and methods of warfare is dominated by the practice of remarkably few established powers because the major ground of resorting to anticipatory self-defence and a large portion of LOAC is customary international law, which has been developed by these “specially affected” States to advance their interests. For newly rising powers such as China, failing to meet the requirements of “persistent objector” before and after the birth of a rule at concern would not relieve their obligation to comply. A successful example where a contrary practice of a large number of weaker States makes a few powerful States switch from an established rule of customary international law to an emerging new rule is rare. It is extremely difficult for a militarily disadvantaged State that lacks field experience to replicate such a strategy in areas involving force.\n104. To prevent coercive erosions of its sovereignty, China’s strategy is to embed a firewall at the most representative and democratic lawmaking forum to obstruct the convenient transplantation of power disparity from the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to the special regimes of international law that constitute cornerstones of an evolving global system of Internet governance. A treaty negotiated at a more egalitarian forum such as the UNGA would enable the Chinese perspectives to carry greater weight in forming international law among a large number of similarly disadvantaged countries. And lawmaking in the form of treaty allows a less advanced State such as China to pick and choose elastically from treaties and their provisions according to its goals.\nV. Conclusion\n105. To summarize, the above analyses suggest that behind China’s general and vague opposition to an explicit affirmation of the applicability of specific LOAC rules to cyberspace and the right of self-defence in cyberspace is China’s profound concern that doing so would acquiesce to the encroachment of its sovereignty and unlock Pandora’s box of coercive external interferences with its independence in determining the mode of domestic Internet governance and the path of development.\n106. Has China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and digital economy driven it to pursue a more proactive and enterprising approach to reshaping international law governing the domain of cyber\n Alan Boyle &amp; Christine Chinkin, The Making of International Law (2007), 28-29.\n Ibid., 29.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 311\nwarfare so as to build up a competitive advantage against the established powers? At first glance, Beijing's long-term resistance to confirming the applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace before the adoption of the final UN GGE report, amid the exaggerated normative rivalry between the Russia-China Camp and the US-EU Camp, appeared to corroborate this argument. However, closer scrutiny reveals that, the conceptual generalization and ambiguity in China's resisting stance stems from the same premises underpinning the mainstream \"wait and see\" approach of most States towards utilizing international law as the primary means to regulate or justify their cyberoperations. Following the \"wait and see\" trend of State practice, China has agreed to the general applicability of the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello*, and law on State responsibility for international wrongful acts, but still resists the applicability of some specific rules in cyberspace, e.g., the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules, to allow for flexibility in responding to cyber technology development in attribution and the evolvement of international law.\n107. Despite the recent developments in its cyber defensive capacity, China remains disadvantaged as a rising power with weaker military capacity and less normative influence. China's normative proposals, exemplified by the ICCIS, serves more as bargaining leverage to protect itself from being bound by the existing or emerging law supported by the established powers, but unfavourable to itself, and also to move the focus of international legal discourse from the paradigm of military responses to cyberattacks concentrated in the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to that of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. China's normative efforts are largely defensive, given that Beijing chooses to prioritize its interests in defending against possible use of force either triggered by an alleged cyberattack or carried out in the means of cyber operations, over its offensive interests in staying less constrained in the use of cyber force.\n108. Because of the special features of how existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* were made, the normative influence of China and its SCO allies is not sufficient, at this moment, to change the practice of the frequent users of force, to come up with a norm promising effective observance by these States, or to veto the formation of new law proposed by these States at concern. The return of sovereign control in cyberspace and the focus shift of international legal discourse result from a set of factors, e.g., the limitations of current technologies and existing law, with the normative efforts of the SCO members having contributed to this global trend.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n109. But these countries can still resist the imposition of non-consensual norms upon themselves in the domain of cyberspace, obstruct the codification of disfavoured norms, and influence how other States characterize and respond to a situation involving cyber operations. This is why the seemingly unfeasible idea of an international cyber disarmament treaty concluded under the framework of the UN remains on the table. The UNSC's monopoly of authorizing the use of force and the UNGA's feature as one of the most egalitarian forums for international lawmaking make the UN the favourable forum relied on by rising powers such as China to build resilience against other lawmaking processes where established powers play a greater role, e.g., the development of customary international law or soft law in less representative forums.",

It is a Californian corporation created by a 1998 Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Commerce to transfer the power to manage and oversee the domain name system (DNS) coordination from the US government to the global community. This agreement was supposed to terminate on 30 September 2000, while subject to further amendments.²⁷ The US government did not end its supervision until October 2016,²⁸ mainly in response to the calling of major Internet technical organizations for freeing ICANN from unilateral oversight of the US as a backlash from the Snowden Disclosures.²⁹ Yet, it is early to tell whether the globalization of ICANN can be genuinely realized, given that most of its key infrastructures remain in the US territory. The deprivation of the top domain of Iraq, \".iq\", by ICANN in the Iraq war under the undue influence of the US government,³⁰ the Snowden Disclosures, and the \"Vault 7\" documents released by WikiLeaks³¹ have demonstrated the capacity and motivation of the US to abuse its dominant position in global Internet governance under the current multi-stakeholder model. 25 See generally Milton Mueller, Chapter 25: Communications and The Internet, in: Jacob Katz Cogan, Ian Hurd &amp; Ian Johnstone (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Organizations (2017), 539-542. 26 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter IV: Plan of Action. 27 Memorandum of Understanding Between The US Department of Commerce and ICANN (25 November 1998) (www.icann.org/resources/unthemed-pages/icannmou-1998-11-25-en). 28 Dave Lee, Has the US Just Given Away the Internet?, BBC News (1 October 2016) (www.bbc.com/news/technology-37527719). 29 Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation (10 October 2013) (www.icann.org/news/announcement-2013-10-07-en). 30 See LIANG Yabin, Cyberspace is the New Battlefield for Game of States in the Big Data Era, Study Times (20 October 2014) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/1020/c40531-25866183.html). 31 See, e.g., Wikileaks Exposes CIA Interference in French Presidential Elections, The European Union Times (16 February 2017) (www.eutimes.net/2017/02/wikileaks-exposes-cia-interference-in-french-presidential-elections/).

Instead, this UN GGE similarly 57 The White House Office of the Press Secretary, Fact Sheet: President XI Jinping's State Visit to the United States (25 September 2015) (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinping-state-visit-united-states). 58 US Department of Justice, First China-US Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue, Summary of Outcomes (9 October 2017) (www.justice.gov/opa/pr/first-us-china-law-enforcement-and-cybersecurity-dialogue). 59 Harold Hongju Koh, International Law in Cyberspace, 54 Harvard ILJ (2012), 4-5. 60 Above n.22, paras.19, 23. 61 Report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Development in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the context of International Security, UN Doc.

        "25": "At the UN GGE’s fifth session in 2017, the 25 participating States could not reach a consensus, particularly over the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. It was reported that the US sought “clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States’ use of ICTs”, including international humanitarian law, the right to self-defence, the law of State responsibility, and countermeasures. Cuba, backed by Russia and China which similarly opposed such an explicit affirmation, argued that following the manuscript of the US would militarize cyberspace and “legitimize unilateral punitive force actions” by “States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs”. Consequently, this session concluded without issuing a consensus report.70",

The OEWG is also mandated, “if necessary, to introduce changes to them or elaborate additional rules of behaviour”.72 As mentioned previously, China endorsed both the OEWG and the UN GGE in the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community With a Shared Future in Cyberspace released in 2020. Notably, the resolution establishing the OEWG introduces a new issue, namely, “the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives, 69 Ibid. 70 See, e.g., Elaine Korzak, UN GGE on Cybersecurity: The End of an Era?, The Diplomat (31 July 2017) (https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/un-gge-on-cybersecurity-have-china-and-russia-just-made-cyberspace-less-safe/). 71 UNGA, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

China is among the 25 countries from which UN GGE experts were appointed. The final report explicitly notes the applicability of international humanitarian law “only in situations of armed conflict” and recalls “the established international legal principles including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction” noted in the 2015 report. In the same paragraph, what comes alongside the reference to LOAC is the UN GGE’s recognition of “the need for further study on how and when these principles apply to the use of ICTs by States” and emphasis that “these principles by no means legitimizes or encourages conflict”.76 Simultaneously, the report provides that in their use of ICTs, States must not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State and shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN.77 The text of the final UN GGE report seems to have adopted the prudent approach of the OEWG.

        "29": "At the 2013 Seoul Conference on Cyberspace, HUANG Huikang, then Legal Adviser of the MOFA, underlined the overemphasis on “making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defence, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized” and “the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace”.78 At the 6th US-China Internet Industry Forum, the Chinese delegation further pointed to the numerous “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” regarding methods and means of cyber warfare, arguing for the incompetence of existing norms to address new sophisticated problems stemming from ICT development.79",

He argued that the viewpoints of some States and scholars reflected in the Tallinn Manual illustrate the “military paradigm” of “response to cyberattacks that disregards the principle of non-use of force in international law but over-emphasizes such exceptions as the right to self-defence”, which “clearly does not conform to the international reality and actual needs”.⁸²",
        "31": "In a subsequent paper, MA elaborated that the prevailing challenges States need to address are threats to cybersecurity in times of peace, most of which either are launched by non-State actors and fall under the scope of domestic law, or do not qualify as “use of force” or “armed attacks” governed by international law that apply in times of war but constitute international wrongful acts regulated by the law on State responsibility. In the latter situations, the victim State should first resort to peaceful means such as legal countermeasures or UNSC sanctions, rather than use of force. Accordingly, MA called for both further scrutiny of the applicability of existing rules of the jus ad bellum or the jus in bello to cyberspace and international lawmaking designated for the issues not addressed by these two regimes.⁸³",

For example, the following description frequently appeared on Chinese mainstream media: \"The global Internet is built upon 13 [Internet Protocol version (IPv) 4] root servers, 10 of which, including the only key root server, are located in the US. Theoretically, this gives the US the ultimate power to destroy the entire Internet infrastructure of any country.\"⁸⁶ The deprivation of Iraq's top domain by ICANN during the Iraq war is another frequently cited supporting example.⁸⁷ To tackle the issue, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently approved establishing a DNS root server and a corresponding operating organization by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, along with a plan to upgrade the network infrastructure for the IPv6-based network and encourage large-scale adoption of the IPv6 network.⁸⁸",

Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 277 Manual independent International Group of Experts.⁹⁰ Critiques of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual concentrate on its *jus ad bellum* part, particularly section 2, “the use of force”. Specifically, many scholars consider that the Tallinn Manual’s threshold on what cyber operations constitute the use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is too low. In their view, the majority of the selected International Group of Experts, who are supporters of Michael Schmitt’s “scale and effects” approach,⁹¹ artificially create some situations that have never taken place to prove that cyberattacks can result in analogous scale and effects of kinetic and non-kinetic forces. A direct transplantation of existing *jus ad bellum* to cyberspace arguably goes beyond the current practice of most States.⁹² Another major concern of Chinese scholars is that, rather than regulating the means and methods of cyber warfare, the sponsors of the Tallinn Manual intend to seek legal bases to initiate cyber or even kinetic wars. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual extensively interprets a country’s right of self-defence against non-State actors and anticipatory self-defence against an imminent threat of cyber operations. They hence argue for a higher bar than the Tallinn Manual requirements for invoking the right of self-defence within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter.⁹³",
        "35": "Given the unique features of cyber operations, it can be observed that China has been hesitant about applying specific LOAC rules to the cyber context. What are the “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” that prevent China from embracing LOAC and the Tallinn Manual at present? In the absence of any official policy, non-authoritative sources shed light on specific controversies focused on the principles of distinction and proportionality in cyberspace.⁹⁴ ⁹⁰ See, e.g., JIANG Yamin, Cyber Great Power Needs to Pay Attention to International Cybersecurity Strategies, People.com, (19 March 2015) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2015/0319/c386965-26716864.html). ⁹¹ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 11. ⁹² See, e.g., above n.89, DING &amp; ZHU, 85-86; HUANG (2016), 10-11; HUANG (2015), 150; CHEN, 154. ⁹³ See, e.g., above n.89, HUANG (2016), 8-9; HUANG (2015), 152; CHEN, 154-55. ⁹⁴ See, e.g., LI Bojun, Cyber War and the Applicability of the Law of Armed Conflict, 31 Faxue Pinglun [LR] (2013), 62-63; WANG Kongxiang, Legal Questions and Regulation of Civilian Participation in Cyber War, 5 Fazhi Yanjiu [Research on Rule of L] (2013), 100-09; CHEN, above n.89, 158; CAI Lihong, Challenges to the Principle of Distinction by Information Attacks and Strategies, 24 Xian Zhengzhi Xueyuan Xuebao [J Xi’an P Inst PLA] (2011), 95-96. Chinese JIL (2021) First, the existence of an armed conflict permits the use of lethal force based solely on the status of an individual or object. Some Chinese scholars argue that cyberattacks, in light of the latest level of technology, are not controllable so as to constrain their effects within the boundaries of military objects and therefore indiscriminate in nature.95 The 2007 nation-wide denial-of-service attacks sweeping over Estonian Internet infrastructure, including the websites and systems of its Parliament, banks, ministries and media, was cited as a typical example of indiscriminate cyberattack,96 although whether there was an armed conflict and whether such activities amounted to attacks within the meaning of LOAC is disputable. Given such practical difficulties in applying the principle of “distinction” in cyberwar, some scholars suspect the application of LOAC will open a gate for illegitimate cyber and kinetic attacks leading to humanitarian disasters.97 For example, despite its title—“Duty of care during attacks on dams, dykes, and nuclear electrical generating stations”, Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, along with the US policy that categorizes enemy “war-sustaining” objects as lawful targets, is framed as a disguised affirmation of the legitimacy of attacks on critical, yet highly dangerous infrastructures.98 The Internet was originally designed in a way capable of being immediately transformed from war-supporting civil facilities to war-fighting objects, making the majority of its components dual-use objects. Overwhelming reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure would dramatically expand the scope of targetable objects under LOAC. Accordingly, recognizing the applicability of the LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks in cyberspace would be tantamount to authorizing attacks against critical dual-use infrastructures, rendering mass civilians vulnerable to the adverse impacts of not only cyberattacks but also kinetic ones. Second, since the civilian aspect of dual-use cyber infrastructures is relevant only to the attack requirements for proportionality and precaution, the “proportionality” of attacks against objects highly dependent upon Internet or computer control systems is another worrying issue. One scholar quotes John 95 Ibid., WANG, 107; LIANG, above n.30. 96 Scheherazade Rehman, Estonia’s Lessons in Cyberwarfare, US News (14 January 2013) (www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/01/14/estonia-shows-how-to-build-a-defense-against-cyberwarfare). 97 CAI, above n.94; CUI Wenbo, The Influence on Chinese Cyber Security Interest of Tallinn Manual, 15 Jiangnan Shehui Xueyuan Xuebao [J Jiangnan Soc U] (2013), 24. 98 CAI, above n.94, 95; ibid., CUI. Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 279 Hamre, former US Deputy Defense Secretary, who is skeptical about the feasibility of using cyber operations to achieve the designated military objectives, to demonstrate the unexpected collateral damages caused by cyberattacks.⁹⁹ This scholar also considers the current rule of the proportionality of attacks, which factors “the incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damages to civilian objects, or a combination thereof” into assessing whether such collateral damages would be excessive in relation to “the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”,¹⁰⁰ as inadequate protection of civilian interests and suggests adding “knock-on effects” into consideration.¹⁰¹ Third, the distinction between civilian noncombatants and civilians who directly participate in hostilities used to be not an appealing question for Chinese scholars, not only because the Chinese military does not have a tradition of employing civilian contractors, but also because China has not sent its troops to the battlefield for more than thirty years. To reduce costs and obtain technical expertise, the increasing usage of civilians to operate cyberattacks, maintain information weapons, or support cyber combat operations by States has further eroded the distinction between combatants and civilians.¹⁰² It is reasonable for the Chinese military, government and some State-owned-enterprise to recruit civilians for activities related to cyber warfare. Although the law that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities or who adopts a continuous combat function may be lawfully attacked is not in dispute, the targetability of a civilian who assists with cyber operations depends on the answers to two questions: which people are targetable and when they may be targeted. Some Chinese scholars argue that, due to the technical predicament of identity verification and attribution, the applicable LOAC rules fail to provide certainty and predictability for the determination of individual status.¹⁰³ Fourth, another issue closely related to China’s opposition to applying some LOAC rules to cyberspace, namely, what acts may constitute a resort to ⁹⁹ Ibid., CAI, 96, quoting from Is it Real?

Chinese JIL (2021) armed force that triggers the application of LOAC, is hinted by the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (“SCO Agreement”). It is a separate question under the jus in bello, without prejudice to the question of “use of force” within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Annex 1 to this Agreement defines “information war” as: confrontation between two or more states in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining political, economic and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to taking decisions in the interest of an opposing party[.].¹⁰⁴ Although it remains unsettled whether and when an armed conflict, international or non-international, can commence based on a single cyber exchange, the SCO Agreement’s definition of war clearly expands the traditional meaning of armed conflict caused by conventional force under LOAC. Assuming that the term “war” in Annex 1 is not utilized as rhetoric, but rather as the reference of “armed conflict” within the meaning of LOAC, we may tentatively argue that the SCO members consider the existing LOAC’s scope of regulation as underinclusive because it fails to include the cyber actions that can generate political, economic, social and even psychological consequences into the realm of LOAC. ## III.

        "37": "Common Article 2 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 defines an international armed conflict as any “declared war or any other armed conflict which may arise two or more States”, regardless of whether any of them recognizes the state of war. In *Tadić*, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found “an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State.”¹⁰⁵ Undoubtedly, cyberattacks accompanying any kinetic use of force fall under the sphere of LOAC. As with cyber warfare, the pertinent question is whether a single cyber exchange in the absence of any conventional use of force can trigger an international armed conflict by itself.",
        "38": "The notion “resort to armed force” is not defined under LOAC and is easily confused with the usage of “use of force” under the *jus ad bellum*. Nevertheless, the different objects and purposes of these two regimes entail distinct legal tests of “force”. The *jus ad bellum* specifically regulates inter-State relations and States’ lawful use of force, seeking to maintain peaceful relations among nations by setting up strict conditions for invoking forceful measures, “when States may move beyond non-forceful measures such as diplomacy, economic sanctions, and countermeasures”.¹⁰⁶ By contrast, the *jus in bello* regulates the behaviour of parties to an armed conflict, and its object and purpose are to protect the military and civilian victims of war by prohibiting the harms caused by armed attacks during a conflict that are either unnecessary to effectively accomplish legitimate military objectives or excessive in relation to them.¹⁰⁷ The *jus in bello* does not govern whether the use of force is legitimate under the *jus ad bellum* but imposes restrictions on methods and means of warfare.",
        "39": "Despite the absence of a treaty definition of the notion “armed forces” under LOAC, Article 49(1) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva --- ¹⁰⁵ Prosecutor v.

Chinese JIL (2021) Conventions defines “attack” within the meaning of LOAC as “acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence”.¹⁰⁸ By concentrating on the term “violence”, Article 49(1) provides a feasible way to access cyberattacks by analogy to the physical violent effects caused by kinetic attacks. The threshold concept of “attack” is selected in light of LOAC’s object and purpose, since only acts that qualify as attacks would be subject to many of its core prohibitions and restrictions. Only qualified attacks would trigger a wide range of legal protections for the civilian population and objects under LOAC. In most cases, an unqualified act beyond the realm of LOAC would fall under the domain of domestic and international human rights law. So far, there appears to be a consensus that as long as a cyber operation attributable to a State has the equivalent effects of kinetic forces, such as death, physical injury to persons, or damages to objects, it would trigger an international armed conflict.¹⁰⁹ Similarly, Rule 30 of the Tallinn Manual suggests that the “armed force” criterion is fulfilled when a cyber operation is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to person or damage or destruction to objects.¹¹⁰ A majority of the independent experts participating in the Tallinn Manual project favour including “loss of functionality” in the definition of damages, although there are various shades of opinions among them.¹¹¹",
        "40": "The ICRC Commentary states that the term “attack” means “combat action”, without further elaboration.¹¹² A paper written by the Head of the ICRC’s Operational Law indicates that the ICRC considers the consequence-based approach as “insufficient to capture the whole range of possible effects of cyber operations and the damage that they can cause, which will not 108 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 49(1). 109 Nils Melzer, Cyberwarfare and International Law, UN Institute for Disarmament Research Publications (2011), 24 (https://unidir.org/files/publications/pdfs/cyberwarfare-and-international-law-382.pdf); Michael Schmitt, Classification of Cyber Conflict, 17 JCSL (2012), 251, n.25; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (2012), 131; Droege, above n.107, 546; Knut Dörmann, Applicability of the Additional Protocols to Computer Network Attacks, ICRC Resource Centre (19 November 2004), 3 (www.icrc.org/en/doc/resources/documents/misc/68lg92.htm). 110 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 30, 106. 111 Ibid., 108-09. 112 Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski &amp; Bruno Zimmermann (eds.), Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 (1987), para.1880. Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 283 necessarily resemble the physical effects of traditional weapons\".¹¹³ Given adequate consideration to the object and purpose of LOAC and the concerns of a gap in protection, especially the protection of civilians from the effects of war, that paper seems to endorse the \"loss of functionality\" approach adopted by the majority view of the Tallinn Manual. Based on this approach, whether a cyber operation amounts to an attack depends on whether it causes the target to lose function, even if the target is not physically damaged.¹¹⁴",
        "41": "States may support the dysfunction approach since cyber operations would be more frequently resorted, not to physically destroy or damage objects, which can be accomplished by using kinetic force, but rather to incapacitate or disrupt the normal functioning of a vital military or dual-use infrastructure.¹¹⁵ For instance, an electrical grid or water supply system might be shut down, and a country's banking or stock-trading system could be manipulated, both without any physical damage. As is demonstrated by the 2007 Estonian denial-of-service attacks, for certain civilian populations, the potential hardship arising from such dysfunction could be far more extensive or severe than the physical destruction of a particular building. Such effects might not be comparable to those caused by physical violence, but they are \"precisely the kind of severe consequences from which [LOAC] seeks to protect the civilian population\".¹¹⁶",
        "42": "According to the dysfunction approach, cyberattacks against military or dual-use infrastructure, such as paralyzing information systems, altering or deleting processes and resources, are attacks that can trigger the application of LOAC, while applying the consequence-based approach would lead to a contrary conclusion. The applicable LOAC rule maintains that cyberattacks resulting in no physical damage are lawful.¹¹⁷ The US-EU camp intends to stay with the existing rule and has codified it in the Tallinn Manual. Although international law evolves to reflect the changing values developed by the international community, most States remain silent on this issue. Whether LOAC should expand its established interpretation of attacks depends on future State practice. ¹¹³ Droege, above n.107, 546. ¹¹⁴ Ibid., 546-47. ¹¹⁵ Ibid. ¹¹⁶ Ibid., 549. ¹¹⁷ Schmitt, above n.106, 291. Chinese JIL (2021)",
        "43": "Part of the SCO Agreement defines war as the “confrontation between two or more States in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes, and resources, critical and other structures”. Under this part of the definition, those confrontations that happen without any physical damages would not qualify as attacks and therefore be lawful under LOAC. The remaining part, namely, inter-State confrontations in cyberspace aimed at “undermining political, economic, and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to [take] decisions in the interest of an opposing party”, is unlikely to fall into the scope of attacks under LOAC either.",
        "44": "On Article 49 of Additional Protocol I, the *Bothe, Partsch and Solf Commentary* underlines that attacks refer to “those aspects of military operations that most directly affect the safety of the civilian population and the integrity of civilian objects”.¹¹⁸ It would be difficult to assert that political, economic, social, or even psychological effects of cyber operations could be deemed most directly affecting the personal safety of civilians or the physical integrity of civilian objects. Dissemination of propaganda, espionage, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological or economic warfare does not fall under the concept of attack in LOAC.¹¹⁹",
        "45": "LOAC endeavours to regulate methods and means of war and the treatments of different groups. Under LOAC, a State wants to protect its civilian population and objects, and at the same time, be able to use lethal force against the belligerent party once an armed conflict commences. An overinclusive definition of “attack” will subject the civilian population to catastrophic consequences that would have been avoided by applying the present definition with a high threshold. Such consideration partly explains why most States remain silent in the face of cyberattacks.¹²⁰",
        "46": "The SCO Agreement’s definition of war demonstrates the six countries’ concerns of adverse impacts by acts that do not qualify as attacks and coincides with Russia’s proposal for non-proliferation of information weapons. But, unlike biological and chemical weapons, the usage of so-called information weapons does not necessarily lead to unnecessary suffering of humans ¹¹⁸ Michael Bothe, Karl Josef Partsch &amp; Waldemar A. Solf, New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts: Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (1982), 325. ¹¹⁹ Ibid., 289. ¹²⁰ See, e.g., Gary Brown, Why Iran didn’t admit Stuxnet was an attack, 63 Joint Force Quarterly (2011), 71. Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 285 and might even reduce physical harm compared to the usage of conventional forces regarding the accomplishment of the same military objective. This feature of information weapons makes them not a proper subject matter for a total (or partial) ban. By their features and consequences, unqualified cyberattacks are more suitable to be regulated by regimes other than LOAC for the time being. As demonstrated by the final UN GGE report, leading SCO members, including China, Russia, and Kazakhstan, no longer dispute the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict, although controversies over, for example, the qualification of single cyber exchange as attacks under the meaning of LOAC, remain unsettled. Hence, the SCO members may continue to advance the broad interpretation of “attack” to build up consensus for new norms while resisting the application of the existing LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks. ## III.B. Dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities",
        "47": "As a “cardinal principle”¹²¹ of LOAC, the principle of distinction requires that a distinction be made between military and civilian persons and objects and prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. Article 52(1) of Additional Protocol I defines “civilian objects” in a negative manner as “all objects which are not military objectives”.¹²² Military objectives are those “by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage”.¹²³ According to Rule 39 of the Tallinn Manual, an object cannot be civilian and military simultaneously; its status is either one or the other.¹²⁴ Therefore, the entire dual-use object becomes a military objective from the moment it is used for military action, even if its military use is only “marginal” compared to its civilian use. Such observation represents today’s prevailing view on the qualification of dual-use objects as targetable military objectives.¹²⁵ ¹²¹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, 257, para.78. ¹²² Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 52(1). ¹²³ Ibid., Art. 52(2). ¹²⁴ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 39 and its Commentary, para.1. ¹²⁵ See Droege, above n.107, 562; Michael Schmitt, The Law of Cyber Targeting, Tallinn Paper No.7 (2015), 11. Chinese JIL (2021)",
        "48": "From the perspective of civilian protection, the “potentially non-lethal nature of cyberweapons”¹²⁶ draws concerns over an “expanded target list”¹²⁷ and an obscured assessment of the legality of an attack. In a world where a large part of civilian infrastructure and services are highly reliant on international cyber infrastructure, including the Internet, servers, routers, cables, satellites, and computers, the danger of loss of function, partial damage or complete destruction is evident. For example, approximately 98% of US government communications use civilian-owned and civilian-operated networks.¹²⁸ Under LOAC, belligerent parties can easily target cyber infrastructure as military objectives because mere containing, storing, or transmitting a tiny percentage of military data would render the entire infrastructure a legitimate target.",
        "49": "Several scenarios of consequences of attacks against dual-use cyber infrastructure entail humanitarian concerns for civilian protection. The past decade witnessed the increasing use of cloud computing, the users of which are usually unaware of which server their data is stored on and whether military data is stored on the same server. Cyberspace is an artificial battlefield, where, unlike natural theatres of war, such as land or airspace, travelling military data or weapons (e.g., malware, botnet, or malicious codes) can make not only itself a legitimate target but also the transmitting infrastructure a military objective. It can be a computer system, a communication network, a server or router, a major cable, a satellite, or in the worst case, the entire Internet network system.¹²⁹",
        "50": "The Tallinn Manual provides that “the circumstances under which the Internet in its entirety could be attacked [are] so highly unlikely as to render the possibility purely theoretical at the present time”, and that “virtually any attack against the Internet would have to be limited to certain discrete segments thereof”.¹³⁰ Nevertheless, it also acknowledges that “it may be impossible to know over which part of the network military transmissions, as distinct 126 Jeffrey T. G. Kelsey, Hacking into International Humanitarian Law: The Principle of Distinction and Neutrality in the Age of Cyber Warfare, 106 Michigan LR (2007-2008), 1439. 127 Eric Talbot Jensen, Unexpected Consequences from Knock-on Effects: A Different Standard from Computer Network Operations, 18 Am U ILR (2003), 1149. 128 Eric Talbot Jensen, Cyber Warfare and Precautions against The Effects of Attacks, 88 Texas LR (2010), 1534. 129 See, generally, Droege, above n.107, 562-65. 130 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 39 and its Commentary, para.5. Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 287 from civilian ones, will pass. In such cases, the entire network (or at least those aspects in which transmission is reasonably likely) qualifies as a military objective.”¹³¹",
        "51": "In the physical world, the irrelevance of dual-use objects’ civilian part regarding the principle of distinction is no longer in dispute. In cyberspace, the broad interpretation might lead to extreme situations where nothing civilian remains. More importantly, being a military objective will incur not only attacks in cyberspace but also fatal kinetic attacks. As a result, the fundamental rule that civilian population and objects enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations becomes an empty shell, leaving such situations only subject to protection under the principles of proportionality and precaution.",
        "52": "Almost all States and legal commentators agree that the element of “make[s] an effective contribution to military action” in Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I includes a contribution towards “war-fighting” or “war-supporting” capabilities of the belligerent party.¹³² War-fighting objects refer to those used in combat, while war-supporting objects are what military operations rely on in some “relatively direct sense”.¹³³ In the cyber context, typical war-supporting objects are factories producing hardware or software or other kinds of information weapons,¹³⁴ all of which qualify as military objectives. Controversy on this element concentrates on the “war-sustaining” object policy of the US, which has been adopted by a few States so far.¹³⁵ The majority of Tallinn Manual independent experts refused to include war-sustaining objects into military objectives due to the remote relationship between them and military operations.¹³⁶",
        "53": "The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations of the US extends the expression of Article 52(2) to “effectively contribute to the enemy’s war-fighting or war-sustaining capability”.¹³⁷ The term “war-sustaining” encompasses objects within “an economy or governmental financial system” ¹³¹ Ibid., para.3. ¹³² Schmitt, above n.125. ¹³³ Ibid. ¹³⁴ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16. ¹³⁵ Schmitt, above n.125, 12. ¹³⁶ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16. ¹³⁷ Department of the Navy and Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, NWP 1-14M/MCWP 5-12.1/COMDTPUB P5800.7A (July 2007), para.8.2. Chinese JIL (2021) relied on by the enemy to fund participation in the conflict.¹³⁸ For instance, the revenue from cotton export during the US Civil War enabled the Confederate States to finance and therefore sustain its war.¹³⁹ Contemporary examples are oil industries of the terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Shams, whose funding of war relied on revenues from oil exports.¹⁴⁰ The rationale behind the war-sustaining approach in the sense of traditional warfare is that the destruction of certain economic objects that are not absolutely “indispensable to civilian survival”, yet currently protected under LOAC, would shorten a conflict and therefore reduce the potential casualty toll and generate societal changes.¹⁴¹",
        "54": "The different effects of cyberattacks and kinetic ones might make cyberattacks against war-sustaining objects more effective in achieving the expected military goal. Using cyber operations to paralyze the infrastructure upon which a central banking system is built, or delete funds from accounts, or change account balances, or manipulate the stock market, will lead to a collapse of the enemy’s confidence. According to the applicable law, many of such cyber operations may not even qualify as attacks under LOAC. Despite the unique advantage of cyberattacks, the military advantage of cyber operations on war-sustaining objects might be indefinite and difficult to articulate.¹⁴² Critiques of war-sustaining objects within the sphere of traditional warfare can apply indiscriminately to cyberspace. There would be no limits to warfare, providing that substantially the entire economy of a country can be considered as war-sustaining.¹⁴³ Consequently, a much broader scope of military objectives that include the enemy’s research and development capabilities would devastate the humanitarian values upheld by the principle of distinction.",
        "55": "To sum up, the Chinese scholars’ view that applying some existing rules of LOAC to cyberspace would potentially “open a gate for humanitarian 138 Schmitt, above n.125, 12. 139 US Naval War College, Annotated Supplement to the Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations (1997), 400, n.11. 140 Schmitt, above n.125, 12. 141 See Charles J. Dunlap, The End of Innocence, Rethinking Noncombatancy in the Post-Kosovo Era, 28 Strategic R (Summer 2002), 9. 142 US Department of Defense Office of General Counsel, An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations (May 1999), 8 (https://fas.org/irp/eprint/io-legal.pdf). 143 Droege, above n.107, 568. Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 289 disasters” is reasonable, given that attacks against dual-use infrastructure are currently lawful in most cases. Unless there is a breakthrough in law, attacks against major cyber infrastructure would remain subject to the legal safeguards for civilian protection embodied in the principles of proportionality and precaution. As with Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, targeting highly dangerous infrastructure, such as dams, dikes, and nuclear electrical generating stations, violates the established rule enshrined in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I, which explicitly prohibits targeting listed infrastructure even if they constitute military objectives.",
        "56": "Some may argue that, instead of denying the existing law, a government should assume its responsibility to ensure that military data or weapons do not taint civilian facilities. Unfortunately, the present level of technology and the indiscrepable relationship between civilian and military components in global cyberspace holds little promise for such complete separation.",
        "57": "Another alternative proposal pertinent to the Chinese scholars’ argument is to expand the list of “works and installations containing dangerous forces” in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I by analogy so that critical cyber infrastructure could not be made targetable objects.¹⁴⁴ But the hurdle for adequate State support for this effort remains high. It would be difficult to convince States that the potentially nonlethal effects of attacks on cyber infrastructure could be made comparable to that of radioactive materials leak or flood.",
        "58": "China has never embraced the “war-sustaining” approach. As demonstrated by the SCO Agreement’s definition of war, China’s perception of threats to the safety and normal functionality of its cyber infrastructure is more oriented towards cyber operations below the threshold of attacks under LOAC. In other words, a lower bar of attacks capable of triggering the application of LOAC is demanded. Meanwhile, the Chinese scholars who expressed concerns over allowing attacks against dual-use and war-sustaining objects under LOAC might want to remove these objects from LOAC’s list of legitimate military objectives. To simultaneously realize the objectives of the SCO members and the mentioned Chinese scholars would require any cyber operations falling under the SCO Agreement’s definition to only attack objects exclusively used for military purposes and dual-use objects that are neither highly dangerous nor counted as cyber infrastructure. Such handling ¹⁴⁴ Robin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann, Cyber Warfare: Applying the Principle of Distinction in an Interconnected Space, 45 Israel LR (2012), 390. Chinese JIL (2021) might significantly reduce the legitimate functioning space for cyberattacks and prevent them from doing what they are best at, namely, accomplishing military advantage precisely without causing non-reversible damages of critical civilian infrastructure and having the potential to stay non-violent and reduce collateral losses. Such consequences turn out to be contrary to the humanitarian intentions of these Chinese scholars to reduce the harms suffered by victims of war. ## III.C. Proportionality of cyberattacks against infrastructures",
        "59": "Given that the interconnectedness of military networks and their heavy reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure has left the principle of distinction virtually empty of contents, the principle of proportionality becomes an ultimate rule for protecting civilian persons and objects. This principle prohibits attacks “which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.145 In light of the harsh challenges imposed by the unique features of cyber warfare, the actual role that the principle of proportionality can play could not be overstated.",
        "60": "Under LOAC, what can be considered as “excessive” incidental damage to civilian objects in comparison with the expected concrete and direct military advantage remains controversial. The principle of proportionality is “more easily stated than applied in practice”. As a matter of fact, findings of excessive incidental damage to civilian infrastructure are very few and far between as compared to the military advantage.146 Moreover, the proportionality assessment in LOAC is made ex-ante when expected collateral damage is weighed against the anticipated military damage.147 The practical difficulties in ascertaining the expected effects of cyber operations prevent commanders from precisely assessing the potential collateral damages to civilian objects. How to apply this principle in cyberspace hinges on the development of both legal interpretation and technology, the uncertainty of which may jeopardize 145 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 51(5)(b). 146 ICTY, Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (13 June 2000), para.19 (www.icty.org/x/file/Press/nato061300.pdf). 147 Schmitt, above n.125, 19. Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 291 this principle’s ability to prevent significant collateral damages to civilian objects in cyber warfare.",
        "61": "In the digital era, incidental damages to civilian objects will no longer be limited to physical ones but also the loss of functionality of civilian cyber infrastructure. Therefore, in order to accommodate the special needs of cyber warfare, several opinions calling for modifications of the assessment of “collateral damages to civilian objects” have emerged. For example, it is suggested that more weight should be given to temporary consequences regarding cyberattacks, for the temporary incapacity of critical systems would incur more severe consequences than mere inconvenience, such as in situations where loss of life may be caused by the inability of hospitals to communicate vital information.¹⁴⁸ But existing LOAC fails to provide any legal basis for this. The paradoxical applicable law is described as: whereas the destruction of a single civilian car would amount to legally relevant, albeit rather insignificant, ‘collateral damage’, the disconnection of thousands or millions of households, companies and public services from the Internet or other communication services, or the severance of online financial transactions for a country’s entire economy and the corresponding economic and societal effects as such would not count as relevant elements to be factored into the proportionality calculus.¹⁴⁹",
        "62": "Similarly, some scholars propose to include “knock-on effects” of cyber-attacks in the proportionality calculations when such an effect would not have occurred “but for” the attack.¹⁵⁰ “Knock-on effects” refer to those generated by the initial effects of the attack.¹⁵¹ Both the 1990-1992 Gulf War and the NATO action in the former Yugoslavia illustrate that the knock-on effects of targeting electricity grid may cause more harm to the affected civilians than the direct effect of these attacks themselves.¹⁵² Although existing law has not touched upon this issue, most scholars seem to agree that knock-on effects ¹⁴⁸ Oona Hathaway, et al., The Law of Cyber-Attack, 100 California LR (2012), 851. ¹⁴⁹ Geiß &amp; Lahmann, above n.144, 397. ¹⁵⁰ Michael Schmitt, Heather Harrison Dinniss &amp; Thomas C.

Chinese JIL (2021) should be part of the proportionality analysis to the extent they are “reasonably foreseeable”,[153] which resonates with the term “expected” in Additional Protocol I.",
        "63": "Commentary to Rule 51 of the Tallinn Manual includes both direct and indirect effects of attacks in the proportionality assessment.[154] The former means “the immediate, first-order consequences, unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms”, and the latter refers to “the delayed and/or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms”. Without deliberately using the same term, the Tallinn Manual adopts the “knock-on effects” approach, factoring “any indirect effects that should be expected by those individuals planning, approving, or executing a cyberattack” into the proportionality evaluation.[155] Such indirect effects can be exemplified by accidents involving transportation systems or malware inserted into a military computer system spread to other civilian computer systems and thereafter disables them, where those risks are or should have been expected. Such indirect effects may result from blocking the Global Positioning Satellite data or disrupting the Global Positioning System.[156] Inconvenience, irritation, stress, or fear caused by cyber operations are explicitly excluded from collateral damages to civilian objects.[157]",
        "64": "The Chinese scholars' view on the theoretical and practical difficulties in applying the present law on proportionality concurs with the mainstream view among international law commentators. The Tallinn Manual's rules and commentaries on this principle are early attempts to codify the prevailing treaty interpretation, contributing to an enhanced relief valve of attacks against critical cyber infrastructure. The Chinese scholars' critiques of Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, which permits attacks against highly dangerous infrastructure, were not made in conjunction with Rule 51, becoming an interpretation out of context. The proportionality assessment under existing law disillusions those who wish to use it to make up for the failure of rules regarding the principle of distinction in protecting civilian safety. If the applicable LOAC rules regarding the principles of distinction and proportionality remain unchanged, the principle of precaution would be the only safeguard left. 153 Schmitt, above n.150. 154 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 160, para.6. 155 Ibid. 156 Ibid. 157 Ibid., para.5.

In cyber warfare, “for such time” as civilians directly participate in hostilities, they not only become legitimate targets of military operations but also are bound by LOAC rules governing the conduct of hostilities. Furthermore, such civilians should not be factored into the proportionality calculation. They are not considered for the principle of precaution that aims to avoid or minimize incidental harm to civilians.¹⁶⁰",
        "66": "Civilians may be targeted for direct participation in hostilities. Currently, given the complexity of this issue, there is no authoritative guidance on which activities qualify as direct participation.¹⁶¹ The present State practice, the jurisprudence of international judicial bodies and prevailing academic views adopt a case-by-case determination method through exemplification rather than illustration.¹⁶² To address when civilians may be targeted, the ICRC sponsored a five-year research project in 2003 and produced its *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law* (“Interpretive Guidance”).¹⁶³",

        "68": "There is no reason to distinguish cyber operations from kinetic operations regarding how civilian conducts qualify as direct participation in hostilities, as most controversies are not cyber-specific. Critiques of the Interpretive Guidance in conventional warfare do not necessarily stand in cyberspace. According to the “threshold of harm” element, an act amounting to hostility does not have to qualify as an attack within the meaning of LOAC, which indispensably entails the infliction of death, injury, or destruction on military personnel and objects. “Essentially any consequence adversely affecting the military operations or military capacity” of an opposing party would satisfy the test.¹⁶⁷ Compared to the difficulties in arming civilians with traditional weapons, the technical barrier to cyber armed civilians is almost non-existent. It is too easy for civilians to have the know-how to conduct harmful cyber activities.¹⁶⁸ Therefore, in cyber warfare, “the pool of targetable individuals could be extremely large in future conflicts, far more than is the case in classic conflict.”¹⁶⁹",

Engaging in developing cyber defence systems, such as encryption technology, firewalls or anti-virus software, also falls under this category.

Commentators questioned the rationality of the ICRC's interpretation of the term \"for such time\" when a direct participant can be targeted.172 The ICRC provides that this period covers preparatory measures of a specific act of direct participation, deployment to or return from the activity concerned.173 They argued that the restrictive interpretation has dramatically narrowed the window of targetability, rendering this standard particularly impractical in cyber warfare.174 There is usually no deployment to or return from cyber operations since most of them are controlled remotely.",
        "71": "More importantly, the duration of cyber operations can be extremely short, sometimes even too brief to identify the attacker.175 Or, in some cases, for example, a surreptitiously emplaced logic bomb, the effect of cyber operations can be long-delayed.176 A better approach is suggested to cure this deficiency: To characterise an individual who engages in multiple cyber operations that are part of an on-going cyber campaign as a direct participant targetable throughout the period of activity.

Members of organized armed groups are the other category of civilians that are legitimate targets of military operations.^[178]^ According to the Interpretive Guidance, only those with a “continuous combat function” can be attacked.^[179]^ The NATO members and Israel favour including all members of a group formed to conduct hostilities.^[180]^ These countries criticize the requirement of “continuous combat function” as affording greater protection to members of organized groups than members of the armed forces, whereas the former enjoy no right to engage in hostilities while the latter does.^[181]^ In the human-made theatre in cyberspace, where distinguishing members of organized armed groups from civilians can be far more difficult and uncertain than on physical battlefields, the additional requirement of ensuring that a member performs “continuous combat function” seems impractical and unnecessary. After all, LOAC’s presumption of civilian status in the case of doubt has offered adequate protection for such members.^[182]^",
        "73": "At first sight, the Chinese scholars’ view tends to see the problem as a practical one of attribution and verification rather than one of law. Nonetheless, such difficulties give rise to debates about legal issues specific to cyber warfare. To the degree that the targetability of civilians is concerned, the critiques of the Interpretive Guidance mainly stem from practical difficulties, before or at the moment of targeting, in distinguishing members of armed groups or civilians directly participating in hostilities from civilians.",

If China ends up agreeing with the applicability of LOAC rules on this issue, it might favour the ICRC’s restrictive standard of “for such time” and “continuous combat function”, not only because of China’s defensive rather than offensive approach to the use of force, but also because of its humanitarian considerations to protect the lives of a large number of civilians relate—occupationally to activities that have a bearing on military operations, or personally to someone occasionally carrying out conduct of hostilities—from lethal attacks.",
        "75": "For the purpose of civilian protection, the better approach for States turns out to be recruiting only military personnel, ideally with uniforms and other distinctive marks, for military operations by cyber means. While accessible in theory, the transformation of non-State cyber actors into national forces would be time-consuming. As a reminder, the privateers were not completely abandoned by States until the time when the maritime powers had developed strong navies, which were capable of forcing the armed merchants who refused to integrate into the navy to put down their weapons in exchange for State protection on the high seas and defeating privates and enemy fleets.^[183]^ ## IV. The objectives of China’s normative proposals",
        "76": "Based on its limited number of available official statements and practices, China’s opposition to the applicability of some LOAC rules in cyberspace remains vague and general from a legal perspective. The SCO Agreement’s expansive version of cyber “war” indicates that China’s earlier position did not distinguish armed conflicts from other situations, although the application of LOAC hinges on such a differentiation. Apart from the catchall interpretation of cyberattacks, many Chinese scholars expressed concerns over the adequacy of the LOAC rules governing the targetability of dual-use infrastructure and certain groups of civilians and the principle of proportionality. These concerns are not groundless both in terms of law and practice. In fact, the ICRC’s views on the three issues, or even some corresponding rules of the Tallinn Manual, address their concerns well. The practice of the US and its allies that China opposes has not hardened into customary international law binding on all ^[183]^ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering: A Historical Analogy, Cyber Studies Programme Working Paper No. 1 (March 2015), 3-6, 9 (www.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/cybersecurity-and-the-age-of-privateering-a-historical-analogy.html). Chinese JIL (2021) States that fail to maintain persistent objection to it. These facts have contributed to China's incremental acceptance of the general applicability of LOAC to the cyber context despite many remaining controversies over how specific LOAC rules should be interpreted and applied to cyber operations.",
        "77": "As with China's concerns over the Tallinn Manual's overemphasis on the military paradigm of responses to cyberattacks in international legal discourse, which threatens to derogate from the principle of non-use of force and to abuse the right to self-defence, a more diverse group of experts was composed to draft the second version of the Tallinn Manual, to address the criticisms of the limited diversity of the group of experts participating in drafting the first version of the Tallinn Manual[184] and this group's overreliance on Western legal sources.[185] There were three non-Western experts from China, Belarus and Thailand, among the nine experts who participated in the formulation process of Tallinn Manual 2.0.[186] The scope of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 expands from \"above the threshold\" cyber operations whose \"scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force\"[187] or which are \"executed in the context of an armed conflict that [is] subject to the LOAC\"[188] to \"below the threshold\" cyber operations that take place in peacetime and fall outside the regulatory scope of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello.",
        "78": "The threshold of use of force functions as a firewall that separates cyber operations which can trigger the exercise of the right to self-defence by a victim State from cyber operations that can entail only pacific countermeasures. As previously mentioned, a major concern of China points to the Tallinn Manual's threshold on which cyber operations constitute use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The Chinese perspective considers it as a low standard intended to accommodate some States' strategic 184 Dieter Fleck, Searching for International Rules Applicable to Cyber Warfare—A Critical First Assessment of the New Tallinn Manual, 18 JCSL (2013), 335; Ido Kilovaty, Cyber Warfare and the Jus ad Bellum Challenge: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, 5 Am U Nat'l S L Brief (2014), 108. 185 Kirsten E.

Rule 69 stipulates the “scale and effects” approach.¹⁸⁹ Rule 71 provides that only “a State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence”.¹⁹⁰ The International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual reached a consensus that the scale of effects of cyber operations causing physical consequences can be considered as comparable to those of kinetic operations and hence the use of force under the *jus ad bellum*.¹⁹¹ But they contested over the status of cyber operations that have no consequences in the physical world but can lead to serious consequences.¹⁹²",

        "81": "Consequently, the victim State’s response in most cases would be limited to measures falling below the threshold of use of force, such as countermeasures²⁰¹ or referring the matter to the UNSC.²⁰² By far, the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Rules have identified only the Stuxnet attack as meeting the Tallinn threshold of use of force; some experts considered it as meeting the higher “scale and effects” threshold of an armed attack that can trigger the application of LOAC.²⁰³ Even American military lawyers and scholars, who are deemed by their Chinese counterparts as seeking to militarize cyberspace through lowering the threshold of use of force, have admitted that, “the prevailing view is that most, if not all, documented cyber actions taken by States to date have fallen below the ‘use of force’ threshold.”²⁰⁴ Apart from the narrowly construed right to self-defence in situations of armed conflicts, Rule 20 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides a broader right of States to take countermeasures in time of peace, “whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal 197 Ibid. 198 Ibid., 591. 199 Above n.21, Tallinn Manual, Rule 15; Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 73. 200 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, 351-53; Eichensehr, above n.185, 587. 201 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, Rule 20, 161. 202 Ibid., Rule 76, 357. 203 Ibid., 342. 204 Gary Corn &amp; Eric Jensen, The Technicolor Zone of Cyberspace–Part I, Just Security (30 May 2018) (www.justsecurity.org/57217/technicolor-zone-cyberspace-part/).

        "82": "The narrow construction of the right to self-defence and countermeasures under the Tallinn Rules demonstrates the reluctance of the International Group of Experts to permissibly authorize a State to undertake unilateral acts that would result in effects in the territory of another State, in another word, a strong pro-sovereignty inclination of the Tallinn Rules. In contrast, the US and the UK argued that sovereignty did not by itself constitute a specific rule of international law that cyber operations might violate, but rather a foundational principle of international law that undergirds specific rules of international law, such as the prohibition against the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the rule of non-intervention under customary international law. In these two countries’ view, such a principle has no binding effect, and low-scale cyber operations deployed by a State that generate effects in another State’s territory but do not breach any of these specific rules, do not violate international law merely because of their incompatibility with the abstract principle of sovereignty.²⁰⁷ This controversy over the status of sovereignty remains unsettled in the final UN GGE report mainly due to the UK’s active participation in the UN GGE. Yet NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations released in 2020 has endorsed the status of sovereignty as a rule of international law in a footnote, with the UK as the only NATO member having reserved on that footnote.²⁰⁸",
        "83": "Therefore, although the Tallinn Rules were developed under the auspices of NATO, they represent neither the exceptional perspectives of some States such as the US or the UK nor the collective views of the NATO members.

Chinese JIL (2021) express their legal positions to shape the codification process, many States maintained a persistent policy of silence and ambiguity on the specificities of existing or emerging norms regulating cyberspace.²⁰⁹ Meanwhile, the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, together with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, convened two consultative meetings in April 2015 and February 2016 with representatives from more than one hundred States, including China.²¹⁰",
        "84": "The technological difficulties in credibly attributing responsibility for cyber operations, the ongoing controversies over which existing rules apply to cyberspace, their contents, the suitability of the prevailing international legal framework as the primary method to regulate inter-State behaviour in cyberspace, and political and strategic considerations that have prevented States from making public attributions and invoking their rights to take responsive measures, all have contributed to the “wait and see” approach adopted by most States towards utilizing rules and norms of international law, including the Tallinn Rules, to regulate cyber operations.²¹¹ These factors cast doubt over the ripeness of codifying applicable international law in these areas. The limited State practice and opinio juris partly explain China’s “wait and see” stance, which is in line with the mainstream approach in order to preserve a degree of operational flexibility in the face of technological development and the dynamic international environment.²¹²",
        "85": "To summarize, China’s long-term insistence on the non-applicability of the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules to cyberspace does not only conform to the development trend of international normative discourses but also contributes to fuelling this momentum. Sovereign control of cyberspace has been increasingly reviving, and the focus of international legal discourse has shifted from the military paradigm concentrated on the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to the prism of general rules of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. The current landscape of international law identification and development reflects and underpins most concerns of China 209 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 588. 210 HUANG, above n.186, 84-85. 211 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 584, 588, 633, 639, 648, 653 (2018). 212 See, e.g., ZHU Lingling, Deduction and Development of State Responsibility Attribution in Cyber Attacks from the Perspective of Tallinn Manual Version 2.0, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 77-78; HUANG Zhixiong, New Trends of International Rule-making for Cyberspace: Some Considerations Based Tallinn Manual 2.0, 1 Xiamen Daxue Xuebao [J Xiamen U] (2018), 5-6.

        "86": "However, there are two residual concerns of China not reflected in the mainstream State practice following the publication of the two versions of the Tallinn Manual. They are underscored by the elements of cyber sovereignty proposed by China that call for the prohibition of using ICT, information and communications networks to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression or arms race, and the OEWG resolution's reiteration of the need for introducing additional rules of behaviour regarding States' right to combat interference in their internal affairs through the dissemination of false and distorted news and States' duty to abstain from engaging in such activities. One is external threats posed by more powerful States which may utilize their digital advantages to threaten China's national security and social stability, and the other is external limitations, either from emerging norms of international law or other established powers, of China's exercise of regulatory power over content transmitted in cyberspace to combat such threats.",
        "87": "Therefore, in addition to the mentioned concerns addressed by the mainstream State practice, China has employed its generalized and vague resistance to the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace as bargaining leverage to achieve another two objectives in international legal discourse: (1) to build up consensus for a new treaty regulating all use of cyber forces, or a disarmament treaty banning all or at least some types of information weapons, and (2) to block the formation of new law that would limit its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace and prevent disfavoured existing law from binding on its exercise of sovereign power in cyberspace. ## IV.A. A disarmament treaty &amp; national security",
        "88": "The first objective of China's opposition to an explicit affirmation of the right to self-defence and the applicability of some LOAC rules to the cyber context, namely, to build up consensus for a disarmament treaty on the use of information weapons under the auspice of the UN, emanates from the nature of States' right to self-defence. It is an inherent right reserved for States to Chinese JIL (2021) resort to force by its own decision after the enshrinement of a general prohibition of uses of force in the UN Charter.²¹³",
        "89": "As evidenced by the controversies over anticipatory self-defence in the drafting processes of the Tallinn Rules, diverse concepts and practices regarding the preconditions for the commencement of self-defence and the limitations to the exercise of this right have been invoked and contested by States. Whether Article 51 of the UN Charter allows anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defence before an armed attack occurs has long been a major point of contention. The US, the UK, Israel and some other States have construed Article 51 in a permissible manner by referring to the Caroline doctrine under customary international law, based on which they have often resorted to force. The UNSC has condemned some of such practices; the International Court of Justice took the restrictive view in the judgments of the Corfu Channel case,²¹⁴ the Nicaragua case,²¹⁵ and other decisions afterwards.²¹⁶ The restrictive approach limits States' right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter to situations where an armed attack has already taken place, excluding anticipatory self-defence. From the perspective of the degree of compliance, the effectiveness of the general prohibition of use of force is questionable. But none of these States supporting permissive interpretations dares to bluntly admit the existence of a violation or defy this universally accepted rule, although they always use various factual and legal arguments to justify their breaches.",
        "90": "In the same vein, it is not practically feasible to ensure effective observance of a norm prohibiting use of force in cyberspace, especially by these States that are frequent invokers of anticipatory self-defence. Therefore, what China and other SCO members seek is rather to influence the norm-formulation process at the UN that reflects how the international community of States characterizes a situation or act in question, e.g., as a violation of the proposed norm, and whether most States have a willingness to suppress such dubious acts. In the interim, China has not come up with a clear and concrete stance on how to develop a standard resembling Article 2(4) and Article 51 of the UN Charter in judging the legality and legitimacy of State behaviour concerning use of cyber force.

All nuclear-weapon States except China, which abstained, voted against a UNGA resolution proposing to convene the first UN conference aimed at achieving a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons.²¹⁷ On 22 January 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first multilateral agreement that bans nuclear weapons, entered into force. Although 85 States have signed and 50 of them have ratified this treaty, the non-participation of all nine States possessing nuclear weapons renders the efficacy of the treaty questionable.²¹⁸ Additionally, as manifested by Cuba's objection to an endorsement of the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, the States that do not enjoy conventional military superiority over their adversaries may have asymmetric advantages in cyberspace, which they are reluctant to give up.²¹⁹ Therefore, a cyber disarmament treaty would lack the support of both major cyber powers and the rest of the weaker cyber-armed States.",

The refrainment of most States, including the US, in most cyber tensions with other States, from resorting to the prevailing international legal framework in dealing with inter-State cyber relations, highlights the limitations of normative approaches in functioning as a general taboo for irresponsible activities in cyberspace by not only State but also private actors.",
        "94": "Compared to conventional and nuclear weapons, the technical barriers to entry in cyber warfare are so low that non-State actors and countries that are conceivably weak by the standards of hard powers can play a significant role on par with powerful countries at low levels of cost. Cyberattacks can be conducted by any actor having an electronic device and connected to the Internet. The interconnectivity of the network enables any actor to stay geographically remote from where they commit cyberattacks. Simultaneously, unlike classic military operations that rely upon territorial linkages, this interconnectivity severely decreases the degree of State control over actors and activities. The life of a treaty, particularly a disarmament treaty, rests in its enforcement. The construction of a credible monitoring and enforcement mechanism would prove to be the utmost hurdle for a cyber disarmament treaty.",

The central bone of contention in the normative competitions between the SCO members and the Western powers rests upon whether information and data transmitted in cyberspace shall be made subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State, although both sides have reached a consensus on the applicability of sovereignty as part of international law in cyberspace. At the core of this debate is how to draw the lines between the realms of domestic law and international law as consensual erosion of State sovereignty to be applied equally to all States.",
        "97": "The US holds the view that, although sovereignty gives a State the right to control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory, the exercise of such jurisdiction by the territorial State, encompassing the use and access to the Internet, must comply with that State's obligations under applicable international law, particularly international human rights law. While noting that the freedom of expression may be restricted in situations such as the incitement of imminent terrorist violence, the US considers \"certain censorship and content control, including blocking websites simply because they contain content that criticizes a leader, a government policy, or an ideology, or because the content espouses particular religious beliefs\" as constituting State violations of international human rights law.²²⁴",

The Tallinn Manual 2.0 does not touch upon the sovereignty of a State over potential data; it only mentions sovereign power over any cyber infrastructure located within States' territory and activities associated with that cyber infrastructure.

The propaganda and liaison roles played by online social networking servers, such as Facebook and Twitter, in the \"Arab Spring\" that led to social unrest, political turmoil and regime-changes in Northern African and Western Asian countries, and the exposure of the massive surveillance by the US National Security Agency in the PRISM program have strengthened the Chinese conviction of the need for Internet censorship to block and filter information in cyberspace that is harmful to China's social stability and national security.²²⁷ In the trend of the global revival of cyber sovereignty, China strengthens its sovereignty-based regulatory power by referring to similar censorship practices of other States, such as the US, Australia, Italy, Germany, France, the UK, and Korea that once held opposing views, regarding the information about terrorism, incitement to hate crimes, pornography, violence and other crimes involving the usage of the Internet.²²⁸",

Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 309 current model of Internet governance by either resorting to non-legal advocacy for Internet freedom or invoking relevant international law, especially the rules of international human rights law on the right to freedom of expression, association, and the media, and the right to access to information. Google's withdrawal from the Chinese market in 2010 was a representative example of the former means where a leading multinational company threatened the Chinese government for a policy change under the instructions of some Western countries.²²⁹ Additionally, the Chinese government has been alarmed by soft law norms applicable in peacetime that are proposed by some Western countries, such as relevant code of conduct on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace at the 2016-2017 UN GGE meetings. Such non-binding norms are intended to circumvent the advocacy of Russia and China to formulate new rules to regulate State behaviour regarding cybersecurity in the form of a treaty at the forum of the UN and may gradually harden into binding law.²³⁰",
        "102": "This argument likely explains why Cuba, Russia and China refused to explicitly affirm the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law in the cyber context in the 2017 UN GGE report, while having accepted the general applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace since the publication of the 2015 UN GGE consensus report. The crucial factor that prevented these States from reaching a consensus with the Western countries was the opposing camp's intention to introduce \"clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States' use of ICTs\"²³¹ in the UN GGE report, which threatened to restrict States' right to regulate the content of and access to information. The UN GGE report is a non-binding statement, but it may serve as proof of State practice and *opinio juris* in ascertaining whether certain international law applies to a participating State signing onto the consensus report and the extent to which the included law limits the endorsing State's right to regulate domestic affairs. Although these countries have recognized the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict upon the adoption of the final UN GGE report, residual disagreements over how specific LOAC rules apply to ICT-related activities remain prominent between them and the Western countries. ²²⁹ HUANG, above n.227, 34. ²³⁰ HUANG Zhixiong, Norms of Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace: Origin, Impact and Response, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 68-69. ²³¹ Korzak, above n.70. Chinese JIL (2021)",
        "103": "The law governing the right to self-defence and means and methods of warfare is dominated by the practice of remarkably few established powers because the major ground of resorting to anticipatory self-defence and a large portion of LOAC is customary international law, which has been developed by these “specially affected” States to advance their interests.²³² For newly rising powers such as China, failing to meet the requirements of “persistent objector” before and after the birth of a rule at concern would not relieve their obligation to comply. A successful example where a contrary practice of a large number of weaker States makes a few powerful States switch from an established rule of customary international law to an emerging new rule is rare.²³³ It is extremely difficult for a militarily disadvantaged State that lacks field experience to replicate such a strategy in areas involving force.",
        "104": "To prevent coercive erosions of its sovereignty, China’s strategy is to embed a firewall at the most representative and democratic lawmaking forum to obstruct the convenient transplantation of power disparity from the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to the special regimes of international law that constitute cornerstones of an evolving global system of Internet governance. A treaty negotiated at a more egalitarian forum such as the UNGA would enable the Chinese perspectives to carry greater weight in forming international law among a large number of similarly disadvantaged countries. And lawmaking in the form of treaty allows a less advanced State such as China to pick and choose elastically from treaties and their provisions according to its goals. V. Conclusion",
        "105": "To summarize, the above analyses suggest that behind China’s general and vague opposition to an explicit affirmation of the applicability of specific LOAC rules to cyberspace and the right of self-defence in cyberspace is China’s profound concern that doing so would acquiesce to the encroachment of its sovereignty and unlock Pandora’s box of coercive external interferences with its independence in determining the mode of domestic Internet governance and the path of development.",

Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 311 warfare so as to build up a competitive advantage against the established powers? At first glance, Beijing's long-term resistance to confirming the applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace before the adoption of the final UN GGE report, amid the exaggerated normative rivalry between the Russia-China Camp and the US-EU Camp, appeared to corroborate this argument. However, closer scrutiny reveals that, the conceptual generalization and ambiguity in China's resisting stance stems from the same premises underpinning the mainstream \"wait and see\" approach of most States towards utilizing international law as the primary means to regulate or justify their cyberoperations. Following the \"wait and see\" trend of State practice, China has agreed to the general applicability of the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello*, and law on State responsibility for international wrongful acts, but still resists the applicability of some specific rules in cyberspace, e.g., the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules, to allow for flexibility in responding to cyber technology development in attribution and the evolvement of international law.",
        "107": "Despite the recent developments in its cyber defensive capacity, China remains disadvantaged as a rising power with weaker military capacity and less normative influence. China's normative proposals, exemplified by the ICCIS, serves more as bargaining leverage to protect itself from being bound by the existing or emerging law supported by the established powers, but unfavourable to itself, and also to move the focus of international legal discourse from the paradigm of military responses to cyberattacks concentrated in the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to that of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. China's normative efforts are largely defensive, given that Beijing chooses to prioritize its interests in defending against possible use of force either triggered by an alleged cyberattack or carried out in the means of cyber operations, over its offensive interests in staying less constrained in the use of cyber force.",
        "108": "Because of the special features of how existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* were made, the normative influence of China and its SCO allies is not sufficient, at this moment, to change the practice of the frequent users of force, to come up with a norm promising effective observance by these States, or to veto the formation of new law proposed by these States at concern. The return of sovereign control in cyberspace and the focus shift of international legal discourse result from a set of factors, e.g., the limitations of current technologies and existing law, with the normative efforts of the SCO members having contributed to this global trend. Chinese JIL (2021)",
        "109": "But these countries can still resist the imposition of non-consensual norms upon themselves in the domain of cyberspace, obstruct the codification of disfavoured norms, and influence how other States characterize and respond to a situation involving cyber operations. This is why the seemingly unfeasible idea of an international cyber disarmament treaty concluded under the framework of the UN remains on the table. The UNSC's monopoly of authorizing the use of force and the UNGA's feature as one of the most egalitarian forums for international lawmaking make the UN the favourable forum relied on by rising powers such as China to build resilience against other lawmaking processes where established powers play a greater role, e.g., the development of customary international law or soft law in less representative forums."

This article argues that China’s resistance to applying some rules of the *jus in bello* to cyberspace is in line with the “wait and see” approach of most States. But there are two distinctive objectives behind this generalized stance: one is to protect its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace from being bound by disfavoured emerging and existing law, and the other is to build up consensus for a treaty regulating uses of cyber force under the United Nations framework.\n## I. Introduction\n1. International law is a generator and a product of the changing global order. China, as “both an aspirational ‘great power’ which plays a key role alongside the West in global governance, and a member of the post-colonial States which views Western hegemony with a critical eye and sees the need to champion the causes of the developing world”, no longer tries to conceal its\n* Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow, Fudan University Law School; S.J.D.

The usual disclaimer applies.\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\nincreasing willingness to be a norm entrepreneur in crafting and advancing its perspectives and values regarding various international norms. To what extent and how the rise of a new great power will influence international law largely hinges upon the interaction between the rising power and the established powers that have dominated international legal discourse for centuries. The perspectives of China and the established powers differ substantially on many issues, especially those relating to sovereign equality, non-intervention and national security. This can be exemplified by China's perspectives on many issues of cyber warfare in the normative rivalry between the United States (US)-European Union (EU) Camp and the Russia-China Camp, which are competing to influence the making of international law, as well as other countries' domestic policies.\n2. Through the International Code of Conduct for Information Security (ICCIS) first submitted to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2011 and joint efforts in other forums such as the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT), the Russia-China Camp has advanced a sovereignty-based model of Internet governance, which respects cyberspace sovereignty and State independence and legitimizes domestic efforts\nReinterpreting the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and Military Intervention for Humanitarian Purposes, 6 Asian JIL (2016), 114.\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 259\nto regulate the content of and access to information. The US-EU Camp strives to maintain the currently dominant multi-stakeholder model governed by diverse stakeholders, including governments, technical communities, the private sector and other civil society members. It does not accept the ICCIS, especially the domestic regulation on freedom of expression and association and the move towards greater sovereign control in cyberspace.\n3. Notably, China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and the digital economy, especially following the 2008 global financial crisis, did not initially bolster its assertiveness in the international lawmaking procedures that seek to identify existing law or generate new law applicable to State behaviour in cyberspace. China was a low-key participant at the early stages of the UN Group of Government Experts on the Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of Security (“UN GGE”). Its behaviour was found to be passive and frequently concurring with Russia’s stance. The Chinese representatives attending earlier UN GGE meetings were technical officers from the Ministry of Communication rather than diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign affairs (MOFA). But later, China proved to be willing to act more actively and assertively when it was singled out and its fundamental domestic interests were threatened by the disfavoured norms proposed by the established powers.\n4. In reaction to these Western normative attempts, China has transformed from a low-profile, passive team player under the Russian leadership to a proactive actor that had formed its own agenda. China’s active pattern of behaviour was prompted by a 2010 speech by Hillary Clinton, former US Secretary\n ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(a), (c), (d), (f).\n US Office of the Secretary of Defense, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2013 (May 2013), 37 (https://fas.org/man/eprint/dod-china-2013.pdf); European Parliament Resolution of 22 November 2012 on the Forthcoming WCIT-12 of the International Telecommunications Union, and the Possible Expansion of the Scope of International Telecommunication Regulations, P7_TA(2012)0451 (22 November 2012), para.5 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52012IP0451).\n US Department of State, International Cyberspace Policy Strategy (March 2016) (per Public Law 114-113, Division N, Title IV, Section 402), 16-18 (https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/255732.pdf).\n Ibid.\n As noted in: Adam Segal, Chinese Cyber Diplomacy in a New Era of Uncertainty, Aegis Paper Series No. 1703, Hoover Institution (2017), 5-6 (www.lawfareblog.com/chinese-cyber-diplomacy-new-era-uncertainty-0).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nof State, that criticized China for limiting the freedom to access the Internet and conducting online censorship. Higher-level officials from the MOFA with expertise in cyber governance started to represent China in diplomatic activities. The ICCIS was developed to counter-balance the diplomatic momentum generated by a series of US activities, including Clinton’s speeches on freedom in cyberspace between 2010-2012, the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the 2011 Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace. Beijing viewed these activities as attempting to militarize cyberspace and maintain the dominance of the US in cyber governance by interfering in other States’ sovereign right to regulate cyberspace.\n5. In 2011, the first edition of the ICCIS was submitted two months before the London Conference, a United Kingdom (UK)-sponsored attempt in line with those of the US and their allies. The ICCIS called on States “not to use information and communications technologies (ICTs), including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies”, called for “peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security”, and emphasized “the important role of the UN in formulating international norms”. An updated edition of the ICCIS with similar wording was circulated at the UNGA in 2015, possibly intended to gather wider support in the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures that harmed the US’s credibility in its continuous diplomatic attempts.\n6. The second World Internet Conference in 2015 marked the emergence of China’s own vision of global Internet governance that advocates both respect for sovereignty in cyberspace and international cooperation to “jointly build a community of shared future in cyberspace”. Chinese President XI Jinping highlighted the problems of the current global Internet governance system, including, among other things, the inadequate existing rules governing cyberspace that hardly reflect the perspectives of the majority of countries,\n As noted in ibid., 6.\n Ibid., 4-5, 7.\n ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(b), (j).\n International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the Letter dated 9 January 2015 from the Permanent Representatives of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russia Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations Addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

One proposal explicitly called on all countries to work together to “contain the abuse of information technology, oppose cyber surveillance and cyberattacks and reject arms race in cyberspace” and “push for the formulation of international cyberspace rules accepted by all parties as well as an international convention against terrorism in cyberspace, improve the legal assistance mechanism to fight cybercrimes and jointly uphold peace and security in cyberspace”.\n7. The vision of “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” was further elaborated by the Organizing Committee of the World Internet Conference in 2019. It urged countries to oppose hostile activities, acts of aggression, cyberattacks, large-scale surveillance operations, unfounded accusations of cyberattacks against other countries and attempts to politicize cybersecurity issues; prevent arms race and military conflict in cyberspace; and remain committed to resolving disputes by peaceful means. In 2020, the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace was released amid the COVID-19 pandemic that underpinned the urgency of “achieving shared development, ensuring common security, realizing joint governance, and enjoying benefits”. This document emphasized the need to “exert the roles of the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) and the UN GGE, and support formulating codes, norms and principles of responsible State conduct in cyberspace that are acceptable to all parties under the UN framework”.\n8. To assess the implications of China’s rise for the evolution of international law governing the use of force by States in cyberspace, this paper studies the normative initiatives and strategies employed by China in identifying rules of existing law and creating new law applicable to cyber warfare. In light of China’s sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance, Part II introduces the general stance of China on the adequacy of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to address cyber warfare.

Special attention is paid to legal controversies over the rules on cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities, the proportionality of cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and the targetability of certain categories of civilians. Part IV examines the rationales behind China's generalized normative proposal and its vague refusal to confirm the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello, while having recognized the general applicability of these two regimes to cyberspace. The last part concludes with a tentative assessment of the nature and the degree of China's normative influence over international lawmaking governing State behaviour in cyberspace and the possible momentum of China's policy in the future.\n## II. China's general stance on applicable law governing cyber warfare\n## II.A. China's sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance\n9. On 1 March 2017, the MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration jointly issued the first international cyber policy paper of China—the International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (ISCC)—to comprehensively introduce and explain Beijing's policy and position on issues of cyber-related international affairs. At his daily press briefing following the release, the UN Secretary-General Spokesman Stéphane Dujarric described the ISCC as “a very important report” and suggested that “China has a big role to play” in global cyber governance. The linchpin of China’s cyber diplomacy is the idea of cyber sovereignty, around which China formulates its cybersecurity policies towards three primary objectives. The first is to protect its critical information infrastructure, cyber sovereignty, national security and domestic stability from threats posed by digital power disparity among countries, cybercrimes and cyber terrorism, and external interference with China’s internal\n Statement by Ambassador FU Cong in the Assembly Meeting of the UN Conference on Disarmament on International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (9 March 2017) (www.china-un.ch/eng/hom/t1444602.htm); also MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration, International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (1 March 2017) (www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zzjg_663340/jks_665232/kjlc_665236/qtwt_665250/t1442390.shtml) [hereinafter “ISCC”].\n Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General (2 March 2017) (www.un.org/press/en/2017/db170302.doc.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 263\naffairs. The second is to shape the current global Internet governance and promote the formation of a system of international legal norms in China's favour. The third objective is to convert China's increasing cyber capacity into soft power to mobilize and influence other countries' preferences. Chapter II lays out the three elements of China's proposed idea of cyber sovereignty—regulatory authority, non-interference and sovereign equality, and the security-oriented balanced approach.\n10. The appeal for cyber sovereignty by China and other like-minded countries takes place at a time when governments' sovereign power over cyberspace is in decline for many reasons, including but not limited to the privatization of cyberspace, the rise of non-State actors and the digital gap between the developed and developing countries. As evidenced by the first and second editions of the Tallinn Manual providing that \"a State may exercise control over cyber infrastructure and activity within its sovereign territory\", sovereignty in cyberspace is not a revisionist idea by itself. According to the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Manual 2.0, this premise, which was confirmed by the 2013 Report of the UN GGE, is now \"relatively well accepted by the international community\". The US and its allies have held out to this idea in order to sustain the current platform governed by multi-stakeholders under their control.\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\n11. It is noteworthy that, among all the technical communities developing the \"law\" of the Internet and managing the global distribution of Internet resources in terms of naming and addresses, the ISCC exclusively named the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and urged the international community to \"make [ICANN] a truly independent international institution, increase its representations and ensure greater openness and transparency in its decision-making and operation\". ICANN has been a highly politicalized organization. It is a Californian corporation created by a 1998 Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Commerce to transfer the power to manage and oversee the domain name system (DNS) coordination from the US government to the global community. This agreement was supposed to terminate on 30 September 2000, while subject to further amendments. The US government did not end its supervision until October 2016, mainly in response to the calling of major Internet technical organizations for freeing ICANN from unilateral oversight of the US as a backlash from the Snowden Disclosures. Yet, it is early to tell whether the globalization of ICANN can be genuinely realized, given that most of its key infrastructures remain in the US territory. The deprivation of the top domain of Iraq, \".iq\", by ICANN in the Iraq war under the undue influence of the US government, the Snowden Disclosures, and the \"Vault 7\" documents released by WikiLeaks have demonstrated the capacity and motivation of the US to abuse its dominant position in global Internet governance under the current multi-stakeholder model.\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 265\n12. The label “multi-stakeholder” was only applied to ICANN in the wake of the battles over Internet governance initiated by national governments, which are treated as “stakeholders” on an equal footing with private corporates and members of civil society, during and after the World Summit on the Information Society, as political rhetoric to mobilize non-State actors to help resist governmental interference into Internet governance and to simultaneously make the established self-governance model more palatable to States and the UN system. ICANN is a global Internet governance organization possessing monopoly power over the DNS, but it is only subject to the sole jurisdiction of the US under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law. Due to the anticipated objection of the US, to put ICANN under the oversight of the international community of sovereign States proves difficult to attain. And an equivalent alternative to ICANN would be not only costly but also highly disruptive for Internet users.\n13. Aside from open participation, ICANN is not subject to any classic form of internal accountability that commonly exists in private corporations and nonprofit organizations, such as direct accountability mechanisms based on membership or shareholders in the Regional Internet Registries and the open, bottom-up, consensus-based standardization process of the Internet Engineering Task Force. Although ICANN self-identifies as championing the bottom-up, consensus-driven, multi-stakeholder model of governance, its policy-making processes manifest a top-down hierarchy, in which issues raised from the grassroots level end up as policy recommendations to be voted at the Board of Directors. The Board has “near-absolute” power over the bylaws governing the entirety of processes and can “untrammeled[ly]” decide whether to accept these recommendations in the absence of any binding forms of appeal or review. While anyone can join most of ICANN’s volunteer Working Groups to express their views and have the views considered based\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\non merits in the consensus-driven dialogues, “all decision making authority rests solely and exclusively in the hands of a Board of Directors.” Moreover, the Board governs the DNS through private contracts with domain name registrars and registries. The critical details and implementations of these contracts are negotiated bilaterally between ICANN and the registrars/registries, largely beyond the influence of general policies developed in the bottom-up representative processes. To summarize, ICANN seems to employ open participation as a substitute for other missing and more effective accountability mechanisms.\n14. In the ISCC, China advocates shifting from the present multi-stakeholder model of global Internet governance to a multilateral State-centric model. In the latter model, a wide range of actors are encouraged to make their respective contributions based on their capacity in the multilateral decision-making processes led by governments, particularly regarding public policies and security. China favours the UN as the principal forum to coordinate positions of various parties and build international consensus, while other international mechanisms and platforms are called on to complement based on their comparative advantage. The establishment of “multilateral, democratic, and transparent international Internet government systems” is listed as a major goal in the Thirteenth Five-Year-Plan for China’s economic and social development from 2016 to 2020.\n## II.B. International normative discourses\n15. The fundamentally divergent approaches to global Internet governance have driven China and the US to contrasting views on the adequacy of existing international law to address cybersecurity issues. The US and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies insist that prevailing\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 267\ninternational law, including the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello* and relevant rules concerning State responsibility for international wrongful acts apply to cyberspace, and that the existing international legal framework is adequate to accommodate novel situations in the information age.\n16. China’s position on the adequacy of existing international law had not crystalized until the 2013 UN GGE meeting. Since then, China has accepted, in principle, the general applicability of relevant international law to cyberspace. Despite this, China has maintained that international lawmaking is demanded to address the issues that are not clearly dealt with by existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, as parallel paths to further study the applicability of these two regimes’ established rules to cyber warfare from the perspectives of “maintaining international security, strategic mutual trust and preventing cyber conflicts”.\n17. Although the 2017 ISCC is not written in legal language, it calls for “formulating universally accepted international rules and norms of state behaviour in cyberspace within the framework of the UN” towards the ultimate goal of a “rule-based” global governance system in cyberspace. Rather than using the word “codifying”, China opted for “formulating” and emphasized the universal acceptance of rules by countries. This wording reveals China’s reluctance to recognize the applicability of some *already existing* rules of international law to cyberspace, mainly because of the under-representation of developing countries in global cyber governance. In its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the Chinese government also stated that it would “take an active role in formulating international rules in areas such as the Internet”.\n The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World (May 2011), 9 (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf); also Brian J.

In its efforts to achieve these objectives, Beijing has been increasingly active in various multilateral lawmaking forums, particularly major UN platforms such as the UNGA, UN GGE, the UN Expert Group on Combating Cybercrime and International Telecommunication Union. For example, along with the promotion of the concepts of cyber sovereignty and “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” at the World Internet Conference, a State-run annual international forum focusing on the development, use and governance of the Internet, underlying elements of these concepts have also been advocated in China’s Position Paper at the UNGA since 2014 to maintain the momentum and build consensus. These elements include: (1) peaceful use of cyberspace for economic and social development; (2) objection to cyber war and arms race; (3) the development of an international code of conduct for cyberspace under the UN framework that is acceptable to all, such as the two versions of the ICCIS; (4) strengthened international cooperation to combat cybercrimes such as cyber terrorism; and (5) objection to any country’s attempt to overstretch the concept of national security to restrict ICT development and cooperation among other countries or to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs.\n19. Additionally, issue-specific normative initiatives such as the Global Initiative on Data Security and the Comments and Recommendations of China to the 4th Meeting of the UN Open-ended Inter-governmental Expert Group on Cybercrime have also been advanced to gain prominence among\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 269\nagenda items within the UN system. These comprehensive and issue-specific normative initiatives unfold the usage of issue linkage under China's overall scheme of the legal framework governing cyberspace, under which the issues of the development and use of the Internet, cyber and data security, cybercrimes, cyber governance and cyber warfare that transcend different fields of international law are simultaneously placed on the agenda of international lawmaking to keep this bundle of issues at the frontline.\n20. In light of the digital divide between the developed and developing countries and the inequitable order of the existing international legal system, China has been aligning normative efforts at regional and South-South forums such as the BRICS, Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO), the ASEAN Regional Forum, China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in support of lawmaking activities at the UN. The progress China has made in enhancing agenda-shaping and coalition-building capacities can be exemplified by the agenda item of \"International Law in Cyberspace\" proposed by China for the 53rd Annual Session of the AALCO and the data security cooperation initiative signed between the Arab League and China.\n21. Meanwhile, bilateral normative discourses between China and other major powers are ongoing, aiming to figure out common interests and build up consensus for future international lawmaking. Among these, the most\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\nnoticeable landmark is an agreement reached by the US and China in 2015 over mutual refrain from knowingly conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property and further efforts in identifying and promoting appropriate norms of State behaviour in cyberspace.57 The first US-China Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue in 2017 once signalled a possibility for greater cooperation.58 However, since 2018, the deterioration of these countries' bilateral relations has stagnated confidence-building measures towards further coordination and cooperation.\n22. In the context of cyber warfare, the US position is that existing LOAC, including its principles of distinction, necessity, and proportionality, applies in cyberspace.59 By contrast, China, Russia, and other SCO members have not agreed to the US stance and played a rival role. In the 2013 Report of the UN GGE, China and Russia managed to exclude any reference to the applicability of international humanitarian law principles in cyberspace, despite the controversial affirmation of the applicability of \"international law\" and the UN Charter.60 The 2015 UN GGE Report explicitly \"notes\" the possible applicability of \"the established international legal principles, including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction\", while cautiously avoiding making any reference to international humanitarian law.61 The wording of this text fails to clarify whether the UN GGE reached a consensus on the applicability of these LOAC principles to cyber activities or merely noted their existence. Moreover, although the 2015 UN GGE Report mentions the prohibition on the threat or use of force against any State's territorial integrity or political independence,62 it does not refer to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks amounting to use of force as an exception to such general prohibition. Instead, this UN GGE similarly\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 271\n\"noted the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter\", which arguably encompasses the right to self-defence according to most Western countries.^[63]^\n23. Without an explicit official position, Beijing's stance on many occasions has been found to be general yet frequently in line with Russia's efforts to negotiate an international arms control treaty on the use and non-proliferation of information weapons.^[64]^ For example, the 2011 ICCIS proposes \"not to use ICTs, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies\", and calls for \"peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security\".^[65]^ In the updated ICCIS circulated at the UNGA in 2015, the controversial terms of \"proliferate information weapons\" is omitted, and the original paragraph is replaced by \"not to use ICTs and information and communications networks to carry out activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security\".^[66]^\n24. The ISCC pronounces China's consistent opposition to certain countries' \"Cold War Mentality\" in characterizing international relations in cyberspace as a \"zero-sum game\" and abusing the predominant position in global Internet governance to secure advantages by militarization and deterrence build-up in cyberspace.^[67]^ By calling the international community to adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, particularly non-use of force and peaceful settlement of disputes, the ISCC articulates the idea of upholding peace through international cooperation and safeguarding a country's own security that underpins \"common security\" of the international community of States \"on the basis of full respect for other countries' security\".^[68]^ Specifically, the ISCC proposes that \"all countries must oppose ICT-backed acts of hostility and aggression, prevent arms race and conflicts in cyberspace and settle disputes through peaceful means\"; China plans to work with other countries to \"curb the abuse of information technology and prevent arms race\n^[63]^ Ibid., para.28(c).\n^[64]^ As noted in: John Markoff and Andrew E. Kramer, US and Russia Differ on a Treaty for Cyberspace, NY Times (27 June 2009) (www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/world/28cyber.html).\n^[65]^ ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(b), (j).\n^[66]^ Above n.13.\n^[67]^ ISCC, above n.17, Chapter II: The Principle of Peace, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n^[68]^ Ibid., Chapter II: The Principle of Peace.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nin cyberspace”. While the ISCC discourages militarization of cyberspace, China plans to enhance its “defense capability in cyberspace” and “expedite the development of a cyber force” with the aim to “prevent a major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security and maintain national security and social stability”.69\n25. At the UN GGE’s fifth session in 2017, the 25 participating States could not reach a consensus, particularly over the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. It was reported that the US sought “clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States’ use of ICTs”, including international humanitarian law, the right to self-defence, the law of State responsibility, and countermeasures. Cuba, backed by Russia and China which similarly opposed such an explicit affirmation, argued that following the manuscript of the US would militarize cyberspace and “legitimize unilateral punitive force actions” by “States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs”. Consequently, this session concluded without issuing a consensus report.70\n26. In December 2018, the First Committee of the UNGA adopted two resolutions to continue the international discussions of norms on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace by establishing two parallel working processes: one is a new GGE sponsored mainly by the US,71 and the other is the OEWG proposed by Russia that allows all interested Member States to participate in further studying the existing rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour identified by the previous UN GGE reports. The OEWG is also mandated, “if necessary, to introduce changes to them or elaborate additional rules of behaviour”.72 As mentioned previously, China endorsed both the OEWG and the UN GGE in the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community With a Shared Future in Cyberspace released in 2020. Notably, the resolution establishing the OEWG introduces a new issue, namely, “the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives,\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 273\nthe dissemination of false and distorted news, which can be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of other States or as being harmful to the promotion of peace, cooperation and friendly relations among States and nations”.73 The US criticized this resolution’s language borrowed from a controversial 1981 UNGA resolution that declares the duty of a State to “abstain from any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other States”.74 Meanwhile, Russia positioned itself as an advocate for democracy for all UN Member States, given the exclusive club nature of the UN GGE.75\n27. In May 2021, the 2019-2020 UN GGE completed its mission by adopting a consensus final report to be subsequently endorsed by the UNGA. China is among the 25 countries from which UN GGE experts were appointed. The final report explicitly notes the applicability of international humanitarian law “only in situations of armed conflict” and recalls “the established international legal principles including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction” noted in the 2015 report. In the same paragraph, what comes alongside the reference to LOAC is the UN GGE’s recognition of “the need for further study on how and when these principles apply to the use of ICTs by States” and emphasis that “these principles by no means legitimizes or encourages conflict”.76 Simultaneously, the report provides that in their use of ICTs, States must not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State and shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN.77 The text of the final UN GGE report seems to have adopted the prudent approach of the OEWG. It also demonstrates that China has\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\naccepted the applicability of LOAC to cyberspace during an armed conflict while leaving controversial issues of how specific LOAC rules apply to the use of ICTs for further discussions, such as whether cyber-only exchanges can trigger an armed conflict, the scope of cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, the targetability of certain objects in the ICT context, etc.\n## II.C. Possible explanations for China’s opposition\n28. China’s stance on the applicability of LOAC to cyberspace is still evolving with the dynamic international environment, partly explaining why Beijing has refrained from specifying rationales for its resistance to some LOAC rules and how they govern ICT-related activities. Although limited in number, several statements made by Chinese officials on international occasions shed light on this question.\n29. At the 2013 Seoul Conference on Cyberspace, HUANG Huikang, then Legal Adviser of the MOFA, underlined the overemphasis on “making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defence, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized” and “the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace”.78 At the 6th US-China Internet Industry Forum, the Chinese delegation further pointed to the numerous “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” regarding methods and means of cyber warfare, arguing for the incompetence of existing norms to address new sophisticated problems stemming from ICT development.79\n30. At the 7th US-China Internet Industry Forum in 2015, MA Xinmin, then Deputy Director-General of the Department of Treaty and Law of the MOFA, acknowledged that in principle, existing international law, including “the purposes and principles of the [UN] Charter, such as *jus ad bellum* rule of non-use of force except in self-defence or under UN Security Council’s (SC) authorization [...] and international humanitarian law among others shall be directly applicable to cyberspace.”80 However, he emphasized that applying existing LOAC rules to cyber warfare should be conducted “with great caution”, because of the lack of State practice on cyber warfare\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 275\nand the peculiarities of cyberspace, including many legal and technical issues, e.g., identification, tracing and establishment of State responsibility, that are yet to be solved for the application of LOAC to cyberspace. MA also warned of the threats of “aggravating cyberspace militarization and arms race” and the corresponding “pushing for the application of laws of war in that scenario”. He argued that the viewpoints of some States and scholars reflected in the Tallinn Manual illustrate the “military paradigm” of “response to cyberattacks that disregards the principle of non-use of force in international law but over-emphasizes such exceptions as the right to self-defence”, which “clearly does not conform to the international reality and actual needs”.\n31. In a subsequent paper, MA elaborated that the prevailing challenges States need to address are threats to cybersecurity in times of peace, most of which either are launched by non-State actors and fall under the scope of domestic law, or do not qualify as “use of force” or “armed attacks” governed by international law that apply in times of war but constitute international wrongful acts regulated by the law on State responsibility. In the latter situations, the victim State should first resort to peaceful means such as legal countermeasures or UNSC sanctions, rather than use of force. Accordingly, MA called for both further scrutiny of the applicability of existing rules of the jus ad bellum or the jus in bello to cyberspace and international lawmaking designated for the issues not addressed by these two regimes.\n32. Quasi-authoritative Chinese sources similarly argue that some Western countries attempt to militarize the Internet through insisting on applying existing rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace. The Liberation Army Daily straightforwardly criticizes the US for utilizing the Tallinn Manual project to “find legal basis for its cyber warfare policies and military customs”, to maintain the dominant control of the West in cyberspace.\n Ibid., para.24.\n Ibid., paras.20, 23.\n MA, above n.47.\n See, e.g., Zhong Sheng, The United States Bears Primary Responsibility for Halting Cyber War, People’s Daily (7 February 2013) (http://cpc.people.com.cn/pinglun/n/2013/0207/c78779-20456593.html).\n LI Ying, The NATO to Find Legal Basis for Manipulation of Cyberspace, Liberation Army Daily (24 October 2014) (www.chinanews.com/mil/2014/10-24/6712323.shtml).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n33. China's concern over the significant power disparity in Internet technology and cyber infrastructure between it and developed countries partly explains its long-term resistance to applying existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyber warfare prior to the adoption of the final UN GGE report. For example, the following description frequently appeared on Chinese mainstream media: \"The global Internet is built upon 13 [Internet Protocol version (IPv) 4] root servers, 10 of which, including the only key root server, are located in the US. Theoretically, this gives the US the ultimate power to destroy the entire Internet infrastructure of any country.\" The deprivation of Iraq's top domain by ICANN during the Iraq war is another frequently cited supporting example. To tackle the issue, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently approved establishing a DNS root server and a corresponding operating organization by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, along with a plan to upgrade the network infrastructure for the IPv6-based network and encourage large-scale adoption of the IPv6 network.\n34. The mainstream view of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual produced under the auspices of NATO is that: By its essence, the Tallinn Manual is not a re-statement or clarification of existing international law but involves the making of new rules on cyber warfare that reflects the distinctive practice and vested interests of the NATO members. Chinese scholars also highlighted the geographical limitation in the member selection of the Tallinn\n See, e.g., LI Yi, Chinese Internet, Please Keep the “Root”, Beijing Daily (24 January 2014) (http://news.sina.com.cn/pl/2014-01-22/015929310615.shtml).\n LIANG, above n.30.\n Xinhua, China Greenlights Establishment of Root Server, China.org.cn (8 December 2019) (http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/201912/08/content_WS5dec361ec6d0bcf8c4c1882d.html); Xinhua, China Steps up Deploying IPv6-based Network, China.org.cn (3 May 2019) (www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/03/c_138031821.htm).\n See, e.g., DING Libai &amp; ZHU Jing, Tallinn Manual Defines and Reflects on Cyber Attack “Force”, 36 Hebei Faxue [Hebei L Sci] (2018), 84; HUANG Zhixiong, Application of International Law in Cyberspace: Establishing Rules of the Game, 38 Huanqiu Falv Pinglun [Global LR] (2016), 13; HUANG Zhixiong, International Legal Issues concerning “Cyber Warfare” and Strategies for China: Focusing on the Field of Jus ad Bellum, 37 Xiandai Faxue [Modern L Sci] (2015), 154; CHEN Qi, Cybersecurity, Cyber War and International Law: From the Perspective of Tallinn Manual, 7 Zhengzhi yu Falv [P Sci L] (2014), 153-56; XU Yijie, Watch Out for the “Tallinn Manual” Used by the NATO to Make “Rules of Cyber War”, 10 Zhongguo Dangzheng Ganbu Luntan [Chinese Cadres Tribune] (2013), 98-99.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 277\nManual independent International Group of Experts. Critiques of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual concentrate on its *jus ad bellum* part, particularly section 2, “the use of force”. Specifically, many scholars consider that the Tallinn Manual’s threshold on what cyber operations constitute the use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is too low. In their view, the majority of the selected International Group of Experts, who are supporters of Michael Schmitt’s “scale and effects” approach, artificially create some situations that have never taken place to prove that cyberattacks can result in analogous scale and effects of kinetic and non-kinetic forces. A direct transplantation of existing *jus ad bellum* to cyberspace arguably goes beyond the current practice of most States. Another major concern of Chinese scholars is that, rather than regulating the means and methods of cyber warfare, the sponsors of the Tallinn Manual intend to seek legal bases to initiate cyber or even kinetic wars. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual extensively interprets a country’s right of self-defence against non-State actors and anticipatory self-defence against an imminent threat of cyber operations. They hence argue for a higher bar than the Tallinn Manual requirements for invoking the right of self-defence within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n35. Given the unique features of cyber operations, it can be observed that China has been hesitant about applying specific LOAC rules to the cyber context. What are the “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” that prevent China from embracing LOAC and the Tallinn Manual at present? In the absence of any official policy, non-authoritative sources shed light on specific controversies focused on the principles of distinction and proportionality in cyberspace.\n See, e.g., JIANG Yamin, Cyber Great Power Needs to Pay Attention to International Cybersecurity Strategies, People.com, (19 March 2015) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2015/0319/c386965-26716864.html).\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 11.\n See, e.g., above n.89, DING &amp; ZHU, 85-86; HUANG (2016), 10-11; HUANG (2015), 150; CHEN, 154.\n See, e.g., above n.89, HUANG (2016), 8-9; HUANG (2015), 152; CHEN, 154-55.\n See, e.g., LI Bojun, Cyber War and the Applicability of the Law of Armed Conflict, 31 Faxue Pinglun [LR] (2013), 62-63; WANG Kongxiang, Legal Questions and Regulation of Civilian Participation in Cyber War, 5 Fazhi Yanjiu [Research on Rule of L] (2013), 100-09; CHEN, above n.89, 158; CAI Lihong, Challenges to the Principle of Distinction by Information Attacks and Strategies, 24 Xian Zhengzhi Xueyuan Xuebao [J Xi’an P Inst PLA] (2011), 95-96.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nFirst, the existence of an armed conflict permits the use of lethal force based solely on the status of an individual or object. Some Chinese scholars argue that cyberattacks, in light of the latest level of technology, are not controllable so as to constrain their effects within the boundaries of military objects and therefore indiscriminate in nature.95 The 2007 nation-wide denial-of-service attacks sweeping over Estonian Internet infrastructure, including the websites and systems of its Parliament, banks, ministries and media, was cited as a typical example of indiscriminate cyberattack,96 although whether there was an armed conflict and whether such activities amounted to attacks within the meaning of LOAC is disputable. Given such practical difficulties in applying the principle of “distinction” in cyberwar, some scholars suspect the application of LOAC will open a gate for illegitimate cyber and kinetic attacks leading to humanitarian disasters.97 For example, despite its title—“Duty of care during attacks on dams, dykes, and nuclear electrical generating stations”, Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, along with the US policy that categorizes enemy “war-sustaining” objects as lawful targets, is framed as a disguised affirmation of the legitimacy of attacks on critical, yet highly dangerous infrastructures.98 The Internet was originally designed in a way capable of being immediately transformed from war-supporting civil facilities to war-fighting objects, making the majority of its components dual-use objects. Overwhelming reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure would dramatically expand the scope of targetable objects under LOAC. Accordingly, recognizing the applicability of the LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks in cyberspace would be tantamount to authorizing attacks against critical dual-use infrastructures, rendering mass civilians vulnerable to the adverse impacts of not only cyberattacks but also kinetic ones.\nSecond, since the civilian aspect of dual-use cyber infrastructures is relevant only to the attack requirements for proportionality and precaution, the “proportionality” of attacks against objects highly dependent upon Internet or computer control systems is another worrying issue. One scholar quotes John\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 279\nHamre, former US Deputy Defense Secretary, who is skeptical about the feasibility of using cyber operations to achieve the designated military objectives, to demonstrate the unexpected collateral damages caused by cyberattacks. This scholar also considers the current rule of the proportionality of attacks, which factors “the incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damages to civilian objects, or a combination thereof” into assessing whether such collateral damages would be excessive in relation to “the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”, as inadequate protection of civilian interests and suggests adding “knock-on effects” into consideration.\nThird, the distinction between civilian noncombatants and civilians who directly participate in hostilities used to be not an appealing question for Chinese scholars, not only because the Chinese military does not have a tradition of employing civilian contractors, but also because China has not sent its troops to the battlefield for more than thirty years. To reduce costs and obtain technical expertise, the increasing usage of civilians to operate cyberattacks, maintain information weapons, or support cyber combat operations by States has further eroded the distinction between combatants and civilians. It is reasonable for the Chinese military, government and some State-owned-enterprise to recruit civilians for activities related to cyber warfare. Although the law that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities or who adopts a continuous combat function may be lawfully attacked is not in dispute, the targetability of a civilian who assists with cyber operations depends on the answers to two questions: which people are targetable and when they may be targeted. Some Chinese scholars argue that, due to the technical predicament of identity verification and attribution, the applicable LOAC rules fail to provide certainty and predictability for the determination of individual status.\nFourth, another issue closely related to China’s opposition to applying some LOAC rules to cyberspace, namely, what acts may constitute a resort to\n Ibid., CAI, 96, quoting from Is it Real? Is it Hype?, Interview with John Hamre, PBS Frontline (18 February 2003) (www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cyberwar/interviews/hamre.html).\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 1125 UNTS 3, Art. 57(2)(a)(iii) and 57(2)(b) [hereinafter “Additional Protocol I”].\n CAI, above n.94, 96.\n Susan Brenner, Cyber Threats: The Emerging Fault Lines of the Nation State (2009), 197.\n See, e.g., LI, above n.94, 62; WANG, above n.94, 103-09.\nChinese JIL (2021)\narmed force that triggers the application of LOAC, is hinted by the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (“SCO Agreement”). It is a separate question under the jus in bello, without prejudice to the question of “use of force” within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Annex 1 to this Agreement defines “information war” as:\nconfrontation between two or more states in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining political, economic and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to taking decisions in the interest of an opposing party[.].\nAlthough it remains unsettled whether and when an armed conflict, international or non-international, can commence based on a single cyber exchange, the SCO Agreement’s definition of war clearly expands the traditional meaning of armed conflict caused by conventional force under LOAC. Assuming that the term “war” in Annex 1 is not utilized as rhetoric, but rather as the reference of “armed conflict” within the meaning of LOAC, we may tentatively argue that the SCO members consider the existing LOAC’s scope of regulation as underinclusive because it fails to include the cyber actions that can generate political, economic, social and even psychological consequences into the realm of LOAC.\n## III. Examining China’s perspectives on specific rules of LOAC\n36. This part examines the legal or practical grounds supporting China’s views on the four mentioned issues of LOAC. In doing so, this part presents the general contour of various opinions on specific topics, encompassing State practice, positions of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and applicable Tallinn rules. Relevant treaty provisions and judgments of international judicial bodies will be referred to, if available.\n Annex 1 to the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (16 June 2009), List of Basic Terms in the Field of International Information Security (http://cn.io.gov.mo/Legis/International/record/1280.aspx) (Chinese only) and (https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf) (non-official English translation).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 281\n## III.A. Cyberattacks regulated by LOAC\n37. Common Article 2 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 defines an international armed conflict as any “declared war or any other armed conflict which may arise two or more States”, regardless of whether any of them recognizes the state of war. In *Tadić*, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found “an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State.” Undoubtedly, cyberattacks accompanying any kinetic use of force fall under the sphere of LOAC. As with cyber warfare, the pertinent question is whether a single cyber exchange in the absence of any conventional use of force can trigger an international armed conflict by itself.\n38. The notion “resort to armed force” is not defined under LOAC and is easily confused with the usage of “use of force” under the *jus ad bellum*. Nevertheless, the different objects and purposes of these two regimes entail distinct legal tests of “force”. The *jus ad bellum* specifically regulates inter-State relations and States’ lawful use of force, seeking to maintain peaceful relations among nations by setting up strict conditions for invoking forceful measures, “when States may move beyond non-forceful measures such as diplomacy, economic sanctions, and countermeasures”. By contrast, the *jus in bello* regulates the behaviour of parties to an armed conflict, and its object and purpose are to protect the military and civilian victims of war by prohibiting the harms caused by armed attacks during a conflict that are either unnecessary to effectively accomplish legitimate military objectives or excessive in relation to them. The *jus in bello* does not govern whether the use of force is legitimate under the *jus ad bellum* but imposes restrictions on methods and means of warfare.\n39. Despite the absence of a treaty definition of the notion “armed forces” under LOAC, Article 49(1) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva\n---\n Prosecutor v. Tadić, ICTY Appeals Chamber, Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction (2 October 1995), Case No. IT-94-1-A, para.70.\n Michael Schmitt, “Attack” as a Term of Art in International Law: The Cyber Operations Context, in: Christine Czosseck, Rain Ottis &amp; Katharina Ziolkowski (eds.), Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (2012), 284.\n Cordula Droege, Get off My Cloud: Cyber Warfare, International Humanitarian Law, and the Protection of Civilians, 94 IR Red Cross (2012), 545.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nConventions defines “attack” within the meaning of LOAC as “acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence”. By concentrating on the term “violence”, Article 49(1) provides a feasible way to access cyberattacks by analogy to the physical violent effects caused by kinetic attacks. The threshold concept of “attack” is selected in light of LOAC’s object and purpose, since only acts that qualify as attacks would be subject to many of its core prohibitions and restrictions. Only qualified attacks would trigger a wide range of legal protections for the civilian population and objects under LOAC. In most cases, an unqualified act beyond the realm of LOAC would fall under the domain of domestic and international human rights law. So far, there appears to be a consensus that as long as a cyber operation attributable to a State has the equivalent effects of kinetic forces, such as death, physical injury to persons, or damages to objects, it would trigger an international armed conflict. Similarly, Rule 30 of the Tallinn Manual suggests that the “armed force” criterion is fulfilled when a cyber operation is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to person or damage or destruction to objects. A majority of the independent experts participating in the Tallinn Manual project favour including “loss of functionality” in the definition of damages, although there are various shades of opinions among them.\n40. The ICRC Commentary states that the term “attack” means “combat action”, without further elaboration. A paper written by the Head of the ICRC’s Operational Law indicates that the ICRC considers the consequence-based approach as “insufficient to capture the whole range of possible effects of cyber operations and the damage that they can cause, which will not\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 283\nnecessarily resemble the physical effects of traditional weapons\". Given adequate consideration to the object and purpose of LOAC and the concerns of a gap in protection, especially the protection of civilians from the effects of war, that paper seems to endorse the \"loss of functionality\" approach adopted by the majority view of the Tallinn Manual. Based on this approach, whether a cyber operation amounts to an attack depends on whether it causes the target to lose function, even if the target is not physically damaged.\n41. States may support the dysfunction approach since cyber operations would be more frequently resorted, not to physically destroy or damage objects, which can be accomplished by using kinetic force, but rather to incapacitate or disrupt the normal functioning of a vital military or dual-use infrastructure. For instance, an electrical grid or water supply system might be shut down, and a country's banking or stock-trading system could be manipulated, both without any physical damage. As is demonstrated by the 2007 Estonian denial-of-service attacks, for certain civilian populations, the potential hardship arising from such dysfunction could be far more extensive or severe than the physical destruction of a particular building. Such effects might not be comparable to those caused by physical violence, but they are \"precisely the kind of severe consequences from which [LOAC] seeks to protect the civilian population\".\n42. According to the dysfunction approach, cyberattacks against military or dual-use infrastructure, such as paralyzing information systems, altering or deleting processes and resources, are attacks that can trigger the application of LOAC, while applying the consequence-based approach would lead to a contrary conclusion. The applicable LOAC rule maintains that cyberattacks resulting in no physical damage are lawful. The US-EU camp intends to stay with the existing rule and has codified it in the Tallinn Manual. Although international law evolves to reflect the changing values developed by the international community, most States remain silent on this issue. Whether LOAC should expand its established interpretation of attacks depends on future State practice.\n Droege, above n.107, 546.\n Ibid., 546-47.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., 549.\n Schmitt, above n.106, 291.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n43. Part of the SCO Agreement defines war as the “confrontation between two or more States in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes, and resources, critical and other structures”. Under this part of the definition, those confrontations that happen without any physical damages would not qualify as attacks and therefore be lawful under LOAC. The remaining part, namely, inter-State confrontations in cyberspace aimed at “undermining political, economic, and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to [take] decisions in the interest of an opposing party”, is unlikely to fall into the scope of attacks under LOAC either.\n44. On Article 49 of Additional Protocol I, the *Bothe, Partsch and Solf Commentary* underlines that attacks refer to “those aspects of military operations that most directly affect the safety of the civilian population and the integrity of civilian objects”. It would be difficult to assert that political, economic, social, or even psychological effects of cyber operations could be deemed most directly affecting the personal safety of civilians or the physical integrity of civilian objects. Dissemination of propaganda, espionage, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological or economic warfare does not fall under the concept of attack in LOAC.\n45. LOAC endeavours to regulate methods and means of war and the treatments of different groups. Under LOAC, a State wants to protect its civilian population and objects, and at the same time, be able to use lethal force against the belligerent party once an armed conflict commences. An overinclusive definition of “attack” will subject the civilian population to catastrophic consequences that would have been avoided by applying the present definition with a high threshold. Such consideration partly explains why most States remain silent in the face of cyberattacks.\n46. The SCO Agreement’s definition of war demonstrates the six countries’ concerns of adverse impacts by acts that do not qualify as attacks and coincides with Russia’s proposal for non-proliferation of information weapons. But, unlike biological and chemical weapons, the usage of so-called information weapons does not necessarily lead to unnecessary suffering of humans\n Michael Bothe, Karl Josef Partsch &amp; Waldemar A. Solf, New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts: Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (1982), 325.\n Ibid., 289.\n See, e.g., Gary Brown, Why Iran didn’t admit Stuxnet was an attack, 63 Joint Force Quarterly (2011), 71.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 285\nand might even reduce physical harm compared to the usage of conventional forces regarding the accomplishment of the same military objective. This feature of information weapons makes them not a proper subject matter for a total (or partial) ban. By their features and consequences, unqualified cyberattacks are more suitable to be regulated by regimes other than LOAC for the time being. As demonstrated by the final UN GGE report, leading SCO members, including China, Russia, and Kazakhstan, no longer dispute the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict, although controversies over, for example, the qualification of single cyber exchange as attacks under the meaning of LOAC, remain unsettled. Hence, the SCO members may continue to advance the broad interpretation of “attack” to build up consensus for new norms while resisting the application of the existing LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks.\n## III.B. Dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities\n47. As a “cardinal principle” of LOAC, the principle of distinction requires that a distinction be made between military and civilian persons and objects and prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. Article 52(1) of Additional Protocol I defines “civilian objects” in a negative manner as “all objects which are not military objectives”. Military objectives are those “by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage”. According to Rule 39 of the Tallinn Manual, an object cannot be civilian and military simultaneously; its status is either one or the other. Therefore, the entire dual-use object becomes a military objective from the moment it is used for military action, even if its military use is only “marginal” compared to its civilian use. Such observation represents today’s prevailing view on the qualification of dual-use objects as targetable military objectives.\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, 257, para.78.\n Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 52(1).\n Ibid., Art. 52(2).\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 39 and its Commentary, para.1.\n See Droege, above n.107, 562; Michael Schmitt, The Law of Cyber Targeting, Tallinn Paper No.7 (2015), 11.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n48. From the perspective of civilian protection, the “potentially non-lethal nature of cyberweapons” draws concerns over an “expanded target list” and an obscured assessment of the legality of an attack. In a world where a large part of civilian infrastructure and services are highly reliant on international cyber infrastructure, including the Internet, servers, routers, cables, satellites, and computers, the danger of loss of function, partial damage or complete destruction is evident. For example, approximately 98% of US government communications use civilian-owned and civilian-operated networks. Under LOAC, belligerent parties can easily target cyber infrastructure as military objectives because mere containing, storing, or transmitting a tiny percentage of military data would render the entire infrastructure a legitimate target.\n49. Several scenarios of consequences of attacks against dual-use cyber infrastructure entail humanitarian concerns for civilian protection. The past decade witnessed the increasing use of cloud computing, the users of which are usually unaware of which server their data is stored on and whether military data is stored on the same server. Cyberspace is an artificial battlefield, where, unlike natural theatres of war, such as land or airspace, travelling military data or weapons (e.g., malware, botnet, or malicious codes) can make not only itself a legitimate target but also the transmitting infrastructure a military objective. It can be a computer system, a communication network, a server or router, a major cable, a satellite, or in the worst case, the entire Internet network system.\n50. The Tallinn Manual provides that “the circumstances under which the Internet in its entirety could be attacked [are] so highly unlikely as to render the possibility purely theoretical at the present time”, and that “virtually any attack against the Internet would have to be limited to certain discrete segments thereof”. Nevertheless, it also acknowledges that “it may be impossible to know over which part of the network military transmissions, as distinct\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 287\nfrom civilian ones, will pass. In such cases, the entire network (or at least those aspects in which transmission is reasonably likely) qualifies as a military objective.”\n51. In the physical world, the irrelevance of dual-use objects’ civilian part regarding the principle of distinction is no longer in dispute. In cyberspace, the broad interpretation might lead to extreme situations where nothing civilian remains. More importantly, being a military objective will incur not only attacks in cyberspace but also fatal kinetic attacks. As a result, the fundamental rule that civilian population and objects enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations becomes an empty shell, leaving such situations only subject to protection under the principles of proportionality and precaution.\n52. Almost all States and legal commentators agree that the element of “make[s] an effective contribution to military action” in Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I includes a contribution towards “war-fighting” or “war-supporting” capabilities of the belligerent party. War-fighting objects refer to those used in combat, while war-supporting objects are what military operations rely on in some “relatively direct sense”. In the cyber context, typical war-supporting objects are factories producing hardware or software or other kinds of information weapons, all of which qualify as military objectives. Controversy on this element concentrates on the “war-sustaining” object policy of the US, which has been adopted by a few States so far. The majority of Tallinn Manual independent experts refused to include war-sustaining objects into military objectives due to the remote relationship between them and military operations.\n53. The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations of the US extends the expression of Article 52(2) to “effectively contribute to the enemy’s war-fighting or war-sustaining capability”. The term “war-sustaining” encompasses objects within “an economy or governmental financial system”\n Ibid., para.3.\n Schmitt, above n.125.\n Ibid.\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n Department of the Navy and Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, NWP 1-14M/MCWP 5-12.1/COMDTPUB P5800.7A (July 2007), para.8.2.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nrelied on by the enemy to fund participation in the conflict. For instance, the revenue from cotton export during the US Civil War enabled the Confederate States to finance and therefore sustain its war. Contemporary examples are oil industries of the terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Shams, whose funding of war relied on revenues from oil exports. The rationale behind the war-sustaining approach in the sense of traditional warfare is that the destruction of certain economic objects that are not absolutely “indispensable to civilian survival”, yet currently protected under LOAC, would shorten a conflict and therefore reduce the potential casualty toll and generate societal changes.\n54. The different effects of cyberattacks and kinetic ones might make cyberattacks against war-sustaining objects more effective in achieving the expected military goal. Using cyber operations to paralyze the infrastructure upon which a central banking system is built, or delete funds from accounts, or change account balances, or manipulate the stock market, will lead to a collapse of the enemy’s confidence. According to the applicable law, many of such cyber operations may not even qualify as attacks under LOAC. Despite the unique advantage of cyberattacks, the military advantage of cyber operations on war-sustaining objects might be indefinite and difficult to articulate. Critiques of war-sustaining objects within the sphere of traditional warfare can apply indiscriminately to cyberspace. There would be no limits to warfare, providing that substantially the entire economy of a country can be considered as war-sustaining. Consequently, a much broader scope of military objectives that include the enemy’s research and development capabilities would devastate the humanitarian values upheld by the principle of distinction.\n55. To sum up, the Chinese scholars’ view that applying some existing rules of LOAC to cyberspace would potentially “open a gate for humanitarian\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 289\ndisasters” is reasonable, given that attacks against dual-use infrastructure are currently lawful in most cases. Unless there is a breakthrough in law, attacks against major cyber infrastructure would remain subject to the legal safeguards for civilian protection embodied in the principles of proportionality and precaution. As with Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, targeting highly dangerous infrastructure, such as dams, dikes, and nuclear electrical generating stations, violates the established rule enshrined in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I, which explicitly prohibits targeting listed infrastructure even if they constitute military objectives.\n56. Some may argue that, instead of denying the existing law, a government should assume its responsibility to ensure that military data or weapons do not taint civilian facilities. Unfortunately, the present level of technology and the indiscrepable relationship between civilian and military components in global cyberspace holds little promise for such complete separation.\n57. Another alternative proposal pertinent to the Chinese scholars’ argument is to expand the list of “works and installations containing dangerous forces” in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I by analogy so that critical cyber infrastructure could not be made targetable objects. But the hurdle for adequate State support for this effort remains high. It would be difficult to convince States that the potentially nonlethal effects of attacks on cyber infrastructure could be made comparable to that of radioactive materials leak or flood.\n58. China has never embraced the “war-sustaining” approach. As demonstrated by the SCO Agreement’s definition of war, China’s perception of threats to the safety and normal functionality of its cyber infrastructure is more oriented towards cyber operations below the threshold of attacks under LOAC. In other words, a lower bar of attacks capable of triggering the application of LOAC is demanded. Meanwhile, the Chinese scholars who expressed concerns over allowing attacks against dual-use and war-sustaining objects under LOAC might want to remove these objects from LOAC’s list of legitimate military objectives. To simultaneously realize the objectives of the SCO members and the mentioned Chinese scholars would require any cyber operations falling under the SCO Agreement’s definition to only attack objects exclusively used for military purposes and dual-use objects that are neither highly dangerous nor counted as cyber infrastructure. Such handling\n Robin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann, Cyber Warfare: Applying the Principle of Distinction in an Interconnected Space, 45 Israel LR (2012), 390.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nmight significantly reduce the legitimate functioning space for cyberattacks and prevent them from doing what they are best at, namely, accomplishing military advantage precisely without causing non-reversible damages of critical civilian infrastructure and having the potential to stay non-violent and reduce collateral losses. Such consequences turn out to be contrary to the humanitarian intentions of these Chinese scholars to reduce the harms suffered by victims of war.\n## III.C. Proportionality of cyberattacks against infrastructures\n59. Given that the interconnectedness of military networks and their heavy reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure has left the principle of distinction virtually empty of contents, the principle of proportionality becomes an ultimate rule for protecting civilian persons and objects. This principle prohibits attacks “which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.145 In light of the harsh challenges imposed by the unique features of cyber warfare, the actual role that the principle of proportionality can play could not be overstated.\n60. Under LOAC, what can be considered as “excessive” incidental damage to civilian objects in comparison with the expected concrete and direct military advantage remains controversial. The principle of proportionality is “more easily stated than applied in practice”. As a matter of fact, findings of excessive incidental damage to civilian infrastructure are very few and far between as compared to the military advantage.146 Moreover, the proportionality assessment in LOAC is made ex-ante when expected collateral damage is weighed against the anticipated military damage.147 The practical difficulties in ascertaining the expected effects of cyber operations prevent commanders from precisely assessing the potential collateral damages to civilian objects. How to apply this principle in cyberspace hinges on the development of both legal interpretation and technology, the uncertainty of which may jeopardize\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 291\nthis principle’s ability to prevent significant collateral damages to civilian objects in cyber warfare.\n61. In the digital era, incidental damages to civilian objects will no longer be limited to physical ones but also the loss of functionality of civilian cyber infrastructure. Therefore, in order to accommodate the special needs of cyber warfare, several opinions calling for modifications of the assessment of “collateral damages to civilian objects” have emerged. For example, it is suggested that more weight should be given to temporary consequences regarding cyberattacks, for the temporary incapacity of critical systems would incur more severe consequences than mere inconvenience, such as in situations where loss of life may be caused by the inability of hospitals to communicate vital information. But existing LOAC fails to provide any legal basis for this. The paradoxical applicable law is described as:\nwhereas the destruction of a single civilian car would amount to legally relevant, albeit rather insignificant, ‘collateral damage’, the disconnection of thousands or millions of households, companies and public services from the Internet or other communication services, or the severance of online financial transactions for a country’s entire economy and the corresponding economic and societal effects as such would not count as relevant elements to be factored into the proportionality calculus.\n62. Similarly, some scholars propose to include “knock-on effects” of cyber-attacks in the proportionality calculations when such an effect would not have occurred “but for” the attack. “Knock-on effects” refer to those generated by the initial effects of the attack. Both the 1990-1992 Gulf War and the NATO action in the former Yugoslavia illustrate that the knock-on effects of targeting electricity grid may cause more harm to the affected civilians than the direct effect of these attacks themselves. Although existing law has not touched upon this issue, most scholars seem to agree that knock-on effects\n Oona Hathaway, et al., The Law of Cyber-Attack, 100 California LR (2012), 851.\n Geiß &amp; Lahmann, above n.144, 397.\n Michael Schmitt, Heather Harrison Dinniss &amp; Thomas C. Wingfield, Computers and War: The Legal Battlespace, Background Paper Prepared for the Informal High-Level Expert Meeting on Current Challenges to International Humanitarian Law (25-27 June 2004), 8-9 (www.hpcresearch.org/sites/default/files/publications/schmittetal.pdf).\n Ibid., 8.\n Dinniss, above n.109, 205.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nshould be part of the proportionality analysis to the extent they are “reasonably foreseeable”,[153] which resonates with the term “expected” in Additional Protocol I.\n63. Commentary to Rule 51 of the Tallinn Manual includes both direct and indirect effects of attacks in the proportionality assessment.[154] The former means “the immediate, first-order consequences, unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms”, and the latter refers to “the delayed and/or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms”. Without deliberately using the same term, the Tallinn Manual adopts the “knock-on effects” approach, factoring “any indirect effects that should be expected by those individuals planning, approving, or executing a cyberattack” into the proportionality evaluation.[155] Such indirect effects can be exemplified by accidents involving transportation systems or malware inserted into a military computer system spread to other civilian computer systems and thereafter disables them, where those risks are or should have been expected. Such indirect effects may result from blocking the Global Positioning Satellite data or disrupting the Global Positioning System.[156] Inconvenience, irritation, stress, or fear caused by cyber operations are explicitly excluded from collateral damages to civilian objects.[157]\n64. The Chinese scholars' view on the theoretical and practical difficulties in applying the present law on proportionality concurs with the mainstream view among international law commentators. The Tallinn Manual's rules and commentaries on this principle are early attempts to codify the prevailing treaty interpretation, contributing to an enhanced relief valve of attacks against critical cyber infrastructure. The Chinese scholars' critiques of Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, which permits attacks against highly dangerous infrastructure, were not made in conjunction with Rule 51, becoming an interpretation out of context. The proportionality assessment under existing law disillusions those who wish to use it to make up for the failure of rules regarding the principle of distinction in protecting civilian safety. If the applicable LOAC rules regarding the principles of distinction and proportionality remain unchanged, the principle of precaution would be the only safeguard left.\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 293\n## III.D. Targetable civilians\n65. Article 51(3) of the Additional Protocol I and Article 13(3) of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts provides that, if civilians engage in conducts amounting to “direct participation in hostilities”, their protection against direct military attacks would be suspended. In cyber warfare, “for such time” as civilians directly participate in hostilities, they not only become legitimate targets of military operations but also are bound by LOAC rules governing the conduct of hostilities. Furthermore, such civilians should not be factored into the proportionality calculation. They are not considered for the principle of precaution that aims to avoid or minimize incidental harm to civilians.\n66. Civilians may be targeted for direct participation in hostilities. Currently, given the complexity of this issue, there is no authoritative guidance on which activities qualify as direct participation. The present State practice, the jurisprudence of international judicial bodies and prevailing academic views adopt a case-by-case determination method through exemplification rather than illustration. To address when civilians may be targeted, the ICRC sponsored a five-year research project in 2003 and produced its *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law* (“Interpretive Guidance”).\n67. In this document, the ICRC proposes three “constitutive elements” of direct participation in hostilities: (1) an act that negatively impacts the enemy’s military effort, or in which harm is intended (threshold of harm); (2) a relatively direct nexus between that act and the resulting harm, or that act constituting an “integral part” of a coordinated military operation likely to cause the said harm (direct causation), and (3) linkage to the armed conflict\n---\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\n(belligerent nexus). Although these criteria were generally accepted, the Interpretive Guidance has drawn strong criticism from scholars. These scholars argued that it is both underinclusive as to improperly exclude some forms of direct participation and overinclusive as to incorrectly permit attacks against some civilians and civilian property.\n68. There is no reason to distinguish cyber operations from kinetic operations regarding how civilian conducts qualify as direct participation in hostilities, as most controversies are not cyber-specific. Critiques of the Interpretive Guidance in conventional warfare do not necessarily stand in cyberspace. According to the “threshold of harm” element, an act amounting to hostility does not have to qualify as an attack within the meaning of LOAC, which indispensably entails the infliction of death, injury, or destruction on military personnel and objects. “Essentially any consequence adversely affecting the military operations or military capacity” of an opposing party would satisfy the test. Compared to the difficulties in arming civilians with traditional weapons, the technical barrier to cyber armed civilians is almost non-existent. It is too easy for civilians to have the know-how to conduct harmful cyber activities. Therefore, in cyber warfare, “the pool of targetable individuals could be extremely large in future conflicts, far more than is the case in classic conflict.”\n69. Espionage activities, including gathering and disseminating intelligence of military tactics and operations by cyber means, or hacking into the enemy system to identify enemy vulnerabilities, would both suffice. Engaging in developing cyber defence systems, such as encryption technology, firewalls or anti-virus software, also falls under this category. However, the element of “direct causation” defines them as causing only “indirect harm” because such individual conduct “merely builds up or maintains the capacity of a party to\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 295\nharm its adversary\".170 Considering the Interpretive Guidance as sacrificing military necessity for exaggerated civilian protection, commentators suggest expanding the current interpretation of direct hostilities to capacity-building acts, namely, those espionage and development activities specific to a particular cyber operation or enemy system.171\n70. Nevertheless, the unique features of cyber warfare demand particular attention paid to certain issues in cyberspace. Commentators questioned the rationality of the ICRC's interpretation of the term \"for such time\" when a direct participant can be targeted.172 The ICRC provides that this period covers preparatory measures of a specific act of direct participation, deployment to or return from the activity concerned.173 They argued that the restrictive interpretation has dramatically narrowed the window of targetability, rendering this standard particularly impractical in cyber warfare.174 There is usually no deployment to or return from cyber operations since most of them are controlled remotely.\n71. More importantly, the duration of cyber operations can be extremely short, sometimes even too brief to identify the attacker.175 Or, in some cases, for example, a surreptitiously emplaced logic bomb, the effect of cyber operations can be long-delayed.176 A better approach is suggested to cure this deficiency:\nTo characterise an individual who engages in multiple cyber operations that are part of an on-going cyber campaign as a direct participant targetable throughout the period of activity. Once the individual definitively withdraws from participation, he or she regains their protection from attack, and not before.177\nThis approach seems more promising but might still lead to scary consequences. For civilian computer operators working in closed military facilities,\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\ntheir targetability would not expire after work but become a portable threat travelling with them and making their family members and neighbours legitimate collateral damage. As the debate continues, any resolution must grant sufficient consideration to the safety of civilians.\n72. Cyber warfare also presents peculiar questions to the controversy over which members of an organized armed group are targetable between the ICRC and the NATO members. Members of organized armed groups are the other category of civilians that are legitimate targets of military operations.^[178]^ According to the Interpretive Guidance, only those with a “continuous combat function” can be attacked.^[179]^ The NATO members and Israel favour including all members of a group formed to conduct hostilities.^[180]^ These countries criticize the requirement of “continuous combat function” as affording greater protection to members of organized groups than members of the armed forces, whereas the former enjoy no right to engage in hostilities while the latter does.^[181]^ In the human-made theatre in cyberspace, where distinguishing members of organized armed groups from civilians can be far more difficult and uncertain than on physical battlefields, the additional requirement of ensuring that a member performs “continuous combat function” seems impractical and unnecessary. After all, LOAC’s presumption of civilian status in the case of doubt has offered adequate protection for such members.^[182]^\n73. At first sight, the Chinese scholars’ view tends to see the problem as a practical one of attribution and verification rather than one of law. Nonetheless, such difficulties give rise to debates about legal issues specific to cyber warfare. To the degree that the targetability of civilians is concerned, the critiques of the Interpretive Guidance mainly stem from practical difficulties, before or at the moment of targeting, in distinguishing members of armed groups or civilians directly participating in hostilities from civilians.\n74. For capacity-building or -maintaining conduct that involves espionage or development activities by cyber means, it would be premature to argue that China is willing to waive its right to attack civilians that severely harm its military operation or capacity. But given its general defensive stance on security\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 297\nissues, China is neither likely to embrace the broader approach that covers such “indirect” conduct. If China ends up agreeing with the applicability of LOAC rules on this issue, it might favour the ICRC’s restrictive standard of “for such time” and “continuous combat function”, not only because of China’s defensive rather than offensive approach to the use of force, but also because of its humanitarian considerations to protect the lives of a large number of civilians relate—occupationally to activities that have a bearing on military operations, or personally to someone occasionally carrying out conduct of hostilities—from lethal attacks.\n75. For the purpose of civilian protection, the better approach for States turns out to be recruiting only military personnel, ideally with uniforms and other distinctive marks, for military operations by cyber means. While accessible in theory, the transformation of non-State cyber actors into national forces would be time-consuming. As a reminder, the privateers were not completely abandoned by States until the time when the maritime powers had developed strong navies, which were capable of forcing the armed merchants who refused to integrate into the navy to put down their weapons in exchange for State protection on the high seas and defeating privates and enemy fleets.^[183]^\n## IV. The objectives of China’s normative proposals\n76. Based on its limited number of available official statements and practices, China’s opposition to the applicability of some LOAC rules in cyberspace remains vague and general from a legal perspective. The SCO Agreement’s expansive version of cyber “war” indicates that China’s earlier position did not distinguish armed conflicts from other situations, although the application of LOAC hinges on such a differentiation. Apart from the catchall interpretation of cyberattacks, many Chinese scholars expressed concerns over the adequacy of the LOAC rules governing the targetability of dual-use infrastructure and certain groups of civilians and the principle of proportionality. These concerns are not groundless both in terms of law and practice. In fact, the ICRC’s views on the three issues, or even some corresponding rules of the Tallinn Manual, address their concerns well. The practice of the US and its allies that China opposes has not hardened into customary international law binding on all\n^[183]^ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering: A Historical Analogy, Cyber Studies Programme Working Paper No. 1 (March 2015), 3-6, 9 (www.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/cybersecurity-and-the-age-of-privateering-a-historical-analogy.html).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nStates that fail to maintain persistent objection to it. These facts have contributed to China's incremental acceptance of the general applicability of LOAC to the cyber context despite many remaining controversies over how specific LOAC rules should be interpreted and applied to cyber operations.\n77. As with China's concerns over the Tallinn Manual's overemphasis on the military paradigm of responses to cyberattacks in international legal discourse, which threatens to derogate from the principle of non-use of force and to abuse the right to self-defence, a more diverse group of experts was composed to draft the second version of the Tallinn Manual, to address the criticisms of the limited diversity of the group of experts participating in drafting the first version of the Tallinn Manual[184] and this group's overreliance on Western legal sources.[185] There were three non-Western experts from China, Belarus and Thailand, among the nine experts who participated in the formulation process of Tallinn Manual 2.0.[186] The scope of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 expands from \"above the threshold\" cyber operations whose \"scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force\"[187] or which are \"executed in the context of an armed conflict that [is] subject to the LOAC\"[188] to \"below the threshold\" cyber operations that take place in peacetime and fall outside the regulatory scope of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello.\n78. The threshold of use of force functions as a firewall that separates cyber operations which can trigger the exercise of the right to self-defence by a victim State from cyber operations that can entail only pacific countermeasures. As previously mentioned, a major concern of China points to the Tallinn Manual's threshold on which cyber operations constitute use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The Chinese perspective considers it as a low standard intended to accommodate some States' strategic\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 299\nneeds to expansively interpret the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter in order to justify their use of force against other States.\n79. Rule 69 and Rule 71 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were drafted by the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual and incorporated in the second version without being discussed by the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Rule 69 stipulates the “scale and effects” approach. Rule 71 provides that only “a State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence”. The International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual reached a consensus that the scale of effects of cyber operations causing physical consequences can be considered as comparable to those of kinetic operations and hence the use of force under the *jus ad bellum*. But they contested over the status of cyber operations that have no consequences in the physical world but can lead to serious consequences.\n80. Some Western scholars identified the failure of Rule 69 to include cyber operations having no physical consequences but can cause temporary suspension of operational functionality, result in alteration and destruction of data or code, or involve “psychological operation” and “cyber espionage”, as a major shortcoming of the Tallinn Rules. Accordingly, they considered the definition of “use of force” adopted by the Tallinn Rules\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\nas “narrow”, blaming the experts for their overreliance on “a consequence-based gravity test in the jus ad bellum”. In addition to the perceived narrow prohibition against the use of cyber force, they considered the Tallinn Rules’ construction of the right to self-defence as even narrower, given the significant difficulties in establishing causal links between multiple consequences and a cyber operation added to the difficulties of attributing a cyber operation to a State or a non-State actor. Although the notion of anticipatory self-defence, which has long been a concern of China and an old controversy in the international law circle with a new incarnation, was adopted in the Tallinn Rules, the practical difficulties in detecting the preparations for launching a cyberattack and further determining whether a cyberattack is imminent render the requirements for resorting to using force on the ground of anticipatory self-defence highly demanding.\n81. Consequently, the victim State’s response in most cases would be limited to measures falling below the threshold of use of force, such as countermeasures or referring the matter to the UNSC. By far, the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Rules have identified only the Stuxnet attack as meeting the Tallinn threshold of use of force; some experts considered it as meeting the higher “scale and effects” threshold of an armed attack that can trigger the application of LOAC. Even American military lawyers and scholars, who are deemed by their Chinese counterparts as seeking to militarize cyberspace through lowering the threshold of use of force, have admitted that, “the prevailing view is that most, if not all, documented cyber actions taken by States to date have fallen below the ‘use of force’ threshold.” Apart from the narrowly construed right to self-defence in situations of armed conflicts, Rule 20 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides a broader right of States to take countermeasures in time of peace, “whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 301\nobligation that is owned by another State”. Nevertheless, the exercise of this right by States is subject to similar difficulties in attribution, in addition to a set of conditions, including notification, proportionality, and the exclusion of measures amounting to uses of force.\n82. The narrow construction of the right to self-defence and countermeasures under the Tallinn Rules demonstrates the reluctance of the International Group of Experts to permissibly authorize a State to undertake unilateral acts that would result in effects in the territory of another State, in another word, a strong pro-sovereignty inclination of the Tallinn Rules. In contrast, the US and the UK argued that sovereignty did not by itself constitute a specific rule of international law that cyber operations might violate, but rather a foundational principle of international law that undergirds specific rules of international law, such as the prohibition against the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the rule of non-intervention under customary international law. In these two countries’ view, such a principle has no binding effect, and low-scale cyber operations deployed by a State that generate effects in another State’s territory but do not breach any of these specific rules, do not violate international law merely because of their incompatibility with the abstract principle of sovereignty. This controversy over the status of sovereignty remains unsettled in the final UN GGE report mainly due to the UK’s active participation in the UN GGE. Yet NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations released in 2020 has endorsed the status of sovereignty as a rule of international law in a footnote, with the UK as the only NATO member having reserved on that footnote.\n83. Therefore, although the Tallinn Rules were developed under the auspices of NATO, they represent neither the exceptional perspectives of some States such as the US or the UK nor the collective views of the NATO members. Throughout the Hague Process, during the drafting of the Tallinn Rules, where legal advisors from 50 States were given the opportunity to\n\nChinese JIL (2021)\nexpress their legal positions to shape the codification process, many States maintained a persistent policy of silence and ambiguity on the specificities of existing or emerging norms regulating cyberspace. Meanwhile, the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, together with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, convened two consultative meetings in April 2015 and February 2016 with representatives from more than one hundred States, including China.\n84. The technological difficulties in credibly attributing responsibility for cyber operations, the ongoing controversies over which existing rules apply to cyberspace, their contents, the suitability of the prevailing international legal framework as the primary method to regulate inter-State behaviour in cyberspace, and political and strategic considerations that have prevented States from making public attributions and invoking their rights to take responsive measures, all have contributed to the “wait and see” approach adopted by most States towards utilizing rules and norms of international law, including the Tallinn Rules, to regulate cyber operations. These factors cast doubt over the ripeness of codifying applicable international law in these areas. The limited State practice and opinio juris partly explain China’s “wait and see” stance, which is in line with the mainstream approach in order to preserve a degree of operational flexibility in the face of technological development and the dynamic international environment.\n85. To summarize, China’s long-term insistence on the non-applicability of the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules to cyberspace does not only conform to the development trend of international normative discourses but also contributes to fuelling this momentum. Sovereign control of cyberspace has been increasingly reviving, and the focus of international legal discourse has shifted from the military paradigm concentrated on the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to the prism of general rules of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. The current landscape of international law identification and development reflects and underpins most concerns of China\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 303\nand many other like-minded States, while the Tallinn Rules serve as one of the early efforts rather than the concluding remark of ongoing international legal discourses.\n86. However, there are two residual concerns of China not reflected in the mainstream State practice following the publication of the two versions of the Tallinn Manual. They are underscored by the elements of cyber sovereignty proposed by China that call for the prohibition of using ICT, information and communications networks to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression or arms race, and the OEWG resolution's reiteration of the need for introducing additional rules of behaviour regarding States' right to combat interference in their internal affairs through the dissemination of false and distorted news and States' duty to abstain from engaging in such activities. One is external threats posed by more powerful States which may utilize their digital advantages to threaten China's national security and social stability, and the other is external limitations, either from emerging norms of international law or other established powers, of China's exercise of regulatory power over content transmitted in cyberspace to combat such threats.\n87. Therefore, in addition to the mentioned concerns addressed by the mainstream State practice, China has employed its generalized and vague resistance to the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace as bargaining leverage to achieve another two objectives in international legal discourse: (1) to build up consensus for a new treaty regulating all use of cyber forces, or a disarmament treaty banning all or at least some types of information weapons, and (2) to block the formation of new law that would limit its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace and prevent disfavoured existing law from binding on its exercise of sovereign power in cyberspace.\n## IV.A. A disarmament treaty &amp; national security\n88. The first objective of China's opposition to an explicit affirmation of the right to self-defence and the applicability of some LOAC rules to the cyber context, namely, to build up consensus for a disarmament treaty on the use of information weapons under the auspice of the UN, emanates from the nature of States' right to self-defence. It is an inherent right reserved for States to\nChinese JIL (2021)\nresort to force by its own decision after the enshrinement of a general prohibition of uses of force in the UN Charter.\n89. As evidenced by the controversies over anticipatory self-defence in the drafting processes of the Tallinn Rules, diverse concepts and practices regarding the preconditions for the commencement of self-defence and the limitations to the exercise of this right have been invoked and contested by States. Whether Article 51 of the UN Charter allows anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defence before an armed attack occurs has long been a major point of contention. The US, the UK, Israel and some other States have construed Article 51 in a permissible manner by referring to the Caroline doctrine under customary international law, based on which they have often resorted to force. The UNSC has condemned some of such practices; the International Court of Justice took the restrictive view in the judgments of the Corfu Channel case, the Nicaragua case, and other decisions afterwards. The restrictive approach limits States' right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter to situations where an armed attack has already taken place, excluding anticipatory self-defence. From the perspective of the degree of compliance, the effectiveness of the general prohibition of use of force is questionable. But none of these States supporting permissive interpretations dares to bluntly admit the existence of a violation or defy this universally accepted rule, although they always use various factual and legal arguments to justify their breaches.\n90. In the same vein, it is not practically feasible to ensure effective observance of a norm prohibiting use of force in cyberspace, especially by these States that are frequent invokers of anticipatory self-defence. Therefore, what China and other SCO members seek is rather to influence the norm-formulation process at the UN that reflects how the international community of States characterizes a situation or act in question, e.g., as a violation of the proposed norm, and whether most States have a willingness to suppress such dubious acts. In the interim, China has not come up with a clear and concrete stance on how to develop a standard resembling Article 2(4) and Article 51 of the UN Charter in judging the legality and legitimacy of State behaviour concerning use of cyber force. More importantly, concluding new treaties for\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 305\nwarfare or a disarmament treaty would be more challenging than adapting existing law through interpretation.\n91. Cyber disarmament is more unrealistic in today's international political environment than the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in light of the recent backlashes against the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons provoked by the Iran and North Korea nuclear crises. All nuclear-weapon States except China, which abstained, voted against a UNGA resolution proposing to convene the first UN conference aimed at achieving a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons. On 22 January 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first multilateral agreement that bans nuclear weapons, entered into force. Although 85 States have signed and 50 of them have ratified this treaty, the non-participation of all nine States possessing nuclear weapons renders the efficacy of the treaty questionable. Additionally, as manifested by Cuba's objection to an endorsement of the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, the States that do not enjoy conventional military superiority over their adversaries may have asymmetric advantages in cyberspace, which they are reluctant to give up. Therefore, a cyber disarmament treaty would lack the support of both major cyber powers and the rest of the weaker cyber-armed States.\n92. In the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures in 2013 and the WikiLeaks disclosures lasting from mid-2016 to date, a rising trend of nationalism has taken place in many countries that used to stand in line with the US-EU camp, such as Brazil and Germany, pushing these countries to start thinking how to defend their \"data sovereignty\". The rise of cybersecurity nationalism has undermined international norm-making efforts, including trade negotiations between the EU and the US and the US attempts to promote norms of Internet freedom globally. There is no reason that cybersecurity discourse would stay intact.\n Tariq Rauf, 2017: The Year in Which Nuclear Weapons Could be Banned?, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Commentary (20 March 2017) (www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2017/2017-year-which-nuclear-weapons-could-be-banned).\n See generally, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (22 January 2021) (www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-on-the-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons/).\n Arun M. Sukumar, The UN GGE Failed: Is International Law in Cyberspace Doomed as Well?, Lawfare (4 July 2017) (www.lawfareblog.com/un-gge-failed-international-law-cyberspace-doomed-well).\n Mueller, above n.25, 555.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n93. Given the unique features of cyber operations and the Internet, even a treaty in the style of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons would have little practical significance in deterring the abuse and misuse of force in cyberspace. The refrainment of most States, including the US, in most cyber tensions with other States, from resorting to the prevailing international legal framework in dealing with inter-State cyber relations, highlights the limitations of normative approaches in functioning as a general taboo for irresponsible activities in cyberspace by not only State but also private actors.\n94. Compared to conventional and nuclear weapons, the technical barriers to entry in cyber warfare are so low that non-State actors and countries that are conceivably weak by the standards of hard powers can play a significant role on par with powerful countries at low levels of cost. Cyberattacks can be conducted by any actor having an electronic device and connected to the Internet. The interconnectivity of the network enables any actor to stay geographically remote from where they commit cyberattacks. Simultaneously, unlike classic military operations that rely upon territorial linkages, this interconnectivity severely decreases the degree of State control over actors and activities. The life of a treaty, particularly a disarmament treaty, rests in its enforcement. The construction of a credible monitoring and enforcement mechanism would prove to be the utmost hurdle for a cyber disarmament treaty.\n95. Probably having realized the lack of feasibility and political will among States to negotiate a cyber disarmament treaty, China has softened, to some degree, its stance against the alleged militarization of cyberspace. In the most up-to-date white paper on China's military strategy issued in 2015, China plans to \"expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defence [...] so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability\".[221] The ISCC further confirms that \"enhanced defence capability in cyberspace is an important part of China's endeavour to modernize its national defence and armed forces\",[222] while restricting China's development of a cyber force to defensive capability.[223]\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 307\n## IV.B. Sovereign control over the Internet vs non-intervention\n96. The changes in the global context of disarmament and China's position regarding use of force in the cyber context have rendered the proposed second objective of China more salient. The central bone of contention in the normative competitions between the SCO members and the Western powers rests upon whether information and data transmitted in cyberspace shall be made subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State, although both sides have reached a consensus on the applicability of sovereignty as part of international law in cyberspace. At the core of this debate is how to draw the lines between the realms of domestic law and international law as consensual erosion of State sovereignty to be applied equally to all States.\n97. The US holds the view that, although sovereignty gives a State the right to control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory, the exercise of such jurisdiction by the territorial State, encompassing the use and access to the Internet, must comply with that State's obligations under applicable international law, particularly international human rights law. While noting that the freedom of expression may be restricted in situations such as the incitement of imminent terrorist violence, the US considers \"certain censorship and content control, including blocking websites simply because they contain content that criticizes a leader, a government policy, or an ideology, or because the content espouses particular religious beliefs\" as constituting State violations of international human rights law.\n98. China likely views this reference to international human rights law as a pretext for Western attempts to conceptually undermine the scope of sovereign powers by narrowing the content of *domaine réservé* in the context of Internet governance. China claims for cyber sovereignty that includes not only cyber infrastructure within its territory but also its jurisdiction over data and the regulation and monitoring of the content of information flowing over cyberspace. Consciously aware that the scope of a State's internal matters and the international legal limitations to that State's exercise of sovereign power over internal matters evolve over time, China has consistently resisted non-reciprocal and non-voluntary restrictions on its exercise of sovereignty.\n Egan, above n.45, 15-17.\n See, e.g., National Security Law of the People's Republic of China (2015), art. 25; XI Jinping, Keynote Speech at the opening ceremony of the 2nd World Internet Conference (16 December 2015) (www.wuzhenwic.org/2015-12/16/c_47521.htm).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n99. From Beijing's perspective, the nature of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as a product formulated under the domination of Western powers was not changed solely by the increased diversity in the composition of the International Group of Experts participating in the drafting process, because the newly-added matters reflect foremostly Western perspectives and concerns. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 does not touch upon the sovereignty of a State over potential data; it only mentions sovereign power over any cyber infrastructure located within States' territory and activities associated with that cyber infrastructure. Similar problems exist in the Tallinn Rules concerning jurisdiction, which overwhelmingly emphasize the limitations imposed by international human rights law to the exercise of sovereignty in cyberspace.\n100. In the domestic sphere, China invokes cyber sovereignty to underpin its regulation over data and information in cyberspace. As shown in the SCO Agreement's wording of \"mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to take decisions to the interest of an opposing party\", China is always wary of potential foreign interference. The propaganda and liaison roles played by online social networking servers, such as Facebook and Twitter, in the \"Arab Spring\" that led to social unrest, political turmoil and regime-changes in Northern African and Western Asian countries, and the exposure of the massive surveillance by the US National Security Agency in the PRISM program have strengthened the Chinese conviction of the need for Internet censorship to block and filter information in cyberspace that is harmful to China's social stability and national security. In the trend of the global revival of cyber sovereignty, China strengthens its sovereignty-based regulatory power by referring to similar censorship practices of other States, such as the US, Australia, Italy, Germany, France, the UK, and Korea that once held opposing views, regarding the information about terrorism, incitement to hate crimes, pornography, violence and other crimes involving the usage of the Internet.\n101. In the international sphere, China has employed cyber sovereignty as a shield against some Western States' attempts to compel it to change the\n HUANG, above n.212.\n HUANG Zhixiong, Regulation of Cyber Information: A Component Implicitly Covered by Cyber Sovereignty, 3 Guojia Zhili [Nat'l Governance Wkly] (2016), 33-34.\n Xinlian, From the US to Australia: How States Regulate the Internet, China Daily (17 May 2016) (http://world.chinadaily.com.cn/2016-05/17/content_25321844.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 309\ncurrent model of Internet governance by either resorting to non-legal advocacy for Internet freedom or invoking relevant international law, especially the rules of international human rights law on the right to freedom of expression, association, and the media, and the right to access to information. Google's withdrawal from the Chinese market in 2010 was a representative example of the former means where a leading multinational company threatened the Chinese government for a policy change under the instructions of some Western countries. Additionally, the Chinese government has been alarmed by soft law norms applicable in peacetime that are proposed by some Western countries, such as relevant code of conduct on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace at the 2016-2017 UN GGE meetings. Such non-binding norms are intended to circumvent the advocacy of Russia and China to formulate new rules to regulate State behaviour regarding cybersecurity in the form of a treaty at the forum of the UN and may gradually harden into binding law.\n102. This argument likely explains why Cuba, Russia and China refused to explicitly affirm the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law in the cyber context in the 2017 UN GGE report, while having accepted the general applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace since the publication of the 2015 UN GGE consensus report. The crucial factor that prevented these States from reaching a consensus with the Western countries was the opposing camp's intention to introduce \"clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States' use of ICTs\" in the UN GGE report, which threatened to restrict States' right to regulate the content of and access to information. The UN GGE report is a non-binding statement, but it may serve as proof of State practice and *opinio juris* in ascertaining whether certain international law applies to a participating State signing onto the consensus report and the extent to which the included law limits the endorsing State's right to regulate domestic affairs. Although these countries have recognized the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict upon the adoption of the final UN GGE report, residual disagreements over how specific LOAC rules apply to ICT-related activities remain prominent between them and the Western countries.\n HUANG, above n.227, 34.\n HUANG Zhixiong, Norms of Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace: Origin, Impact and Response, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 68-69.\n Korzak, above n.70.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n103. The law governing the right to self-defence and means and methods of warfare is dominated by the practice of remarkably few established powers because the major ground of resorting to anticipatory self-defence and a large portion of LOAC is customary international law, which has been developed by these “specially affected” States to advance their interests. For newly rising powers such as China, failing to meet the requirements of “persistent objector” before and after the birth of a rule at concern would not relieve their obligation to comply. A successful example where a contrary practice of a large number of weaker States makes a few powerful States switch from an established rule of customary international law to an emerging new rule is rare. It is extremely difficult for a militarily disadvantaged State that lacks field experience to replicate such a strategy in areas involving force.\n104. To prevent coercive erosions of its sovereignty, China’s strategy is to embed a firewall at the most representative and democratic lawmaking forum to obstruct the convenient transplantation of power disparity from the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to the special regimes of international law that constitute cornerstones of an evolving global system of Internet governance. A treaty negotiated at a more egalitarian forum such as the UNGA would enable the Chinese perspectives to carry greater weight in forming international law among a large number of similarly disadvantaged countries. And lawmaking in the form of treaty allows a less advanced State such as China to pick and choose elastically from treaties and their provisions according to its goals.\nV. Conclusion\n105. To summarize, the above analyses suggest that behind China’s general and vague opposition to an explicit affirmation of the applicability of specific LOAC rules to cyberspace and the right of self-defence in cyberspace is China’s profound concern that doing so would acquiesce to the encroachment of its sovereignty and unlock Pandora’s box of coercive external interferences with its independence in determining the mode of domestic Internet governance and the path of development.\n106. Has China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and digital economy driven it to pursue a more proactive and enterprising approach to reshaping international law governing the domain of cyber\n Alan Boyle &amp; Christine Chinkin, The Making of International Law (2007), 28-29.\n Ibid., 29.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 311\nwarfare so as to build up a competitive advantage against the established powers? At first glance, Beijing's long-term resistance to confirming the applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace before the adoption of the final UN GGE report, amid the exaggerated normative rivalry between the Russia-China Camp and the US-EU Camp, appeared to corroborate this argument. However, closer scrutiny reveals that, the conceptual generalization and ambiguity in China's resisting stance stems from the same premises underpinning the mainstream \"wait and see\" approach of most States towards utilizing international law as the primary means to regulate or justify their cyberoperations. Following the \"wait and see\" trend of State practice, China has agreed to the general applicability of the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello*, and law on State responsibility for international wrongful acts, but still resists the applicability of some specific rules in cyberspace, e.g., the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules, to allow for flexibility in responding to cyber technology development in attribution and the evolvement of international law.\n107. Despite the recent developments in its cyber defensive capacity, China remains disadvantaged as a rising power with weaker military capacity and less normative influence. China's normative proposals, exemplified by the ICCIS, serves more as bargaining leverage to protect itself from being bound by the existing or emerging law supported by the established powers, but unfavourable to itself, and also to move the focus of international legal discourse from the paradigm of military responses to cyberattacks concentrated in the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to that of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. China's normative efforts are largely defensive, given that Beijing chooses to prioritize its interests in defending against possible use of force either triggered by an alleged cyberattack or carried out in the means of cyber operations, over its offensive interests in staying less constrained in the use of cyber force.\n108. Because of the special features of how existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* were made, the normative influence of China and its SCO allies is not sufficient, at this moment, to change the practice of the frequent users of force, to come up with a norm promising effective observance by these States, or to veto the formation of new law proposed by these States at concern. The return of sovereign control in cyberspace and the focus shift of international legal discourse result from a set of factors, e.g., the limitations of current technologies and existing law, with the normative efforts of the SCO members having contributed to this global trend.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n109. But these countries can still resist the imposition of non-consensual norms upon themselves in the domain of cyberspace, obstruct the codification of disfavoured norms, and influence how other States characterize and respond to a situation involving cyber operations. This is why the seemingly unfeasible idea of an international cyber disarmament treaty concluded under the framework of the UN remains on the table. The UNSC's monopoly of authorizing the use of force and the UNGA's feature as one of the most egalitarian forums for international lawmaking make the UN the favourable forum relied on by rising powers such as China to build resilience against other lawmaking processes where established powers play a greater role, e.g., the development of customary international law or soft law in less representative forums."

This article argues that China’s resistance to applying some rules of the *jus in bello* to cyberspace is in line with the “wait and see” approach of most States. But there are two distinctive objectives behind this generalized stance: one is to protect its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace from being bound by disfavoured emerging and existing law, and the other is to build up consensus for a treaty regulating uses of cyber force under the United Nations framework.\n## I. Introduction\n1. International law is a generator and a product of the changing global order.

To what extent and how the rise of a new great power will influence international law largely hinges upon the interaction between the rising power and the established powers that have dominated international legal discourse for centuries. The perspectives of China and the established powers differ substantially on many issues, especially those relating to sovereign equality, non-intervention and national security. This can be exemplified by China's perspectives on many issues of cyber warfare in the normative rivalry between the United States (US)-European Union (EU) Camp and the Russia-China Camp, which are competing to influence the making of international law, as well as other countries' domestic policies.²\n2. Through the International Code of Conduct for Information Security (ICCIS) first submitted to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2011³ and joint efforts in other forums such as the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT),⁴ the Russia-China Camp has advanced a sovereignty-based model of Internet governance, which respects cyberspace sovereignty and State independence and legitimizes domestic efforts\nReinterpreting the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and Military Intervention for Humanitarian Purposes, 6 Asian JIL (2016), 114.\n2 See, e.g., Kristen E.

No. A/66/359 (14 September 2011) [hereinafter “ICCIS”].\n4 At the WCIT in December 2012, Russia took the lead to float an enhanced sovereign governance model under the International Telecommunications Regulations and challenged the present management of the domain name system by the Internet Cooperation for Assigned Names and Numbers. The Russian proposal was adopted as a separate resolution attached to the revised treaty text. See Russian Federation, Proposals for the Work of the Conference, Revision 1 to Document 27-E, Proposed Art. 3A.2 (17 November 2012) (www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000188224.pdf); also International Telecommunication Union, Final Acts of the WCIT (Dubai, 2012), art. 1.1(a) (www.itu.int/en/wcit-12/Documents/final-acts-wcit-12.pdf).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 259\nto regulate the content of and access to information.⁵ The US-EU Camp strives to maintain the currently dominant multi-stakeholder model governed by diverse stakeholders, including governments, technical communities, the private sector and other civil society members.⁶ It does not accept the ICCIS, especially the domestic regulation on freedom of expression and association⁷ and the move towards greater sovereign control in cyberspace.⁸\n3. Notably, China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and the digital economy, especially following the 2008 global financial crisis, did not initially bolster its assertiveness in the international lawmaking procedures that seek to identify existing law or generate new law applicable to State behaviour in cyberspace. China was a low-key participant at the early stages of the UN Group of Government Experts on the Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of Security (“UN GGE”). Its behaviour was found to be passive and frequently concurring with Russia’s stance. The Chinese representatives attending earlier UN GGE meetings were technical officers from the Ministry of Communication rather than diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign affairs (MOFA).⁹ But later, China proved to be willing to act more actively and assertively when it was singled out and its fundamental domestic interests were threatened by the disfavoured norms proposed by the established powers.\n4. In reaction to these Western normative attempts, China has transformed from a low-profile, passive team player under the Russian leadership to a proactive actor that had formed its own agenda. China’s active pattern of behaviour was prompted by a 2010 speech by Hillary Clinton, former US Secretary\n⁵ ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(a), (c), (d), (f).\n⁶ US Office of the Secretary of Defense, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2013 (May 2013), 37 (https://fas.org/man/eprint/dod-china-2013.pdf); European Parliament Resolution of 22 November 2012 on the Forthcoming WCIT-12 of the International Telecommunications Union, and the Possible Expansion of the Scope of International Telecommunication Regulations, P7_TA(2012)0451 (22 November 2012), para.5 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52012IP0451).\n⁷ US Department of State, International Cyberspace Policy Strategy (March 2016) (per Public Law 114-113, Division N, Title IV, Section 402), 16-18 (https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/255732.pdf).\n⁸ Ibid.\n⁹ As noted in: Adam Segal, Chinese Cyber Diplomacy in a New Era of Uncertainty, Aegis Paper Series No. 1703, Hoover Institution (2017), 5-6 (www.lawfareblog.com/chinese-cyber-diplomacy-new-era-uncertainty-0).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nof State, that criticized China for limiting the freedom to access the Internet and conducting online censorship. Higher-level officials from the MOFA with expertise in cyber governance started to represent China in diplomatic activities.¹⁰ The ICCIS was developed to counter-balance the diplomatic momentum generated by a series of US activities, including Clinton’s speeches on freedom in cyberspace between 2010-2012, the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the 2011 Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace. Beijing viewed these activities as attempting to militarize cyberspace and maintain the dominance of the US in cyber governance by interfering in other States’ sovereign right to regulate cyberspace.¹¹\n5. In 2011, the first edition of the ICCIS was submitted two months before the London Conference, a United Kingdom (UK)-sponsored attempt in line with those of the US and their allies. The ICCIS called on States “not to use information and communications technologies (ICTs), including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies”, called for “peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security”, and emphasized “the important role of the UN in formulating international norms”.¹² An updated edition of the ICCIS with similar wording was circulated at the UNGA in 2015,¹³ possibly intended to gather wider support in the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures that harmed the US’s credibility in its continuous diplomatic attempts.\n6. The second World Internet Conference in 2015 marked the emergence of China’s own vision of global Internet governance that advocates both respect for sovereignty in cyberspace and international cooperation to “jointly build a community of shared future in cyberspace”. Chinese President XI Jinping highlighted the problems of the current global Internet governance system, including, among other things, the inadequate existing rules governing cyberspace that hardly reflect the perspectives of the majority of countries,\n¹⁰ As noted in ibid., 6.\n¹¹ Ibid., 4-5, 7.\n¹² ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(b), (j).\n¹³ International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the Letter dated 9 January 2015 from the Permanent Representatives of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russia Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations Addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

One proposal explicitly called on all countries to work together to “contain the abuse of information technology, oppose cyber surveillance and cyberattacks and reject arms race in cyberspace” and “push for the formulation of international cyberspace rules accepted by all parties as well as an international convention against terrorism in cyberspace, improve the legal assistance mechanism to fight cybercrimes and jointly uphold peace and security in cyberspace”.¹⁴\n7. The vision of “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” was further elaborated by the Organizing Committee of the World Internet Conference in 2019. It urged countries to oppose hostile activities, acts of aggression, cyberattacks, large-scale surveillance operations, unfounded accusations of cyberattacks against other countries and attempts to politicize cybersecurity issues; prevent arms race and military conflict in cyberspace; and remain committed to resolving disputes by peaceful means.¹⁵ In 2020, the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace was released amid the COVID-19 pandemic that underpinned the urgency of “achieving shared development, ensuring common security, realizing joint governance, and enjoying benefits”. This document emphasized the need to “exert the roles of the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) and the UN GGE, and support formulating codes, norms and principles of responsible State conduct in cyberspace that are acceptable to all parties under the UN framework”.¹⁶\n8. To assess the implications of China’s rise for the evolution of international law governing the use of force by States in cyberspace, this paper studies the normative initiatives and strategies employed by China in identifying rules of existing law and creating new law applicable to cyber warfare. In light of China’s sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance, Part II introduces the general stance of China on the adequacy of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to address cyber warfare. Part III evaluates the Chinese perspectives on\n¹⁴ Remarks by H.E.

Special attention is paid to legal controversies over the rules on cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities, the proportionality of cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and the targetability of certain categories of civilians. Part IV examines the rationales behind China's generalized normative proposal and its vague refusal to confirm the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello, while having recognized the general applicability of these two regimes to cyberspace. The last part concludes with a tentative assessment of the nature and the degree of China's normative influence over international lawmaking governing State behaviour in cyberspace and the possible momentum of China's policy in the future.\n## II. China's general stance on applicable law governing cyber warfare\n## II.A. China's sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance\n9. On 1 March 2017, the MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration jointly issued the first international cyber policy paper of China—the International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (ISCC)—to comprehensively introduce and explain Beijing's policy and position on issues of cyber-related international affairs.¹⁷ At his daily press briefing following the release, the UN Secretary-General Spokesman Stéphane Dujarric described the ISCC as “a very important report” and suggested that “China has a big role to play” in global cyber governance.¹⁸ The linchpin of China’s cyber diplomacy is the idea of cyber sovereignty, around which China formulates its cybersecurity policies towards three primary objectives. The first is to protect its critical information infrastructure, cyber sovereignty, national security and domestic stability from threats posed by digital power disparity among countries, cybercrimes and cyber terrorism, and external interference with China’s internal\n¹⁷ Statement by Ambassador FU Cong in the Assembly Meeting of the UN Conference on Disarmament on International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (9 March 2017) (www.china-un.ch/eng/hom/t1444602.htm); also MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration, International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (1 March 2017) (www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zzjg_663340/jks_665232/kjlc_665236/qtwt_665250/t1442390.shtml) [hereinafter “ISCC”].\n¹⁸ Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General (2 March 2017) (www.un.org/press/en/2017/db170302.doc.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 263\naffairs. The second is to shape the current global Internet governance and promote the formation of a system of international legal norms in China's favour. The third objective is to convert China's increasing cyber capacity into soft power to mobilize and influence other countries' preferences.¹⁹ Chapter II lays out the three elements of China's proposed idea of cyber sovereignty—regulatory authority, non-interference and sovereign equality, and the security-oriented balanced approach.²⁰\n10. The appeal for cyber sovereignty by China and other like-minded countries takes place at a time when governments' sovereign power over cyberspace is in decline for many reasons, including but not limited to the privatization of cyberspace, the rise of non-State actors and the digital gap between the developed and developing countries. As evidenced by the first and second editions of the Tallinn Manual providing that \"a State may exercise control over cyber infrastructure and activity within its sovereign territory\",²¹ sovereignty in cyberspace is not a revisionist idea by itself. According to the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Manual 2.0, this premise, which was confirmed by the 2013 Report of the UN GGE,²² is now \"relatively well accepted by the international community\".²³ The US and its allies have held out to this idea in order to sustain the current platform governed by multi-stakeholders under their control.²⁴\n19 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter I: Opportunities and Challenges, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n20 Ibid., Chapter II: The Principle of Sovereignty.\n21 Michael Schmitt (general ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), Rule 1 [hereinafter \"Tallinn Manual\"]; also Michael Schmitt (general ed.) &amp; Liis Vihul (managing ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on The International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2017), Rule 1 [hereinafter \"Tallinn Manual 2.0\"].\n22 Report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

It is noteworthy that, among all the technical communities developing the \"law\" of the Internet and managing the global distribution of Internet resources in terms of naming and addresses,²⁵ the ISCC exclusively named the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and urged the international community to \"make [ICANN] a truly independent international institution, increase its representations and ensure greater openness and transparency in its decision-making and operation\".²⁶ ICANN has been a highly politicalized organization. It is a Californian corporation created by a 1998 Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Commerce to transfer the power to manage and oversee the domain name system (DNS) coordination from the US government to the global community. This agreement was supposed to terminate on 30 September 2000, while subject to further amendments.²⁷ The US government did not end its supervision until October 2016,²⁸ mainly in response to the calling of major Internet technical organizations for freeing ICANN from unilateral oversight of the US as a backlash from the Snowden Disclosures.²⁹ Yet, it is early to tell whether the globalization of ICANN can be genuinely realized, given that most of its key infrastructures remain in the US territory. The deprivation of the top domain of Iraq, \".iq\", by ICANN in the Iraq war under the undue influence of the US government,³⁰ the Snowden Disclosures, and the \"Vault 7\" documents released by WikiLeaks³¹ have demonstrated the capacity and motivation of the US to abuse its dominant position in global Internet governance under the current multi-stakeholder model.\n25 See generally Milton Mueller, Chapter 25: Communications and The Internet, in: Jacob Katz Cogan, Ian Hurd &amp; Ian Johnstone (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Organizations (2017), 539-542.\n26 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter IV: Plan of Action.\n27 Memorandum of Understanding Between The US Department of Commerce and ICANN (25 November 1998) (www.icann.org/resources/unthemed-pages/icannmou-1998-11-25-en).\n28 Dave Lee, Has the US Just Given Away the Internet?, BBC News (1 October 2016) (www.bbc.com/news/technology-37527719).\n29 Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation (10 October 2013) (www.icann.org/news/announcement-2013-10-07-en).\n30 See LIANG Yabin, Cyberspace is the New Battlefield for Game of States in the Big Data Era, Study Times (20 October 2014) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/1020/c40531-25866183.html).\n31 See, e.g., Wikileaks Exposes CIA Interference in French Presidential Elections, The European Union Times (16 February 2017) (www.eutimes.net/2017/02/wikileaks-exposes-cia-interference-in-french-presidential-elections/).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 265\n12. The label “multi-stakeholder” was only applied to ICANN in the wake of the battles over Internet governance initiated by national governments, which are treated as “stakeholders” on an equal footing with private corporates and members of civil society, during and after the World Summit on the Information Society, as political rhetoric to mobilize non-State actors to help resist governmental interference into Internet governance and to simultaneously make the established self-governance model more palatable to States and the UN system.³² ICANN is a global Internet governance organization possessing monopoly power over the DNS, but it is only subject to the sole jurisdiction of the US under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law.³³ Due to the anticipated objection of the US, to put ICANN under the oversight of the international community of sovereign States³⁴ proves difficult to attain. And an equivalent alternative to ICANN would be not only costly but also highly disruptive for Internet users.³⁵\n13. Aside from open participation, ICANN is not subject to any classic form of internal accountability that commonly exists in private corporations and nonprofit organizations, such as direct accountability mechanisms based on membership or shareholders in the Regional Internet Registries and the open, bottom-up, consensus-based standardization process of the Internet Engineering Task Force.³⁶ Although ICANN self-identifies as championing the bottom-up, consensus-driven, multi-stakeholder model of governance, its policy-making processes manifest a top-down hierarchy, in which issues raised from the grassroots level end up as policy recommendations to be voted at the Board of Directors.³⁷ The Board has “near-absolute” power over the bylaws governing the entirety of processes and can “untrammeled[ly]” decide whether to accept these recommendations in the absence of any binding forms of appeal or review. While anyone can join most of ICANN’s volunteer Working Groups to express their views and have the views considered based\n32 Mueller, above n.25, 546.\n33 Milton Mueller, ICANN, Inc.: Accountability and Participation in the Governance of Critical Internet Resources, Internet Governance Project (2009), 7 (www.internet-governance.org/wp-content/uploads/ICANNInc.pdf).\n34 See, e.g., Political Oversight of ICANN: A Briefing for the WSIS Summit, Concept Paper by the Internet Governance Project (1 November 2005) (www2.world-governance.org/IMG/pdf_political-oversight_internet_governance.pdf).\n35 Mueller, above n.33, 5.\n36 Ibid., 4-5.\n37 How Does ICANN Work?

The critical details and implementations of these contracts are negotiated bilaterally between ICANN and the registrars/registries, largely beyond the influence of general policies developed in the bottom-up representative processes.⁴⁰ To summarize, ICANN seems to employ open participation as a substitute for other missing and more effective accountability mechanisms.⁴¹\n14. In the ISCC, China advocates shifting from the present multi-stakeholder model of global Internet governance to a multilateral State-centric model. In the latter model, a wide range of actors are encouraged to make their respective contributions based on their capacity in the multilateral decision-making processes led by governments, particularly regarding public policies and security.⁴² China favours the UN as the principal forum to coordinate positions of various parties and build international consensus, while other international mechanisms and platforms are called on to complement based on their comparative advantage.⁴³ The establishment of “multilateral, democratic, and transparent international Internet government systems” is listed as a major goal in the Thirteenth Five-Year-Plan for China’s economic and social development from 2016 to 2020.⁴⁴\n## II.B. International normative discourses\n15. The fundamentally divergent approaches to global Internet governance have driven China and the US to contrasting views on the adequacy of existing international law to address cybersecurity issues. The US and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies insist that prevailing\n38 Ibid.\n39 Mueller, above n.33, 2, 15.\n40 Mueller, above n.25, 541.\n41 Mueller, above n.33, 8.\n42 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter II: The Principle of Sovereignty.\n43 Ibid., Chapter II: The Principle of Shared Governance.\n44 National People’s Congress, Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Guomin Jingji he Shehui Fazhan di Shisange Wunian Guihua Gangyao [Outline of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the People’s Republic of China (2016-2020)] (March 2016), Chapter 28: Strengthen Information Security.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 267\ninternational law, including the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello* and relevant rules concerning State responsibility for international wrongful acts apply to cyberspace, and that the existing international legal framework is adequate to accommodate novel situations in the information age.⁴⁵\n16. China’s position on the adequacy of existing international law had not crystalized until the 2013 UN GGE meeting. Since then, China has accepted, in principle, the general applicability of relevant international law to cyberspace.⁴⁶ Despite this, China has maintained that international lawmaking is demanded to address the issues that are not clearly dealt with by existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, as parallel paths to further study the applicability of these two regimes’ established rules to cyber warfare from the perspectives of “maintaining international security, strategic mutual trust and preventing cyber conflicts”.⁴⁷\n17. Although the 2017 ISCC is not written in legal language, it calls for “formulating universally accepted international rules and norms of state behaviour in cyberspace within the framework of the UN” towards the ultimate goal of a “rule-based” global governance system in cyberspace.⁴⁸ Rather than using the word “codifying”, China opted for “formulating” and emphasized the universal acceptance of rules by countries. This wording reveals China’s reluctance to recognize the applicability of some *already existing* rules of international law to cyberspace, mainly because of the under-representation of developing countries in global cyber governance. In its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the Chinese government also stated that it would “take an active role in formulating international rules in areas such as the Internet”.⁴⁹\n⁴⁵ The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World (May 2011), 9 (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf); also Brian J.

In its efforts to achieve these objectives, Beijing has been increasingly active in various multilateral lawmaking forums, particularly major UN platforms such as the UNGA, UN GGE, the UN Expert Group on Combating Cybercrime and International Telecommunication Union. For example, along with the promotion of the concepts of cyber sovereignty and “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” at the World Internet Conference, a State-run annual international forum focusing on the development, use and governance of the Internet, underlying elements of these concepts have also been advocated in China’s Position Paper at the UNGA since 2014 to maintain the momentum and build consensus. These elements include: (1) peaceful use of cyberspace for economic and social development; (2) objection to cyber war and arms race; (3) the development of an international code of conduct for cyberspace under the UN framework that is acceptable to all, such as the two versions of the ICCIS; (4) strengthened international cooperation to combat cybercrimes such as cyber terrorism; and (5) objection to any country’s attempt to overstretch the concept of national security to restrict ICT development and cooperation among other countries or to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs.⁵⁰\n19.

These comprehensive and issue-specific normative initiatives unfold the usage of issue linkage under China's overall scheme of the legal framework governing cyberspace, under which the issues of the development and use of the Internet, cyber and data security, cybercrimes, cyber governance and cyber warfare that transcend different fields of international law are simultaneously placed on the agenda of international lawmaking to keep this bundle of issues at the frontline.\n20. In light of the digital divide between the developed and developing countries and the inequitable order of the existing international legal system, China has been aligning normative efforts at regional and South-South forums such as the BRICS, Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO), the ASEAN Regional Forum, China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, Forum of China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in support of lawmaking activities at the UN.⁵³ The progress China has made in enhancing agenda-shaping and coalition-building capacities can be exemplified by the agenda item of \"International Law in Cyberspace\" proposed by China for the 53rd Annual Session of the AALCO⁵⁴ and the data security cooperation initiative signed between the Arab League and China.⁵⁵\n21.

In the context of cyber warfare, the US position is that existing LOAC, including its principles of distinction, necessity, and proportionality, applies in cyberspace.59 By contrast, China, Russia, and other SCO members have not agreed to the US stance and played a rival role. In the 2013 Report of the UN GGE, China and Russia managed to exclude any reference to the applicability of international humanitarian law principles in cyberspace, despite the controversial affirmation of the applicability of \"international law\" and the UN Charter.60 The 2015 UN GGE Report explicitly \"notes\" the possible applicability of \"the established international legal principles, including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction\", while cautiously avoiding making any reference to international humanitarian law.61 The wording of this text fails to clarify whether the UN GGE reached a consensus on the applicability of these LOAC principles to cyber activities or merely noted their existence. Moreover, although the 2015 UN GGE Report mentions the prohibition on the threat or use of force against any State's territorial integrity or political independence,62 it does not refer to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks amounting to use of force as an exception to such general prohibition. Instead, this UN GGE similarly\n57 The White House Office of the Press Secretary, Fact Sheet: President XI Jinping's State Visit to the United States (25 September 2015) (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinping-state-visit-united-states).\n58 US Department of Justice, First China-US Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue, Summary of Outcomes (9 October 2017) (www.justice.gov/opa/pr/first-us-china-law-enforcement-and-cybersecurity-dialogue).\n59 Harold Hongju Koh, International Law in Cyberspace, 54 Harvard ILJ (2012), 4-5.\n60 Above n.22, paras.19, 23.\n61 Report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Development in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the context of International Security, UN Doc.

Without an explicit official position, Beijing's stance on many occasions has been found to be general yet frequently in line with Russia's efforts to negotiate an international arms control treaty on the use and non-proliferation of information weapons.^^ For example, the 2011 ICCIS proposes \"not to use ICTs, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies\", and calls for \"peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security\".^^ In the updated ICCIS circulated at the UNGA in 2015, the controversial terms of \"proliferate information weapons\" is omitted, and the original paragraph is replaced by \"not to use ICTs and information and communications networks to carry out activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security\".^^\n24. The ISCC pronounces China's consistent opposition to certain countries' \"Cold War Mentality\" in characterizing international relations in cyberspace as a \"zero-sum game\" and abusing the predominant position in global Internet governance to secure advantages by militarization and deterrence build-up in cyberspace.^^ By calling the international community to adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, particularly non-use of force and peaceful settlement of disputes, the ISCC articulates the idea of upholding peace through international cooperation and safeguarding a country's own security that underpins \"common security\" of the international community of States \"on the basis of full respect for other countries' security\".^^ Specifically, the ISCC proposes that \"all countries must oppose ICT-backed acts of hostility and aggression, prevent arms race and conflicts in cyberspace and settle disputes through peaceful means\"; China plans to work with other countries to \"curb the abuse of information technology and prevent arms race\n^^ Ibid., para.28(c).\n^^ As noted in: John Markoff and Andrew E.

While the ISCC discourages militarization of cyberspace, China plans to enhance its “defense capability in cyberspace” and “expedite the development of a cyber force” with the aim to “prevent a major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security and maintain national security and social stability”.69\n25. At the UN GGE’s fifth session in 2017, the 25 participating States could not reach a consensus, particularly over the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. It was reported that the US sought “clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States’ use of ICTs”, including international humanitarian law, the right to self-defence, the law of State responsibility, and countermeasures. Cuba, backed by Russia and China which similarly opposed such an explicit affirmation, argued that following the manuscript of the US would militarize cyberspace and “legitimize unilateral punitive force actions” by “States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs”. Consequently, this session concluded without issuing a consensus report.70\n26. In December 2018, the First Committee of the UNGA adopted two resolutions to continue the international discussions of norms on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace by establishing two parallel working processes: one is a new GGE sponsored mainly by the US,71 and the other is the OEWG proposed by Russia that allows all interested Member States to participate in further studying the existing rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour identified by the previous UN GGE reports. The OEWG is also mandated, “if necessary, to introduce changes to them or elaborate additional rules of behaviour”.72 As mentioned previously, China endorsed both the OEWG and the UN GGE in the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community With a Shared Future in Cyberspace released in 2020. Notably, the resolution establishing the OEWG introduces a new issue, namely, “the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives,\n69 Ibid.\n70 See, e.g., Elaine Korzak, UN GGE on Cybersecurity: The End of an Era?, The Diplomat (31 July 2017) (https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/un-gge-on-cybersecurity-have-china-and-russia-just-made-cyberspace-less-safe/).\n71 UNGA, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

In May 2021, the 2019-2020 UN GGE completed its mission by adopting a consensus final report to be subsequently endorsed by the UNGA. China is among the 25 countries from which UN GGE experts were appointed. The final report explicitly notes the applicability of international humanitarian law “only in situations of armed conflict” and recalls “the established international legal principles including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction” noted in the 2015 report. In the same paragraph, what comes alongside the reference to LOAC is the UN GGE’s recognition of “the need for further study on how and when these principles apply to the use of ICTs by States” and emphasis that “these principles by no means legitimizes or encourages conflict”.76 Simultaneously, the report provides that in their use of ICTs, States must not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State and shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN.77 The text of the final UN GGE report seems to have adopted the prudent approach of the OEWG. It also demonstrates that China has\n73 Ibid., 3.\n74 UNGA, Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States, UN Doc.

Possible explanations for China’s opposition\n28. China’s stance on the applicability of LOAC to cyberspace is still evolving with the dynamic international environment, partly explaining why Beijing has refrained from specifying rationales for its resistance to some LOAC rules and how they govern ICT-related activities. Although limited in number, several statements made by Chinese officials on international occasions shed light on this question.\n29. At the 2013 Seoul Conference on Cyberspace, HUANG Huikang, then Legal Adviser of the MOFA, underlined the overemphasis on “making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defence, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized” and “the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace”.78 At the 6th US-China Internet Industry Forum, the Chinese delegation further pointed to the numerous “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” regarding methods and means of cyber warfare, arguing for the incompetence of existing norms to address new sophisticated problems stemming from ICT development.79\n30. At the 7th US-China Internet Industry Forum in 2015, MA Xinmin, then Deputy Director-General of the Department of Treaty and Law of the MOFA, acknowledged that in principle, existing international law, including “the purposes and principles of the [UN] Charter, such as *jus ad bellum* rule of non-use of force except in self-defence or under UN Security Council’s (SC) authorization [...] and international humanitarian law among others shall be directly applicable to cyberspace.”80 However, he emphasized that applying existing LOAC rules to cyber warfare should be conducted “with great caution”, because of the lack of State practice on cyber warfare\n78 MOFA, Working Together to Build a Harmonious and Progressive International Cyberspace Order, Remarks by Dr HUANG Huikang at the Seoul Conference on Cyberspace (17 October 2013), (www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cgmb/chn/wjbxw/P020131021538048406901.doc).\n79 Statement by the Chinese Delegation at the 6th US-China Internet Industrial Forum, 2013 Chinese YIL, 666-67.\n80 MA, above n.46.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 275\nand the peculiarities of cyberspace, including many legal and technical issues, e.g., identification, tracing and establishment of State responsibility, that are yet to be solved for the application of LOAC to cyberspace.⁸¹ MA also warned of the threats of “aggravating cyberspace militarization and arms race” and the corresponding “pushing for the application of laws of war in that scenario”. He argued that the viewpoints of some States and scholars reflected in the Tallinn Manual illustrate the “military paradigm” of “response to cyberattacks that disregards the principle of non-use of force in international law but over-emphasizes such exceptions as the right to self-defence”, which “clearly does not conform to the international reality and actual needs”.⁸²\n31. In a subsequent paper, MA elaborated that the prevailing challenges States need to address are threats to cybersecurity in times of peace, most of which either are launched by non-State actors and fall under the scope of domestic law, or do not qualify as “use of force” or “armed attacks” governed by international law that apply in times of war but constitute international wrongful acts regulated by the law on State responsibility. In the latter situations, the victim State should first resort to peaceful means such as legal countermeasures or UNSC sanctions, rather than use of force. Accordingly, MA called for both further scrutiny of the applicability of existing rules of the jus ad bellum or the jus in bello to cyberspace and international lawmaking designated for the issues not addressed by these two regimes.⁸³\n32. Quasi-authoritative Chinese sources similarly argue that some Western countries attempt to militarize the Internet through insisting on applying existing rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace.⁸⁴ The Liberation Army Daily straightforwardly criticizes the US for utilizing the Tallinn Manual project to “find legal basis for its cyber warfare policies and military customs”, to maintain the dominant control of the West in cyberspace.⁸⁵\n⁸¹ Ibid., para.24.\n⁸² Ibid., paras.20, 23.\n⁸³ MA, above n.47.\n⁸⁴ See, e.g., Zhong Sheng, The United States Bears Primary Responsibility for Halting Cyber War, People’s Daily (7 February 2013) (http://cpc.people.com.cn/pinglun/n/2013/0207/c78779-20456593.html).\n⁸⁵ LI Ying, The NATO to Find Legal Basis for Manipulation of Cyberspace, Liberation Army Daily (24 October 2014) (www.chinanews.com/mil/2014/10-24/6712323.shtml).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n33. China's concern over the significant power disparity in Internet technology and cyber infrastructure between it and developed countries partly explains its long-term resistance to applying existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyber warfare prior to the adoption of the final UN GGE report. For example, the following description frequently appeared on Chinese mainstream media: \"The global Internet is built upon 13 [Internet Protocol version (IPv) 4] root servers, 10 of which, including the only key root server, are located in the US. Theoretically, this gives the US the ultimate power to destroy the entire Internet infrastructure of any country.\"⁸⁶ The deprivation of Iraq's top domain by ICANN during the Iraq war is another frequently cited supporting example.⁸⁷ To tackle the issue, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently approved establishing a DNS root server and a corresponding operating organization by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, along with a plan to upgrade the network infrastructure for the IPv6-based network and encourage large-scale adoption of the IPv6 network.⁸⁸\n34. The mainstream view of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual produced under the auspices of NATO is that: By its essence, the Tallinn Manual is not a re-statement or clarification of existing international law but involves the making of new rules on cyber warfare that reflects the distinctive practice and vested interests of the NATO members.⁸⁹ Chinese scholars also highlighted the geographical limitation in the member selection of the Tallinn\n⁸⁶ See, e.g., LI Yi, Chinese Internet, Please Keep the “Root”, Beijing Daily (24 January 2014) (http://news.sina.com.cn/pl/2014-01-22/015929310615.shtml).\n⁸⁷ LIANG, above n.30.\n⁸⁸ Xinhua, China Greenlights Establishment of Root Server, China.org.cn (8 December 2019) (http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/201912/08/content_WS5dec361ec6d0bcf8c4c1882d.html); Xinhua, China Steps up Deploying IPv6-based Network, China.org.cn (3 May 2019) (www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/03/c_138031821.htm).\n⁸⁹ See, e.g., DING Libai &amp; ZHU Jing, Tallinn Manual Defines and Reflects on Cyber Attack “Force”, 36 Hebei Faxue [Hebei L Sci] (2018), 84; HUANG Zhixiong, Application of International Law in Cyberspace: Establishing Rules of the Game, 38 Huanqiu Falv Pinglun [Global LR] (2016), 13; HUANG Zhixiong, International Legal Issues concerning “Cyber Warfare” and Strategies for China: Focusing on the Field of Jus ad Bellum, 37 Xiandai Faxue [Modern L Sci] (2015), 154; CHEN Qi, Cybersecurity, Cyber War and International Law: From the Perspective of Tallinn Manual, 7 Zhengzhi yu Falv [P Sci L] (2014), 153-56; XU Yijie, Watch Out for the “Tallinn Manual” Used by the NATO to Make “Rules of Cyber War”, 10 Zhongguo Dangzheng Ganbu Luntan [Chinese Cadres Tribune] (2013), 98-99.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 277\nManual independent International Group of Experts.⁹⁰ Critiques of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual concentrate on its *jus ad bellum* part, particularly section 2, “the use of force”. Specifically, many scholars consider that the Tallinn Manual’s threshold on what cyber operations constitute the use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is too low. In their view, the majority of the selected International Group of Experts, who are supporters of Michael Schmitt’s “scale and effects” approach,⁹¹ artificially create some situations that have never taken place to prove that cyberattacks can result in analogous scale and effects of kinetic and non-kinetic forces. A direct transplantation of existing *jus ad bellum* to cyberspace arguably goes beyond the current practice of most States.⁹² Another major concern of Chinese scholars is that, rather than regulating the means and methods of cyber warfare, the sponsors of the Tallinn Manual intend to seek legal bases to initiate cyber or even kinetic wars. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual extensively interprets a country’s right of self-defence against non-State actors and anticipatory self-defence against an imminent threat of cyber operations. They hence argue for a higher bar than the Tallinn Manual requirements for invoking the right of self-defence within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter.⁹³\n35. Given the unique features of cyber operations, it can be observed that China has been hesitant about applying specific LOAC rules to the cyber context. What are the “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” that prevent China from embracing LOAC and the Tallinn Manual at present? In the absence of any official policy, non-authoritative sources shed light on specific controversies focused on the principles of distinction and proportionality in cyberspace.⁹⁴\n⁹⁰ See, e.g., JIANG Yamin, Cyber Great Power Needs to Pay Attention to International Cybersecurity Strategies, People.com, (19 March 2015) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2015/0319/c386965-26716864.html).\n⁹¹ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 11.\n⁹² See, e.g., above n.89, DING &amp; ZHU, 85-86; HUANG (2016), 10-11; HUANG (2015), 150; CHEN, 154.\n⁹³ See, e.g., above n.89, HUANG (2016), 8-9; HUANG (2015), 152; CHEN, 154-55.\n⁹⁴ See, e.g., LI Bojun, Cyber War and the Applicability of the Law of Armed Conflict, 31 Faxue Pinglun [LR] (2013), 62-63; WANG Kongxiang, Legal Questions and Regulation of Civilian Participation in Cyber War, 5 Fazhi Yanjiu [Research on Rule of L] (2013), 100-09; CHEN, above n.89, 158; CAI Lihong, Challenges to the Principle of Distinction by Information Attacks and Strategies, 24 Xian Zhengzhi Xueyuan Xuebao [J Xi’an P Inst PLA] (2011), 95-96.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nFirst, the existence of an armed conflict permits the use of lethal force based solely on the status of an individual or object. Some Chinese scholars argue that cyberattacks, in light of the latest level of technology, are not controllable so as to constrain their effects within the boundaries of military objects and therefore indiscriminate in nature.95 The 2007 nation-wide denial-of-service attacks sweeping over Estonian Internet infrastructure, including the websites and systems of its Parliament, banks, ministries and media, was cited as a typical example of indiscriminate cyberattack,96 although whether there was an armed conflict and whether such activities amounted to attacks within the meaning of LOAC is disputable. Given such practical difficulties in applying the principle of “distinction” in cyberwar, some scholars suspect the application of LOAC will open a gate for illegitimate cyber and kinetic attacks leading to humanitarian disasters.97 For example, despite its title—“Duty of care during attacks on dams, dykes, and nuclear electrical generating stations”, Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, along with the US policy that categorizes enemy “war-sustaining” objects as lawful targets, is framed as a disguised affirmation of the legitimacy of attacks on critical, yet highly dangerous infrastructures.98 The Internet was originally designed in a way capable of being immediately transformed from war-supporting civil facilities to war-fighting objects, making the majority of its components dual-use objects. Overwhelming reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure would dramatically expand the scope of targetable objects under LOAC. Accordingly, recognizing the applicability of the LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks in cyberspace would be tantamount to authorizing attacks against critical dual-use infrastructures, rendering mass civilians vulnerable to the adverse impacts of not only cyberattacks but also kinetic ones.\nSecond, since the civilian aspect of dual-use cyber infrastructures is relevant only to the attack requirements for proportionality and precaution, the “proportionality” of attacks against objects highly dependent upon Internet or computer control systems is another worrying issue. One scholar quotes John\n95 Ibid., WANG, 107; LIANG, above n.30.\n96 Scheherazade Rehman, Estonia’s Lessons in Cyberwarfare, US News (14 January 2013) (www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/01/14/estonia-shows-how-to-build-a-defense-against-cyberwarfare).\n97 CAI, above n.94; CUI Wenbo, The Influence on Chinese Cyber Security Interest of Tallinn Manual, 15 Jiangnan Shehui Xueyuan Xuebao [J Jiangnan Soc U] (2013), 24.\n98 CAI, above n.94, 95; ibid., CUI.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 279\nHamre, former US Deputy Defense Secretary, who is skeptical about the feasibility of using cyber operations to achieve the designated military objectives, to demonstrate the unexpected collateral damages caused by cyberattacks.⁹⁹ This scholar also considers the current rule of the proportionality of attacks, which factors “the incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damages to civilian objects, or a combination thereof” into assessing whether such collateral damages would be excessive in relation to “the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”,¹⁰⁰ as inadequate protection of civilian interests and suggests adding “knock-on effects” into consideration.¹⁰¹\nThird, the distinction between civilian noncombatants and civilians who directly participate in hostilities used to be not an appealing question for Chinese scholars, not only because the Chinese military does not have a tradition of employing civilian contractors, but also because China has not sent its troops to the battlefield for more than thirty years. To reduce costs and obtain technical expertise, the increasing usage of civilians to operate cyberattacks, maintain information weapons, or support cyber combat operations by States has further eroded the distinction between combatants and civilians.¹⁰² It is reasonable for the Chinese military, government and some State-owned-enterprise to recruit civilians for activities related to cyber warfare. Although the law that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities or who adopts a continuous combat function may be lawfully attacked is not in dispute, the targetability of a civilian who assists with cyber operations depends on the answers to two questions: which people are targetable and when they may be targeted. Some Chinese scholars argue that, due to the technical predicament of identity verification and attribution, the applicable LOAC rules fail to provide certainty and predictability for the determination of individual status.¹⁰³\nFourth, another issue closely related to China’s opposition to applying some LOAC rules to cyberspace, namely, what acts may constitute a resort to\n⁹⁹ Ibid., CAI, 96, quoting from Is it Real?

It is a separate question under the jus in bello, without prejudice to the question of “use of force” within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Annex 1 to this Agreement defines “information war” as:\nconfrontation between two or more states in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining political, economic and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to taking decisions in the interest of an opposing party[.].¹⁰⁴\nAlthough it remains unsettled whether and when an armed conflict, international or non-international, can commence based on a single cyber exchange, the SCO Agreement’s definition of war clearly expands the traditional meaning of armed conflict caused by conventional force under LOAC. Assuming that the term “war” in Annex 1 is not utilized as rhetoric, but rather as the reference of “armed conflict” within the meaning of LOAC, we may tentatively argue that the SCO members consider the existing LOAC’s scope of regulation as underinclusive because it fails to include the cyber actions that can generate political, economic, social and even psychological consequences into the realm of LOAC.\n## III. Examining China’s perspectives on specific rules of LOAC\n36. This part examines the legal or practical grounds supporting China’s views on the four mentioned issues of LOAC. In doing so, this part presents the general contour of various opinions on specific topics, encompassing State practice, positions of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and applicable Tallinn rules. Relevant treaty provisions and judgments of international judicial bodies will be referred to, if available.\n¹⁰⁴ Annex 1 to the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (16 June 2009), List of Basic Terms in the Field of International Information Security (http://cn.io.gov.mo/Legis/International/record/1280.aspx) (Chinese only) and (https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf) (non-official English translation).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 281\n## III.A. Cyberattacks regulated by LOAC\n37. Common Article 2 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 defines an international armed conflict as any “declared war or any other armed conflict which may arise two or more States”, regardless of whether any of them recognizes the state of war. In *Tadić*, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found “an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State.”¹⁰⁵ Undoubtedly, cyberattacks accompanying any kinetic use of force fall under the sphere of LOAC. As with cyber warfare, the pertinent question is whether a single cyber exchange in the absence of any conventional use of force can trigger an international armed conflict by itself.\n38. The notion “resort to armed force” is not defined under LOAC and is easily confused with the usage of “use of force” under the *jus ad bellum*. Nevertheless, the different objects and purposes of these two regimes entail distinct legal tests of “force”. The *jus ad bellum* specifically regulates inter-State relations and States’ lawful use of force, seeking to maintain peaceful relations among nations by setting up strict conditions for invoking forceful measures, “when States may move beyond non-forceful measures such as diplomacy, economic sanctions, and countermeasures”.¹⁰⁶ By contrast, the *jus in bello* regulates the behaviour of parties to an armed conflict, and its object and purpose are to protect the military and civilian victims of war by prohibiting the harms caused by armed attacks during a conflict that are either unnecessary to effectively accomplish legitimate military objectives or excessive in relation to them.¹⁰⁷ The *jus in bello* does not govern whether the use of force is legitimate under the *jus ad bellum* but imposes restrictions on methods and means of warfare.\n39. Despite the absence of a treaty definition of the notion “armed forces” under LOAC, Article 49(1) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva\n---\n¹⁰⁵ Prosecutor v. Tadić, ICTY Appeals Chamber, Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction (2 October 1995), Case No. IT-94-1-A, para.70.\n¹⁰⁶ Michael Schmitt, “Attack” as a Term of Art in International Law: The Cyber Operations Context, in: Christine Czosseck, Rain Ottis &amp; Katharina Ziolkowski (eds.), Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (2012), 284.\n¹⁰⁷ Cordula Droege, Get off My Cloud: Cyber Warfare, International Humanitarian Law, and the Protection of Civilians, 94 IR Red Cross (2012), 545.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nConventions defines “attack” within the meaning of LOAC as “acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence”.¹⁰⁸ By concentrating on the term “violence”, Article 49(1) provides a feasible way to access cyberattacks by analogy to the physical violent effects caused by kinetic attacks. The threshold concept of “attack” is selected in light of LOAC’s object and purpose, since only acts that qualify as attacks would be subject to many of its core prohibitions and restrictions. Only qualified attacks would trigger a wide range of legal protections for the civilian population and objects under LOAC. In most cases, an unqualified act beyond the realm of LOAC would fall under the domain of domestic and international human rights law. So far, there appears to be a consensus that as long as a cyber operation attributable to a State has the equivalent effects of kinetic forces, such as death, physical injury to persons, or damages to objects, it would trigger an international armed conflict.¹⁰⁹ Similarly, Rule 30 of the Tallinn Manual suggests that the “armed force” criterion is fulfilled when a cyber operation is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to person or damage or destruction to objects.¹¹⁰ A majority of the independent experts participating in the Tallinn Manual project favour including “loss of functionality” in the definition of damages, although there are various shades of opinions among them.¹¹¹\n40. The ICRC Commentary states that the term “attack” means “combat action”, without further elaboration.¹¹² A paper written by the Head of the ICRC’s Operational Law indicates that the ICRC considers the consequence-based approach as “insufficient to capture the whole range of possible effects of cyber operations and the damage that they can cause, which will not\n108 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 49(1).\n109 Nils Melzer, Cyberwarfare and International Law, UN Institute for Disarmament Research Publications (2011), 24 (https://unidir.org/files/publications/pdfs/cyberwarfare-and-international-law-382.pdf); Michael Schmitt, Classification of Cyber Conflict, 17 JCSL (2012), 251, n.25; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (2012), 131; Droege, above n.107, 546; Knut Dörmann, Applicability of the Additional Protocols to Computer Network Attacks, ICRC Resource Centre (19 November 2004), 3 (www.icrc.org/en/doc/resources/documents/misc/68lg92.htm).\n110 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 30, 106.\n111 Ibid., 108-09.\n112 Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski &amp; Bruno Zimmermann (eds.), Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 (1987), para.1880.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 283\nnecessarily resemble the physical effects of traditional weapons\".¹¹³ Given adequate consideration to the object and purpose of LOAC and the concerns of a gap in protection, especially the protection of civilians from the effects of war, that paper seems to endorse the \"loss of functionality\" approach adopted by the majority view of the Tallinn Manual. Based on this approach, whether a cyber operation amounts to an attack depends on whether it causes the target to lose function, even if the target is not physically damaged.¹¹⁴\n41. States may support the dysfunction approach since cyber operations would be more frequently resorted, not to physically destroy or damage objects, which can be accomplished by using kinetic force, but rather to incapacitate or disrupt the normal functioning of a vital military or dual-use infrastructure.¹¹⁵ For instance, an electrical grid or water supply system might be shut down, and a country's banking or stock-trading system could be manipulated, both without any physical damage. As is demonstrated by the 2007 Estonian denial-of-service attacks, for certain civilian populations, the potential hardship arising from such dysfunction could be far more extensive or severe than the physical destruction of a particular building. Such effects might not be comparable to those caused by physical violence, but they are \"precisely the kind of severe consequences from which [LOAC] seeks to protect the civilian population\".¹¹⁶\n42. According to the dysfunction approach, cyberattacks against military or dual-use infrastructure, such as paralyzing information systems, altering or deleting processes and resources, are attacks that can trigger the application of LOAC, while applying the consequence-based approach would lead to a contrary conclusion. The applicable LOAC rule maintains that cyberattacks resulting in no physical damage are lawful.¹¹⁷ The US-EU camp intends to stay with the existing rule and has codified it in the Tallinn Manual. Although international law evolves to reflect the changing values developed by the international community, most States remain silent on this issue. Whether LOAC should expand its established interpretation of attacks depends on future State practice.\n¹¹³ Droege, above n.107, 546.\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 546-47.\n¹¹⁵ Ibid.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid., 549.\n¹¹⁷ Schmitt, above n.106, 291.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n43. Part of the SCO Agreement defines war as the “confrontation between two or more States in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes, and resources, critical and other structures”. Under this part of the definition, those confrontations that happen without any physical damages would not qualify as attacks and therefore be lawful under LOAC. The remaining part, namely, inter-State confrontations in cyberspace aimed at “undermining political, economic, and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to [take] decisions in the interest of an opposing party”, is unlikely to fall into the scope of attacks under LOAC either.\n44. On Article 49 of Additional Protocol I, the *Bothe, Partsch and Solf Commentary* underlines that attacks refer to “those aspects of military operations that most directly affect the safety of the civilian population and the integrity of civilian objects”.¹¹⁸ It would be difficult to assert that political, economic, social, or even psychological effects of cyber operations could be deemed most directly affecting the personal safety of civilians or the physical integrity of civilian objects. Dissemination of propaganda, espionage, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological or economic warfare does not fall under the concept of attack in LOAC.¹¹⁹\n45. LOAC endeavours to regulate methods and means of war and the treatments of different groups. Under LOAC, a State wants to protect its civilian population and objects, and at the same time, be able to use lethal force against the belligerent party once an armed conflict commences. An overinclusive definition of “attack” will subject the civilian population to catastrophic consequences that would have been avoided by applying the present definition with a high threshold. Such consideration partly explains why most States remain silent in the face of cyberattacks.¹²⁰\n46. The SCO Agreement’s definition of war demonstrates the six countries’ concerns of adverse impacts by acts that do not qualify as attacks and coincides with Russia’s proposal for non-proliferation of information weapons. But, unlike biological and chemical weapons, the usage of so-called information weapons does not necessarily lead to unnecessary suffering of humans\n¹¹⁸ Michael Bothe, Karl Josef Partsch &amp; Waldemar A. Solf, New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts: Commentary on the Two 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (1982), 325.\n¹¹⁹ Ibid., 289.\n¹²⁰ See, e.g., Gary Brown, Why Iran didn’t admit Stuxnet was an attack, 63 Joint Force Quarterly (2011), 71.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 285\nand might even reduce physical harm compared to the usage of conventional forces regarding the accomplishment of the same military objective. This feature of information weapons makes them not a proper subject matter for a total (or partial) ban. By their features and consequences, unqualified cyberattacks are more suitable to be regulated by regimes other than LOAC for the time being. As demonstrated by the final UN GGE report, leading SCO members, including China, Russia, and Kazakhstan, no longer dispute the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict, although controversies over, for example, the qualification of single cyber exchange as attacks under the meaning of LOAC, remain unsettled. Hence, the SCO members may continue to advance the broad interpretation of “attack” to build up consensus for new norms while resisting the application of the existing LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks.\n## III.B. Dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities\n47. As a “cardinal principle”¹²¹ of LOAC, the principle of distinction requires that a distinction be made between military and civilian persons and objects and prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. Article 52(1) of Additional Protocol I defines “civilian objects” in a negative manner as “all objects which are not military objectives”.¹²² Military objectives are those “by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage”.¹²³ According to Rule 39 of the Tallinn Manual, an object cannot be civilian and military simultaneously; its status is either one or the other.¹²⁴ Therefore, the entire dual-use object becomes a military objective from the moment it is used for military action, even if its military use is only “marginal” compared to its civilian use. Such observation represents today’s prevailing view on the qualification of dual-use objects as targetable military objectives.¹²⁵\n¹²¹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, 257, para.78.\n¹²² Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 52(1).\n¹²³ Ibid., Art. 52(2).\n¹²⁴ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 39 and its Commentary, para.1.\n¹²⁵ See Droege, above n.107, 562; Michael Schmitt, The Law of Cyber Targeting, Tallinn Paper No.7 (2015), 11.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n48. From the perspective of civilian protection, the “potentially non-lethal nature of cyberweapons”¹²⁶ draws concerns over an “expanded target list”¹²⁷ and an obscured assessment of the legality of an attack. In a world where a large part of civilian infrastructure and services are highly reliant on international cyber infrastructure, including the Internet, servers, routers, cables, satellites, and computers, the danger of loss of function, partial damage or complete destruction is evident. For example, approximately 98% of US government communications use civilian-owned and civilian-operated networks.¹²⁸ Under LOAC, belligerent parties can easily target cyber infrastructure as military objectives because mere containing, storing, or transmitting a tiny percentage of military data would render the entire infrastructure a legitimate target.\n49. Several scenarios of consequences of attacks against dual-use cyber infrastructure entail humanitarian concerns for civilian protection. The past decade witnessed the increasing use of cloud computing, the users of which are usually unaware of which server their data is stored on and whether military data is stored on the same server. Cyberspace is an artificial battlefield, where, unlike natural theatres of war, such as land or airspace, travelling military data or weapons (e.g., malware, botnet, or malicious codes) can make not only itself a legitimate target but also the transmitting infrastructure a military objective. It can be a computer system, a communication network, a server or router, a major cable, a satellite, or in the worst case, the entire Internet network system.¹²⁹\n50. The Tallinn Manual provides that “the circumstances under which the Internet in its entirety could be attacked [are] so highly unlikely as to render the possibility purely theoretical at the present time”, and that “virtually any attack against the Internet would have to be limited to certain discrete segments thereof”.¹³⁰ Nevertheless, it also acknowledges that “it may be impossible to know over which part of the network military transmissions, as distinct\n126 Jeffrey T.

In such cases, the entire network (or at least those aspects in which transmission is reasonably likely) qualifies as a military objective.”¹³¹\n51. In the physical world, the irrelevance of dual-use objects’ civilian part regarding the principle of distinction is no longer in dispute. In cyberspace, the broad interpretation might lead to extreme situations where nothing civilian remains. More importantly, being a military objective will incur not only attacks in cyberspace but also fatal kinetic attacks. As a result, the fundamental rule that civilian population and objects enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations becomes an empty shell, leaving such situations only subject to protection under the principles of proportionality and precaution.\n52. Almost all States and legal commentators agree that the element of “make[s] an effective contribution to military action” in Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I includes a contribution towards “war-fighting” or “war-supporting” capabilities of the belligerent party.¹³² War-fighting objects refer to those used in combat, while war-supporting objects are what military operations rely on in some “relatively direct sense”.¹³³ In the cyber context, typical war-supporting objects are factories producing hardware or software or other kinds of information weapons,¹³⁴ all of which qualify as military objectives. Controversy on this element concentrates on the “war-sustaining” object policy of the US, which has been adopted by a few States so far.¹³⁵ The majority of Tallinn Manual independent experts refused to include war-sustaining objects into military objectives due to the remote relationship between them and military operations.¹³⁶\n53. The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations of the US extends the expression of Article 52(2) to “effectively contribute to the enemy’s war-fighting or war-sustaining capability”.¹³⁷ The term “war-sustaining” encompasses objects within “an economy or governmental financial system”\n¹³¹ Ibid., para.3.\n¹³² Schmitt, above n.125.\n¹³³ Ibid.\n¹³⁴ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n¹³⁵ Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n¹³⁶ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n¹³⁷ Department of the Navy and Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, NWP 1-14M/MCWP 5-12.1/COMDTPUB P5800.7A (July 2007), para.8.2.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nrelied on by the enemy to fund participation in the conflict.¹³⁸ For instance, the revenue from cotton export during the US Civil War enabled the Confederate States to finance and therefore sustain its war.¹³⁹ Contemporary examples are oil industries of the terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Shams, whose funding of war relied on revenues from oil exports.¹⁴⁰ The rationale behind the war-sustaining approach in the sense of traditional warfare is that the destruction of certain economic objects that are not absolutely “indispensable to civilian survival”, yet currently protected under LOAC, would shorten a conflict and therefore reduce the potential casualty toll and generate societal changes.¹⁴¹\n54. The different effects of cyberattacks and kinetic ones might make cyberattacks against war-sustaining objects more effective in achieving the expected military goal. Using cyber operations to paralyze the infrastructure upon which a central banking system is built, or delete funds from accounts, or change account balances, or manipulate the stock market, will lead to a collapse of the enemy’s confidence. According to the applicable law, many of such cyber operations may not even qualify as attacks under LOAC. Despite the unique advantage of cyberattacks, the military advantage of cyber operations on war-sustaining objects might be indefinite and difficult to articulate.¹⁴² Critiques of war-sustaining objects within the sphere of traditional warfare can apply indiscriminately to cyberspace. There would be no limits to warfare, providing that substantially the entire economy of a country can be considered as war-sustaining.¹⁴³ Consequently, a much broader scope of military objectives that include the enemy’s research and development capabilities would devastate the humanitarian values upheld by the principle of distinction.\n55. To sum up, the Chinese scholars’ view that applying some existing rules of LOAC to cyberspace would potentially “open a gate for humanitarian\n138 Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n139 US Naval War College, Annotated Supplement to the Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations (1997), 400, n.11.\n140 Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n141 See Charles J. Dunlap, The End of Innocence, Rethinking Noncombatancy in the Post-Kosovo Era, 28 Strategic R (Summer 2002), 9.\n142 US Department of Defense Office of General Counsel, An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations (May 1999), 8 (https://fas.org/irp/eprint/io-legal.pdf).\n143 Droege, above n.107, 568.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 289\ndisasters” is reasonable, given that attacks against dual-use infrastructure are currently lawful in most cases. Unless there is a breakthrough in law, attacks against major cyber infrastructure would remain subject to the legal safeguards for civilian protection embodied in the principles of proportionality and precaution. As with Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, targeting highly dangerous infrastructure, such as dams, dikes, and nuclear electrical generating stations, violates the established rule enshrined in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I, which explicitly prohibits targeting listed infrastructure even if they constitute military objectives.\n56. Some may argue that, instead of denying the existing law, a government should assume its responsibility to ensure that military data or weapons do not taint civilian facilities. Unfortunately, the present level of technology and the indiscrepable relationship between civilian and military components in global cyberspace holds little promise for such complete separation.\n57. Another alternative proposal pertinent to the Chinese scholars’ argument is to expand the list of “works and installations containing dangerous forces” in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I by analogy so that critical cyber infrastructure could not be made targetable objects.¹⁴⁴ But the hurdle for adequate State support for this effort remains high. It would be difficult to convince States that the potentially nonlethal effects of attacks on cyber infrastructure could be made comparable to that of radioactive materials leak or flood.\n58. China has never embraced the “war-sustaining” approach. As demonstrated by the SCO Agreement’s definition of war, China’s perception of threats to the safety and normal functionality of its cyber infrastructure is more oriented towards cyber operations below the threshold of attacks under LOAC. In other words, a lower bar of attacks capable of triggering the application of LOAC is demanded. Meanwhile, the Chinese scholars who expressed concerns over allowing attacks against dual-use and war-sustaining objects under LOAC might want to remove these objects from LOAC’s list of legitimate military objectives. To simultaneously realize the objectives of the SCO members and the mentioned Chinese scholars would require any cyber operations falling under the SCO Agreement’s definition to only attack objects exclusively used for military purposes and dual-use objects that are neither highly dangerous nor counted as cyber infrastructure. Such handling\n¹⁴⁴ Robin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann, Cyber Warfare: Applying the Principle of Distinction in an Interconnected Space, 45 Israel LR (2012), 390.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nmight significantly reduce the legitimate functioning space for cyberattacks and prevent them from doing what they are best at, namely, accomplishing military advantage precisely without causing non-reversible damages of critical civilian infrastructure and having the potential to stay non-violent and reduce collateral losses. Such consequences turn out to be contrary to the humanitarian intentions of these Chinese scholars to reduce the harms suffered by victims of war.\n## III.C. Proportionality of cyberattacks against infrastructures\n59. Given that the interconnectedness of military networks and their heavy reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure has left the principle of distinction virtually empty of contents, the principle of proportionality becomes an ultimate rule for protecting civilian persons and objects. This principle prohibits attacks “which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.145 In light of the harsh challenges imposed by the unique features of cyber warfare, the actual role that the principle of proportionality can play could not be overstated.\n60. Under LOAC, what can be considered as “excessive” incidental damage to civilian objects in comparison with the expected concrete and direct military advantage remains controversial. The principle of proportionality is “more easily stated than applied in practice”. As a matter of fact, findings of excessive incidental damage to civilian infrastructure are very few and far between as compared to the military advantage.146 Moreover, the proportionality assessment in LOAC is made ex-ante when expected collateral damage is weighed against the anticipated military damage.147 The practical difficulties in ascertaining the expected effects of cyber operations prevent commanders from precisely assessing the potential collateral damages to civilian objects. How to apply this principle in cyberspace hinges on the development of both legal interpretation and technology, the uncertainty of which may jeopardize\n145 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 51(5)(b).\n146 ICTY, Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (13 June 2000), para.19 (www.icty.org/x/file/Press/nato061300.pdf).\n147 Schmitt, above n.125, 19.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 291\nthis principle’s ability to prevent significant collateral damages to civilian objects in cyber warfare.\n61. In the digital era, incidental damages to civilian objects will no longer be limited to physical ones but also the loss of functionality of civilian cyber infrastructure. Therefore, in order to accommodate the special needs of cyber warfare, several opinions calling for modifications of the assessment of “collateral damages to civilian objects” have emerged. For example, it is suggested that more weight should be given to temporary consequences regarding cyberattacks, for the temporary incapacity of critical systems would incur more severe consequences than mere inconvenience, such as in situations where loss of life may be caused by the inability of hospitals to communicate vital information.¹⁴⁸ But existing LOAC fails to provide any legal basis for this. The paradoxical applicable law is described as:\nwhereas the destruction of a single civilian car would amount to legally relevant, albeit rather insignificant, ‘collateral damage’, the disconnection of thousands or millions of households, companies and public services from the Internet or other communication services, or the severance of online financial transactions for a country’s entire economy and the corresponding economic and societal effects as such would not count as relevant elements to be factored into the proportionality calculus.¹⁴⁹\n62. Similarly, some scholars propose to include “knock-on effects” of cyber-attacks in the proportionality calculations when such an effect would not have occurred “but for” the attack.¹⁵⁰ “Knock-on effects” refer to those generated by the initial effects of the attack.¹⁵¹ Both the 1990-1992 Gulf War and the NATO action in the former Yugoslavia illustrate that the knock-on effects of targeting electricity grid may cause more harm to the affected civilians than the direct effect of these attacks themselves.¹⁵² Although existing law has not touched upon this issue, most scholars seem to agree that knock-on effects\n¹⁴⁸ Oona Hathaway, et al., The Law of Cyber-Attack, 100 California LR (2012), 851.\n¹⁴⁹ Geiß &amp; Lahmann, above n.144, 397.\n¹⁵⁰ Michael Schmitt, Heather Harrison Dinniss &amp; Thomas C.

Commentary to Rule 51 of the Tallinn Manual includes both direct and indirect effects of attacks in the proportionality assessment. The former means “the immediate, first-order consequences, unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms”, and the latter refers to “the delayed and/or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms”. Without deliberately using the same term, the Tallinn Manual adopts the “knock-on effects” approach, factoring “any indirect effects that should be expected by those individuals planning, approving, or executing a cyberattack” into the proportionality evaluation. Such indirect effects can be exemplified by accidents involving transportation systems or malware inserted into a military computer system spread to other civilian computer systems and thereafter disables them, where those risks are or should have been expected. Such indirect effects may result from blocking the Global Positioning Satellite data or disrupting the Global Positioning System. Inconvenience, irritation, stress, or fear caused by cyber operations are explicitly excluded from collateral damages to civilian objects.\n64. The Chinese scholars' view on the theoretical and practical difficulties in applying the present law on proportionality concurs with the mainstream view among international law commentators. The Tallinn Manual's rules and commentaries on this principle are early attempts to codify the prevailing treaty interpretation, contributing to an enhanced relief valve of attacks against critical cyber infrastructure. The Chinese scholars' critiques of Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, which permits attacks against highly dangerous infrastructure, were not made in conjunction with Rule 51, becoming an interpretation out of context. The proportionality assessment under existing law disillusions those who wish to use it to make up for the failure of rules regarding the principle of distinction in protecting civilian safety. If the applicable LOAC rules regarding the principles of distinction and proportionality remain unchanged, the principle of precaution would be the only safeguard left.\n153 Schmitt, above n.150.\n154 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 160, para.6.\n155 Ibid.\n156 Ibid.\n157 Ibid., para.5.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 293\n## III.D. Targetable civilians\n65. Article 51(3) of the Additional Protocol I¹⁵⁸ and Article 13(3)¹⁵⁹ of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts provides that, if civilians engage in conducts amounting to “direct participation in hostilities”, their protection against direct military attacks would be suspended. In cyber warfare, “for such time” as civilians directly participate in hostilities, they not only become legitimate targets of military operations but also are bound by LOAC rules governing the conduct of hostilities. Furthermore, such civilians should not be factored into the proportionality calculation. They are not considered for the principle of precaution that aims to avoid or minimize incidental harm to civilians.¹⁶⁰\n66. Civilians may be targeted for direct participation in hostilities. Currently, given the complexity of this issue, there is no authoritative guidance on which activities qualify as direct participation.¹⁶¹ The present State practice, the jurisprudence of international judicial bodies and prevailing academic views adopt a case-by-case determination method through exemplification rather than illustration.¹⁶² To address when civilians may be targeted, the ICRC sponsored a five-year research project in 2003 and produced its *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law* (“Interpretive Guidance”).¹⁶³\n67. In this document, the ICRC proposes three “constitutive elements” of direct participation in hostilities: (1) an act that negatively impacts the enemy’s military effort, or in which harm is intended (threshold of harm); (2) a relatively direct nexus between that act and the resulting harm, or that act constituting an “integral part” of a coordinated military operation likely to cause the said harm (direct causation), and (3) linkage to the armed conflict\n---\n158 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 51(3).\n159 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, 1125 UNTS 609 (7 December 1978), Art. 13(3).\n160 Melzer, above n.109, 27.\n161 Michael Schmitt, Deconstructing Direct Participation in Hostilities: The Constitutive Elements, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 699.\n162 Ibid., 705-09.\n163 ICRC, Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law (prepared by Nils Melzer) (May 2009) (www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n(belligerent nexus).¹⁶⁴ Although these criteria were generally accepted, the Interpretive Guidance has drawn strong criticism from scholars.¹⁶⁵ These scholars argued that it is both underinclusive as to improperly exclude some forms of direct participation and overinclusive as to incorrectly permit attacks against some civilians and civilian property.¹⁶⁶\n68. There is no reason to distinguish cyber operations from kinetic operations regarding how civilian conducts qualify as direct participation in hostilities, as most controversies are not cyber-specific. Critiques of the Interpretive Guidance in conventional warfare do not necessarily stand in cyberspace. According to the “threshold of harm” element, an act amounting to hostility does not have to qualify as an attack within the meaning of LOAC, which indispensably entails the infliction of death, injury, or destruction on military personnel and objects. “Essentially any consequence adversely affecting the military operations or military capacity” of an opposing party would satisfy the test.¹⁶⁷ Compared to the difficulties in arming civilians with traditional weapons, the technical barrier to cyber armed civilians is almost non-existent. It is too easy for civilians to have the know-how to conduct harmful cyber activities.¹⁶⁸ Therefore, in cyber warfare, “the pool of targetable individuals could be extremely large in future conflicts, far more than is the case in classic conflict.”¹⁶⁹\n69. Espionage activities, including gathering and disseminating intelligence of military tactics and operations by cyber means, or hacking into the enemy system to identify enemy vulnerabilities, would both suffice. Engaging in developing cyber defence systems, such as encryption technology, firewalls or anti-virus software, also falls under this category. However, the element of “direct causation” defines them as causing only “indirect harm” because such individual conduct “merely builds up or maintains the capacity of a party to\n164 Ibid., 46.\n165 See, i.e., Kenneth Watkin, Opportunity Lost: Organized Armed Groups and the ICRC “Direct Participation in Hostilities” Interpretive Guidance, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 641-95; Schmitt, above n.161, 697-740; Bill Boothby, “And for Such Time as”: The Time Dimension to Direct Participation in Hostilities, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 741-68; W.

Nevertheless, the unique features of cyber warfare demand particular attention paid to certain issues in cyberspace. Commentators questioned the rationality of the ICRC's interpretation of the term \"for such time\" when a direct participant can be targeted.172 The ICRC provides that this period covers preparatory measures of a specific act of direct participation, deployment to or return from the activity concerned.173 They argued that the restrictive interpretation has dramatically narrowed the window of targetability, rendering this standard particularly impractical in cyber warfare.174 There is usually no deployment to or return from cyber operations since most of them are controlled remotely.\n71. More importantly, the duration of cyber operations can be extremely short, sometimes even too brief to identify the attacker.175 Or, in some cases, for example, a surreptitiously emplaced logic bomb, the effect of cyber operations can be long-delayed.176 A better approach is suggested to cure this deficiency:\nTo characterise an individual who engages in multiple cyber operations that are part of an on-going cyber campaign as a direct participant targetable throughout the period of activity. Once the individual definitively withdraws from participation, he or she regains their protection from attack, and not before.177\nThis approach seems more promising but might still lead to scary consequences. For civilian computer operators working in closed military facilities,\n170 Above n.163, 53.\n171 Michael Schmitt, Cyber Operations and the Jus in Bello: Key Issues, in: Daria P. Wollschaeger &amp; Raul Pedrozo (eds.), International Law and the Changing Character of War (International Law Studies, Vol. 87) (2011), 101.\n172 See generally above n.165; Schmitt, above n.125, 14-16.\n173 Above n.163, 65-68.\n174 See, e.g., Schmitt, above n.125, 14-16.\n175 Ibid., 16.\n176 Schmitt, above n.171, 102.\n177 Schmitt, above n.125, 16.\nChinese JIL (2021)\ntheir targetability would not expire after work but become a portable threat travelling with them and making their family members and neighbours legitimate collateral damage. As the debate continues, any resolution must grant sufficient consideration to the safety of civilians.\n72. Cyber warfare also presents peculiar questions to the controversy over which members of an organized armed group are targetable between the ICRC and the NATO members. Members of organized armed groups are the other category of civilians that are legitimate targets of military operations.^^ According to the Interpretive Guidance, only those with a “continuous combat function” can be attacked.^^ The NATO members and Israel favour including all members of a group formed to conduct hostilities.^^ These countries criticize the requirement of “continuous combat function” as affording greater protection to members of organized groups than members of the armed forces, whereas the former enjoy no right to engage in hostilities while the latter does.^^ In the human-made theatre in cyberspace, where distinguishing members of organized armed groups from civilians can be far more difficult and uncertain than on physical battlefields, the additional requirement of ensuring that a member performs “continuous combat function” seems impractical and unnecessary. After all, LOAC’s presumption of civilian status in the case of doubt has offered adequate protection for such members.^^\n73. At first sight, the Chinese scholars’ view tends to see the problem as a practical one of attribution and verification rather than one of law. Nonetheless, such difficulties give rise to debates about legal issues specific to cyber warfare. To the degree that the targetability of civilians is concerned, the critiques of the Interpretive Guidance mainly stem from practical difficulties, before or at the moment of targeting, in distinguishing members of armed groups or civilians directly participating in hostilities from civilians.\n74. For capacity-building or -maintaining conduct that involves espionage or development activities by cyber means, it would be premature to argue that China is willing to waive its right to attack civilians that severely harm its military operation or capacity. But given its general defensive stance on security\n178 Melzer, above n.109, 29.\n179 Above n.163, 71.\n180 See Michael Schmitt, The Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities: A Critical Analysis, 1 Harvard Nat’l S J (2010), 21-24.\n181 Schmitt, above n.171, 100.\n182 Additional Protocol I, above n.100, Art. 50(1).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 297\nissues, China is neither likely to embrace the broader approach that covers such “indirect” conduct. If China ends up agreeing with the applicability of LOAC rules on this issue, it might favour the ICRC’s restrictive standard of “for such time” and “continuous combat function”, not only because of China’s defensive rather than offensive approach to the use of force, but also because of its humanitarian considerations to protect the lives of a large number of civilians relate—occupationally to activities that have a bearing on military operations, or personally to someone occasionally carrying out conduct of hostilities—from lethal attacks.\n75. For the purpose of civilian protection, the better approach for States turns out to be recruiting only military personnel, ideally with uniforms and other distinctive marks, for military operations by cyber means. While accessible in theory, the transformation of non-State cyber actors into national forces would be time-consuming. As a reminder, the privateers were not completely abandoned by States until the time when the maritime powers had developed strong navies, which were capable of forcing the armed merchants who refused to integrate into the navy to put down their weapons in exchange for State protection on the high seas and defeating privates and enemy fleets.^^\n## IV. The objectives of China’s normative proposals\n76. Based on its limited number of available official statements and practices, China’s opposition to the applicability of some LOAC rules in cyberspace remains vague and general from a legal perspective. The SCO Agreement’s expansive version of cyber “war” indicates that China’s earlier position did not distinguish armed conflicts from other situations, although the application of LOAC hinges on such a differentiation. Apart from the catchall interpretation of cyberattacks, many Chinese scholars expressed concerns over the adequacy of the LOAC rules governing the targetability of dual-use infrastructure and certain groups of civilians and the principle of proportionality. These concerns are not groundless both in terms of law and practice. In fact, the ICRC’s views on the three issues, or even some corresponding rules of the Tallinn Manual, address their concerns well. The practice of the US and its allies that China opposes has not hardened into customary international law binding on all\n^^ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering: A Historical Analogy, Cyber Studies Programme Working Paper No. 1 (March 2015), 3-6, 9 (www.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/cybersecurity-and-the-age-of-privateering-a-historical-analogy.html).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nStates that fail to maintain persistent objection to it. These facts have contributed to China's incremental acceptance of the general applicability of LOAC to the cyber context despite many remaining controversies over how specific LOAC rules should be interpreted and applied to cyber operations.\n77. As with China's concerns over the Tallinn Manual's overemphasis on the military paradigm of responses to cyberattacks in international legal discourse, which threatens to derogate from the principle of non-use of force and to abuse the right to self-defence, a more diverse group of experts was composed to draft the second version of the Tallinn Manual, to address the criticisms of the limited diversity of the group of experts participating in drafting the first version of the Tallinn Manual and this group's overreliance on Western legal sources. There were three non-Western experts from China, Belarus and Thailand, among the nine experts who participated in the formulation process of Tallinn Manual 2.0. The scope of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 expands from \"above the threshold\" cyber operations whose \"scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force\" or which are \"executed in the context of an armed conflict that [is] subject to the LOAC\" to \"below the threshold\" cyber operations that take place in peacetime and fall outside the regulatory scope of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello.\n78. The threshold of use of force functions as a firewall that separates cyber operations which can trigger the exercise of the right to self-defence by a victim State from cyber operations that can entail only pacific countermeasures. As previously mentioned, a major concern of China points to the Tallinn Manual's threshold on which cyber operations constitute use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The Chinese perspective considers it as a low standard intended to accommodate some States' strategic\n184 Dieter Fleck, Searching for International Rules Applicable to Cyber Warfare—A Critical First Assessment of the New Tallinn Manual, 18 JCSL (2013), 335; Ido Kilovaty, Cyber Warfare and the Jus ad Bellum Challenge: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, 5 Am U Nat'l S L Brief (2014), 108.\n185 Kirsten E.

Rule 69 stipulates the “scale and effects” approach.¹⁸⁹ Rule 71 provides that only “a State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence”.¹⁹⁰ The International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual reached a consensus that the scale of effects of cyber operations causing physical consequences can be considered as comparable to those of kinetic operations and hence the use of force under the *jus ad bellum*.¹⁹¹ But they contested over the status of cyber operations that have no consequences in the physical world but can lead to serious consequences.¹⁹²\n80. Some Western scholars identified the failure of Rule 69 to include cyber operations having no physical consequences but can cause temporary suspension of operational functionality,¹⁹³ result in alteration and destruction of data or code,¹⁹⁴ or involve “psychological operation” and “cyber espionage”,¹⁹⁵ as a major shortcoming of the Tallinn Rules.¹⁹⁶ Accordingly, they considered the definition of “use of force” adopted by the Tallinn Rules\n189 Ibid.\n190 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, Rule 71, 339.\n191 See, e.g., Ido Kilovaty, Virtual Violence-Disruptive Cyberspace Operations as “Attacks” Under International Humanitarian Law, 23 Michigan Telecomm &amp; Tech LR (2016), 145-46.\n192 See above n.184, Fleck, 336-37; Kilovaty, 116.\n193 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, 21; Michael N.

Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice, 112 AJIL (2018), 590.\nChinese JIL (2021)\nas “narrow”, blaming the experts for their overreliance on “a consequence-based gravity test in the jus ad bellum”.¹⁹⁷ In addition to the perceived narrow prohibition against the use of cyber force, they considered the Tallinn Rules’ construction of the right to self-defence as even narrower, given the significant difficulties in establishing causal links between multiple consequences and a cyber operation added to the difficulties of attributing a cyber operation to a State or a non-State actor.¹⁹⁸ Although the notion of anticipatory self-defence, which has long been a concern of China and an old controversy in the international law circle with a new incarnation, was adopted in the Tallinn Rules,¹⁹⁹ the practical difficulties in detecting the preparations for launching a cyberattack and further determining whether a cyberattack is imminent render the requirements for resorting to using force on the ground of anticipatory self-defence highly demanding.²⁰⁰\n81. Consequently, the victim State’s response in most cases would be limited to measures falling below the threshold of use of force, such as countermeasures²⁰¹ or referring the matter to the UNSC.²⁰² By far, the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Rules have identified only the Stuxnet attack as meeting the Tallinn threshold of use of force; some experts considered it as meeting the higher “scale and effects” threshold of an armed attack that can trigger the application of LOAC.²⁰³ Even American military lawyers and scholars, who are deemed by their Chinese counterparts as seeking to militarize cyberspace through lowering the threshold of use of force, have admitted that, “the prevailing view is that most, if not all, documented cyber actions taken by States to date have fallen below the ‘use of force’ threshold.”²⁰⁴ Apart from the narrowly construed right to self-defence in situations of armed conflicts, Rule 20 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides a broader right of States to take countermeasures in time of peace, “whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal\n197 Ibid.\n198 Ibid., 591.\n199 Above n.21, Tallinn Manual, Rule 15; Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 73.\n200 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, 351-53; Eichensehr, above n.185, 587.\n201 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, Rule 20, 161.\n202 Ibid., Rule 76, 357.\n203 Ibid., 342.\n204 Gary Corn &amp; Eric Jensen, The Technicolor Zone of Cyberspace–Part I, Just Security (30 May 2018) (www.justsecurity.org/57217/technicolor-zone-cyberspace-part/).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 301\nobligation that is owned by another State”.²⁰⁵ Nevertheless, the exercise of this right by States is subject to similar difficulties in attribution, in addition to a set of conditions, including notification, proportionality,²⁰⁶ and the exclusion of measures amounting to uses of force.\n82. The narrow construction of the right to self-defence and countermeasures under the Tallinn Rules demonstrates the reluctance of the International Group of Experts to permissibly authorize a State to undertake unilateral acts that would result in effects in the territory of another State, in another word, a strong pro-sovereignty inclination of the Tallinn Rules. In contrast, the US and the UK argued that sovereignty did not by itself constitute a specific rule of international law that cyber operations might violate, but rather a foundational principle of international law that undergirds specific rules of international law, such as the prohibition against the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the rule of non-intervention under customary international law. In these two countries’ view, such a principle has no binding effect, and low-scale cyber operations deployed by a State that generate effects in another State’s territory but do not breach any of these specific rules, do not violate international law merely because of their incompatibility with the abstract principle of sovereignty.²⁰⁷ This controversy over the status of sovereignty remains unsettled in the final UN GGE report mainly due to the UK’s active participation in the UN GGE. Yet NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations released in 2020 has endorsed the status of sovereignty as a rule of international law in a footnote, with the UK as the only NATO member having reserved on that footnote.²⁰⁸\n83. Therefore, although the Tallinn Rules were developed under the auspices of NATO, they represent neither the exceptional perspectives of some States such as the US or the UK nor the collective views of the NATO members. Throughout the Hague Process, during the drafting of the Tallinn Rules, where legal advisors from 50 States were given the opportunity to\n205 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, Rule 38, 111.\n206 Ibid., 120, 127.\n207 As noted in: Michael Schmitt, US Transparency Regarding International Law in Cyberspace, Just Security (15 November 2016) (www.justsecurity.org/34465/transparency-international-law-cyberspace/); also Corn &amp; Jensen, above n.204.\n208 North Atlantic Treaty Organization Allied Joint Publication-3.20, Allied Joint Doctrine For Cyberspace Operations (Edition A Version 1) (29 January 2020), Footnote 26 and GBR’s Reservation (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/899678/doctrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nexpress their legal positions to shape the codification process, many States maintained a persistent policy of silence and ambiguity on the specificities of existing or emerging norms regulating cyberspace.²⁰⁹ Meanwhile, the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, together with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, convened two consultative meetings in April 2015 and February 2016 with representatives from more than one hundred States, including China.²¹⁰\n84. The technological difficulties in credibly attributing responsibility for cyber operations, the ongoing controversies over which existing rules apply to cyberspace, their contents, the suitability of the prevailing international legal framework as the primary method to regulate inter-State behaviour in cyberspace, and political and strategic considerations that have prevented States from making public attributions and invoking their rights to take responsive measures, all have contributed to the “wait and see” approach adopted by most States towards utilizing rules and norms of international law, including the Tallinn Rules, to regulate cyber operations.²¹¹ These factors cast doubt over the ripeness of codifying applicable international law in these areas. The limited State practice and opinio juris partly explain China’s “wait and see” stance, which is in line with the mainstream approach in order to preserve a degree of operational flexibility in the face of technological development and the dynamic international environment.²¹²\n85. To summarize, China’s long-term insistence on the non-applicability of the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules to cyberspace does not only conform to the development trend of international normative discourses but also contributes to fuelling this momentum. Sovereign control of cyberspace has been increasingly reviving, and the focus of international legal discourse has shifted from the military paradigm concentrated on the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to the prism of general rules of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. The current landscape of international law identification and development reflects and underpins most concerns of China\n209 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 588.\n210 HUANG, above n.186, 84-85.\n211 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 584, 588, 633, 639, 648, 653 (2018).\n212 See, e.g., ZHU Lingling, Deduction and Development of State Responsibility Attribution in Cyber Attacks from the Perspective of Tallinn Manual Version 2.0, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 77-78; HUANG Zhixiong, New Trends of International Rule-making for Cyberspace: Some Considerations Based Tallinn Manual 2.0, 1 Xiamen Daxue Xuebao [J Xiamen U] (2018), 5-6.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 303\nand many other like-minded States, while the Tallinn Rules serve as one of the early efforts rather than the concluding remark of ongoing international legal discourses.\n86. However, there are two residual concerns of China not reflected in the mainstream State practice following the publication of the two versions of the Tallinn Manual. They are underscored by the elements of cyber sovereignty proposed by China that call for the prohibition of using ICT, information and communications networks to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression or arms race, and the OEWG resolution's reiteration of the need for introducing additional rules of behaviour regarding States' right to combat interference in their internal affairs through the dissemination of false and distorted news and States' duty to abstain from engaging in such activities. One is external threats posed by more powerful States which may utilize their digital advantages to threaten China's national security and social stability, and the other is external limitations, either from emerging norms of international law or other established powers, of China's exercise of regulatory power over content transmitted in cyberspace to combat such threats.\n87. Therefore, in addition to the mentioned concerns addressed by the mainstream State practice, China has employed its generalized and vague resistance to the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace as bargaining leverage to achieve another two objectives in international legal discourse: (1) to build up consensus for a new treaty regulating all use of cyber forces, or a disarmament treaty banning all or at least some types of information weapons, and (2) to block the formation of new law that would limit its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace and prevent disfavoured existing law from binding on its exercise of sovereign power in cyberspace.\n## IV.A. A disarmament treaty &amp; national security\n88. The first objective of China's opposition to an explicit affirmation of the right to self-defence and the applicability of some LOAC rules to the cyber context, namely, to build up consensus for a disarmament treaty on the use of information weapons under the auspice of the UN, emanates from the nature of States' right to self-defence. It is an inherent right reserved for States to\nChinese JIL (2021)\nresort to force by its own decision after the enshrinement of a general prohibition of uses of force in the UN Charter.²¹³\n89. As evidenced by the controversies over anticipatory self-defence in the drafting processes of the Tallinn Rules, diverse concepts and practices regarding the preconditions for the commencement of self-defence and the limitations to the exercise of this right have been invoked and contested by States. Whether Article 51 of the UN Charter allows anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defence before an armed attack occurs has long been a major point of contention. The US, the UK, Israel and some other States have construed Article 51 in a permissible manner by referring to the Caroline doctrine under customary international law, based on which they have often resorted to force. The UNSC has condemned some of such practices; the International Court of Justice took the restrictive view in the judgments of the Corfu Channel case,²¹⁴ the Nicaragua case,²¹⁵ and other decisions afterwards.²¹⁶ The restrictive approach limits States' right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter to situations where an armed attack has already taken place, excluding anticipatory self-defence. From the perspective of the degree of compliance, the effectiveness of the general prohibition of use of force is questionable. But none of these States supporting permissive interpretations dares to bluntly admit the existence of a violation or defy this universally accepted rule, although they always use various factual and legal arguments to justify their breaches.\n90. In the same vein, it is not practically feasible to ensure effective observance of a norm prohibiting use of force in cyberspace, especially by these States that are frequent invokers of anticipatory self-defence. Therefore, what China and other SCO members seek is rather to influence the norm-formulation process at the UN that reflects how the international community of States characterizes a situation or act in question, e.g., as a violation of the proposed norm, and whether most States have a willingness to suppress such dubious acts. In the interim, China has not come up with a clear and concrete stance on how to develop a standard resembling Article 2(4) and Article 51 of the UN Charter in judging the legality and legitimacy of State behaviour concerning use of cyber force. More importantly, concluding new treaties for\n213 UN Charter, 1 UNTS XVI (24 October 1945), Arts. 2(4).\n214 Corfu Channel Case (UK v.

Cyber disarmament is more unrealistic in today's international political environment than the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in light of the recent backlashes against the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons provoked by the Iran and North Korea nuclear crises. All nuclear-weapon States except China, which abstained, voted against a UNGA resolution proposing to convene the first UN conference aimed at achieving a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons.²¹⁷ On 22 January 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first multilateral agreement that bans nuclear weapons, entered into force. Although 85 States have signed and 50 of them have ratified this treaty, the non-participation of all nine States possessing nuclear weapons renders the efficacy of the treaty questionable.²¹⁸ Additionally, as manifested by Cuba's objection to an endorsement of the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, the States that do not enjoy conventional military superiority over their adversaries may have asymmetric advantages in cyberspace, which they are reluctant to give up.²¹⁹ Therefore, a cyber disarmament treaty would lack the support of both major cyber powers and the rest of the weaker cyber-armed States.\n92. In the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures in 2013 and the WikiLeaks disclosures lasting from mid-2016 to date, a rising trend of nationalism has taken place in many countries that used to stand in line with the US-EU camp, such as Brazil and Germany, pushing these countries to start thinking how to defend their \"data sovereignty\". The rise of cybersecurity nationalism has undermined international norm-making efforts, including trade negotiations between the EU and the US and the US attempts to promote norms of Internet freedom globally.²²⁰ There is no reason that cybersecurity discourse would stay intact.\n²¹⁷ Tariq Rauf, 2017: The Year in Which Nuclear Weapons Could be Banned?, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Commentary (20 March 2017) (www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2017/2017-year-which-nuclear-weapons-could-be-banned).\n²¹⁸ See generally, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (22 January 2021) (www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-on-the-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons/).\n²¹⁹ Arun M.

Given the unique features of cyber operations and the Internet, even a treaty in the style of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons would have little practical significance in deterring the abuse and misuse of force in cyberspace. The refrainment of most States, including the US, in most cyber tensions with other States, from resorting to the prevailing international legal framework in dealing with inter-State cyber relations, highlights the limitations of normative approaches in functioning as a general taboo for irresponsible activities in cyberspace by not only State but also private actors.\n94. Compared to conventional and nuclear weapons, the technical barriers to entry in cyber warfare are so low that non-State actors and countries that are conceivably weak by the standards of hard powers can play a significant role on par with powerful countries at low levels of cost. Cyberattacks can be conducted by any actor having an electronic device and connected to the Internet. The interconnectivity of the network enables any actor to stay geographically remote from where they commit cyberattacks. Simultaneously, unlike classic military operations that rely upon territorial linkages, this interconnectivity severely decreases the degree of State control over actors and activities. The life of a treaty, particularly a disarmament treaty, rests in its enforcement. The construction of a credible monitoring and enforcement mechanism would prove to be the utmost hurdle for a cyber disarmament treaty.\n95. Probably having realized the lack of feasibility and political will among States to negotiate a cyber disarmament treaty, China has softened, to some degree, its stance against the alleged militarization of cyberspace. In the most up-to-date white paper on China's military strategy issued in 2015, China plans to \"expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defence [...] so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability\". The ISCC further confirms that \"enhanced defence capability in cyberspace is an important part of China's endeavour to modernize its national defence and armed forces\", while restricting China's development of a cyber force to defensive capability.\n221 State Council Information Office, China's Military Strategy (May 2015), Chapter IV: Building and Development of China's Armed Forces (www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-05/26/content_20820628_4.htm).\n222 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n223 Ibid., Chapter I: Opportunities and Challenges &amp; Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 307\n## IV.B. Sovereign control over the Internet vs non-intervention\n96. The changes in the global context of disarmament and China's position regarding use of force in the cyber context have rendered the proposed second objective of China more salient. The central bone of contention in the normative competitions between the SCO members and the Western powers rests upon whether information and data transmitted in cyberspace shall be made subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State, although both sides have reached a consensus on the applicability of sovereignty as part of international law in cyberspace. At the core of this debate is how to draw the lines between the realms of domestic law and international law as consensual erosion of State sovereignty to be applied equally to all States.\n97. The US holds the view that, although sovereignty gives a State the right to control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory, the exercise of such jurisdiction by the territorial State, encompassing the use and access to the Internet, must comply with that State's obligations under applicable international law, particularly international human rights law. While noting that the freedom of expression may be restricted in situations such as the incitement of imminent terrorist violence, the US considers \"certain censorship and content control, including blocking websites simply because they contain content that criticizes a leader, a government policy, or an ideology, or because the content espouses particular religious beliefs\" as constituting State violations of international human rights law.²²⁴\n98. China likely views this reference to international human rights law as a pretext for Western attempts to conceptually undermine the scope of sovereign powers by narrowing the content of *domaine réservé* in the context of Internet governance. China claims for cyber sovereignty that includes not only cyber infrastructure within its territory but also its jurisdiction over data and the regulation and monitoring of the content of information flowing over cyberspace.²²⁵ Consciously aware that the scope of a State's internal matters and the international legal limitations to that State's exercise of sovereign power over internal matters evolve over time, China has consistently resisted non-reciprocal and non-voluntary restrictions on its exercise of sovereignty.\n²²⁴ Egan, above n.45, 15-17.\n²²⁵ See, e.g., National Security Law of the People's Republic of China (2015), art. 25; XI Jinping, Keynote Speech at the opening ceremony of the 2nd World Internet Conference (16 December 2015) (www.wuzhenwic.org/2015-12/16/c_47521.htm).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n99. From Beijing's perspective, the nature of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as a product formulated under the domination of Western powers was not changed solely by the increased diversity in the composition of the International Group of Experts participating in the drafting process, because the newly-added matters reflect foremostly Western perspectives and concerns. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 does not touch upon the sovereignty of a State over potential data; it only mentions sovereign power over any cyber infrastructure located within States' territory and activities associated with that cyber infrastructure. Similar problems exist in the Tallinn Rules concerning jurisdiction, which overwhelmingly emphasize the limitations imposed by international human rights law to the exercise of sovereignty in cyberspace.²²⁶\n100. In the domestic sphere, China invokes cyber sovereignty to underpin its regulation over data and information in cyberspace. As shown in the SCO Agreement's wording of \"mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to take decisions to the interest of an opposing party\", China is always wary of potential foreign interference. The propaganda and liaison roles played by online social networking servers, such as Facebook and Twitter, in the \"Arab Spring\" that led to social unrest, political turmoil and regime-changes in Northern African and Western Asian countries, and the exposure of the massive surveillance by the US National Security Agency in the PRISM program have strengthened the Chinese conviction of the need for Internet censorship to block and filter information in cyberspace that is harmful to China's social stability and national security.²²⁷ In the trend of the global revival of cyber sovereignty, China strengthens its sovereignty-based regulatory power by referring to similar censorship practices of other States, such as the US, Australia, Italy, Germany, France, the UK, and Korea that once held opposing views, regarding the information about terrorism, incitement to hate crimes, pornography, violence and other crimes involving the usage of the Internet.²²⁸\n101. In the international sphere, China has employed cyber sovereignty as a shield against some Western States' attempts to compel it to change the\n²²⁶ HUANG, above n.212.\n²²⁷ HUANG Zhixiong, Regulation of Cyber Information: A Component Implicitly Covered by Cyber Sovereignty, 3 Guojia Zhili [Nat'l Governance Wkly] (2016), 33-34.\n²²⁸ Xinlian, From the US to Australia: How States Regulate the Internet, China Daily (17 May 2016) (http://world.chinadaily.com.cn/2016-05/17/content_25321844.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 309\ncurrent model of Internet governance by either resorting to non-legal advocacy for Internet freedom or invoking relevant international law, especially the rules of international human rights law on the right to freedom of expression, association, and the media, and the right to access to information. Google's withdrawal from the Chinese market in 2010 was a representative example of the former means where a leading multinational company threatened the Chinese government for a policy change under the instructions of some Western countries.²²⁹ Additionally, the Chinese government has been alarmed by soft law norms applicable in peacetime that are proposed by some Western countries, such as relevant code of conduct on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace at the 2016-2017 UN GGE meetings. Such non-binding norms are intended to circumvent the advocacy of Russia and China to formulate new rules to regulate State behaviour regarding cybersecurity in the form of a treaty at the forum of the UN and may gradually harden into binding law.²³⁰\n102. This argument likely explains why Cuba, Russia and China refused to explicitly affirm the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law in the cyber context in the 2017 UN GGE report, while having accepted the general applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace since the publication of the 2015 UN GGE consensus report. The crucial factor that prevented these States from reaching a consensus with the Western countries was the opposing camp's intention to introduce \"clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States' use of ICTs\"²³¹ in the UN GGE report, which threatened to restrict States' right to regulate the content of and access to information. The UN GGE report is a non-binding statement, but it may serve as proof of State practice and *opinio juris* in ascertaining whether certain international law applies to a participating State signing onto the consensus report and the extent to which the included law limits the endorsing State's right to regulate domestic affairs. Although these countries have recognized the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict upon the adoption of the final UN GGE report, residual disagreements over how specific LOAC rules apply to ICT-related activities remain prominent between them and the Western countries.\n²²⁹ HUANG, above n.227, 34.\n²³⁰ HUANG Zhixiong, Norms of Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace: Origin, Impact and Response, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 68-69.\n²³¹ Korzak, above n.70.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n103. The law governing the right to self-defence and means and methods of warfare is dominated by the practice of remarkably few established powers because the major ground of resorting to anticipatory self-defence and a large portion of LOAC is customary international law, which has been developed by these “specially affected” States to advance their interests.²³² For newly rising powers such as China, failing to meet the requirements of “persistent objector” before and after the birth of a rule at concern would not relieve their obligation to comply. A successful example where a contrary practice of a large number of weaker States makes a few powerful States switch from an established rule of customary international law to an emerging new rule is rare.²³³ It is extremely difficult for a militarily disadvantaged State that lacks field experience to replicate such a strategy in areas involving force.\n104. To prevent coercive erosions of its sovereignty, China’s strategy is to embed a firewall at the most representative and democratic lawmaking forum to obstruct the convenient transplantation of power disparity from the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to the special regimes of international law that constitute cornerstones of an evolving global system of Internet governance. A treaty negotiated at a more egalitarian forum such as the UNGA would enable the Chinese perspectives to carry greater weight in forming international law among a large number of similarly disadvantaged countries. And lawmaking in the form of treaty allows a less advanced State such as China to pick and choose elastically from treaties and their provisions according to its goals.\nV. Conclusion\n105. To summarize, the above analyses suggest that behind China’s general and vague opposition to an explicit affirmation of the applicability of specific LOAC rules to cyberspace and the right of self-defence in cyberspace is China’s profound concern that doing so would acquiesce to the encroachment of its sovereignty and unlock Pandora’s box of coercive external interferences with its independence in determining the mode of domestic Internet governance and the path of development.\n106. Has China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and digital economy driven it to pursue a more proactive and enterprising approach to reshaping international law governing the domain of cyber\n²³² Alan Boyle &amp; Christine Chinkin, The Making of International Law (2007), 28-29.\n²³³ Ibid., 29.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 311\nwarfare so as to build up a competitive advantage against the established powers? At first glance, Beijing's long-term resistance to confirming the applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace before the adoption of the final UN GGE report, amid the exaggerated normative rivalry between the Russia-China Camp and the US-EU Camp, appeared to corroborate this argument. However, closer scrutiny reveals that, the conceptual generalization and ambiguity in China's resisting stance stems from the same premises underpinning the mainstream \"wait and see\" approach of most States towards utilizing international law as the primary means to regulate or justify their cyberoperations. Following the \"wait and see\" trend of State practice, China has agreed to the general applicability of the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello*, and law on State responsibility for international wrongful acts, but still resists the applicability of some specific rules in cyberspace, e.g., the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules, to allow for flexibility in responding to cyber technology development in attribution and the evolvement of international law.\n107. Despite the recent developments in its cyber defensive capacity, China remains disadvantaged as a rising power with weaker military capacity and less normative influence. China's normative proposals, exemplified by the ICCIS, serves more as bargaining leverage to protect itself from being bound by the existing or emerging law supported by the established powers, but unfavourable to itself, and also to move the focus of international legal discourse from the paradigm of military responses to cyberattacks concentrated in the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to that of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. China's normative efforts are largely defensive, given that Beijing chooses to prioritize its interests in defending against possible use of force either triggered by an alleged cyberattack or carried out in the means of cyber operations, over its offensive interests in staying less constrained in the use of cyber force.\n108. Because of the special features of how existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* were made, the normative influence of China and its SCO allies is not sufficient, at this moment, to change the practice of the frequent users of force, to come up with a norm promising effective observance by these States, or to veto the formation of new law proposed by these States at concern. The return of sovereign control in cyberspace and the focus shift of international legal discourse result from a set of factors, e.g., the limitations of current technologies and existing law, with the normative efforts of the SCO members having contributed to this global trend.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n109. But these countries can still resist the imposition of non-consensual norms upon themselves in the domain of cyberspace, obstruct the codification of disfavoured norms, and influence how other States characterize and respond to a situation involving cyber operations. This is why the seemingly unfeasible idea of an international cyber disarmament treaty concluded under the framework of the UN remains on the table. The UNSC's monopoly of authorizing the use of force and the UNGA's feature as one of the most egalitarian forums for international lawmaking make the UN the favourable forum relied on by rising powers such as China to build resilience against other lawmaking processes where established powers play a greater role, e.g., the development of customary international law or soft law in less representative forums."

All rights reserved.\ndoi:10.1093/chinesejil/jmab022 # Decoding China’s Perspectives on Cyber Warfare Chaoyi Jiang* ## Abstract This article examines China’s concerns over the adequacy of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to address cyber warfare, particularly the rules on cyberattacks governed by the *jus in bello*, dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities, the proportionality of cyberattacks against key infrastructures and the targetability of certain categories of civilians. This article argues that China’s resistance to applying some rules of the *jus in bello* to cyberspace is in line with the “wait and see” approach of most States. But there are two distinctive objectives behind this generalized stance: one is to protect its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace from being bound by disfavoured emerging and existing law, and the other is to build up consensus for a treaty regulating uses of cyber force under the United Nations framework.\n## I.

To what extent and how the rise of a new great power will influence international law largely hinges upon the interaction between the rising power and the established powers that have dominated international legal discourse for centuries. The perspectives of China and the established powers differ substantially on many issues, especially those relating to sovereign equality, non-intervention and national security. This can be exemplified by China's perspectives on many issues of cyber warfare in the normative rivalry between the United States (US)-European Union (EU) Camp and the Russia-China Camp, which are competing to influence the making of international law, as well as other countries' domestic policies.² Reinterpreting the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and Military Intervention for Humanitarian Purposes, 6 Asian JIL (2016), 114.\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 259 to regulate the content of and access to information.⁵ The US-EU Camp strives to maintain the currently dominant multi-stakeholder model governed by diverse stakeholders, including governments, technical communities, the private sector and other civil society members.⁶ It does not accept the ICCIS, especially the domestic regulation on freedom of expression and association⁷ and the move towards greater sovereign control in cyberspace.⁸ ⁵ ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(a), (c), (d), (f).\n⁶ US Office of the Secretary of Defense, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2013, 37 (https://fas.org/man/eprint/dod-china-2013.pdf); European Parliament Resolution of 22 November 2012 on the Forthcoming WCIT-12 of the International Telecommunications Union, and the Possible Expansion of the Scope of International Telecommunication Regulations, P7_TA(2012)0451 (22 November 2012), para.5 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52012IP0451).\n⁷ US Department of State, International Cyberspace Policy Strategy (per Public Law 114-113, Division N, Title IV, Section 402), 16-18 (https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/255732.pdf).\n⁸ Ibid.\n⁹ As noted in: Adam Segal, Chinese Cyber Diplomacy in a New Era of Uncertainty, Aegis Paper Series No. 1703, Hoover Institution (2017), 5-6 (www.lawfareblog.com/chinese-cyber-diplomacy-new-era-uncertainty-0).\nChinese JIL (2021) of State, that criticized China for limiting the freedom to access the Internet and conducting online censorship.

One proposal explicitly called on all countries to work together to “contain the abuse of information technology, oppose cyber surveillance and cyberattacks and reject arms race in cyberspace” and “push for the formulation of international cyberspace rules accepted by all parties as well as an international convention against terrorism in cyberspace, improve the legal assistance mechanism to fight cybercrimes and jointly uphold peace and security in cyberspace”.¹⁴ ¹⁴ Remarks by H.E.

Special attention is paid to legal controversies over the rules on cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities, the proportionality of cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and the targetability of certain categories of civilians. Part IV examines the rationales behind China's generalized normative proposal and its vague refusal to confirm the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello, while having recognized the general applicability of these two regimes to cyberspace. The last part concludes with a tentative assessment of the nature and the degree of China's normative influence over international lawmaking governing State behaviour in cyberspace and the possible momentum of China's policy in the future.\n## II. China's general stance on applicable law governing cyber warfare ## II.A. China's sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance ¹⁷ Statement by Ambassador FU Cong in the Assembly Meeting of the UN Conference on Disarmament on International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (9 March 2017) (www.china-un.ch/eng/hom/t1444602.htm); also MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration, International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (1 March 2017) (www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zzjg_663340/jks_665232/kjlc_665236/qtwt_665250/t1442390.shtml) [hereinafter “ISCC”].\n¹⁸ Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General (2 March 2017) (www.un.org/press/en/2017/db170302.doc.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 263 affairs. The second is to shape the current global Internet governance and promote the formation of a system of international legal norms in China's favour. The third objective is to convert China's increasing cyber capacity into soft power to mobilize and influence other countries' preferences.¹⁹ Chapter II lays out the three elements of China's proposed idea of cyber sovereignty—regulatory authority, non-interference and sovereign equality, and the security-oriented balanced approach.²⁰ Chinese JIL (2021)\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 265\n\nChinese JIL (2021) on merits in the consensus-driven dialogues,³⁸ “all decision making authority rests solely and exclusively in the hands of a Board of Directors.”³⁹ Moreover, the Board governs the DNS through private contracts with domain name registrars and registries. The critical details and implementations of these contracts are negotiated bilaterally between ICANN and the registrars/registries, largely beyond the influence of general policies developed in the bottom-up representative processes.⁴⁰ To summarize, ICANN seems to employ open participation as a substitute for other missing and more effective accountability mechanisms.⁴¹\n\n## II.B. International normative discourses\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 267 international law, including the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello* and relevant rules concerning State responsibility for international wrongful acts apply to cyberspace, and that the existing international legal framework is adequate to accommodate novel situations in the information age.⁴⁵ ⁴⁵ The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World, 9 (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf); also Brian J.

These comprehensive and issue-specific normative initiatives unfold the usage of issue linkage under China's overall scheme of the legal framework governing cyberspace, under which the issues of the development and use of the Internet, cyber and data security, cybercrimes, cyber governance and cyber warfare that transcend different fields of international law are simultaneously placed on the agenda of international lawmaking to keep this bundle of issues at the frontline.\n\nChinese JIL (2021) noticeable landmark is an agreement reached by the US and China in 2015 over mutual refrain from knowingly conducting or supporting cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property and further efforts in identifying and promoting appropriate norms of State behaviour in cyberspace.57 The first US-China Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialogue in 2017 once signalled a possibility for greater cooperation.58 However, since 2018, the deterioration of these countries' bilateral relations has stagnated confidence-building measures towards further coordination and cooperation.\n\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 271\"noted the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter\", which arguably encompasses the right to self-defence according to most Western countries.^[63]^ ^[63]^ Ibid., para.28(c).\n^[64]^ As noted in: John Markoff and Andrew E.

While the ISCC discourages militarization of cyberspace, China plans to enhance its “defense capability in cyberspace” and “expedite the development of a cyber force” with the aim to “prevent a major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security and maintain national security and social stability”.69 Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 273 the dissemination of false and distorted news, which can be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of other States or as being harmful to the promotion of peace, cooperation and friendly relations among States and nations”.73 The US criticized this resolution’s language borrowed from a controversial 1981 UNGA resolution that declares the duty of a State to “abstain from any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other States”.74 Meanwhile, Russia positioned itself as an advocate for democracy for all UN Member States, given the exclusive club nature of the UN GGE.75 Chinese JIL (2021) accepted the applicability of LOAC to cyberspace during an armed conflict while leaving controversial issues of how specific LOAC rules apply to the use of ICTs for further discussions, such as whether cyber-only exchanges can trigger an armed conflict, the scope of cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, the targetability of certain objects in the ICT context, etc.\n## II.C.

He argued that the viewpoints of some States and scholars reflected in the Tallinn Manual illustrate the “military paradigm” of “response to cyberattacks that disregards the principle of non-use of force in international law but over-emphasizes such exceptions as the right to self-defence”, which “clearly does not conform to the international reality and actual needs”.⁸² ⁸¹ Ibid., para.24.\n⁸² Ibid., paras.20, 23.\n⁸³ MA, above n.47.\n⁸⁴ See, e.g., Zhong Sheng, The United States Bears Primary Responsibility for Halting Cyber War, People’s Daily (7 February 2013) (http://cpc.people.com.cn/pinglun/n/2013/0207/c78779-20456593.html).\n⁸⁵ LI Ying, The NATO to Find Legal Basis for Manipulation of Cyberspace, Liberation Army Daily (24 October 2014) (www.chinanews.com/mil/2014/10-24/6712323.shtml).\nChinese JIL (2021) ⁸⁶ See, e.g., LI Yi, Chinese Internet, Please Keep the “Root”, Beijing Daily (24 January 2014) (http://news.sina.com.cn/pl/2014-01-22/015929310615.shtml).\n⁸⁷ LIANG, above n.30.\n⁸⁸ Xinhua, China Greenlights Establishment of Root Server, China.org.cn (8 December 2019) (http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/201912/08/content_WS5dec361ec6d0bcf8c4c1882d.html); Xinhua, China Steps up Deploying IPv6-based Network, China.org.cn (3 May 2019) (www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/03/c_138031821.htm).\n⁸⁹ See, e.g., DING Libai &amp; ZHU Jing, Tallinn Manual Defines and Reflects on Cyber Attack “Force”, 36 Hebei Faxue [Hebei L Sci] (2018), 84; HUANG Zhixiong, Application of International Law in Cyberspace: Establishing Rules of the Game, 38 Huanqiu Falv Pinglun [Global LR] (2016), 13; HUANG Zhixiong, International Legal Issues concerning “Cyber Warfare” and Strategies for China: Focusing on the Field of Jus ad Bellum, 37 Xiandai Faxue [Modern L Sci] (2015), 154; CHEN Qi, Cybersecurity, Cyber War and International Law: From the Perspective of Tallinn Manual, 7 Zhengzhi yu Falv [P Sci L] (2014), 153-56; XU Yijie, Watch Out for the “Tallinn Manual” Used by the NATO to Make “Rules of Cyber War”, 10 Zhongguo Dangzheng Ganbu Luntan [Chinese Cadres Tribune] (2013), 98-99.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 277 Manual independent International Group of Experts.⁹⁰ Critiques of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual concentrate on its *jus ad bellum* part, particularly section 2, “the use of force”. Specifically, many scholars consider that the Tallinn Manual’s threshold on what cyber operations constitute the use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is too low. In their view, the majority of the selected International Group of Experts, who are supporters of Michael Schmitt’s “scale and effects” approach,⁹¹ artificially create some situations that have never taken place to prove that cyberattacks can result in analogous scale and effects of kinetic and non-kinetic forces. A direct transplantation of existing *jus ad bellum* to cyberspace arguably goes beyond the current practice of most States.⁹² Another major concern of Chinese scholars is that, rather than regulating the means and methods of cyber warfare, the sponsors of the Tallinn Manual intend to seek legal bases to initiate cyber or even kinetic wars. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual extensively interprets a country’s right of self-defence against non-State actors and anticipatory self-defence against an imminent threat of cyber operations. They hence argue for a higher bar than the Tallinn Manual requirements for invoking the right of self-defence within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter.⁹³ ⁹⁰ See, e.g., JIANG Yamin, Cyber Great Power Needs to Pay Attention to International Cybersecurity Strategies, People.com, (19 March 2015) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2015/0319/c386965-26716864.html).\n⁹¹ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 11.\n⁹² See, e.g., above n.89, DING &amp; ZHU, 85-86; HUANG (2016), 10-11; HUANG (2015), 150; CHEN, 154.\n⁹³ See, e.g., above n.89, HUANG (2016), 8-9; HUANG (2015), 152; CHEN, 154-55.\n⁹⁴ See, e.g., LI Bojun, Cyber War and the Applicability of the Law of Armed Conflict, 31 Faxue Pinglun [LR] (2013), 62-63; WANG Kongxiang, Legal Questions and Regulation of Civilian Participation in Cyber War, 5 Fazhi Yanjiu [Research on Rule of L] (2013), 100-09; CHEN, above n.89, 158; CAI Lihong, Challenges to the Principle of Distinction by Information Attacks and Strategies, 24 Xian Zhengzhi Xueyuan Xuebao [J Xi’an P Inst PLA] (2011), 95-96.\nChinese JIL (2021) First, the existence of an armed conflict permits the use of lethal force based solely on the status of an individual or object. Some Chinese scholars argue that cyberattacks, in light of the latest level of technology, are not controllable so as to constrain their effects within the boundaries of military objects and therefore indiscriminate in nature.95 The 2007 nation-wide denial-of-service attacks sweeping over Estonian Internet infrastructure, including the websites and systems of its Parliament, banks, ministries and media, was cited as a typical example of indiscriminate cyberattack,96 although whether there was an armed conflict and whether such activities amounted to attacks within the meaning of LOAC is disputable. Given such practical difficulties in applying the principle of “distinction” in cyberwar, some scholars suspect the application of LOAC will open a gate for illegitimate cyber and kinetic attacks leading to humanitarian disasters.97 For example, despite its title—“Duty of care during attacks on dams, dykes, and nuclear electrical generating stations”, Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, along with the US policy that categorizes enemy “war-sustaining” objects as lawful targets, is framed as a disguised affirmation of the legitimacy of attacks on critical, yet highly dangerous infrastructures.98 The Internet was originally designed in a way capable of being immediately transformed from war-supporting civil facilities to war-fighting objects, making the majority of its components dual-use objects. Overwhelming reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure would dramatically expand the scope of targetable objects under LOAC. Accordingly, recognizing the applicability of the LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks in cyberspace would be tantamount to authorizing attacks against critical dual-use infrastructures, rendering mass civilians vulnerable to the adverse impacts of not only cyberattacks but also kinetic ones.\nSecond, since the civilian aspect of dual-use cyber infrastructures is relevant only to the attack requirements for proportionality and precaution, the “proportionality” of attacks against objects highly dependent upon Internet or computer control systems is another worrying issue. One scholar quotes John Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 279 Hamre, former US Deputy Defense Secretary, who is skeptical about the feasibility of using cyber operations to achieve the designated military objectives, to demonstrate the unexpected collateral damages caused by cyberattacks.⁹⁹ This scholar also considers the current rule of the proportionality of attacks, which factors “the incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damages to civilian objects, or a combination thereof” into assessing whether such collateral damages would be excessive in relation to “the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”,¹⁰⁰ as inadequate protection of civilian interests and suggests adding “knock-on effects” into consideration.¹⁰¹ Third, the distinction between civilian noncombatants and civilians who directly participate in hostilities used to be not an appealing question for Chinese scholars, not only because the Chinese military does not have a tradition of employing civilian contractors, but also because China has not sent its troops to the battlefield for more than thirty years. To reduce costs and obtain technical expertise, the increasing usage of civilians to operate cyberattacks, maintain information weapons, or support cyber combat operations by States has further eroded the distinction between combatants and civilians.¹⁰² It is reasonable for the Chinese military, government and some State-owned-enterprise to recruit civilians for activities related to cyber warfare. Although the law that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities or who adopts a continuous combat function may be lawfully attacked is not in dispute, the targetability of a civilian who assists with cyber operations depends on the answers to two questions: which people are targetable and when they may be targeted. Some Chinese scholars argue that, due to the technical predicament of identity verification and attribution, the applicable LOAC rules fail to provide certainty and predictability for the determination of individual status.¹⁰³ Fourth, another issue closely related to China’s opposition to applying some LOAC rules to cyberspace, namely, what acts may constitute a resort to ⁹⁹ Ibid., CAI, 96, quoting from Is it Real? Is it Hype?, Interview with John Hamre, PBS Frontline (18 February 2003) (www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cyberwar/interviews/hamre.html).\n¹⁰⁰ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 1125 UNTS 3, Art. 57(2)(a)(iii) and 57(2)(b) [hereinafter “Additional Protocol I”].\n¹⁰¹ CAI, above n.94, 96.\n¹⁰² Susan Brenner, Cyber Threats: The Emerging Fault Lines of the Nation State (2009), 197.\n¹⁰³ See, e.g., LI, above n.94, 62; WANG, above n.94, 103-09.\nChinese JIL (2021) armed force that triggers the application of LOAC, is hinted by the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (“SCO Agreement”). It is a separate question under the jus in bello, without prejudice to the question of “use of force” within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Annex 1 to this Agreement defines “information war” as: confrontation between two or more states in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes and resources, critical and other structures, undermining political, economic and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to taking decisions in the interest of an opposing party[.].¹⁰⁴ Although it remains unsettled whether and when an armed conflict, international or non-international, can commence based on a single cyber exchange, the SCO Agreement’s definition of war clearly expands the traditional meaning of armed conflict caused by conventional force under LOAC. Assuming that the term “war” in Annex 1 is not utilized as rhetoric, but rather as the reference of “armed conflict” within the meaning of LOAC, we may tentatively argue that the SCO members consider the existing LOAC’s scope of regulation as underinclusive because it fails to include the cyber actions that can generate political, economic, social and even psychological consequences into the realm of LOAC.\n## III. Examining China’s perspectives on specific rules of LOAC ¹⁰⁴ Annex 1 to the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security (16 June 2009), List of Basic Terms in the Field of International Information Security (http://cn.io.gov.mo/Legis/International/record/1280.aspx) (Chinese only) and (https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/SCO-090616-IISAgreement.pdf) (non-official English translation).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 281 ## III.A. Cyberattacks regulated by LOAC --- ¹⁰⁵ Prosecutor v. Tadić, ICTY Appeals Chamber, Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction (2 October 1995), Case No. IT-94-1-A, para.70.\n¹⁰⁶ Michael Schmitt, “Attack” as a Term of Art in International Law: The Cyber Operations Context, in: Christine Czosseck, Rain Ottis &amp; Katharina Ziolkowski (eds.), Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (2012), 284.\n¹⁰⁷ Cordula Droege, Get off My Cloud: Cyber Warfare, International Humanitarian Law, and the Protection of Civilians, 94 IR Red Cross (2012), 545.\nChinese JIL (2021) Conventions defines “attack” within the meaning of LOAC as “acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence”.¹⁰⁸ By concentrating on the term “violence”, Article 49(1) provides a feasible way to access cyberattacks by analogy to the physical violent effects caused by kinetic attacks. The threshold concept of “attack” is selected in light of LOAC’s object and purpose, since only acts that qualify as attacks would be subject to many of its core prohibitions and restrictions. Only qualified attacks would trigger a wide range of legal protections for the civilian population and objects under LOAC. In most cases, an unqualified act beyond the realm of LOAC would fall under the domain of domestic and international human rights law. So far, there appears to be a consensus that as long as a cyber operation attributable to a State has the equivalent effects of kinetic forces, such as death, physical injury to persons, or damages to objects, it would trigger an international armed conflict.¹⁰⁹ Similarly, Rule 30 of the Tallinn Manual suggests that the “armed force” criterion is fulfilled when a cyber operation is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to person or damage or destruction to objects.¹¹⁰ A majority of the independent experts participating in the Tallinn Manual project favour including “loss of functionality” in the definition of damages, although there are various shades of opinions among them.¹¹¹ Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 283 necessarily resemble the physical effects of traditional weapons\".¹¹³ Given adequate consideration to the object and purpose of LOAC and the concerns of a gap in protection, especially the protection of civilians from the effects of war, that paper seems to endorse the\"loss of functionality\"approach adopted by the majority view of the Tallinn Manual. Based on this approach, whether a cyber operation amounts to an attack depends on whether it causes the target to lose function, even if the target is not physically damaged.¹¹⁴ ¹¹³ Droege, above n.107, 546.\n¹¹⁴ Ibid., 546-47.\n¹¹⁵ Ibid.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid., 549.\n¹¹⁷ Schmitt, above n.106, 291.\nChinese JIL (2021) ¹¹⁸ Michael Bothe, Karl Josef Partsch &amp; Waldemar A.

This feature of information weapons makes them not a proper subject matter for a total (or partial) ban. By their features and consequences, unqualified cyberattacks are more suitable to be regulated by regimes other than LOAC for the time being. As demonstrated by the final UN GGE report, leading SCO members, including China, Russia, and Kazakhstan, no longer dispute the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict, although controversies over, for example, the qualification of single cyber exchange as attacks under the meaning of LOAC, remain unsettled. Hence, the SCO members may continue to advance the broad interpretation of “attack” to build up consensus for new norms while resisting the application of the existing LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks.\n## III.B.

Unless there is a breakthrough in law, attacks against major cyber infrastructure would remain subject to the legal safeguards for civilian protection embodied in the principles of proportionality and precaution.

For civilian computer operators working in closed military facilities, Chinese JIL (2021) their targetability would not expire after work but become a portable threat travelling with them and making their family members and neighbours legitimate collateral damage.

To what extent and how the rise of a new great power will influence international law largely hinges upon the interaction between the rising power and the established powers that have dominated international legal discourse for centuries. The perspectives of China and the established powers differ substantially on many issues, especially those relating to sovereign equality, non-intervention and national security. This can be exemplified by China's perspectives on many issues of cyber warfare in the normative rivalry between the United States (US)-European Union (EU) Camp and the Russia-China Camp, which are competing to influence the making of international law, as well as other countries' domestic policies.²\n2. Through the International Code of Conduct for Information Security (ICCIS) first submitted to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2011³ and joint efforts in other forums such as the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT),⁴ the Russia-China Camp has advanced a sovereignty-based model of Internet governance, which respects cyberspace sovereignty and State independence and legitimizes domestic efforts\nReinterpreting the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and Military Intervention for Humanitarian Purposes, 6 Asian JIL (2016), 114.\n2 See, e.g., Kristen E.

The Russian proposal was adopted as a separate resolution attached to the revised treaty text. See Russian Federation, Proposals for the Work of the Conference, Revision 1 to Document 27-E, Proposed Art. 3A.2 (17 November 2012) (www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000188224.pdf); also International Telecommunication Union, Final Acts of the WCIT (Dubai, 2012), art. 1.1(a) (www.itu.int/en/wcit-12/Documents/final-acts-wcit-12.pdf).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 259\nto regulate the content of and access to information.⁵ The US-EU Camp strives to maintain the currently dominant multi-stakeholder model governed by diverse stakeholders, including governments, technical communities, the private sector and other civil society members.⁶ It does not accept the ICCIS, especially the domestic regulation on freedom of expression and association⁷ and the move towards greater sovereign control in cyberspace.⁸\n3. Notably, China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and the digital economy, especially following the 2008 global financial crisis, did not initially bolster its assertiveness in the international lawmaking procedures that seek to identify existing law or generate new law applicable to State behaviour in cyberspace. China was a low-key participant at the early stages of the UN Group of Government Experts on the Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of Security (“UN GGE”). Its behaviour was found to be passive and frequently concurring with Russia’s stance. The Chinese representatives attending earlier UN GGE meetings were technical officers from the Ministry of Communication rather than diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign affairs (MOFA).⁹ But later, China proved to be willing to act more actively and assertively when it was singled out and its fundamental domestic interests were threatened by the disfavoured norms proposed by the established powers.\n4. In reaction to these Western normative attempts, China has transformed from a low-profile, passive team player under the Russian leadership to a proactive actor that had formed its own agenda. China’s active pattern of behaviour was prompted by a 2010 speech by Hillary Clinton, former US Secretary\n⁵ ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(a), (c), (d), (f).\n⁶ US Office of the Secretary of Defense, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2013 (May 2013), 37 (https://fas.org/man/eprint/dod-china-2013.pdf); European Parliament Resolution of 22 November 2012 on the Forthcoming WCIT-12 of the International Telecommunications Union, and the Possible Expansion of the Scope of International Telecommunication Regulations, P7_TA(2012)0451 (22 November 2012), para.5 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52012IP0451).\n⁷ US Department of State, International Cyberspace Policy Strategy (March 2016) (per Public Law 114-113, Division N, Title IV, Section 402), 16-18 (https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/255732.pdf).\n⁸ Ibid.\n⁹ As noted in: Adam Segal, Chinese Cyber Diplomacy in a New Era of Uncertainty, Aegis Paper Series No. 1703, Hoover Institution (2017), 5-6 (www.lawfareblog.com/chinese-cyber-diplomacy-new-era-uncertainty-0).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nof State, that criticized China for limiting the freedom to access the Internet and conducting online censorship. Higher-level officials from the MOFA with expertise in cyber governance started to represent China in diplomatic activities.¹⁰ The ICCIS was developed to counter-balance the diplomatic momentum generated by a series of US activities, including Clinton’s speeches on freedom in cyberspace between 2010-2012, the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the 2011 Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace. Beijing viewed these activities as attempting to militarize cyberspace and maintain the dominance of the US in cyber governance by interfering in other States’ sovereign right to regulate cyberspace.¹¹\n5. In 2011, the first edition of the ICCIS was submitted two months before the London Conference, a United Kingdom (UK)-sponsored attempt in line with those of the US and their allies. The ICCIS called on States “not to use information and communications technologies (ICTs), including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies”, called for “peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security”, and emphasized “the important role of the UN in formulating international norms”.¹² An updated edition of the ICCIS with similar wording was circulated at the UNGA in 2015,¹³ possibly intended to gather wider support in the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures that harmed the US’s credibility in its continuous diplomatic attempts.\n6. The second World Internet Conference in 2015 marked the emergence of China’s own vision of global Internet governance that advocates both respect for sovereignty in cyberspace and international cooperation to “jointly build a community of shared future in cyberspace”. Chinese President XI Jinping highlighted the problems of the current global Internet governance system, including, among other things, the inadequate existing rules governing cyberspace that hardly reflect the perspectives of the majority of countries,\n¹⁰ As noted in ibid., 6.\n¹¹ Ibid., 4-5, 7.\n¹² ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(b), (j).\n¹³ International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the Letter dated 9 January 2015 from the Permanent Representatives of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russia Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations Addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

One proposal explicitly called on all countries to work together to “contain the abuse of information technology, oppose cyber surveillance and cyberattacks and reject arms race in cyberspace” and “push for the formulation of international cyberspace rules accepted by all parties as well as an international convention against terrorism in cyberspace, improve the legal assistance mechanism to fight cybercrimes and jointly uphold peace and security in cyberspace”.¹⁴\n7. The vision of “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” was further elaborated by the Organizing Committee of the World Internet Conference in 2019. It urged countries to oppose hostile activities, acts of aggression, cyberattacks, large-scale surveillance operations, unfounded accusations of cyberattacks against other countries and attempts to politicize cybersecurity issues; prevent arms race and military conflict in cyberspace; and remain committed to resolving disputes by peaceful means.¹⁵ In 2020, the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace was released amid the COVID-19 pandemic that underpinned the urgency of “achieving shared development, ensuring common security, realizing joint governance, and enjoying benefits”. This document emphasized the need to “exert the roles of the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) and the UN GGE, and support formulating codes, norms and principles of responsible State conduct in cyberspace that are acceptable to all parties under the UN framework”.¹⁶\n8. To assess the implications of China’s rise for the evolution of international law governing the use of force by States in cyberspace, this paper studies the normative initiatives and strategies employed by China in identifying rules of existing law and creating new law applicable to cyber warfare. In light of China’s sovereignty-centric approach to cyber governance, Part II introduces the general stance of China on the adequacy of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to address cyber warfare.

Special attention is paid to legal controversies over the rules on cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities, the proportionality of cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and the targetability of certain categories of civilians. Part IV examines the rationales behind China's generalized normative proposal and its vague refusal to confirm the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello, while having recognized the general applicability of these two regimes to cyberspace. The last part concludes with a tentative assessment of the nature and the degree of China's normative influence over international lawmaking governing State behaviour in cyberspace and the possible momentum of China's policy in the future.\n\n---\n\n## __postscript__\n\n76. Based on its limited number of available official statements and practices, China’s opposition to the applicability of some LOAC rules in cyberspace remains vague and general from a legal perspective. The SCO Agreement’s expansive version of cyber “war” indicates that China’s earlier position did not distinguish armed conflicts from other situations, although the application of LOAC hinges on such a differentiation. Apart from the catchall interpretation of cyberattacks, many Chinese scholars expressed concerns over the adequacy of the LOAC rules governing the targetability of dual-use infrastructure and certain groups of civilians and the principle of proportionality. These concerns are not groundless both in terms of law and practice. In fact, the ICRC’s views on the three issues, or even some corresponding rules of the Tallinn Manual, address their concerns well. The practice of the US and its allies that China opposes has not hardened into customary international law binding on all\n^^ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering: A Historical Analogy, Cyber Studies Programme Working Paper No. 1 (March 2015), 3-6, 9 (www.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/cybersecurity-and-the-age-of-privateering-a-historical-analogy.html).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nStates that fail to maintain persistent objection to it. These facts have contributed to China's incremental acceptance of the general applicability of LOAC to the cyber context despite many remaining controversies over how specific LOAC rules should be interpreted and applied to cyber operations.\n77. As with China's concerns over the Tallinn Manual's overemphasis on the military paradigm of responses to cyberattacks in international legal discourse, which threatens to derogate from the principle of non-use of force and to abuse the right to self-defence, a more diverse group of experts was composed to draft the second version of the Tallinn Manual, to address the criticisms of the limited diversity of the group of experts participating in drafting the first version of the Tallinn Manual and this group's overreliance on Western legal sources. There were three non-Western experts from China, Belarus and Thailand, among the nine experts who participated in the formulation process of Tallinn Manual 2.0. The scope of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 expands from \"above the threshold\" cyber operations whose \"scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force\" or which are \"executed in the context of an armed conflict that [is] subject to the LOAC\" to \"below the threshold\" cyber operations that take place in peacetime and fall outside the regulatory scope of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello.\n78. The threshold of use of force functions as a firewall that separates cyber operations which can trigger the exercise of the right to self-defence by a victim State from cyber operations that can entail only pacific countermeasures. As previously mentioned, a major concern of China points to the Tallinn Manual's threshold on which cyber operations constitute use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. The Chinese perspective considers it as a low standard intended to accommodate some States' strategic\n184 Dieter Fleck, Searching for International Rules Applicable to Cyber Warfare—A Critical First Assessment of the New Tallinn Manual, 18 JCSL (2013), 335; Ido Kilovaty, Cyber Warfare and the Jus ad Bellum Challenge: Evaluation in the Light of the Tallinn Manual on International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, 5 Am U Nat'l S L Brief (2014), 108.\n185 Kirsten E.

Rule 69 and Rule 71 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were drafted by the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual and incorporated in the second version without being discussed by the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Rule 69 stipulates the “scale and effects” approach.¹⁸⁹ Rule 71 provides that only “a State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence”.¹⁹⁰ The International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual reached a consensus that the scale of effects of cyber operations causing physical consequences can be considered as comparable to those of kinetic operations and hence the use of force under the *jus ad bellum*.¹⁹¹ But they contested over the status of cyber operations that have no consequences in the physical world but can lead to serious consequences.¹⁹²\n80. Some Western scholars identified the failure of Rule 69 to include cyber operations having no physical consequences but can cause temporary suspension of operational functionality,¹⁹³ result in alteration and destruction of data or code,¹⁹⁴ or involve “psychological operation” and “cyber espionage”,¹⁹⁵ as a major shortcoming of the Tallinn Rules.¹⁹⁶ Accordingly, they considered the definition of “use of force” adopted by the Tallinn Rules\n189 Ibid.\n190 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, Rule 71, 339.\n191 See, e.g., Ido Kilovaty, Virtual Violence-Disruptive Cyberspace Operations as “Attacks” Under International Humanitarian Law, 23 Michigan Telecomm &amp; Tech LR (2016), 145-46.\n192 See above n.184, Fleck, 336-37; Kilovaty, 116.\n193 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, 21; Michael N.

Consequently, the victim State’s response in most cases would be limited to measures falling below the threshold of use of force, such as countermeasures²⁰¹ or referring the matter to the UNSC.²⁰² By far, the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Rules have identified only the Stuxnet attack as meeting the Tallinn threshold of use of force; some experts considered it as meeting the higher “scale and effects” threshold of an armed attack that can trigger the application of LOAC.²⁰³ Even American military lawyers and scholars, who are deemed by their Chinese counterparts as seeking to militarize cyberspace through lowering the threshold of use of force, have admitted that, “the prevailing view is that most, if not all, documented cyber actions taken by States to date have fallen below the ‘use of force’ threshold.”²⁰⁴ Apart from the narrowly construed right to self-defence in situations of armed conflicts, Rule 20 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides a broader right of States to take countermeasures in time of peace, “whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal\n197 Ibid.\n198 Ibid., 591.\n199 Above n.21, Tallinn Manual, Rule 15; Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 73.\n200 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, 351-53; Eichensehr, above n.185, 587.\n201 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, Rule 20, 161.\n202 Ibid., Rule 76, 357.\n203 Ibid., 342.\n204 Gary Corn &amp; Eric Jensen, The Technicolor Zone of Cyberspace–Part I, Just Security (30 May 2018) (www.justsecurity.org/57217/technicolor-zone-cyberspace-part/).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 301\nobligation that is owned by another State”.²⁰⁵ Nevertheless, the exercise of this right by States is subject to similar difficulties in attribution, in addition to a set of conditions, including notification, proportionality,²⁰⁶ and the exclusion of measures amounting to uses of force.\n82. The narrow construction of the right to self-defence and countermeasures under the Tallinn Rules demonstrates the reluctance of the International Group of Experts to permissibly authorize a State to undertake unilateral acts that would result in effects in the territory of another State, in another word, a strong pro-sovereignty inclination of the Tallinn Rules. In contrast, the US and the UK argued that sovereignty did not by itself constitute a specific rule of international law that cyber operations might violate, but rather a foundational principle of international law that undergirds specific rules of international law, such as the prohibition against the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the rule of non-intervention under customary international law. In these two countries’ view, such a principle has no binding effect, and low-scale cyber operations deployed by a State that generate effects in another State’s territory but do not breach any of these specific rules, do not violate international law merely because of their incompatibility with the abstract principle of sovereignty.²⁰⁷ This controversy over the status of sovereignty remains unsettled in the final UN GGE report mainly due to the UK’s active participation in the UN GGE. Yet NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations released in 2020 has endorsed the status of sovereignty as a rule of international law in a footnote, with the UK as the only NATO member having reserved on that footnote.²⁰⁸\n83. Therefore, although the Tallinn Rules were developed under the auspices of NATO, they represent neither the exceptional perspectives of some States such as the US or the UK nor the collective views of the NATO members. Throughout the Hague Process, during the drafting of the Tallinn Rules, where legal advisors from 50 States were given the opportunity to\n205 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, Rule 38, 111.\n206 Ibid., 120, 127.\n207 As noted in: Michael Schmitt, US Transparency Regarding International Law in Cyberspace, Just Security (15 November 2016) (www.justsecurity.org/34465/transparency-international-law-cyberspace/); also Corn &amp; Jensen, above n.204.\n208 North Atlantic Treaty Organization Allied Joint Publication-3.20, Allied Joint Doctrine For Cyberspace Operations (Edition A Version 1) (29 January 2020), Footnote 26 and GBR’s Reservation (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/899678/doctrine_nato_cyberspace_operations_ajp_3_20_1_.pdf).\nChinese JIL (2021)\nexpress their legal positions to shape the codification process, many States maintained a persistent policy of silence and ambiguity on the specificities of existing or emerging norms regulating cyberspace.²⁰⁹ Meanwhile, the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, together with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, convened two consultative meetings in April 2015 and February 2016 with representatives from more than one hundred States, including China.²¹⁰\n84. The technological difficulties in credibly attributing responsibility for cyber operations, the ongoing controversies over which existing rules apply to cyberspace, their contents, the suitability of the prevailing international legal framework as the primary method to regulate inter-State behaviour in cyberspace, and political and strategic considerations that have prevented States from making public attributions and invoking their rights to take responsive measures, all have contributed to the “wait and see” approach adopted by most States towards utilizing rules and norms of international law, including the Tallinn Rules, to regulate cyber operations.²¹¹ These factors cast doubt over the ripeness of codifying applicable international law in these areas. The limited State practice and opinio juris partly explain China’s “wait and see” stance, which is in line with the mainstream approach in order to preserve a degree of operational flexibility in the face of technological development and the dynamic international environment.²¹²\n85. To summarize, China’s long-term insistence on the non-applicability of the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules to cyberspace does not only conform to the development trend of international normative discourses but also contributes to fuelling this momentum. Sovereign control of cyberspace has been increasingly reviving, and the focus of international legal discourse has shifted from the military paradigm concentrated on the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to the prism of general rules of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. The current landscape of international law identification and development reflects and underpins most concerns of China\n209 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 588.\n210 HUANG, above n.186, 84-85.\n211 Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, above n.196, 584, 588, 633, 639, 648, 653 (2018).\n212 See, e.g., ZHU Lingling, Deduction and Development of State Responsibility Attribution in Cyber Attacks from the Perspective of Tallinn Manual Version 2.0, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 77-78; HUANG Zhixiong, New Trends of International Rule-making for Cyberspace: Some Considerations Based Tallinn Manual 2.0, 1 Xiamen Daxue Xuebao [J Xiamen U] (2018), 5-6.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 303\nand many other like-minded States, while the Tallinn Rules serve as one of the early efforts rather than the concluding remark of ongoing international legal discourses.\n86. However, there are two residual concerns of China not reflected in the mainstream State practice following the publication of the two versions of the Tallinn Manual. They are underscored by the elements of cyber sovereignty proposed by China that call for the prohibition of using ICT, information and communications networks to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression or arms race, and the OEWG resolution's reiteration of the need for introducing additional rules of behaviour regarding States' right to combat interference in their internal affairs through the dissemination of false and distorted news and States' duty to abstain from engaging in such activities. One is external threats posed by more powerful States which may utilize their digital advantages to threaten China's national security and social stability, and the other is external limitations, either from emerging norms of international law or other established powers, of China's exercise of regulatory power over content transmitted in cyberspace to combat such threats.\n87. Therefore, in addition to the mentioned concerns addressed by the mainstream State practice, China has employed its generalized and vague resistance to the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace as bargaining leverage to achieve another two objectives in international legal discourse: (1) to build up consensus for a new treaty regulating all use of cyber forces, or a disarmament treaty banning all or at least some types of information weapons, and (2) to block the formation of new law that would limit its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace and prevent disfavoured existing law from binding on its exercise of sovereign power in cyberspace.\n88. The first objective of China's opposition to an explicit affirmation of the right to self-defence and the applicability of some LOAC rules to the cyber context, namely, to build up consensus for a disarmament treaty on the use of information weapons under the auspice of the UN, emanates from the nature of States' right to self-defence. It is an inherent right reserved for States to\nChinese JIL (2021)\nresort to force by its own decision after the enshrinement of a general prohibition of uses of force in the UN Charter.²¹³\n89. As evidenced by the controversies over anticipatory self-defence in the drafting processes of the Tallinn Rules, diverse concepts and practices regarding the preconditions for the commencement of self-defence and the limitations to the exercise of this right have been invoked and contested by States. Whether Article 51 of the UN Charter allows anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defence before an armed attack occurs has long been a major point of contention. The US, the UK, Israel and some other States have construed Article 51 in a permissible manner by referring to the Caroline doctrine under customary international law, based on which they have often resorted to force. The UNSC has condemned some of such practices; the International Court of Justice took the restrictive view in the judgments of the Corfu Channel case,²¹⁴ the Nicaragua case,²¹⁵ and other decisions afterwards.²¹⁶ The restrictive approach limits States' right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter to situations where an armed attack has already taken place, excluding anticipatory self-defence. From the perspective of the degree of compliance, the effectiveness of the general prohibition of use of force is questionable. But none of these States supporting permissive interpretations dares to bluntly admit the existence of a violation or defy this universally accepted rule, although they always use various factual and legal arguments to justify their breaches.\n90. In the same vein, it is not practically feasible to ensure effective observance of a norm prohibiting use of force in cyberspace, especially by these States that are frequent invokers of anticipatory self-defence. Therefore, what China and other SCO members seek is rather to influence the norm-formulation process at the UN that reflects how the international community of States characterizes a situation or act in question, e.g., as a violation of the proposed norm, and whether most States have a willingness to suppress such dubious acts. In the interim, China has not come up with a clear and concrete stance on how to develop a standard resembling Article 2(4) and Article 51 of the UN Charter in judging the legality and legitimacy of State behaviour concerning use of cyber force. More importantly, concluding new treaties for\n213 UN Charter, 1 UNTS XVI (24 October 1945), Arts. 2(4).\n214 Corfu Channel Case (UK v.

Cyber disarmament is more unrealistic in today's international political environment than the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in light of the recent backlashes against the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons provoked by the Iran and North Korea nuclear crises. All nuclear-weapon States except China, which abstained, voted against a UNGA resolution proposing to convene the first UN conference aimed at achieving a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons.²¹⁷ On 22 January 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first multilateral agreement that bans nuclear weapons, entered into force. Although 85 States have signed and 50 of them have ratified this treaty, the non-participation of all nine States possessing nuclear weapons renders the efficacy of the treaty questionable.²¹⁸ Additionally, as manifested by Cuba's objection to an endorsement of the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, the States that do not enjoy conventional military superiority over their adversaries may have asymmetric advantages in cyberspace, which they are reluctant to give up.²¹⁹ Therefore, a cyber disarmament treaty would lack the support of both major cyber powers and the rest of the weaker cyber-armed States.\n92. In the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures in 2013 and the WikiLeaks disclosures lasting from mid-2016 to date, a rising trend of nationalism has taken place in many countries that used to stand in line with the US-EU camp, such as Brazil and Germany, pushing these countries to start thinking how to defend their \"data sovereignty\". The rise of cybersecurity nationalism has undermined international norm-making efforts, including trade negotiations between the EU and the US and the US attempts to promote norms of Internet freedom globally.²²⁰ There is no reason that cybersecurity discourse would stay intact.\n²¹⁷ Tariq Rauf, 2017: The Year in Which Nuclear Weapons Could be Banned?, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Commentary (20 March 2017) (www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2017/2017-year-which-nuclear-weapons-could-be-banned).\n²¹⁸ See generally, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (22 January 2021) (www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-on-the-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons/).\n²¹⁹ Arun M.

Given the unique features of cyber operations and the Internet, even a treaty in the style of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons would have little practical significance in deterring the abuse and misuse of force in cyberspace. The refrainment of most States, including the US, in most cyber tensions with other States, from resorting to the prevailing international legal framework in dealing with inter-State cyber relations, highlights the limitations of normative approaches in functioning as a general taboo for irresponsible activities in cyberspace by not only State but also private actors.\n94. Compared to conventional and nuclear weapons, the technical barriers to entry in cyber warfare are so low that non-State actors and countries that are conceivably weak by the standards of hard powers can play a significant role on par with powerful countries at low levels of cost. Cyberattacks can be conducted by any actor having an electronic device and connected to the Internet. The interconnectivity of the network enables any actor to stay geographically remote from where they commit cyberattacks. Simultaneously, unlike classic military operations that rely upon territorial linkages, this interconnectivity severely decreases the degree of State control over actors and activities. The life of a treaty, particularly a disarmament treaty, rests in its enforcement. The construction of a credible monitoring and enforcement mechanism would prove to be the utmost hurdle for a cyber disarmament treaty.\n95. Probably having realized the lack of feasibility and political will among States to negotiate a cyber disarmament treaty, China has softened, to some degree, its stance against the alleged militarization of cyberspace. In the most up-to-date white paper on China's military strategy issued in 2015, China plans to \"expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defence [...] so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability\". The ISCC further confirms that \"enhanced defence capability in cyberspace is an important part of China's endeavour to modernize its national defence and armed forces\", while restricting China's development of a cyber force to defensive capability.\n221 State Council Information Office, China's Military Strategy (May 2015), Chapter IV: Building and Development of China's Armed Forces (www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-05/26/content_20820628_4.htm).\n222 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n223 Ibid., Chapter I: Opportunities and Challenges &amp; Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 307\n## IV.B. Sovereign control over the Internet vs non-intervention\n96. The changes in the global context of disarmament and China's position regarding use of force in the cyber context have rendered the proposed second objective of China more salient. The central bone of contention in the normative competitions between the SCO members and the Western powers rests upon whether information and data transmitted in cyberspace shall be made subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State, although both sides have reached a consensus on the applicability of sovereignty as part of international law in cyberspace. At the core of this debate is how to draw the lines between the realms of domestic law and international law as consensual erosion of State sovereignty to be applied equally to all States.\n97. The US holds the view that, although sovereignty gives a State the right to control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory, the exercise of such jurisdiction by the territorial State, encompassing the use and access to the Internet, must comply with that State's obligations under applicable international law, particularly international human rights law. While noting that the freedom of expression may be restricted in situations such as the incitement of imminent terrorist violence, the US considers \"certain censorship and content control, including blocking websites simply because they contain content that criticizes a leader, a government policy, or an ideology, or because the content espouses particular religious beliefs\" as constituting State violations of international human rights law.²²⁴\n98. China likely views this reference to international human rights law as a pretext for Western attempts to conceptually undermine the scope of sovereign powers by narrowing the content of *domaine réservé* in the context of Internet governance. China claims for cyber sovereignty that includes not only cyber infrastructure within its territory but also its jurisdiction over data and the regulation and monitoring of the content of information flowing over cyberspace.²²⁵ Consciously aware that the scope of a State's internal matters and the international legal limitations to that State's exercise of sovereign power over internal matters evolve over time, China has consistently resisted non-reciprocal and non-voluntary restrictions on its exercise of sovereignty.\n²²⁴ Egan, above n.45, 15-17.\n²²⁵ See, e.g., National Security Law of the People's Republic of China (2015), art. 25; XI Jinping, Keynote Speech at the opening ceremony of the 2nd World Internet Conference (16 December 2015) (www.wuzhenwic.org/2015-12/16/c_47521.htm).\nChinese JIL (2021)\n99. From Beijing's perspective, the nature of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as a product formulated under the domination of Western powers was not changed solely by the increased diversity in the composition of the International Group of Experts participating in the drafting process, because the newly-added matters reflect foremostly Western perspectives and concerns. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 does not touch upon the sovereignty of a State over potential data; it only mentions sovereign power over any cyber infrastructure located within States' territory and activities associated with that cyber infrastructure. Similar problems exist in the Tallinn Rules concerning jurisdiction, which overwhelmingly emphasize the limitations imposed by international human rights law to the exercise of sovereignty in cyberspace.²²⁶\n100. In the domestic sphere, China invokes cyber sovereignty to underpin its regulation over data and information in cyberspace. As shown in the SCO Agreement's wording of \"mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to take decisions to the interest of an opposing party\", China is always wary of potential foreign interference. The propaganda and liaison roles played by online social networking servers, such as Facebook and Twitter, in the \"Arab Spring\" that led to social unrest, political turmoil and regime-changes in Northern African and Western Asian countries, and the exposure of the massive surveillance by the US National Security Agency in the PRISM program have strengthened the Chinese conviction of the need for Internet censorship to block and filter information in cyberspace that is harmful to China's social stability and national security.²²⁷ In the trend of the global revival of cyber sovereignty, China strengthens its sovereignty-based regulatory power by referring to similar censorship practices of other States, such as the US, Australia, Italy, Germany, France, the UK, and Korea that once held opposing views, regarding the information about terrorism, incitement to hate crimes, pornography, violence and other crimes involving the usage of the Internet.²²⁸\n101. In the international sphere, China has employed cyber sovereignty as a shield against some Western States' attempts to compel it to change the\n²²⁶ HUANG, above n.212.\n²²⁷ HUANG Zhixiong, Regulation of Cyber Information: A Component Implicitly Covered by Cyber Sovereignty, 3 Guojia Zhili [Nat'l Governance Wkly] (2016), 33-34.\n²²⁸ Xinlian, From the US to Australia: How States Regulate the Internet, China Daily (17 May 2016) (http://world.chinadaily.com.cn/2016-05/17/content_25321844.htm).\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 309\ncurrent model of Internet governance by either resorting to non-legal advocacy for Internet freedom or invoking relevant international law, especially the rules of international human rights law on the right to freedom of expression, association, and the media, and the right to access to information. Google's withdrawal from the Chinese market in 2010 was a representative example of the former means where a leading multinational company threatened the Chinese government for a policy change under the instructions of some Western countries.²²⁹ Additionally, the Chinese government has been alarmed by soft law norms applicable in peacetime that are proposed by some Western countries, such as relevant code of conduct on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace at the 2016-2017 UN GGE meetings. Such non-binding norms are intended to circumvent the advocacy of Russia and China to formulate new rules to regulate State behaviour regarding cybersecurity in the form of a treaty at the forum of the UN and may gradually harden into binding law.²³⁰\n102. This argument likely explains why Cuba, Russia and China refused to explicitly affirm the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law in the cyber context in the 2017 UN GGE report, while having accepted the general applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace since the publication of the 2015 UN GGE consensus report. The crucial factor that prevented these States from reaching a consensus with the Western countries was the opposing camp's intention to introduce \"clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States' use of ICTs\"²³¹ in the UN GGE report, which threatened to restrict States' right to regulate the content of and access to information. The UN GGE report is a non-binding statement, but it may serve as proof of State practice and *opinio juris* in ascertaining whether certain international law applies to a participating State signing onto the consensus report and the extent to which the included law limits the endorsing State's right to regulate domestic affairs. Although these countries have recognized the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict upon the adoption of the final UN GGE report, residual disagreements over how specific LOAC rules apply to ICT-related activities remain prominent between them and the Western countries.\n²²⁹ HUANG, above n.227, 34.\n²³⁰ HUANG Zhixiong, Norms of Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace: Origin, Impact and Response, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 68-69.\n²³¹ Korzak, above n.70.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n103. The law governing the right to self-defence and means and methods of warfare is dominated by the practice of remarkably few established powers because the major ground of resorting to anticipatory self-defence and a large portion of LOAC is customary international law, which has been developed by these “specially affected” States to advance their interests.²³² For newly rising powers such as China, failing to meet the requirements of “persistent objector” before and after the birth of a rule at concern would not relieve their obligation to comply. A successful example where a contrary practice of a large number of weaker States makes a few powerful States switch from an established rule of customary international law to an emerging new rule is rare.²³³ It is extremely difficult for a militarily disadvantaged State that lacks field experience to replicate such a strategy in areas involving force.\n104. To prevent coercive erosions of its sovereignty, China’s strategy is to embed a firewall at the most representative and democratic lawmaking forum to obstruct the convenient transplantation of power disparity from the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to the special regimes of international law that constitute cornerstones of an evolving global system of Internet governance. A treaty negotiated at a more egalitarian forum such as the UNGA would enable the Chinese perspectives to carry greater weight in forming international law among a large number of similarly disadvantaged countries. And lawmaking in the form of treaty allows a less advanced State such as China to pick and choose elastically from treaties and their provisions according to its goals.\nV. Conclusion\n105. To summarize, the above analyses suggest that behind China’s general and vague opposition to an explicit affirmation of the applicability of specific LOAC rules to cyberspace and the right of self-defence in cyberspace is China’s profound concern that doing so would acquiesce to the encroachment of its sovereignty and unlock Pandora’s box of coercive external interferences with its independence in determining the mode of domestic Internet governance and the path of development.\n106. Has China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and digital economy driven it to pursue a more proactive and enterprising approach to reshaping international law governing the domain of cyber\n²³² Alan Boyle &amp; Christine Chinkin, The Making of International Law (2007), 28-29.\n²³³ Ibid., 29.\nJiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 311\nwarfare so as to build up a competitive advantage against the established powers? At first glance, Beijing's long-term resistance to confirming the applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace before the adoption of the final UN GGE report, amid the exaggerated normative rivalry between the Russia-China Camp and the US-EU Camp, appeared to corroborate this argument. However, closer scrutiny reveals that, the conceptual generalization and ambiguity in China's resisting stance stems from the same premises underpinning the mainstream \"wait and see\" approach of most States towards utilizing international law as the primary means to regulate or justify their cyberoperations. Following the \"wait and see\" trend of State practice, China has agreed to the general applicability of the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello*, and law on State responsibility for international wrongful acts, but still resists the applicability of some specific rules in cyberspace, e.g., the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules, to allow for flexibility in responding to cyber technology development in attribution and the evolvement of international law.\n107. Despite the recent developments in its cyber defensive capacity, China remains disadvantaged as a rising power with weaker military capacity and less normative influence. China's normative proposals, exemplified by the ICCIS, serves more as bargaining leverage to protect itself from being bound by the existing or emerging law supported by the established powers, but unfavourable to itself, and also to move the focus of international legal discourse from the paradigm of military responses to cyberattacks concentrated in the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to that of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. China's normative efforts are largely defensive, given that Beijing chooses to prioritize its interests in defending against possible use of force either triggered by an alleged cyberattack or carried out in the means of cyber operations, over its offensive interests in staying less constrained in the use of cyber force.\n108. Because of the special features of how existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* were made, the normative influence of China and its SCO allies is not sufficient, at this moment, to change the practice of the frequent users of force, to come up with a norm promising effective observance by these States, or to veto the formation of new law proposed by these States at concern. The return of sovereign control in cyberspace and the focus shift of international legal discourse result from a set of factors, e.g., the limitations of current technologies and existing law, with the normative efforts of the SCO members having contributed to this global trend.\nChinese JIL (2021)\n109. But these countries can still resist the imposition of non-consensual norms upon themselves in the domain of cyberspace, obstruct the codification of disfavoured norms, and influence how other States characterize and respond to a situation involving cyber operations. This is why the seemingly unfeasible idea of an international cyber disarmament treaty concluded under the framework of the UN remains on the table. The UNSC's monopoly of authorizing the use of force and the UNGA's feature as one of the most egalitarian forums for international lawmaking make the UN the favourable forum relied on by rising powers such as China to build resilience against other lawmaking processes where established powers play a greater role, e.g., the development of customary international law or soft law in less representative forums.",

This article argues that China’s resistance to applying some rules of the *jus in bello* to cyberspace is in line with the “wait and see” approach of most States. But there are two distinctive objectives behind this generalized stance: one is to protect its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace from being bound by disfavoured emerging and existing law, and the other is to build up consensus for a treaty regulating uses of cyber force under the United Nations framework.\n\n## I. Introduction\n\n1. International law is a generator and a product of the changing global order. China, as “both an aspirational ‘great power’ which plays a key role alongside the West in global governance, and a member of the post-colonial States which views Western hegemony with a critical eye and sees the need to champion the causes of the developing world”, no longer tries to conceal its\n\n* Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow, Fudan University Law School; S.J.D.

To what extent and how the rise of a new great power will influence international law largely hinges upon the interaction between the rising power and the established powers that have dominated international legal discourse for centuries. The perspectives of China and the established powers differ substantially on many issues, especially those relating to sovereign equality, non-intervention and national security. This can be exemplified by China's perspectives on many issues of cyber warfare in the normative rivalry between the United States (US)-European Union (EU) Camp and the Russia-China Camp, which are competing to influence the making of international law, as well as other countries' domestic policies.²\n\n2. Through the International Code of Conduct for Information Security (ICCIS) first submitted to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2011³ and joint efforts in other forums such as the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT),⁴ the Russia-China Camp has advanced a sovereignty-based model of Internet governance, which respects cyberspace sovereignty and State independence and legitimizes domestic efforts\n\nReinterpreting the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and Military Intervention for Humanitarian Purposes, 6 Asian JIL (2016), 114.\n\n2 See, e.g., Kristen E.

Notably, China’s growing strength in Internet technology, military capabilities and the digital economy, especially following the 2008 global financial crisis, did not initially bolster its assertiveness in the international lawmaking procedures that seek to identify existing law or generate new law applicable to State behaviour in cyberspace. China was a low-key participant at the early stages of the UN Group of Government Experts on the Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of Security (“UN GGE”). Its behaviour was found to be passive and frequently concurring with Russia’s stance. The Chinese representatives attending earlier UN GGE meetings were technical officers from the Ministry of Communication rather than diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign affairs (MOFA).⁹ But later, China proved to be willing to act more actively and assertively when it was singled out and its fundamental domestic interests were threatened by the disfavoured norms proposed by the established powers.\n\n4. In reaction to these Western normative attempts, China has transformed from a low-profile, passive team player under the Russian leadership to a proactive actor that had formed its own agenda. China’s active pattern of behaviour was prompted by a 2010 speech by Hillary Clinton, former US Secretary\n\n⁵ ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(a), (c), (d), (f).\n\n⁶ US Office of the Secretary of Defense, Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2013 (May 2013), 37 (https://fas.org/man/eprint/dod-china-2013.pdf); European Parliament Resolution of 22 November 2012 on the Forthcoming WCIT-12 of the International Telecommunications Union, and the Possible Expansion of the Scope of International Telecommunication Regulations, P7_TA(2012)0451 (22 November 2012), para.5 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52012IP0451).\n\n⁷ US Department of State, International Cyberspace Policy Strategy (March 2016) (per Public Law 114-113, Division N, Title IV, Section 402), 16-18 (https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/255732.pdf).\n\n⁸ Ibid.\n\n⁹ As noted in: Adam Segal, Chinese Cyber Diplomacy in a New Era of Uncertainty, Aegis Paper Series No. 1703, Hoover Institution (2017), 5-6 (www.lawfareblog.com/chinese-cyber-diplomacy-new-era-uncertainty-0).",

Higher-level officials from the MOFA with expertise in cyber governance started to represent China in diplomatic activities.¹⁰ The ICCIS was developed to counter-balance the diplomatic momentum generated by a series of US activities, including Clinton’s speeches on freedom in cyberspace between 2010-2012, the 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace and the 2011 Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace. Beijing viewed these activities as attempting to militarize cyberspace and maintain the dominance of the US in cyber governance by interfering in other States’ sovereign right to regulate cyberspace.¹¹\n\n5. In 2011, the first edition of the ICCIS was submitted two months before the London Conference, a United Kingdom (UK)-sponsored attempt in line with those of the US and their allies. The ICCIS called on States “not to use information and communications technologies (ICTs), including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies”, called for “peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security”, and emphasized “the important role of the UN in formulating international norms”.¹² An updated edition of the ICCIS with similar wording was circulated at the UNGA in 2015,¹³ possibly intended to gather wider support in the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures that harmed the US’s credibility in its continuous diplomatic attempts.\n\n6. The second World Internet Conference in 2015 marked the emergence of China’s own vision of global Internet governance that advocates both respect for sovereignty in cyberspace and international cooperation to “jointly build a community of shared future in cyberspace”. Chinese President XI Jinping highlighted the problems of the current global Internet governance system, including, among other things, the inadequate existing rules governing cyberspace that hardly reflect the perspectives of the majority of countries,\n\n¹⁰ As noted in ibid., 6.\n¹¹ Ibid., 4-5, 7.\n¹² ICCIS, above n.3, paras.(b), (j).\n¹³ International Code of Conduct for Information Security, Annex to the Letter dated 9 January 2015 from the Permanent Representatives of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russia Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations Addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

One proposal explicitly called on all countries to work together to “contain the abuse of information technology, oppose cyber surveillance and cyberattacks and reject arms race in cyberspace” and “push for the formulation of international cyberspace rules accepted by all parties as well as an international convention against terrorism in cyberspace, improve the legal assistance mechanism to fight cybercrimes and jointly uphold peace and security in cyberspace”.¹⁴\n\n7. The vision of “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” was further elaborated by the Organizing Committee of the World Internet Conference in 2019. It urged countries to oppose hostile activities, acts of aggression, cyberattacks, large-scale surveillance operations, unfounded accusations of cyberattacks against other countries and attempts to politicize cybersecurity issues; prevent arms race and military conflict in cyberspace; and remain committed to resolving disputes by peaceful means.¹⁵ In 2020, the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace was released amid the COVID-19 pandemic that underpinned the urgency of “achieving shared development, ensuring common security, realizing joint governance, and enjoying benefits”. This document emphasized the need to “exert the roles of the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) and the UN GGE, and support formulating codes, norms and principles of responsible State conduct in cyberspace that are acceptable to all parties under the UN framework”.¹⁶\n\n8. To assess the implications of China’s rise for the evolution of international law governing the use of force by States in cyberspace, this paper studies the normative initiatives and strategies employed by China in identifying rules of existing law and creating new law applicable to cyber warfare.

Special attention is paid to legal controversies over the rules on cyberattacks regulated by LOAC, dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities, the proportionality of cyberattacks against critical infrastructures and the targetability of certain categories of civilians. Part IV examines the rationales behind China's generalized normative proposal and its vague refusal to confirm the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello, while having recognized the general applicability of these two regimes to cyberspace.

On 1 March 2017, the MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration jointly issued the first international cyber policy paper of China—the International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (ISCC)—to comprehensively introduce and explain Beijing's policy and position on issues of cyber-related international affairs.¹⁷ At his daily press briefing following the release, the UN Secretary-General Spokesman Stéphane Dujarric described the ISCC as “a very important report” and suggested that “China has a big role to play” in global cyber governance.¹⁸ The linchpin of China’s cyber diplomacy is the idea of cyber sovereignty, around which China formulates its cybersecurity policies towards three primary objectives. The first is to protect its critical information infrastructure, cyber sovereignty, national security and domestic stability from threats posed by digital power disparity among countries, cybercrimes and cyber terrorism, and external interference with China’s internal\n\n¹⁷ Statement by Ambassador FU Cong in the Assembly Meeting of the UN Conference on Disarmament on International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (9 March 2017) (www.china-un.ch/eng/hom/t1444602.htm); also MOFA and the Cyberspace Administration, International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace (1 March 2017) (www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zzjg_663340/jks_665232/kjlc_665236/qtwt_665250/t1442390.shtml) [hereinafter “ISCC”].\n\n¹⁸ Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General (2 March 2017) (www.un.org/press/en/2017/db170302.doc.htm).",

The second is to shape the current global Internet governance and promote the formation of a system of international legal norms in China's favour. The third objective is to convert China's increasing cyber capacity into soft power to mobilize and influence other countries' preferences.¹⁹ Chapter II lays out the three elements of China's proposed idea of cyber sovereignty—regulatory authority, non-interference and sovereign equality, and the security-oriented balanced approach.²⁰\n\n10. The appeal for cyber sovereignty by China and other like-minded countries takes place at a time when governments' sovereign power over cyberspace is in decline for many reasons, including but not limited to the privatization of cyberspace, the rise of non-State actors and the digital gap between the developed and developing countries. As evidenced by the first and second editions of the Tallinn Manual providing that \"a State may exercise control over cyber infrastructure and activity within its sovereign territory\",²¹ sovereignty in cyberspace is not a revisionist idea by itself. According to the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Manual 2.0, this premise, which was confirmed by the 2013 Report of the UN GGE,²² is now \"relatively well accepted by the international community\".²³ The US and its allies have held out to this idea in order to sustain the current platform governed by multi-stakeholders under their control.²⁴\n\n19 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter I: Opportunities and Challenges, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n20 Ibid., Chapter II: The Principle of Sovereignty.\n21 Michael Schmitt (general ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), Rule 1 [hereinafter \"Tallinn Manual\"]; also Michael Schmitt (general ed.) &amp; Liis Vihul (managing ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on The International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2017), Rule 1 [hereinafter \"Tallinn Manual 2.0\"].\n22 Report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

It is noteworthy that, among all the technical communities developing the \"law\" of the Internet and managing the global distribution of Internet resources in terms of naming and addresses,²⁵ the ISCC exclusively named the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and urged the international community to \"make [ICANN] a truly independent international institution, increase its representations and ensure greater openness and transparency in its decision-making and operation\".²⁶ ICANN has been a highly politicalized organization. It is a Californian corporation created by a 1998 Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Commerce to transfer the power to manage and oversee the domain name system (DNS) coordination from the US government to the global community. This agreement was supposed to terminate on 30 September 2000, while subject to further amendments.²⁷ The US government did not end its supervision until October 2016,²⁸ mainly in response to the calling of major Internet technical organizations for freeing ICANN from unilateral oversight of the US as a backlash from the Snowden Disclosures.²⁹ Yet, it is early to tell whether the globalization of ICANN can be genuinely realized, given that most of its key infrastructures remain in the US territory. The deprivation of the top domain of Iraq, \".iq\", by ICANN in the Iraq war under the undue influence of the US government,³⁰ the Snowden Disclosures, and the \"Vault 7\" documents released by WikiLeaks³¹ have demonstrated the capacity and motivation of the US to abuse its dominant position in global Internet governance under the current multi-stakeholder model.\n\n25 See generally Milton Mueller, Chapter 25: Communications and The Internet, in: Jacob Katz Cogan, Ian Hurd &amp; Ian Johnstone (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International Organizations (2017), 539-542.\n26 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter IV: Plan of Action.\n27 Memorandum of Understanding Between The US Department of Commerce and ICANN (25 November 1998) (www.icann.org/resources/unthemed-pages/icannmou-1998-11-25-en).\n28 Dave Lee, Has the US Just Given Away the Internet?, BBC News (1 October 2016) (www.bbc.com/news/technology-37527719).\n29 Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation (10 October 2013) (www.icann.org/news/announcement-2013-10-07-en).\n30 See LIANG Yabin, Cyberspace is the New Battlefield for Game of States in the Big Data Era, Study Times (20 October 2014) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/1020/c40531-25866183.html).\n31 See, e.g., Wikileaks Exposes CIA Interference in French Presidential Elections, The European Union Times (16 February 2017) (www.eutimes.net/2017/02/wikileaks-exposes-cia-interference-in-french-presidential-elections/).",

The label “multi-stakeholder” was only applied to ICANN in the wake of the battles over Internet governance initiated by national governments, which are treated as “stakeholders” on an equal footing with private corporates and members of civil society, during and after the World Summit on the Information Society, as political rhetoric to mobilize non-State actors to help resist governmental interference into Internet governance and to simultaneously make the established self-governance model more palatable to States and the UN system.³² ICANN is a global Internet governance organization possessing monopoly power over the DNS, but it is only subject to the sole jurisdiction of the US under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law.³³ Due to the anticipated objection of the US, to put ICANN under the oversight of the international community of sovereign States³⁴ proves difficult to attain. And an equivalent alternative to ICANN would be not only costly but also highly disruptive for Internet users.³⁵\n\n13. Aside from open participation, ICANN is not subject to any classic form of internal accountability that commonly exists in private corporations and nonprofit organizations, such as direct accountability mechanisms based on membership or shareholders in the Regional Internet Registries and the open, bottom-up, consensus-based standardization process of the Internet Engineering Task Force.³⁶ Although ICANN self-identifies as championing the bottom-up, consensus-driven, multi-stakeholder model of governance, its policy-making processes manifest a top-down hierarchy, in which issues raised from the grassroots level end up as policy recommendations to be voted at the Board of Directors.³⁷ The Board has “near-absolute” power over the bylaws governing the entirety of processes and can “untrammeled[ly]” decide whether to accept these recommendations in the absence of any binding forms of appeal or review.

The critical details and implementations of these contracts are negotiated bilaterally between ICANN and the registrars/registries, largely beyond the influence of general policies developed in the bottom-up representative processes.⁴⁰ To summarize, ICANN seems to employ open participation as a substitute for other missing and more effective accountability mechanisms.⁴¹\n\n14. In the ISCC, China advocates shifting from the present multi-stakeholder model of global Internet governance to a multilateral State-centric model. In the latter model, a wide range of actors are encouraged to make their respective contributions based on their capacity in the multilateral decision-making processes led by governments, particularly regarding public policies and security.⁴² China favours the UN as the principal forum to coordinate positions of various parties and build international consensus, while other international mechanisms and platforms are called on to complement based on their comparative advantage.⁴³ The establishment of “multilateral, democratic, and transparent international Internet government systems” is listed as a major goal in the Thirteenth Five-Year-Plan for China’s economic and social development from 2016 to 2020.⁴⁴\n\n## II.B.

China’s position on the adequacy of existing international law had not crystalized until the 2013 UN GGE meeting. Since then, China has accepted, in principle, the general applicability of relevant international law to cyberspace.⁴⁶ Despite this, China has maintained that international lawmaking is demanded to address the issues that are not clearly dealt with by existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*, as parallel paths to further study the applicability of these two regimes’ established rules to cyber warfare from the perspectives of “maintaining international security, strategic mutual trust and preventing cyber conflicts”.⁴⁷\n\n17. Although the 2017 ISCC is not written in legal language, it calls for “formulating universally accepted international rules and norms of state behaviour in cyberspace within the framework of the UN” towards the ultimate goal of a “rule-based” global governance system in cyberspace.⁴⁸ Rather than using the word “codifying”, China opted for “formulating” and emphasized the universal acceptance of rules by countries. This wording reveals China’s reluctance to recognize the applicability of some *already existing* rules of international law to cyberspace, mainly because of the under-representation of developing countries in global cyber governance. In its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the Chinese government also stated that it would “take an active role in formulating international rules in areas such as the Internet”.⁴⁹\n\n⁴⁵ The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World (May 2011), 9 (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf); also Brian J.

In its efforts to achieve these objectives, Beijing has been increasingly active in various multilateral lawmaking forums, particularly major UN platforms such as the UNGA, UN GGE, the UN Expert Group on Combating Cybercrime and International Telecommunication Union. For example, along with the promotion of the concepts of cyber sovereignty and “Jointly Build a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace” at the World Internet Conference, a State-run annual international forum focusing on the development, use and governance of the Internet, underlying elements of these concepts have also been advocated in China’s Position Paper at the UNGA since 2014 to maintain the momentum and build consensus. These elements include: (1) peaceful use of cyberspace for economic and social development; (2) objection to cyber war and arms race; (3) the development of an international code of conduct for cyberspace under the UN framework that is acceptable to all, such as the two versions of the ICCIS; (4) strengthened international cooperation to combat cybercrimes such as cyber terrorism; and (5) objection to any country’s attempt to overstretch the concept of national security to restrict ICT development and cooperation among other countries or to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs.⁵⁰\n\n19.

In the context of cyber warfare, the US position is that existing LOAC, including its principles of distinction, necessity, and proportionality, applies in cyberspace.59 By contrast, China, Russia, and other SCO members have not agreed to the US stance and played a rival role. In the 2013 Report of the UN GGE, China and Russia managed to exclude any reference to the applicability of international humanitarian law principles in cyberspace, despite the controversial affirmation of the applicability of \"international law\" and the UN Charter.60 The 2015 UN GGE Report explicitly \"notes\" the possible applicability of \"the established international legal principles, including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction\", while cautiously avoiding making any reference to international humanitarian law.61 The wording of this text fails to clarify whether the UN GGE reached a consensus on the applicability of these LOAC principles to cyber activities or merely noted their existence. Moreover, although the 2015 UN GGE Report mentions the prohibition on the threat or use of force against any State's territorial integrity or political independence,62 it does not refer to the right to self-defence against cyberattacks amounting to use of force as an exception to such general prohibition.

Without an explicit official position, Beijing's stance on many occasions has been found to be general yet frequently in line with Russia's efforts to negotiate an international arms control treaty on the use and non-proliferation of information weapons.^[64]^ For example, the 2011 ICCIS proposes \"not to use ICTs, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies\", and calls for \"peaceful settlements of international disputes and improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security\".^[65]^ In the updated ICCIS circulated at the UNGA in 2015, the controversial terms of \"proliferate information weapons\" is omitted, and the original paragraph is replaced by \"not to use ICTs and information and communications networks to carry out activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security\".^[66]^\n\n24.

While the ISCC discourages militarization of cyberspace, China plans to enhance its “defense capability in cyberspace” and “expedite the development of a cyber force” with the aim to “prevent a major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security and maintain national security and social stability”.69\n\n25. At the UN GGE’s fifth session in 2017, the 25 participating States could not reach a consensus, particularly over the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyber conflicts. It was reported that the US sought “clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States’ use of ICTs”, including international humanitarian law, the right to self-defence, the law of State responsibility, and countermeasures. Cuba, backed by Russia and China which similarly opposed such an explicit affirmation, argued that following the manuscript of the US would militarize cyberspace and “legitimize unilateral punitive force actions” by “States claiming to be victims of illicit uses of ICTs”. Consequently, this session concluded without issuing a consensus report.70\n\n26. In December 2018, the First Committee of the UNGA adopted two resolutions to continue the international discussions of norms on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace by establishing two parallel working processes: one is a new GGE sponsored mainly by the US,71 and the other is the OEWG proposed by Russia that allows all interested Member States to participate in further studying the existing rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour identified by the previous UN GGE reports. The OEWG is also mandated, “if necessary, to introduce changes to them or elaborate additional rules of behaviour”.72 As mentioned previously, China endorsed both the OEWG and the UN GGE in the Initiative on Jointly Building a Community With a Shared Future in Cyberspace released in 2020. Notably, the resolution establishing the OEWG introduces a new issue, namely, “the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives,\n\n69 Ibid.\n\n70 See, e.g., Elaine Korzak, UN GGE on Cybersecurity: The End of an Era?, The Diplomat (31 July 2017) (https://thediplomat.com/2017/07/un-gge-on-cybersecurity-have-china-and-russia-just-made-cyberspace-less-safe/).\n\n71 UNGA, Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

In May 2021, the 2019-2020 UN GGE completed its mission by adopting a consensus final report to be subsequently endorsed by the UNGA. China is among the 25 countries from which UN GGE experts were appointed. The final report explicitly notes the applicability of international humanitarian law “only in situations of armed conflict” and recalls “the established international legal principles including, where applicable, the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction” noted in the 2015 report. In the same paragraph, what comes alongside the reference to LOAC is the UN GGE’s recognition of “the need for further study on how and when these principles apply to the use of ICTs by States” and emphasis that “these principles by no means legitimizes or encourages conflict”.76 Simultaneously, the report provides that in their use of ICTs, States must not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State and shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN.77 The text of the final UN GGE report seems to have adopted the prudent approach of the OEWG.

Possible explanations for China’s opposition\n\n28. China’s stance on the applicability of LOAC to cyberspace is still evolving with the dynamic international environment, partly explaining why Beijing has refrained from specifying rationales for its resistance to some LOAC rules and how they govern ICT-related activities. Although limited in number, several statements made by Chinese officials on international occasions shed light on this question.\n\n29. At the 2013 Seoul Conference on Cyberspace, HUANG Huikang, then Legal Adviser of the MOFA, underlined the overemphasis on “making exceptions for cyber warfare or self-defence, while the non-use of force principle has been marginalized” and “the risk of sliding towards the militarization of cyberspace”.78 At the 6th US-China Internet Industry Forum, the Chinese delegation further pointed to the numerous “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” regarding methods and means of cyber warfare, arguing for the incompetence of existing norms to address new sophisticated problems stemming from ICT development.79\n\n30. At the 7th US-China Internet Industry Forum in 2015, MA Xinmin, then Deputy Director-General of the Department of Treaty and Law of the MOFA, acknowledged that in principle, existing international law, including “the purposes and principles of the [UN] Charter, such as *jus ad bellum* rule of non-use of force except in self-defence or under UN Security Council’s (SC) authorization [...] and international humanitarian law among others shall be directly applicable to cyberspace.”80 However, he emphasized that applying existing LOAC rules to cyber warfare should be conducted “with great caution”, because of the lack of State practice on cyber warfare\n\n78 MOFA, Working Together to Build a Harmonious and Progressive International Cyberspace Order, Remarks by Dr HUANG Huikang at the Seoul Conference on Cyberspace (17 October 2013), (www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cgmb/chn/wjbxw/P020131021538048406901.doc).\n\n79 Statement by the Chinese Delegation at the 6th US-China Internet Industrial Forum, 2013 Chinese YIL, 666-67.\n\n80 MA, above n.46.",

He argued that the viewpoints of some States and scholars reflected in the Tallinn Manual illustrate the “military paradigm” of “response to cyberattacks that disregards the principle of non-use of force in international law but over-emphasizes such exceptions as the right to self-defence”, which “clearly does not conform to the international reality and actual needs”.⁸²\n\n31. In a subsequent paper, MA elaborated that the prevailing challenges States need to address are threats to cybersecurity in times of peace, most of which either are launched by non-State actors and fall under the scope of domestic law, or do not qualify as “use of force” or “armed attacks” governed by international law that apply in times of war but constitute international wrongful acts regulated by the law on State responsibility. In the latter situations, the victim State should first resort to peaceful means such as legal countermeasures or UNSC sanctions, rather than use of force. Accordingly, MA called for both further scrutiny of the applicability of existing rules of the jus ad bellum or the jus in bello to cyberspace and international lawmaking designated for the issues not addressed by these two regimes.⁸³\n\n32. Quasi-authoritative Chinese sources similarly argue that some Western countries attempt to militarize the Internet through insisting on applying existing rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace.⁸⁴ The Liberation Army Daily straightforwardly criticizes the US for utilizing the Tallinn Manual project to “find legal basis for its cyber warfare policies and military customs”, to maintain the dominant control of the West in cyberspace.⁸⁵\n\n⁸¹ Ibid., para.24.\n⁸² Ibid., paras.20, 23.\n⁸³ MA, above n.47.\n⁸⁴ See, e.g., Zhong Sheng, The United States Bears Primary Responsibility for Halting Cyber War, People’s Daily (7 February 2013) (http://cpc.people.com.cn/pinglun/n/2013/0207/c78779-20456593.html).\n⁸⁵ LI Ying, The NATO to Find Legal Basis for Manipulation of Cyberspace, Liberation Army Daily (24 October 2014) (www.chinanews.com/mil/2014/10-24/6712323.shtml).",

China's concern over the significant power disparity in Internet technology and cyber infrastructure between it and developed countries partly explains its long-term resistance to applying existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyber warfare prior to the adoption of the final UN GGE report. For example, the following description frequently appeared on Chinese mainstream media: \"The global Internet is built upon 13 [Internet Protocol version (IPv) 4] root servers, 10 of which, including the only key root server, are located in the US. Theoretically, this gives the US the ultimate power to destroy the entire Internet infrastructure of any country.\"⁸⁶ The deprivation of Iraq's top domain by ICANN during the Iraq war is another frequently cited supporting example.⁸⁷ To tackle the issue, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology recently approved establishing a DNS root server and a corresponding operating organization by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, along with a plan to upgrade the network infrastructure for the IPv6-based network and encourage large-scale adoption of the IPv6 network.⁸⁸\n\n34. The mainstream view of Chinese scholars on the Tallinn Manual produced under the auspices of NATO is that: By its essence, the Tallinn Manual is not a re-statement or clarification of existing international law but involves the making of new rules on cyber warfare that reflects the distinctive practice and vested interests of the NATO members.⁸⁹ Chinese scholars also highlighted the geographical limitation in the member selection of the Tallinn\n\n⁸⁶ See, e.g., LI Yi, Chinese Internet, Please Keep the “Root”, Beijing Daily (24 January 2014) (http://news.sina.com.cn/pl/2014-01-22/015929310615.shtml).\n\n⁸⁷ LIANG, above n.30.\n\n⁸⁸ Xinhua, China Greenlights Establishment of Root Server, China.org.cn (8 December 2019) (http://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/201912/08/content_WS5dec361ec6d0bcf8c4c1882d.html); Xinhua, China Steps up Deploying IPv6-based Network, China.org.cn (3 May 2019) (www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/03/c_138031821.htm).\n\n⁸⁹ See, e.g., DING Libai &amp; ZHU Jing, Tallinn Manual Defines and Reflects on Cyber Attack “Force”, 36 Hebei Faxue [Hebei L Sci] (2018), 84; HUANG Zhixiong, Application of International Law in Cyberspace: Establishing Rules of the Game, 38 Huanqiu Falv Pinglun [Global LR] (2016), 13; HUANG Zhixiong, International Legal Issues concerning “Cyber Warfare” and Strategies for China: Focusing on the Field of Jus ad Bellum, 37 Xiandai Faxue [Modern L Sci] (2015), 154; CHEN Qi, Cybersecurity, Cyber War and International Law: From the Perspective of Tallinn Manual, 7 Zhengzhi yu Falv [P Sci L] (2014), 153-56; XU Yijie, Watch Out for the “Tallinn Manual” Used by the NATO to Make “Rules of Cyber War”, 10 Zhongguo Dangzheng Ganbu Luntan [Chinese Cadres Tribune] (2013), 98-99.",

Specifically, many scholars consider that the Tallinn Manual’s threshold on what cyber operations constitute the use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is too low. In their view, the majority of the selected International Group of Experts, who are supporters of Michael Schmitt’s “scale and effects” approach,⁹¹ artificially create some situations that have never taken place to prove that cyberattacks can result in analogous scale and effects of kinetic and non-kinetic forces. A direct transplantation of existing *jus ad bellum* to cyberspace arguably goes beyond the current practice of most States.⁹² Another major concern of Chinese scholars is that, rather than regulating the means and methods of cyber warfare, the sponsors of the Tallinn Manual intend to seek legal bases to initiate cyber or even kinetic wars. Accordingly, the Tallinn Manual extensively interprets a country’s right of self-defence against non-State actors and anticipatory self-defence against an imminent threat of cyber operations. They hence argue for a higher bar than the Tallinn Manual requirements for invoking the right of self-defence within the meaning of Article 51 of the UN Charter.⁹³\n\n35. Given the unique features of cyber operations, it can be observed that China has been hesitant about applying specific LOAC rules to the cyber context. What are the “ambiguities and gaps in existing international law” that prevent China from embracing LOAC and the Tallinn Manual at present? In the absence of any official policy, non-authoritative sources shed light on specific controversies focused on the principles of distinction and proportionality in cyberspace.⁹⁴\n\n⁹⁰ See, e.g., JIANG Yamin, Cyber Great Power Needs to Pay Attention to International Cybersecurity Strategies, People.com, (19 March 2015) (http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2015/0319/c386965-26716864.html).\n\n⁹¹ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 11.\n\n⁹² See, e.g., above n.89, DING &amp; ZHU, 85-86; HUANG (2016), 10-11; HUANG (2015), 150; CHEN, 154.\n\n⁹³ See, e.g., above n.89, HUANG (2016), 8-9; HUANG (2015), 152; CHEN, 154-55.\n\n⁹⁴ See, e.g., LI Bojun, Cyber War and the Applicability of the Law of Armed Conflict, 31 Faxue Pinglun [LR] (2013), 62-63; WANG Kongxiang, Legal Questions and Regulation of Civilian Participation in Cyber War, 5 Fazhi Yanjiu [Research on Rule of L] (2013), 100-09; CHEN, above n.89, 158; CAI Lihong, Challenges to the Principle of Distinction by Information Attacks and Strategies, 24 Xian Zhengzhi Xueyuan Xuebao [J Xi’an P Inst PLA] (2011), 95-96.",
    "Chinese JIL (2021)\n\nFirst, the existence of an armed conflict permits the use of lethal force based solely on the status of an individual or object. Some Chinese scholars argue that cyberattacks, in light of the latest level of technology, are not controllable so as to constrain their effects within the boundaries of military objects and therefore indiscriminate in nature.95 The 2007 nation-wide denial-of-service attacks sweeping over Estonian Internet infrastructure, including the websites and systems of its Parliament, banks, ministries and media, was cited as a typical example of indiscriminate cyberattack,96 although whether there was an armed conflict and whether such activities amounted to attacks within the meaning of LOAC is disputable. Given such practical difficulties in applying the principle of “distinction” in cyberwar, some scholars suspect the application of LOAC will open a gate for illegitimate cyber and kinetic attacks leading to humanitarian disasters.97 For example, despite its title—“Duty of care during attacks on dams, dykes, and nuclear electrical generating stations”, Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, along with the US policy that categorizes enemy “war-sustaining” objects as lawful targets, is framed as a disguised affirmation of the legitimacy of attacks on critical, yet highly dangerous infrastructures.98 The Internet was originally designed in a way capable of being immediately transformed from war-supporting civil facilities to war-fighting objects, making the majority of its components dual-use objects. Overwhelming reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure would dramatically expand the scope of targetable objects under LOAC. Accordingly, recognizing the applicability of the LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks in cyberspace would be tantamount to authorizing attacks against critical dual-use infrastructures, rendering mass civilians vulnerable to the adverse impacts of not only cyberattacks but also kinetic ones.\n\nSecond, since the civilian aspect of dual-use cyber infrastructures is relevant only to the attack requirements for proportionality and precaution, the “proportionality” of attacks against objects highly dependent upon Internet or computer control systems is another worrying issue. One scholar quotes John\n\n95 Ibid., WANG, 107; LIANG, above n.30.\n\n96 Scheherazade Rehman, Estonia’s Lessons in Cyberwarfare, US News (14 January 2013) (www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/01/14/estonia-shows-how-to-build-a-defense-against-cyberwarfare).\n\n97 CAI, above n.94; CUI Wenbo, The Influence on Chinese Cyber Security Interest of Tallinn Manual, 15 Jiangnan Shehui Xueyuan Xuebao [J Jiangnan Soc U] (2013), 24.\n\n98 CAI, above n.94, 95; ibid., CUI.",

To reduce costs and obtain technical expertise, the increasing usage of civilians to operate cyberattacks, maintain information weapons, or support cyber combat operations by States has further eroded the distinction between combatants and civilians.¹⁰² It is reasonable for the Chinese military, government and some State-owned-enterprise to recruit civilians for activities related to cyber warfare. Although the law that a civilian who directly participates in hostilities or who adopts a continuous combat function may be lawfully attacked is not in dispute, the targetability of a civilian who assists with cyber operations depends on the answers to two questions: which people are targetable and when they may be targeted. Some Chinese scholars argue that, due to the technical predicament of identity verification and attribution, the applicable LOAC rules fail to provide certainty and predictability for the determination of individual status.¹⁰³\n\nFourth, another issue closely related to China’s opposition to applying some LOAC rules to cyberspace, namely, what acts may constitute a resort to\n\n⁹⁹ Ibid., CAI, 96, quoting from Is it Real?

    "Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 281\n\n## III.A. Cyberattacks regulated by LOAC\n\n37. Common Article 2 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 defines an international armed conflict as any “declared war or any other armed conflict which may arise two or more States”, regardless of whether any of them recognizes the state of war. In *Tadić*, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia found “an armed conflict exists whenever there is a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State.”¹⁰⁵ Undoubtedly, cyberattacks accompanying any kinetic use of force fall under the sphere of LOAC. As with cyber warfare, the pertinent question is whether a single cyber exchange in the absence of any conventional use of force can trigger an international armed conflict by itself.\n\n38. The notion “resort to armed force” is not defined under LOAC and is easily confused with the usage of “use of force” under the *jus ad bellum*. Nevertheless, the different objects and purposes of these two regimes entail distinct legal tests of “force”. The *jus ad bellum* specifically regulates inter-State relations and States’ lawful use of force, seeking to maintain peaceful relations among nations by setting up strict conditions for invoking forceful measures, “when States may move beyond non-forceful measures such as diplomacy, economic sanctions, and countermeasures”.¹⁰⁶ By contrast, the *jus in bello* regulates the behaviour of parties to an armed conflict, and its object and purpose are to protect the military and civilian victims of war by prohibiting the harms caused by armed attacks during a conflict that are either unnecessary to effectively accomplish legitimate military objectives or excessive in relation to them.¹⁰⁷ The *jus in bello* does not govern whether the use of force is legitimate under the *jus ad bellum* but imposes restrictions on methods and means of warfare.\n\n39. Despite the absence of a treaty definition of the notion “armed forces” under LOAC, Article 49(1) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva\n\n---\n\n¹⁰⁵ Prosecutor v.

    "Chinese JIL (2021)\n\nConventions defines “attack” within the meaning of LOAC as “acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence”.¹⁰⁸ By concentrating on the term “violence”, Article 49(1) provides a feasible way to access cyberattacks by analogy to the physical violent effects caused by kinetic attacks. The threshold concept of “attack” is selected in light of LOAC’s object and purpose, since only acts that qualify as attacks would be subject to many of its core prohibitions and restrictions. Only qualified attacks would trigger a wide range of legal protections for the civilian population and objects under LOAC. In most cases, an unqualified act beyond the realm of LOAC would fall under the domain of domestic and international human rights law. So far, there appears to be a consensus that as long as a cyber operation attributable to a State has the equivalent effects of kinetic forces, such as death, physical injury to persons, or damages to objects, it would trigger an international armed conflict.¹⁰⁹ Similarly, Rule 30 of the Tallinn Manual suggests that the “armed force” criterion is fulfilled when a cyber operation is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to person or damage or destruction to objects.¹¹⁰ A majority of the independent experts participating in the Tallinn Manual project favour including “loss of functionality” in the definition of damages, although there are various shades of opinions among them.¹¹¹\n\n40. The ICRC Commentary states that the term “attack” means “combat action”, without further elaboration.¹¹² A paper written by the Head of the ICRC’s Operational Law indicates that the ICRC considers the consequence-based approach as “insufficient to capture the whole range of possible effects of cyber operations and the damage that they can cause, which will not\n\n108 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 49(1).\n109 Nils Melzer, Cyberwarfare and International Law, UN Institute for Disarmament Research Publications (2011), 24 (https://unidir.org/files/publications/pdfs/cyberwarfare-and-international-law-382.pdf); Michael Schmitt, Classification of Cyber Conflict, 17 JCSL (2012), 251, n.25; Heather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (2012), 131; Droege, above n.107, 546; Knut Dörmann, Applicability of the Additional Protocols to Computer Network Attacks, ICRC Resource Centre (19 November 2004), 3 (www.icrc.org/en/doc/resources/documents/misc/68lg92.htm).\n110 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 30, 106.\n111 Ibid., 108-09.\n112 Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski &amp; Bruno Zimmermann (eds.), Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 (1987), para.1880.",

Based on this approach, whether a cyber operation amounts to an attack depends on whether it causes the target to lose function, even if the target is not physically damaged.¹¹⁴\n\n41. States may support the dysfunction approach since cyber operations would be more frequently resorted, not to physically destroy or damage objects, which can be accomplished by using kinetic force, but rather to incapacitate or disrupt the normal functioning of a vital military or dual-use infrastructure.¹¹⁵ For instance, an electrical grid or water supply system might be shut down, and a country's banking or stock-trading system could be manipulated, both without any physical damage. As is demonstrated by the 2007 Estonian denial-of-service attacks, for certain civilian populations, the potential hardship arising from such dysfunction could be far more extensive or severe than the physical destruction of a particular building. Such effects might not be comparable to those caused by physical violence, but they are \"precisely the kind of severe consequences from which [LOAC] seeks to protect the civilian population\".¹¹⁶\n\n42. According to the dysfunction approach, cyberattacks against military or dual-use infrastructure, such as paralyzing information systems, altering or deleting processes and resources, are attacks that can trigger the application of LOAC, while applying the consequence-based approach would lead to a contrary conclusion. The applicable LOAC rule maintains that cyberattacks resulting in no physical damage are lawful.¹¹⁷ The US-EU camp intends to stay with the existing rule and has codified it in the Tallinn Manual. Although international law evolves to reflect the changing values developed by the international community, most States remain silent on this issue.

Part of the SCO Agreement defines war as the “confrontation between two or more States in the information space aimed at damaging information systems, processes, and resources, critical and other structures”. Under this part of the definition, those confrontations that happen without any physical damages would not qualify as attacks and therefore be lawful under LOAC. The remaining part, namely, inter-State confrontations in cyberspace aimed at “undermining political, economic, and social systems, mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to [take] decisions in the interest of an opposing party”, is unlikely to fall into the scope of attacks under LOAC either.\n\n44. On Article 49 of Additional Protocol I, the *Bothe, Partsch and Solf Commentary* underlines that attacks refer to “those aspects of military operations that most directly affect the safety of the civilian population and the integrity of civilian objects”.¹¹⁸ It would be difficult to assert that political, economic, social, or even psychological effects of cyber operations could be deemed most directly affecting the personal safety of civilians or the physical integrity of civilian objects. Dissemination of propaganda, espionage, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological or economic warfare does not fall under the concept of attack in LOAC.¹¹⁹\n\n45. LOAC endeavours to regulate methods and means of war and the treatments of different groups. Under LOAC, a State wants to protect its civilian population and objects, and at the same time, be able to use lethal force against the belligerent party once an armed conflict commences. An overinclusive definition of “attack” will subject the civilian population to catastrophic consequences that would have been avoided by applying the present definition with a high threshold. Such consideration partly explains why most States remain silent in the face of cyberattacks.¹²⁰\n\n46. The SCO Agreement’s definition of war demonstrates the six countries’ concerns of adverse impacts by acts that do not qualify as attacks and coincides with Russia’s proposal for non-proliferation of information weapons.

This feature of information weapons makes them not a proper subject matter for a total (or partial) ban. By their features and consequences, unqualified cyberattacks are more suitable to be regulated by regimes other than LOAC for the time being. As demonstrated by the final UN GGE report, leading SCO members, including China, Russia, and Kazakhstan, no longer dispute the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict, although controversies over, for example, the qualification of single cyber exchange as attacks under the meaning of LOAC, remain unsettled. Hence, the SCO members may continue to advance the broad interpretation of “attack” to build up consensus for new norms while resisting the application of the existing LOAC rules on the threshold of armed attacks.\n\n## III.B. Dual-use infrastructure and war-sustaining facilities\n\n47. As a “cardinal principle”¹²¹ of LOAC, the principle of distinction requires that a distinction be made between military and civilian persons and objects and prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. Article 52(1) of Additional Protocol I defines “civilian objects” in a negative manner as “all objects which are not military objectives”.¹²² Military objectives are those “by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage”.¹²³ According to Rule 39 of the Tallinn Manual, an object cannot be civilian and military simultaneously; its status is either one or the other.¹²⁴ Therefore, the entire dual-use object becomes a military objective from the moment it is used for military action, even if its military use is only “marginal” compared to its civilian use. Such observation represents today’s prevailing view on the qualification of dual-use objects as targetable military objectives.¹²⁵\n\n¹²¹ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, 257, para.78.\n¹²² Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 52(1).\n¹²³ Ibid., Art. 52(2).\n¹²⁴ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, Rule 39 and its Commentary, para.1.\n¹²⁵ See Droege, above n.107, 562; Michael Schmitt, The Law of Cyber Targeting, Tallinn Paper No.7 (2015), 11.",
    "Chinese JIL (2021)\n\n48. From the perspective of civilian protection, the “potentially non-lethal nature of cyberweapons”¹²⁶ draws concerns over an “expanded target list”¹²⁷ and an obscured assessment of the legality of an attack. In a world where a large part of civilian infrastructure and services are highly reliant on international cyber infrastructure, including the Internet, servers, routers, cables, satellites, and computers, the danger of loss of function, partial damage or complete destruction is evident. For example, approximately 98% of US government communications use civilian-owned and civilian-operated networks.¹²⁸ Under LOAC, belligerent parties can easily target cyber infrastructure as military objectives because mere containing, storing, or transmitting a tiny percentage of military data would render the entire infrastructure a legitimate target.\n\n49. Several scenarios of consequences of attacks against dual-use cyber infrastructure entail humanitarian concerns for civilian protection. The past decade witnessed the increasing use of cloud computing, the users of which are usually unaware of which server their data is stored on and whether military data is stored on the same server. Cyberspace is an artificial battlefield, where, unlike natural theatres of war, such as land or airspace, travelling military data or weapons (e.g., malware, botnet, or malicious codes) can make not only itself a legitimate target but also the transmitting infrastructure a military objective. It can be a computer system, a communication network, a server or router, a major cable, a satellite, or in the worst case, the entire Internet network system.¹²⁹\n\n50. The Tallinn Manual provides that “the circumstances under which the Internet in its entirety could be attacked [are] so highly unlikely as to render the possibility purely theoretical at the present time”, and that “virtually any attack against the Internet would have to be limited to certain discrete segments thereof”.¹³⁰ Nevertheless, it also acknowledges that “it may be impossible to know over which part of the network military transmissions, as distinct\n\n126 Jeffrey T.

In such cases, the entire network (or at least those aspects in which transmission is reasonably likely) qualifies as a military objective.”¹³¹\n\n51. In the physical world, the irrelevance of dual-use objects’ civilian part regarding the principle of distinction is no longer in dispute. In cyberspace, the broad interpretation might lead to extreme situations where nothing civilian remains. More importantly, being a military objective will incur not only attacks in cyberspace but also fatal kinetic attacks. As a result, the fundamental rule that civilian population and objects enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations becomes an empty shell, leaving such situations only subject to protection under the principles of proportionality and precaution.\n\n52. Almost all States and legal commentators agree that the element of “make[s] an effective contribution to military action” in Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I includes a contribution towards “war-fighting” or “war-supporting” capabilities of the belligerent party.¹³² War-fighting objects refer to those used in combat, while war-supporting objects are what military operations rely on in some “relatively direct sense”.¹³³ In the cyber context, typical war-supporting objects are factories producing hardware or software or other kinds of information weapons,¹³⁴ all of which qualify as military objectives. Controversy on this element concentrates on the “war-sustaining” object policy of the US, which has been adopted by a few States so far.¹³⁵ The majority of Tallinn Manual independent experts refused to include war-sustaining objects into military objectives due to the remote relationship between them and military operations.¹³⁶\n\n53. The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations of the US extends the expression of Article 52(2) to “effectively contribute to the enemy’s war-fighting or war-sustaining capability”.¹³⁷ The term “war-sustaining” encompasses objects within “an economy or governmental financial system”\n\n¹³¹ Ibid., para.3.\n¹³² Schmitt, above n.125.\n¹³³ Ibid.\n¹³⁴ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n¹³⁵ Schmitt, above n.125, 12.\n¹³⁶ Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 131, para.16.\n¹³⁷ Department of the Navy and Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, NWP 1-14M/MCWP 5-12.1/COMDTPUB P5800.7A (July 2007), para.8.2.",

The different effects of cyberattacks and kinetic ones might make cyberattacks against war-sustaining objects more effective in achieving the expected military goal. Using cyber operations to paralyze the infrastructure upon which a central banking system is built, or delete funds from accounts, or change account balances, or manipulate the stock market, will lead to a collapse of the enemy’s confidence. According to the applicable law, many of such cyber operations may not even qualify as attacks under LOAC. Despite the unique advantage of cyberattacks, the military advantage of cyber operations on war-sustaining objects might be indefinite and difficult to articulate.¹⁴² Critiques of war-sustaining objects within the sphere of traditional warfare can apply indiscriminately to cyberspace. There would be no limits to warfare, providing that substantially the entire economy of a country can be considered as war-sustaining.¹⁴³ Consequently, a much broader scope of military objectives that include the enemy’s research and development capabilities would devastate the humanitarian values upheld by the principle of distinction.\n\n55.

Unless there is a breakthrough in law, attacks against major cyber infrastructure would remain subject to the legal safeguards for civilian protection embodied in the principles of proportionality and precaution. As with Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, targeting highly dangerous infrastructure, such as dams, dikes, and nuclear electrical generating stations, violates the established rule enshrined in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I, which explicitly prohibits targeting listed infrastructure even if they constitute military objectives.\n\n56. Some may argue that, instead of denying the existing law, a government should assume its responsibility to ensure that military data or weapons do not taint civilian facilities. Unfortunately, the present level of technology and the indiscrepable relationship between civilian and military components in global cyberspace holds little promise for such complete separation.\n\n57. Another alternative proposal pertinent to the Chinese scholars’ argument is to expand the list of “works and installations containing dangerous forces” in Article 56 of Additional Protocol I by analogy so that critical cyber infrastructure could not be made targetable objects.¹⁴⁴ But the hurdle for adequate State support for this effort remains high. It would be difficult to convince States that the potentially nonlethal effects of attacks on cyber infrastructure could be made comparable to that of radioactive materials leak or flood.\n\n58. China has never embraced the “war-sustaining” approach. As demonstrated by the SCO Agreement’s definition of war, China’s perception of threats to the safety and normal functionality of its cyber infrastructure is more oriented towards cyber operations below the threshold of attacks under LOAC. In other words, a lower bar of attacks capable of triggering the application of LOAC is demanded. Meanwhile, the Chinese scholars who expressed concerns over allowing attacks against dual-use and war-sustaining objects under LOAC might want to remove these objects from LOAC’s list of legitimate military objectives. To simultaneously realize the objectives of the SCO members and the mentioned Chinese scholars would require any cyber operations falling under the SCO Agreement’s definition to only attack objects exclusively used for military purposes and dual-use objects that are neither highly dangerous nor counted as cyber infrastructure.

    "Chinese JIL (2021)\n\nmight significantly reduce the legitimate functioning space for cyberattacks and prevent them from doing what they are best at, namely, accomplishing military advantage precisely without causing non-reversible damages of critical civilian infrastructure and having the potential to stay non-violent and reduce collateral losses. Such consequences turn out to be contrary to the humanitarian intentions of these Chinese scholars to reduce the harms suffered by victims of war.\n\n## III.C. Proportionality of cyberattacks against infrastructures\n\n59. Given that the interconnectedness of military networks and their heavy reliance on civilian cyber infrastructure has left the principle of distinction virtually empty of contents, the principle of proportionality becomes an ultimate rule for protecting civilian persons and objects. This principle prohibits attacks “which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.145 In light of the harsh challenges imposed by the unique features of cyber warfare, the actual role that the principle of proportionality can play could not be overstated.\n\n60. Under LOAC, what can be considered as “excessive” incidental damage to civilian objects in comparison with the expected concrete and direct military advantage remains controversial. The principle of proportionality is “more easily stated than applied in practice”. As a matter of fact, findings of excessive incidental damage to civilian infrastructure are very few and far between as compared to the military advantage.146 Moreover, the proportionality assessment in LOAC is made ex-ante when expected collateral damage is weighed against the anticipated military damage.147 The practical difficulties in ascertaining the expected effects of cyber operations prevent commanders from precisely assessing the potential collateral damages to civilian objects. How to apply this principle in cyberspace hinges on the development of both legal interpretation and technology, the uncertainty of which may jeopardize\n\n145 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 51(5)(b).\n\n146 ICTY, Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (13 June 2000), para.19 (www.icty.org/x/file/Press/nato061300.pdf).\n\n147 Schmitt, above n.125, 19.",

In the digital era, incidental damages to civilian objects will no longer be limited to physical ones but also the loss of functionality of civilian cyber infrastructure. Therefore, in order to accommodate the special needs of cyber warfare, several opinions calling for modifications of the assessment of “collateral damages to civilian objects” have emerged. For example, it is suggested that more weight should be given to temporary consequences regarding cyberattacks, for the temporary incapacity of critical systems would incur more severe consequences than mere inconvenience, such as in situations where loss of life may be caused by the inability of hospitals to communicate vital information.¹⁴⁸ But existing LOAC fails to provide any legal basis for this. The paradoxical applicable law is described as:\n\nwhereas the destruction of a single civilian car would amount to legally relevant, albeit rather insignificant, ‘collateral damage’, the disconnection of thousands or millions of households, companies and public services from the Internet or other communication services, or the severance of online financial transactions for a country’s entire economy and the corresponding economic and societal effects as such would not count as relevant elements to be factored into the proportionality calculus.¹⁴⁹\n\n62. Similarly, some scholars propose to include “knock-on effects” of cyber-attacks in the proportionality calculations when such an effect would not have occurred “but for” the attack.¹⁵⁰ “Knock-on effects” refer to those generated by the initial effects of the attack.¹⁵¹ Both the 1990-1992 Gulf War and the NATO action in the former Yugoslavia illustrate that the knock-on effects of targeting electricity grid may cause more harm to the affected civilians than the direct effect of these attacks themselves.¹⁵² Although existing law has not touched upon this issue, most scholars seem to agree that knock-on effects\n\n¹⁴⁸ Oona Hathaway, et al., The Law of Cyber-Attack, 100 California LR (2012), 851.\n¹⁴⁹ Geiß &amp; Lahmann, above n.144, 397.\n¹⁵⁰ Michael Schmitt, Heather Harrison Dinniss &amp; Thomas C.

Commentary to Rule 51 of the Tallinn Manual includes both direct and indirect effects of attacks in the proportionality assessment.[154] The former means “the immediate, first-order consequences, unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms”, and the latter refers to “the delayed and/or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms”. Without deliberately using the same term, the Tallinn Manual adopts the “knock-on effects” approach, factoring “any indirect effects that should be expected by those individuals planning, approving, or executing a cyberattack” into the proportionality evaluation.[155] Such indirect effects can be exemplified by accidents involving transportation systems or malware inserted into a military computer system spread to other civilian computer systems and thereafter disables them, where those risks are or should have been expected. Such indirect effects may result from blocking the Global Positioning Satellite data or disrupting the Global Positioning System.[156] Inconvenience, irritation, stress, or fear caused by cyber operations are explicitly excluded from collateral damages to civilian objects.[157]\n\n64. The Chinese scholars' view on the theoretical and practical difficulties in applying the present law on proportionality concurs with the mainstream view among international law commentators. The Tallinn Manual's rules and commentaries on this principle are early attempts to codify the prevailing treaty interpretation, contributing to an enhanced relief valve of attacks against critical cyber infrastructure. The Chinese scholars' critiques of Rule 80 of the Tallinn Manual, which permits attacks against highly dangerous infrastructure, were not made in conjunction with Rule 51, becoming an interpretation out of context. The proportionality assessment under existing law disillusions those who wish to use it to make up for the failure of rules regarding the principle of distinction in protecting civilian safety. If the applicable LOAC rules regarding the principles of distinction and proportionality remain unchanged, the principle of precaution would be the only safeguard left.\n\n153 Schmitt, above n.150.\n154 Tallinn Manual, above n.21, 160, para.6.\n155 Ibid.\n156 Ibid.\n157 Ibid., para.5.",

Article 51(3) of the Additional Protocol I¹⁵⁸ and Article 13(3)¹⁵⁹ of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts provides that, if civilians engage in conducts amounting to “direct participation in hostilities”, their protection against direct military attacks would be suspended. In cyber warfare, “for such time” as civilians directly participate in hostilities, they not only become legitimate targets of military operations but also are bound by LOAC rules governing the conduct of hostilities. Furthermore, such civilians should not be factored into the proportionality calculation. They are not considered for the principle of precaution that aims to avoid or minimize incidental harm to civilians.¹⁶⁰\n\n66. Civilians may be targeted for direct participation in hostilities. Currently, given the complexity of this issue, there is no authoritative guidance on which activities qualify as direct participation.¹⁶¹ The present State practice, the jurisprudence of international judicial bodies and prevailing academic views adopt a case-by-case determination method through exemplification rather than illustration.¹⁶² To address when civilians may be targeted, the ICRC sponsored a five-year research project in 2003 and produced its *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law* (“Interpretive Guidance”).¹⁶³\n\n67. In this document, the ICRC proposes three “constitutive elements” of direct participation in hostilities: (1) an act that negatively impacts the enemy’s military effort, or in which harm is intended (threshold of harm); (2) a relatively direct nexus between that act and the resulting harm, or that act constituting an “integral part” of a coordinated military operation likely to cause the said harm (direct causation), and (3) linkage to the armed conflict\n\n---\n\n158 Additional Protocol I, above n. 100, Art. 51(3).\n\n159 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, 1125 UNTS 609 (7 December 1978), Art. 13(3).\n\n160 Melzer, above n.109, 27.\n\n161 Michael Schmitt, Deconstructing Direct Participation in Hostilities: The Constitutive Elements, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 699.\n\n162 Ibid., 705-09.\n\n163 ICRC, Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under International Humanitarian Law (prepared by Nils Melzer) (May 2009) (www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf).",

There is no reason to distinguish cyber operations from kinetic operations regarding how civilian conducts qualify as direct participation in hostilities, as most controversies are not cyber-specific. Critiques of the Interpretive Guidance in conventional warfare do not necessarily stand in cyberspace. According to the “threshold of harm” element, an act amounting to hostility does not have to qualify as an attack within the meaning of LOAC, which indispensably entails the infliction of death, injury, or destruction on military personnel and objects. “Essentially any consequence adversely affecting the military operations or military capacity” of an opposing party would satisfy the test.¹⁶⁷ Compared to the difficulties in arming civilians with traditional weapons, the technical barrier to cyber armed civilians is almost non-existent. It is too easy for civilians to have the know-how to conduct harmful cyber activities.¹⁶⁸ Therefore, in cyber warfare, “the pool of targetable individuals could be extremely large in future conflicts, far more than is the case in classic conflict.”¹⁶⁹\n\n69. Espionage activities, including gathering and disseminating intelligence of military tactics and operations by cyber means, or hacking into the enemy system to identify enemy vulnerabilities, would both suffice. Engaging in developing cyber defence systems, such as encryption technology, firewalls or anti-virus software, also falls under this category. However, the element of “direct causation” defines them as causing only “indirect harm” because such individual conduct “merely builds up or maintains the capacity of a party to\n\n164 Ibid., 46.\n\n165 See, i.e., Kenneth Watkin, Opportunity Lost: Organized Armed Groups and the ICRC “Direct Participation in Hostilities” Interpretive Guidance, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 641-95; Schmitt, above n.161, 697-740; Bill Boothby, “And for Such Time as”: The Time Dimension to Direct Participation in Hostilities, 42 NYU JILP (2010), 741-68; W.

Nevertheless, the unique features of cyber warfare demand particular attention paid to certain issues in cyberspace. Commentators questioned the rationality of the ICRC's interpretation of the term \"for such time\" when a direct participant can be targeted.172 The ICRC provides that this period covers preparatory measures of a specific act of direct participation, deployment to or return from the activity concerned.173 They argued that the restrictive interpretation has dramatically narrowed the window of targetability, rendering this standard particularly impractical in cyber warfare.174 There is usually no deployment to or return from cyber operations since most of them are controlled remotely.\n\n71. More importantly, the duration of cyber operations can be extremely short, sometimes even too brief to identify the attacker.175 Or, in some cases, for example, a surreptitiously emplaced logic bomb, the effect of cyber operations can be long-delayed.176 A better approach is suggested to cure this deficiency:\n\nTo characterise an individual who engages in multiple cyber operations that are part of an on-going cyber campaign as a direct participant targetable throughout the period of activity. Once the individual definitively withdraws from participation, he or she regains their protection from attack, and not before.177\n\nThis approach seems more promising but might still lead to scary consequences.

As the debate continues, any resolution must grant sufficient consideration to the safety of civilians.\n\n72. Cyber warfare also presents peculiar questions to the controversy over which members of an organized armed group are targetable between the ICRC and the NATO members. Members of organized armed groups are the other category of civilians that are legitimate targets of military operations.^[178]^ According to the Interpretive Guidance, only those with a “continuous combat function” can be attacked.^[179]^ The NATO members and Israel favour including all members of a group formed to conduct hostilities.^[180]^ These countries criticize the requirement of “continuous combat function” as affording greater protection to members of organized groups than members of the armed forces, whereas the former enjoy no right to engage in hostilities while the latter does.^[181]^ In the human-made theatre in cyberspace, where distinguishing members of organized armed groups from civilians can be far more difficult and uncertain than on physical battlefields, the additional requirement of ensuring that a member performs “continuous combat function” seems impractical and unnecessary. After all, LOAC’s presumption of civilian status in the case of doubt has offered adequate protection for such members.^[182]^\n\n73. At first sight, the Chinese scholars’ view tends to see the problem as a practical one of attribution and verification rather than one of law. Nonetheless, such difficulties give rise to debates about legal issues specific to cyber warfare. To the degree that the targetability of civilians is concerned, the critiques of the Interpretive Guidance mainly stem from practical difficulties, before or at the moment of targeting, in distinguishing members of armed groups or civilians directly participating in hostilities from civilians.\n\n74. For capacity-building or -maintaining conduct that involves espionage or development activities by cyber means, it would be premature to argue that China is willing to waive its right to attack civilians that severely harm its military operation or capacity. But given its general defensive stance on security\n\n178 Melzer, above n.109, 29.\n179 Above n.163, 71.\n180 See Michael Schmitt, The Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities: A Critical Analysis, 1 Harvard Nat’l S J (2010), 21-24.\n181 Schmitt, above n.171, 100.\n182 Additional Protocol I, above n.100, Art. 50(1).",

If China ends up agreeing with the applicability of LOAC rules on this issue, it might favour the ICRC’s restrictive standard of “for such time” and “continuous combat function”, not only because of China’s defensive rather than offensive approach to the use of force, but also because of its humanitarian considerations to protect the lives of a large number of civilians relate—occupationally to activities that have a bearing on military operations, or personally to someone occasionally carrying out conduct of hostilities—from lethal attacks.\n\n75. For the purpose of civilian protection, the better approach for States turns out to be recruiting only military personnel, ideally with uniforms and other distinctive marks, for military operations by cyber means. While accessible in theory, the transformation of non-State cyber actors into national forces would be time-consuming. As a reminder, the privateers were not completely abandoned by States until the time when the maritime powers had developed strong navies, which were capable of forcing the armed merchants who refused to integrate into the navy to put down their weapons in exchange for State protection on the high seas and defeating privates and enemy fleets.^[183]^\n\n## IV. The objectives of China’s normative proposals\n\n76. Based on its limited number of available official statements and practices, China’s opposition to the applicability of some LOAC rules in cyberspace remains vague and general from a legal perspective. The SCO Agreement’s expansive version of cyber “war” indicates that China’s earlier position did not distinguish armed conflicts from other situations, although the application of LOAC hinges on such a differentiation. Apart from the catchall interpretation of cyberattacks, many Chinese scholars expressed concerns over the adequacy of the LOAC rules governing the targetability of dual-use infrastructure and certain groups of civilians and the principle of proportionality. These concerns are not groundless both in terms of law and practice. In fact, the ICRC’s views on the three issues, or even some corresponding rules of the Tallinn Manual, address their concerns well. The practice of the US and its allies that China opposes has not hardened into customary international law binding on all\n\n^[183]^ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering: A Historical Analogy, Cyber Studies Programme Working Paper No. 1 (March 2015), 3-6, 9 (www.politics.ox.ac.uk/publications/cybersecurity-and-the-age-of-privateering-a-historical-analogy.html).",

These facts have contributed to China's incremental acceptance of the general applicability of LOAC to the cyber context despite many remaining controversies over how specific LOAC rules should be interpreted and applied to cyber operations.\n\n77. As with China's concerns over the Tallinn Manual's overemphasis on the military paradigm of responses to cyberattacks in international legal discourse, which threatens to derogate from the principle of non-use of force and to abuse the right to self-defence, a more diverse group of experts was composed to draft the second version of the Tallinn Manual, to address the criticisms of the limited diversity of the group of experts participating in drafting the first version of the Tallinn Manual[184] and this group's overreliance on Western legal sources.[185] There were three non-Western experts from China, Belarus and Thailand, among the nine experts who participated in the formulation process of Tallinn Manual 2.0.[186] The scope of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 expands from \"above the threshold\" cyber operations whose \"scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force\"[187] or which are \"executed in the context of an armed conflict that [is] subject to the LOAC\"[188] to \"below the threshold\" cyber operations that take place in peacetime and fall outside the regulatory scope of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello.\n\n78. The threshold of use of force functions as a firewall that separates cyber operations which can trigger the exercise of the right to self-defence by a victim State from cyber operations that can entail only pacific countermeasures. As previously mentioned, a major concern of China points to the Tallinn Manual's threshold on which cyber operations constitute use of force within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.

Rule 69 and Rule 71 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 were drafted by the International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual and incorporated in the second version without being discussed by the experts of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Rule 69 stipulates the “scale and effects” approach.¹⁸⁹ Rule 71 provides that only “a State that is the target of a cyber operation that rises to the level of an armed attack may exercise its inherent right of self-defence”.¹⁹⁰ The International Group of Experts of the Tallinn Manual reached a consensus that the scale of effects of cyber operations causing physical consequences can be considered as comparable to those of kinetic operations and hence the use of force under the *jus ad bellum*.¹⁹¹ But they contested over the status of cyber operations that have no consequences in the physical world but can lead to serious consequences.¹⁹²\n\n80. Some Western scholars identified the failure of Rule 69 to include cyber operations having no physical consequences but can cause temporary suspension of operational functionality,¹⁹³ result in alteration and destruction of data or code,¹⁹⁴ or involve “psychological operation” and “cyber espionage”,¹⁹⁵ as a major shortcoming of the Tallinn Rules.¹⁹⁶ Accordingly, they considered the definition of “use of force” adopted by the Tallinn Rules\n\n189 Ibid.\n\n190 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, Rule 71, 339.\n\n191 See, e.g., Ido Kilovaty, Virtual Violence-Disruptive Cyberspace Operations as “Attacks” Under International Humanitarian Law, 23 Michigan Telecomm &amp; Tech LR (2016), 145-46.\n\n192 See above n.184, Fleck, 336-37; Kilovaty, 116.\n\n193 Tallinn Manual 2.0, above n.21, 21; Michael N.

Consequently, the victim State’s response in most cases would be limited to measures falling below the threshold of use of force, such as countermeasures²⁰¹ or referring the matter to the UNSC.²⁰² By far, the International Group of Experts who drafted the Tallinn Rules have identified only the Stuxnet attack as meeting the Tallinn threshold of use of force; some experts considered it as meeting the higher “scale and effects” threshold of an armed attack that can trigger the application of LOAC.²⁰³ Even American military lawyers and scholars, who are deemed by their Chinese counterparts as seeking to militarize cyberspace through lowering the threshold of use of force, have admitted that, “the prevailing view is that most, if not all, documented cyber actions taken by States to date have fallen below the ‘use of force’ threshold.”²⁰⁴ Apart from the narrowly construed right to self-defence in situations of armed conflicts, Rule 20 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides a broader right of States to take countermeasures in time of peace, “whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal\n\n197 Ibid.\n198 Ibid., 591.\n199 Above n.21, Tallinn Manual, Rule 15; Tallinn Manual 2.0, Rule 73.\n200 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, 351-53; Eichensehr, above n.185, 587.\n201 Tallinn Manual 2.0, n.21, Rule 20, 161.\n202 Ibid., Rule 76, 357.\n203 Ibid., 342.\n204 Gary Corn &amp; Eric Jensen, The Technicolor Zone of Cyberspace–Part I, Just Security (30 May 2018) (www.justsecurity.org/57217/technicolor-zone-cyberspace-part/).",

The narrow construction of the right to self-defence and countermeasures under the Tallinn Rules demonstrates the reluctance of the International Group of Experts to permissibly authorize a State to undertake unilateral acts that would result in effects in the territory of another State, in another word, a strong pro-sovereignty inclination of the Tallinn Rules. In contrast, the US and the UK argued that sovereignty did not by itself constitute a specific rule of international law that cyber operations might violate, but rather a foundational principle of international law that undergirds specific rules of international law, such as the prohibition against the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the rule of non-intervention under customary international law. In these two countries’ view, such a principle has no binding effect, and low-scale cyber operations deployed by a State that generate effects in another State’s territory but do not breach any of these specific rules, do not violate international law merely because of their incompatibility with the abstract principle of sovereignty.²⁰⁷ This controversy over the status of sovereignty remains unsettled in the final UN GGE report mainly due to the UK’s active participation in the UN GGE. Yet NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations released in 2020 has endorsed the status of sovereignty as a rule of international law in a footnote, with the UK as the only NATO member having reserved on that footnote.²⁰⁸\n\n83. Therefore, although the Tallinn Rules were developed under the auspices of NATO, they represent neither the exceptional perspectives of some States such as the US or the UK nor the collective views of the NATO members.

The technological difficulties in credibly attributing responsibility for cyber operations, the ongoing controversies over which existing rules apply to cyberspace, their contents, the suitability of the prevailing international legal framework as the primary method to regulate inter-State behaviour in cyberspace, and political and strategic considerations that have prevented States from making public attributions and invoking their rights to take responsive measures, all have contributed to the “wait and see” approach adopted by most States towards utilizing rules and norms of international law, including the Tallinn Rules, to regulate cyber operations.²¹¹ These factors cast doubt over the ripeness of codifying applicable international law in these areas. The limited State practice and opinio juris partly explain China’s “wait and see” stance, which is in line with the mainstream approach in order to preserve a degree of operational flexibility in the face of technological development and the dynamic international environment.²¹²\n\n85. To summarize, China’s long-term insistence on the non-applicability of the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules to cyberspace does not only conform to the development trend of international normative discourses but also contributes to fuelling this momentum. Sovereign control of cyberspace has been increasingly reviving, and the focus of international legal discourse has shifted from the military paradigm concentrated on the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to the prism of general rules of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime.

However, there are two residual concerns of China not reflected in the mainstream State practice following the publication of the two versions of the Tallinn Manual. They are underscored by the elements of cyber sovereignty proposed by China that call for the prohibition of using ICT, information and communications networks to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression or arms race, and the OEWG resolution's reiteration of the need for introducing additional rules of behaviour regarding States' right to combat interference in their internal affairs through the dissemination of false and distorted news and States' duty to abstain from engaging in such activities. One is external threats posed by more powerful States which may utilize their digital advantages to threaten China's national security and social stability, and the other is external limitations, either from emerging norms of international law or other established powers, of China's exercise of regulatory power over content transmitted in cyberspace to combat such threats.\n\n87. Therefore, in addition to the mentioned concerns addressed by the mainstream State practice, China has employed its generalized and vague resistance to the applicability of some rules of the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello to cyberspace as bargaining leverage to achieve another two objectives in international legal discourse: (1) to build up consensus for a new treaty regulating all use of cyber forces, or a disarmament treaty banning all or at least some types of information weapons, and (2) to block the formation of new law that would limit its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace and prevent disfavoured existing law from binding on its exercise of sovereign power in cyberspace.\n\n## IV.A. A disarmament treaty &amp; national security\n\n88. The first objective of China's opposition to an explicit affirmation of the right to self-defence and the applicability of some LOAC rules to the cyber context, namely, to build up consensus for a disarmament treaty on the use of information weapons under the auspice of the UN, emanates from the nature of States' right to self-defence. It is an inherent right reserved for States to",
    "Chinese JIL (2021)\n\nresort to force by its own decision after the enshrinement of a general prohibition of uses of force in the UN Charter.²¹³\n\n89. As evidenced by the controversies over anticipatory self-defence in the drafting processes of the Tallinn Rules, diverse concepts and practices regarding the preconditions for the commencement of self-defence and the limitations to the exercise of this right have been invoked and contested by States. Whether Article 51 of the UN Charter allows anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defence before an armed attack occurs has long been a major point of contention. The US, the UK, Israel and some other States have construed Article 51 in a permissible manner by referring to the Caroline doctrine under customary international law, based on which they have often resorted to force. The UNSC has condemned some of such practices; the International Court of Justice took the restrictive view in the judgments of the Corfu Channel case,²¹⁴ the Nicaragua case,²¹⁵ and other decisions afterwards.²¹⁶ The restrictive approach limits States' right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter to situations where an armed attack has already taken place, excluding anticipatory self-defence. From the perspective of the degree of compliance, the effectiveness of the general prohibition of use of force is questionable. But none of these States supporting permissive interpretations dares to bluntly admit the existence of a violation or defy this universally accepted rule, although they always use various factual and legal arguments to justify their breaches.\n\n90. In the same vein, it is not practically feasible to ensure effective observance of a norm prohibiting use of force in cyberspace, especially by these States that are frequent invokers of anticipatory self-defence. Therefore, what China and other SCO members seek is rather to influence the norm-formulation process at the UN that reflects how the international community of States characterizes a situation or act in question, e.g., as a violation of the proposed norm, and whether most States have a willingness to suppress such dubious acts. In the interim, China has not come up with a clear and concrete stance on how to develop a standard resembling Article 2(4) and Article 51 of the UN Charter in judging the legality and legitimacy of State behaviour concerning use of cyber force.

Cyber disarmament is more unrealistic in today's international political environment than the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in light of the recent backlashes against the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons provoked by the Iran and North Korea nuclear crises. All nuclear-weapon States except China, which abstained, voted against a UNGA resolution proposing to convene the first UN conference aimed at achieving a legally binding ban on nuclear weapons.²¹⁷ On 22 January 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first multilateral agreement that bans nuclear weapons, entered into force. Although 85 States have signed and 50 of them have ratified this treaty, the non-participation of all nine States possessing nuclear weapons renders the efficacy of the treaty questionable.²¹⁸ Additionally, as manifested by Cuba's objection to an endorsement of the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, the States that do not enjoy conventional military superiority over their adversaries may have asymmetric advantages in cyberspace, which they are reluctant to give up.²¹⁹ Therefore, a cyber disarmament treaty would lack the support of both major cyber powers and the rest of the weaker cyber-armed States.\n\n92. In the aftermath of the Snowden Disclosures in 2013 and the WikiLeaks disclosures lasting from mid-2016 to date, a rising trend of nationalism has taken place in many countries that used to stand in line with the US-EU camp, such as Brazil and Germany, pushing these countries to start thinking how to defend their \"data sovereignty\". The rise of cybersecurity nationalism has undermined international norm-making efforts, including trade negotiations between the EU and the US and the US attempts to promote norms of Internet freedom globally.²²⁰ There is no reason that cybersecurity discourse would stay intact.\n\n²¹⁷ Tariq Rauf, 2017: The Year in Which Nuclear Weapons Could be Banned?, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Commentary (20 March 2017) (www.sipri.org/commentary/essay/2017/2017-year-which-nuclear-weapons-could-be-banned).\n\n²¹⁸ See generally, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (22 January 2021) (www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-on-the-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons/).\n\n²¹⁹ Arun M.

    "Chinese JIL (2021)\n\n93. Given the unique features of cyber operations and the Internet, even a treaty in the style of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons would have little practical significance in deterring the abuse and misuse of force in cyberspace. The refrainment of most States, including the US, in most cyber tensions with other States, from resorting to the prevailing international legal framework in dealing with inter-State cyber relations, highlights the limitations of normative approaches in functioning as a general taboo for irresponsible activities in cyberspace by not only State but also private actors.\n\n94. Compared to conventional and nuclear weapons, the technical barriers to entry in cyber warfare are so low that non-State actors and countries that are conceivably weak by the standards of hard powers can play a significant role on par with powerful countries at low levels of cost. Cyberattacks can be conducted by any actor having an electronic device and connected to the Internet. The interconnectivity of the network enables any actor to stay geographically remote from where they commit cyberattacks. Simultaneously, unlike classic military operations that rely upon territorial linkages, this interconnectivity severely decreases the degree of State control over actors and activities. The life of a treaty, particularly a disarmament treaty, rests in its enforcement. The construction of a credible monitoring and enforcement mechanism would prove to be the utmost hurdle for a cyber disarmament treaty.\n\n95. Probably having realized the lack of feasibility and political will among States to negotiate a cyber disarmament treaty, China has softened, to some degree, its stance against the alleged militarization of cyberspace. In the most up-to-date white paper on China's military strategy issued in 2015, China plans to \"expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defence [...] so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability\".[221] The ISCC further confirms that \"enhanced defence capability in cyberspace is an important part of China's endeavour to modernize its national defence and armed forces\",[222] while restricting China's development of a cyber force to defensive capability.[223]\n\n221 State Council Information Office, China's Military Strategy (May 2015), Chapter IV: Building and Development of China's Armed Forces (www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-05/26/content_20820628_4.htm).\n\n222 ISCC, above n.17, Chapter III: Strategic Goals.\n\n223 Ibid., Chapter I: Opportunities and Challenges &amp; Chapter III: Strategic Goals.",
    "Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 307\n\n## IV.B. Sovereign control over the Internet vs non-intervention\n\n96. The changes in the global context of disarmament and China's position regarding use of force in the cyber context have rendered the proposed second objective of China more salient. The central bone of contention in the normative competitions between the SCO members and the Western powers rests upon whether information and data transmitted in cyberspace shall be made subject to the jurisdiction of the territorial State, although both sides have reached a consensus on the applicability of sovereignty as part of international law in cyberspace. At the core of this debate is how to draw the lines between the realms of domestic law and international law as consensual erosion of State sovereignty to be applied equally to all States.\n\n97. The US holds the view that, although sovereignty gives a State the right to control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory, the exercise of such jurisdiction by the territorial State, encompassing the use and access to the Internet, must comply with that State's obligations under applicable international law, particularly international human rights law. While noting that the freedom of expression may be restricted in situations such as the incitement of imminent terrorist violence, the US considers \"certain censorship and content control, including blocking websites simply because they contain content that criticizes a leader, a government policy, or an ideology, or because the content espouses particular religious beliefs\" as constituting State violations of international human rights law.²²⁴\n\n98. China likely views this reference to international human rights law as a pretext for Western attempts to conceptually undermine the scope of sovereign powers by narrowing the content of *domaine réservé* in the context of Internet governance. China claims for cyber sovereignty that includes not only cyber infrastructure within its territory but also its jurisdiction over data and the regulation and monitoring of the content of information flowing over cyberspace.²²⁵ Consciously aware that the scope of a State's internal matters and the international legal limitations to that State's exercise of sovereign power over internal matters evolve over time, China has consistently resisted non-reciprocal and non-voluntary restrictions on its exercise of sovereignty.\n\n²²⁴ Egan, above n.45, 15-17.\n\n²²⁵ See, e.g., National Security Law of the People's Republic of China (2015), art. 25; XI Jinping, Keynote Speech at the opening ceremony of the 2nd World Internet Conference (16 December 2015) (www.wuzhenwic.org/2015-12/16/c_47521.htm).",

From Beijing's perspective, the nature of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as a product formulated under the domination of Western powers was not changed solely by the increased diversity in the composition of the International Group of Experts participating in the drafting process, because the newly-added matters reflect foremostly Western perspectives and concerns. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 does not touch upon the sovereignty of a State over potential data; it only mentions sovereign power over any cyber infrastructure located within States' territory and activities associated with that cyber infrastructure. Similar problems exist in the Tallinn Rules concerning jurisdiction, which overwhelmingly emphasize the limitations imposed by international human rights law to the exercise of sovereignty in cyberspace.²²⁶\n\n100. In the domestic sphere, China invokes cyber sovereignty to underpin its regulation over data and information in cyberspace. As shown in the SCO Agreement's wording of \"mass psychologic brainwashing to destabilize society and State, as well as to force the State to take decisions to the interest of an opposing party\", China is always wary of potential foreign interference. The propaganda and liaison roles played by online social networking servers, such as Facebook and Twitter, in the \"Arab Spring\" that led to social unrest, political turmoil and regime-changes in Northern African and Western Asian countries, and the exposure of the massive surveillance by the US National Security Agency in the PRISM program have strengthened the Chinese conviction of the need for Internet censorship to block and filter information in cyberspace that is harmful to China's social stability and national security.²²⁷ In the trend of the global revival of cyber sovereignty, China strengthens its sovereignty-based regulatory power by referring to similar censorship practices of other States, such as the US, Australia, Italy, Germany, France, the UK, and Korea that once held opposing views, regarding the information about terrorism, incitement to hate crimes, pornography, violence and other crimes involving the usage of the Internet.²²⁸\n\n101.

Google's withdrawal from the Chinese market in 2010 was a representative example of the former means where a leading multinational company threatened the Chinese government for a policy change under the instructions of some Western countries.²²⁹ Additionally, the Chinese government has been alarmed by soft law norms applicable in peacetime that are proposed by some Western countries, such as relevant code of conduct on responsible State behaviour in cyberspace at the 2016-2017 UN GGE meetings. Such non-binding norms are intended to circumvent the advocacy of Russia and China to formulate new rules to regulate State behaviour regarding cybersecurity in the form of a treaty at the forum of the UN and may gradually harden into binding law.²³⁰\n\n102. This argument likely explains why Cuba, Russia and China refused to explicitly affirm the right to self-defence and the applicability of international humanitarian law in the cyber context in the 2017 UN GGE report, while having accepted the general applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace since the publication of the 2015 UN GGE consensus report. The crucial factor that prevented these States from reaching a consensus with the Western countries was the opposing camp's intention to introduce \"clear and direct statements on how international law applies to States' use of ICTs\"²³¹ in the UN GGE report, which threatened to restrict States' right to regulate the content of and access to information. The UN GGE report is a non-binding statement, but it may serve as proof of State practice and *opinio juris* in ascertaining whether certain international law applies to a participating State signing onto the consensus report and the extent to which the included law limits the endorsing State's right to regulate domestic affairs. Although these countries have recognized the applicability of LOAC to cyber operations during an armed conflict upon the adoption of the final UN GGE report, residual disagreements over how specific LOAC rules apply to ICT-related activities remain prominent between them and the Western countries.\n\n²²⁹ HUANG, above n.227, 34.\n²³⁰ HUANG Zhixiong, Norms of Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace: Origin, Impact and Response, 1 Dangdai Faxue [Contemporary LR] (2019), 68-69.\n²³¹ Korzak, above n.70.",
    "Chinese JIL (2021)\n\n103. The law governing the right to self-defence and means and methods of warfare is dominated by the practice of remarkably few established powers because the major ground of resorting to anticipatory self-defence and a large portion of LOAC is customary international law, which has been developed by these “specially affected” States to advance their interests.²³² For newly rising powers such as China, failing to meet the requirements of “persistent objector” before and after the birth of a rule at concern would not relieve their obligation to comply. A successful example where a contrary practice of a large number of weaker States makes a few powerful States switch from an established rule of customary international law to an emerging new rule is rare.²³³ It is extremely difficult for a militarily disadvantaged State that lacks field experience to replicate such a strategy in areas involving force.\n\n104. To prevent coercive erosions of its sovereignty, China’s strategy is to embed a firewall at the most representative and democratic lawmaking forum to obstruct the convenient transplantation of power disparity from the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to the special regimes of international law that constitute cornerstones of an evolving global system of Internet governance. A treaty negotiated at a more egalitarian forum such as the UNGA would enable the Chinese perspectives to carry greater weight in forming international law among a large number of similarly disadvantaged countries. And lawmaking in the form of treaty allows a less advanced State such as China to pick and choose elastically from treaties and their provisions according to its goals.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\n105. To summarize, the above analyses suggest that behind China’s general and vague opposition to an explicit affirmation of the applicability of specific LOAC rules to cyberspace and the right of self-defence in cyberspace is China’s profound concern that doing so would acquiesce to the encroachment of its sovereignty and unlock Pandora’s box of coercive external interferences with its independence in determining the mode of domestic Internet governance and the path of development.\n\n106.

    "Jiang, Decoding China's Perspectives on Cyber Warfare 311\n\nwarfare so as to build up a competitive advantage against the established powers? At first glance, Beijing's long-term resistance to confirming the applicability of existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* to cyberspace before the adoption of the final UN GGE report, amid the exaggerated normative rivalry between the Russia-China Camp and the US-EU Camp, appeared to corroborate this argument. However, closer scrutiny reveals that, the conceptual generalization and ambiguity in China's resisting stance stems from the same premises underpinning the mainstream \"wait and see\" approach of most States towards utilizing international law as the primary means to regulate or justify their cyberoperations. Following the \"wait and see\" trend of State practice, China has agreed to the general applicability of the *jus ad bellum*, the *jus in bello*, and law on State responsibility for international wrongful acts, but still resists the applicability of some specific rules in cyberspace, e.g., the right to self-defence and some LOAC rules, to allow for flexibility in responding to cyber technology development in attribution and the evolvement of international law.\n\n107. Despite the recent developments in its cyber defensive capacity, China remains disadvantaged as a rising power with weaker military capacity and less normative influence. China's normative proposals, exemplified by the ICCIS, serves more as bargaining leverage to protect itself from being bound by the existing or emerging law supported by the established powers, but unfavourable to itself, and also to move the focus of international legal discourse from the paradigm of military responses to cyberattacks concentrated in the *jus ad bellum* and the *jus in bello* to that of international law governing State behaviour in peacetime. China's normative efforts are largely defensive, given that Beijing chooses to prioritize its interests in defending against possible use of force either triggered by an alleged cyberattack or carried out in the means of cyber operations, over its offensive interests in staying less constrained in the use of cyber force.\n\n108. Because of the special features of how existing *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello* were made, the normative influence of China and its SCO allies is not sufficient, at this moment, to change the practice of the frequent users of force, to come up with a norm promising effective observance by these States, or to veto the formation of new law proposed by these States at concern. The return of sovereign control in cyberspace and the focus shift of international legal discourse result from a set of factors, e.g., the limitations of current technologies and existing law, with the normative efforts of the SCO members having contributed to this global trend.",
    "Chinese JIL (2021)\n\n109. But these countries can still resist the imposition of non-consensual norms upon themselves in the domain of cyberspace, obstruct the codification of disfavoured norms, and influence how other States characterize and respond to a situation involving cyber operations. This is why the seemingly unfeasible idea of an international cyber disarmament treaty concluded under the framework of the UN remains on the table. The UNSC's monopoly of authorizing the use of force and the UNGA's feature as one of the most egalitarian forums for international lawmaking make the UN the favourable forum relied on by rising powers such as China to build resilience against other lawmaking processes where established powers play a greater role, e.g., the development of customary international law or soft law in less representative forums."

This article argues that China’s resistance to applying some rules of the jus in bello to cyberspace is in line with the “wait and see” approach of most States. But there are two distinctive objectives behind this generalized stance: one is to protect its domestic regulatory power over cyberspace from being bound by disfavoured emerging and existing law, and the other is to build up consensus for a treaty regulating uses of cyber force under the United Nations framework.",
