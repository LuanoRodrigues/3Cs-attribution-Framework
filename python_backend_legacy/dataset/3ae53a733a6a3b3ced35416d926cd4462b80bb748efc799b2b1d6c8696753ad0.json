More specifically, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence against another State if the attack has been committed by the latter's organs or agents or has been committed by non-State actors tolerated by that State. When no State is implicated in the cyber attack, the victim State can take direct self-defence action against the non-State actor. It is however noted that future State practice may amplify further the attribution standards or introduce new standards.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe term ‘cyber attack’ is used to describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace,¹ but this article will concern itself only with those cyber operations whose aim is to degrade, disrupt, deny or destroy information resident in computers, or to compromise the computers themselves.²\n\nSuch attacks produce not only effects which are internal to a computer or network but also effects which are external thereto by harming connected systems, facilities, materials or people. For example, a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, altering information concerning the position of aeroplanes, produces direct effects on the air traffic control system itself by compromising its operation; but it also demonstrates external effects, by causing air accidents resulting in material destruction and human loss. In fact, such effects may have been the primary aim of the cyber attack.\n\n* Professor of International Law and Security, University of Glasgow. Email: nicholas.tsagourias@glasgow.ac.uk.

It tries to trace back the cyber attack to its source and ascribe it to an author against whom action can be taken. Attribution is thus crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness. The latter aspect of attribution is the focus of this article. More specifically, this article will examine the attribution standards that need to be satisfied in order for a State to use force by way of self-defence against a cyber attack. It is necessary therefore to consider in the first place under what circumstances a cyber attack can activate a State’s right to self-defence.\n\n## 2. Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\n\nWhat distinguishes a cyber attack as defined above from other cyber provocations such as cyber exploitations is its harmful effect, in that a cyber attack makes the targeted system unavailable or compromises its integrity and authenticity.⁶ The immediate question is whether such effects are in themselves sufficient to trigger self-defence in the absence of other material and/or human harm.\n\nFor this reason, it is important to recall the circumstances under which self-defence can be exercised. These are prescribed in Article 51 of the UN Charter and in the customary international law of self-defence. Both branches of the law seem to agree that what triggers the right to self-defence is an armed attack. Although no definition of what constitutes an armed attack is provided in\n\n³ National Security Council, *The Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative* (2009) <http: cybersecurity=\"\" comprehensive-national-cybersecurity-initiative=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012); *A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: National Security Strategy* (HMSO 2010); *The UK Cyber Security Strategy Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world* (Cabinet Office 2011).\n\n⁴ NATO, ‘NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement’ Expert Report (17 May 2010) 45.\n\n⁵ White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World* (May 2011) <http: default=\"\" files=\"\" rss_viewer=\"\" international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf=\"\" sites=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) 14.\n\n⁶ HS Lin, ‘Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force’ (2010) 4 J Nat Sec Law and Policy 63, 64–68.</http:></http:>",

This of course presupposes a definition of what constitutes 'critical infrastructure'. Although there is no universally accepted definition, it seems that most definitions agree that certain services such as security, food, water, transportation, banking and finance, health, energy, governmental and public services constitute critical infrastructure. The 2001 Patriot Act defines critical infrastructure as 'systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters'. In the view of the present writer, a cyber attack on critical state infrastructure which paralyses or massively disrupts the apparatus of the State should be equated to an armed attack, even if it does not cause any immediate human injury or material damage. For example, an attack on a State's financial system which, by modifying or corrupting data, causes massive disruption to the economic life of a State, should qualify as an armed attack. The situation is similar to the conventional destruction of weapons. It is not their physical destruction as such but their unavailability in the sense of not being able to fulfil the purpose for which they have been set that makes an attack on them an armed attack.\n\n7 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v USA) (Merits) [1986] ICJ Rep 14 para 39 (Nicaragua Case).\n8 ibid paras 191-95.\n9 Y Dinstein, 'Computer Network Attack and Self-Defence' in MN Schmitt and BT O'Donnell, Computer Network Attack and International Law (US Naval War College, 2002) 99ff; MN Schmitt, 'Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-Defence, and Armed Conflicts' in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy (National Research Council, National Academies Press 2010) 151ff.

More specifically, following the decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet era war memorial, governmental and banking websites were hit by a directed denial of service (DDoS) attack in 2007.¹² Similarly, in 2008, Georgian governmental websites were hit by a DDoS attack which coincided with the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Georgia in August of that year. Those attacks did not cause any human or material damage and the disruption that they did cause was contained and was manageable. The view that they did not amount to armed attack is also supported by the fact that in the case of Estonia Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which provides for collective self-defence action if a Member State has been attacked was not invoked but the whole incident was mainly treated under criminal law.¹³\n\nRelated to the above is the question of whether a cyber attack on a State's military infrastructure can per se constitute an armed attack. Such an attack would satisfy the self-defence criteria if it causes grave harm which, as was suggested above, does not need to be material or human harm but massive disruption that debilitates the State will also suffice. For example, a cyber attack that disables a State's command and control system can be equated to an armed attack because it disables the decision-making nerve of the State. Of course such an attack can also be a prelude to a kinetic attack in which case the right of pre-emptive self-defence arises.\n\nBe that as it may, identifying the specific cyber act that constitutes the armed attack is very important because cyber attacks are often 'multi-layered' in that the malicious infiltration of the system, the execution of the payload and the production of the harmful effects may take place in different time frames. If an attack is defined as such by its harmful effects including its debilitating effects, an attack would exist from the moment the harmful effects materialize irrespective of when the system has been infiltrated or the payload has been executed. However, if a State becomes aware of the fact that its systems have been compromised, it can take passive or active cyber defence measures to neutralize the threat. A State may even treat the infiltration as a prelude to a cyber or kinetic attack if information exists indicating that the penetration is part of an overall attack. In this case a State can resort to pre-emptive self-defence if all other means of neutralizing the cyber threat fail.\n\nThere is finally the question of whether cyber incidents that do not rise to the level of an armed attack as far as their gravity is concerned can trigger forcible reactions. 'Low intensity' cyber incidents are perhaps more likely to happen because they require less technical sophistication or means. The harm they\n\n¹² E Tikk, K Kaska and L Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence 2010) 14–33.\n\n¹³ NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Annual Session 2009, Committee Report 173 DSCFC 09 E bis-‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ <http: default.asp?shortcut=\"1782\" www.nato-pa.int=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) paras 58–61.</http:>",

If one is to follow the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, such low-level attacks do not amount to armed attack for self-defence purposes and the only option available to the victim State is to take proportional and non-forcible countermeasures.¹⁴ Whether this is reasonable depends on the circumstances, but if the underlying strategy behind the low-intensity attacks and their cumulative effects are taken into account, one may reach a different conclusion. For example, frequent—albeit mildly disruptive attacks—on a State’s financial system may cause limited damage; but the cumulative effect may be substantial if overall trust in the system is destroyed, which may have been the aim of the individual attacks. It is perhaps in such cases that the accumulation of minor cyber provocations could rise to the level of an armed attack for self-defence purposes.\n\n# 3. Attribution: Technical and Political Aspects\n\nIf a cyber attack can activate the right of self-defence, what is important is to assign the attack to an author against whom self-defence action will be taken. Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks—as the case of terrorism demonstrates—and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain. Three particular characteristics of cyberspace make attribution extremely difficult. The first is ‘anonymity’ in that cyber attackers can hide their identity; the second is the possibility of launching multi-stage cyber attacks, in that a number of computers operated by different people and placed in different jurisdictions are infiltrated before an attack is launched; and the third is the speed with which a cyber attack can materialize. What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack; and it is especially critical that all of the above are done in a timely manner and accurately.¹⁵ To give an example, the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85 000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries,¹⁶ which makes the eventual identification of the physical operators of the computers and, above all, of the coordinators or real masterminds behind the attack, very difficult.\n\nAttribution of cyber attacks is thus a multifaceted process; it has technical, legal and political aspects, with each aspect feeding into the other. I will deal with the legal aspects of attribution in the next section but it is important to explain the technical and political aspects of attribution first.\n\n¹⁴ Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 249.

Moreover, certain systems—such as ‘Tor’, used by the military—anonymize their user. As a result, although technical attribution can yield good results it can never be absolutely exact and, moreover, it cannot always identify the person who operated the machine or her/his affiliations.¹⁷ For this reason, in addition to technical investigation, intelligence and information analysis is needed in order to profile the authors of the attack, and to provide information about their capabilities and intentions or their links with States or other entities.¹⁸ As was aptly noted in the context of weapons of mass destruction, but which applies also to cyber war, ‘ultimately the central issue is assessment by the risk-averse security specialists of one international actor of the intentions of another actor’.¹⁹ To this end, the political climate within which the attack took place or who benefited from the attack need also to be taken into account.\n\nFrom the above it transpires that attribution combines technical investigation with intelligence and political assessments.\n\nThis however gives rise to questions about the availability and the probity of evidence upon which assessments are made. With regard to the availability of evidence, it is often difficult to obtain evidence concerning security matters or the evidence that becomes available is often truncated. In the Nicaragua Case the ICJ recognized that problem when it said that ‘the problem is not… the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State… but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator’.²⁰ In the case of a cyber attack this will be compounded by the speed of the attack, its anonymity, the possibility of ‘spoofing’, as well as the fact that it may have travelled through many different jurisdictions—in which case collecting evidence may not be physically possible, or may counter many legal as well as political hurdles.²¹ In the Corfu Channel Case the ICJ recognized the difficulties in furnishing evidence if the territory is under the control of another State and for this reason, the Court allowed ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.²²\n\n¹⁷ W Earl Boebert, ‘A Survey of Challenges in Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 43–48.\n¹⁸ ibid 49–50.\n¹⁹ WM Reisman and A Armstrong, ‘The Past and Future of the Claim of Preemptive Self-Defense’ (2006) 100 AJIL 525, 526.\n²⁰ Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 57.\n²¹ With regard to the Estonian attacks, see Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 27–28.\n²² Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 9, 18 (Corfu Channel Case).",

International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence.²³ The only generic threshold that perhaps exists is that ‘claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive. The same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts’.²⁴ This standard is less strict than the ‘beyond any doubt’ or ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’²⁵ standard but is higher than the ‘balance of evidence’ or the ‘balance of probabilities’.²⁶ However, how can even that standard be satisfied if evidence relies on intelligence information—as it usually does—which can be withheld or be severely truncated because of its confidential nature? If the ICJ’s practice regarding confidential evidence is of any value, it demonstrates a lack of serious probing. In the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, for example, as in the *Corfu Channel Case*,²⁷ the Court did not even demand the production of classified documents by the Respondent²⁸—a failure criticized by one of the judges because the document could have ‘shed light on the central questions of intent and attributability’.²⁹\n\nFrom the above it transpires that standards concerning the availability and probity of evidence in cases involving armed attacks, uses of force or interventions are rather lax and are even more so in the case of cyber attacks because of their particular characteristics as mentioned above. That said, even if the standard of proof is not the same as the one required for the criminal prosecution of individuals³⁰ and even if ‘a more political approach to attribution…might accept less exacting standards’;³¹ it should be stressed that a State should not resort to self-defence on the basis of casual evidence or wild political inferences.\n\n²³ Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v USA) (Merits) [2003] ICJ Rep 161 para 30 (Oil Platforms Case).\n\n²⁴ *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia) [2007] ICJ Rep 43 para 209 (Bosnia Genocide Case); Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins (n 23) para 33.

International Law Criteria on Attribution\n\nAssuming now that by combining technical investigations and political analysis the cyber attack is assigned to a State, the victim State can lawfully take self-defence action against that State only if international law’s attribution standards for self-defence are also met. From international law and practice, three main attribution standards can be identified: according to the first, attacks by State organs are attributed to that State; according to the second attacks by state agents that is, by entities instructed, directed or controlled by a State are attributed to that State; and according to the third, attacks by entities tolerated by a State are attributed to that State. In all of the above instances, self-defence action can be taken against the implicated State. If none of the above applies but a non-State actor attacks another State, that non-State actor becomes the direct target of the self-defence action.\n\n# A. State Organs\n\nAccording to the first standard, the conduct of state organs is attributed to that State. Thus, if a *de jure* organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces,³² commits a cyber attack, the attack will be attributed to that State, which will then become the lawful target of the self-defence action.\n\nThis attribution standard is premised on the juridical status of the author of the attack and its validity has been affirmed on many occasions. For example, in the *Nicaragua Case* the ICJ attributed to the USA the acts of its own organs whereas in the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, the ICJ examined the question of whether the acts of genocide committed in Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia as being committed by Serbia’s *de jure* organs, but returned a negative answer because the perpetrators were not organs of that State under Serbian internal law.³³\n\nIn addition to the conduct of *de jure* organs, acts of a State’s *de facto* organs are also attributed to that State. A *de facto* organ is an entity that is assimilated to, or is absorbed in, the State apparatus. The ICJ had that in mind when it said in the *Nicaragua Case* that there must be a relationship of complete dependence and control.³⁴ The control that the State should exercise over such an entity in order to be treated as *de facto* organ is the control that is inherent in the relation of dependence and covers all fields of the entity’s activities.³⁵ International\n\n³² Art 4, ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ASR); *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) para 385.\n\n³³ *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) paras 385–95.\n\n³⁴ *Nicaragua Case* (n 7) para 109; *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) paras 390–91, 307.

In the Nicaragua Case, for example, the ICJ did not attribute the acts of the Contras to the USA because it was not satisfied that the Contras were completely dependent on the USA, acting as its de facto organs;⁴⁰ and the ICJ reached the same conclusion in the Bosnia Genocide Case with regard to the Republika Srpska, the VRS and certain other paramilitary militias.⁴¹\n\n## B. State Agents\n\nThe second standard refers to an agency relationship which arises when an entity acts under the instructions, direction or control of a State.⁴² Thus, a cyber attack committed by an entity instructed by a state organ to do so will be attributed to that State. Instructions establish an ad hoc relationship between the entity that commits the cyber attack and the State and, for this reason, instructions should be proven in relation to the specific cyber attack.⁴³ The same is true with regard to directions. In the Tehran Hostages Case for example, the ICJ opined that, in order to attribute to Iran the occupation of the US Embassy by militants, it should establish that the militants ‘acted on behalf of the State, having been charged by some competent organ of the Iranian State to carry out a specific operation’.⁴⁴ In the same vein Judge Ago said in his Separate Opinion in the Nicaragua Case that to determine that persons or groups acted in the name and on behalf of the USA, they must ‘have been specifically charged by the United States authorities to commit a particular act, or to carry out a particular task of some kind on behalf of the United States’.⁴⁵\n\nWhereas there is no disagreement as far as the criterion of instructions or directions is concerned, the criterion of ‘control’ appears more problematic\n\n36 ibid, para 115.\n37 Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) paras 391 and 393.\n38 ibid para 393.\n39 ibid para 394.\n40 Nicaragua Case (n 7) paras 109, 227.\n41 Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 395.\n42 Art 8 ASR.\n43 Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 400.\n44 United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v Iran) [1980] ICJ Rep 3 para 58.\n45 Separate Opinion of Judge Ago, Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 16.",

In the first place, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case introduced a stringent test when it spoke of ‘effective control’.⁴⁶ It will mean that a cyber attack carried out by a group or a person will be attributed to a State only if that State has exerted direct influence on the group or person to commit the attack or has enforced its perpetration. The difference between the case of an attack being committed by an entity under the effective control of a State and a de facto organ is that no relationship of dependence is required in the case of effective control but also, and more importantly, that attribution is premised on the control the State exercises in respect of each specific act whereas in the case of de facto organs it is premised on the control the State exercises over the actor.\n\nThe ICTY in the Tadic case introduced an alternative—lower—threshold. In that case, the ICTY distinguished the cases of individuals and unorganized groups—where effective control is the requisite standard—from that of organized groups, where overall control suffices. A State ‘wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity’ and, in that case, ‘it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law’.⁴⁷ Overall control covers the case where a State exerts general influence over a group and its activities. It would for example attribute to a State a cyber attack mounted by a group of ‘hacktivists’ to which a State has provided technical or other support and organized their activities even if no involvement in the specific attack can be proven. Overall control thus differs from effective control because the latter requires control over the specific act.⁴⁸ It also differs from the de facto organ test because there is no relationship of dependency between the State and that entity.\n\nThat said, in the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ criticized the ‘overall control’ test and reaffirmed the effective control test.⁴⁹ Thus, it held that the acts of genocide were not attributable to Serbia because that State did not exercise effective control over the operations in the course of which the acts took place.⁵⁰ Applying the ICJ’s findings to the case at issue, only cyber attacks carried out by entities under the effective control of a State can be attributed to that State.\n\nIn my view, such a stringent and uniform standard is not warranted but instead the requisite degree of control may differ depending on the context within which the issue of control arises.⁵¹ Such a differentiated approach to ‘control’ is\n\n⁴⁶ Art 8 ASR; Nicaragua Case (n 7) paras 116–17; Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 398.\n⁴⁷ Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 131.\n⁴⁸ ibid paras 131, 137.\n⁴⁹ Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) paras 402–6.\n⁵⁰ ibid paras 413–14.\n⁵¹ Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 117.",

In the first place Article 8 of the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility (ASR) speaks of 'control' without any further qualification whereas the commentary suggests that it should apply with a degree of flexibility.⁵² Moreover, Article 55 ASR acknowledges the existence of special regimes which may have their own rules on attribution and responsibility.⁵³ As far as international jurisprudence is concerned, the effective control criterion was employed in the Nicaragua Case in the context of state responsibility for violations of humanitarian law. The question that the Court had to answer was whether violations of humanitarian law committed by the Contras could be attributed to the USA, engaging its international responsibility. The ICTY on its part introduced the overall control criterion in order to characterize the war in Bosnia as international or non-international. The ICTY searched for the requisite criteria in international humanitarian law and decided to revert to the attribution standards found in the law of state responsibility only when it concluded that humanitarian law does not contain any specific criteria in this regard.⁵⁴ Still, the ICTY diverged from the law of state responsibility and introduced the overall control criterion because in its opinion it was more judicious in the circumstances of the case. In the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ applied the effective control standard in the context of the law of state responsibility. The Court also opined that the rules on attribution 'do not vary with the nature of the wrongful act in question in the absence of a clearly expressed lex specialis'.⁵⁵ This was said in order to rebut the suggestion that the attribution criteria should change when responsibility for genocide is at issue. However, the Court did not deny the existence of special regimes in general or within the law of state responsibility more specifically. Regarding the overall control test, the Court admitted that in the context in which it was pronounced by the ICTY it may have been 'applicable and suitable' and that 'logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues [characterisation of a conflict/state responsibility for genocide] which are very different in nature'.⁵⁶ That said, the ICJ rejected the 'overall control' criterion for the law of state responsibility because it 'stretches too far, almost to a breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State's organs and its international responsibility'.⁵⁷\n\n⁵² J Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility (CUP 2001) 112.\n\n⁵³ For example, art 3 of Fourth Hague Convention and art 91 of Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) (opened for signature 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1979) 1125 UNTS 3 introduce strict liability in international humanitarian law by providing that a State is to be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces.

On the one hand, the rationale behind the regime of state responsibility is to hold States responsible for their wrongful conduct but the regime has recognized the modern, narrower, definition of the ‘state’, and attributes to a State only the acts of those entities that are closely linked to it. At the same time, it recognizes different types of responsibility in view of the different ways in which a State can participate in the commission of a wrongful act.⁵⁸ There also exist various international or national, criminal or civil processes to hold into account such sub-entities or their employees. The rationale behind the use of force regime, on the other hand, is to provide the template according to which force can be lawfully used in international relations. However, the use of force regime is very much State oriented. Even if nowadays non-State actors exist that can use large-scale force against other States, they are located in States and operate from within States. As the ICJ opined, it is important to ‘grasp the reality of the relationship between the person taking action and the state’.⁵⁹ Thus, any form or degree of control by a State over a non-State actor that goes on to attack another State will suffice as for the victim State to use force by way of self-defence against the host State.\n\nThis situation can be distinguished from a situation where a State exercises no control over the non-State actor because it is unable to exert its authority over the whole of its territory or over the non-State actor. In that case, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence directly against the non-State actor.⁶⁰\n\nThat this is the case has long been established in the customary law of self-defence. According to the Caroline Case (which is treated as the source of the customary law on self-defence), a State can use force by way of self-defence directly against non-State actors.⁶¹ Moreover, according to Article 51 of the UN Charter, the self-defence trigger (an armed attack) is determined on the basis of events, not on the basis of its author.⁶²\n\nModern State practice relating to terrorism also affirms this approach to self-defence. For example, in 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hizbollah in Lebanon, following Hizbollah attacks which Lebanon was unable to prevent.⁶³ Lebanon not only denied knowledge of the attacks but also\n\n⁵⁸ See, for example, Art 16 ASR.\n⁵⁹ Bosnia Genocide (n 24) para 392.\n⁶⁰ N Tsagourias, ‘Non-State Actors and the Use of Force’ in J d’Aspremont (ed), Participants in the International Legal System: Multiple Perspectives on Non-State Actors in International Law, (Routledge 2011) 326ff.\n⁶¹ British and Foreign State Papers (James Ridgeway and Sons 1858) vol 30, 196–98.\n⁶² Separate Opinion of Judge Kooijmans in Congo v Uganda (n 24) paras 26–27 and in Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Advisory Opinion) [2004] ICJ Rep 2004, para 35 (Palestinian Wall); E Wilmshurst, ‘The Chatham House Principles of International Law on the Use of Force in Self-Defence’ (2006) 55 ICLQ 963, 969–71.\n⁶³ SC Res 1310 (27 July 2000); SC Res 1337 (30 January 2001); SC Res 1553 (29 July 2004); SC Res 1559 (2 September 2004).",

It would be unreasonable to deny the attacked State the right to self-defence merely because there is no attacker State, and the Charter does not so require’.⁶⁸ The ICJ had another opportunity to deal with the issue of non-State actors but abstained from making any definite pronouncement. In the Congo v Uganda Case, Uganda claimed that its operations against rebels operating from within DRC were lawful self-defence measures in view of DRC’s inability to control its territory.⁶⁹ The ICJ however declared Uganda’s actions disproportionate and as a result it felt that it was not required to opine on the legality of self-defence in response to attacks by irregular forces.⁷⁰ It may be claimed that, had Uganda’s response been proportionate, it would have been a lawful measure of self-defence but this is arguing a contrario.\n\nBe that as it may, the ICJ’s assertion that the author of the armed attack should be a State and that the State should exercise ‘effective control’ over the non-State actor in order for the attack to be attributed to a State may also defeat its purpose which is to maintain peace because non-State actors will be able to attack other States with immunity, hiding behind the shield of the host State’s sovereignty and, conversely, States will be able to attack other States hiding behind non-State actors.\n\n⁶⁴ Letter from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (17 May 1982) UN Doc S/15087; Identical letters from the Chargé d’affaires of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (13 July 2006) UN Doc A/60/938-S/2006/518; Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lebanon pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-2/1* A/HRC/3/2 23 November 2006, paras 42, 54.\n\n⁶⁵ Identical letters from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (12 July 2006) UN Doc S/2006/515.

State Toleration or Unwillingness\n\nAs the case of terrorism has shown, cyber attacks can be mounted on States by non-State actors operating from within a State that tolerates them or is unwilling to suppress their activities. According to international law, a State should not allow 'its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states'71 and more specifically its territory is not to be used for military acts against another State.72 This amounts to a State's duty of due diligence which engages its international responsibility when the State fails in this regard. However, if the harmful act amounts to an armed attack, this transforms the legal characterization of the situation and places it within the use of force paradigm. The question then is whether a State that has suffered a cyber attack mounted by a non-State actor operating from within another State and tolerated by that State can use defensive force against that State. If the ICJ's effective control test were to apply in this case, the victim State would not be able to defend itself. However, it would not be much consolation to the victim State to know that it can hold the host State responsible for breaching its duty of due diligence or that it can take countermeasures against that State, but to still not be able to defend itself.73\n\nIf the duty of due diligence exists in order to protect important international values—such as peace and security—or enforce certain important obligations—such as not to use force—it would be unreasonable not to allow the victim State to defend itself against an armed attack which was suffered because of another State's deliberate failure to exercise due diligence.\n\nThe attribution standard of toleration and unwillingness was thus developed in the use of force regime in order to cover situations such as those described above, which were not hypothetical but real and pressing as the case of terrorist attacks all very often shows.74 For example, when the '9/11' attacks were committed by Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban regime refused to hand over Al-Qaeda leaders, the USA responded by using force by way of self-defence. This happened against a background of the Security Council making frequent demands on the Taliban regime not to provide sanctuary to international terrorists or organizations and to take effective measures in order to ensure that its territory was not used for terrorist activities.75 The US President justified the 2001 action on the basis of self-defence and declared that no distinction was\n\n71 Corfu Channel Case (n 22) 22; Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (23 November 2001); GA Res 55/63 (22 January 2001).\n72 The Alabama Claims (United States v Great Britain) 1872 reprinted in JB Moore, History and Digest of International Arbitrations to which the United States has been a Party Vol 1 (GPO 1898), 495ff.\n73 ME O'Connell, 'Cyber Security without Cyber War' (n 14) s 4.1.\n74 B Simma (ed), The Charter of the United Nations, A Commentary vol 1 (2nd edn, OUP 2002) 802.\n75 SC Res 1267 (15 October 1999) para 1.",

Despite every effort by the United States and the international community, the Taliban regime has refused to change its policy.⁷⁷\n\nThis position was supported by the SC in Resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) which affirmed the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in response to the attacks.\n\nIn the Congo v Uganda Case, it seems that the ICJ has recognized that toleration by a State of non-State actors who go on to mount an attack on another State can give rise to a right of self-defence, although in that specific instance the ICJ could not conclude that the absence of action on the part of DRC was tantamount to toleration.⁷⁸\n\nIn sum, toleration by a State of actors that mount cyber attacks on other States or State unwillingness to suppress their activities will trigger self-defence action against those States. This criterion is in line with the State-centric character of the use of force regime by connecting the attack to the State's overall responsibility over its territory and people.\n\n# 5. Conclusion\n\nIt has been claimed in the preceding sections that attribution is critical for the lawfulness of any self-defence action; but attribution is a complex exercise having technical, political and legal aspects. As far as the legal aspects of attribution are concerned, it has been shown that international law has expanded and adapted the attribution standards that apply to the use of force regime to cater for new situations such as terrorism. The attribution standards as they stand today can very much accommodate cyber attacks for self-defence purposes.\n\nAccordingly, a cyber attack will be attributed to a State if it is perpetrated by a de jure or de facto organ of that State, or by actors under the direction,\n\n⁷⁶ Presidential Address to the Nation (11 September 2001) available at: <http: 09=\"\" 2001=\"\" 20010911-16.html=\"\" news=\"\" georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> (accessed 18 June 2012).\n\n⁷⁷ Letter from the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2001/946 and Letter from the Charge d'affaires ai of the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2006/947 (2001).\n\n⁷⁸ Congo v Uganda (n 22) para 301.</http:>",

More specifically, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence against another State if the attack has been committed by the latter's organs or agents or has been committed by non-State actors tolerated by that State. When no State is implicated in the cyber attack, the victim State can take direct self-defence action against the non-State actor. It is however noted that future State practice may amplify further the attribution standards or introduce new standards.\n## 1. Introduction\nThe term ‘cyber attack’ is used to describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace,¹ but this article will concern itself only with those cyber operations whose aim is to degrade, disrupt, deny or destroy information resident in computers, or to compromise the computers themselves.²\nSuch attacks produce not only effects which are internal to a computer or network but also effects which are external thereto by harming connected systems, facilities, materials or people. For example, a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, altering information concerning the position of aeroplanes, produces direct effects on the air traffic control system itself by compromising its operation; but it also demonstrates external effects, by causing air accidents resulting in material destruction and human loss. In fact, such effects may have been the primary aim of the cyber attack.\n* Professor of International Law and Security, University of Glasgow. Email: nicholas.tsagourias@glasgow.ac.uk.

It tries to trace back the cyber attack to its source and ascribe it to an author against whom action can be taken. Attribution is thus crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness. The latter aspect of attribution is the focus of this article. More specifically, this article will examine the attribution standards that need to be satisfied in order for a State to use force by way of self-defence against a cyber attack. It is necessary therefore to consider in the first place under what circumstances a cyber attack can activate a State’s right to self-defence.\n## 2. Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\nWhat distinguishes a cyber attack as defined above from other cyber provocations such as cyber exploitations is its harmful effect, in that a cyber attack makes the targeted system unavailable or compromises its integrity and authenticity.⁶ The immediate question is whether such effects are in themselves sufficient to trigger self-defence in the absence of other material and/or human harm.\nFor this reason, it is important to recall the circumstances under which self-defence can be exercised. These are prescribed in Article 51 of the UN Charter and in the customary international law of self-defence. Both branches of the law seem to agree that what triggers the right to self-defence is an armed attack.

This of course presupposes a definition of what constitutes 'critical infrastructure'. Although there is no universally accepted definition, it seems that most definitions agree that certain services such as security, food, water, transportation, banking and finance, health, energy, governmental and public services constitute critical infrastructure. The 2001 Patriot Act defines critical infrastructure as 'systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters'. In the view of the present writer, a cyber attack on critical state infrastructure which paralyses or massively disrupts the apparatus of the State should be equated to an armed attack, even if it does not cause any immediate human injury or material damage. For example, an attack on a State's financial system which, by modifying or corrupting data, causes massive disruption to the economic life of a State, should qualify as an armed attack. The situation is similar to the conventional destruction of weapons. It is not their physical destruction as such but their unavailability in the sense of not being able to fulfil the purpose for which they have been set that makes an attack on them an armed attack.\n7 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v USA) (Merits) [1986] ICJ Rep 14 para 39 (Nicaragua Case).\n8 ibid paras 191-95.\n9 Y Dinstein, 'Computer Network Attack and Self-Defence' in MN Schmitt and BT O'Donnell, Computer Network Attack and International Law (US Naval War College, 2002) 99ff; MN Schmitt, 'Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-Defence, and Armed Conflicts' in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy (National Research Council, National Academies Press 2010) 151ff.

Contra Dinstein (n 9) 105 and Buchan (n 9).\nNicholas Tsagourias\nConsequently, neither the attacks on Estonia in 2007 nor those on Georgia in 2008 fall within the definition of armed attack. More specifically, following the decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet era war memorial, governmental and banking websites were hit by a directed denial of service (DDoS) attack in 2007.¹² Similarly, in 2008, Georgian governmental websites were hit by a DDoS attack which coincided with the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Georgia in August of that year. Those attacks did not cause any human or material damage and the disruption that they did cause was contained and was manageable. The view that they did not amount to armed attack is also supported by the fact that in the case of Estonia Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which provides for collective self-defence action if a Member State has been attacked was not invoked but the whole incident was mainly treated under criminal law.¹³\nRelated to the above is the question of whether a cyber attack on a State's military infrastructure can per se constitute an armed attack. Such an attack would satisfy the self-defence criteria if it causes grave harm which, as was suggested above, does not need to be material or human harm but massive disruption that debilitates the State will also suffice. For example, a cyber attack that disables a State's command and control system can be equated to an armed attack because it disables the decision-making nerve of the State. Of course such an attack can also be a prelude to a kinetic attack in which case the right of pre-emptive self-defence arises.\nBe that as it may, identifying the specific cyber act that constitutes the armed attack is very important because cyber attacks are often 'multi-layered' in that the malicious infiltration of the system, the execution of the payload and the production of the harmful effects may take place in different time frames. If an attack is defined as such by its harmful effects including its debilitating effects, an attack would exist from the moment the harmful effects materialize irrespective of when the system has been infiltrated or the payload has been executed. However, if a State becomes aware of the fact that its systems have been compromised, it can take passive or active cyber defence measures to neutralize the threat. A State may even treat the infiltration as a prelude to a cyber or kinetic attack if information exists indicating that the penetration is part of an overall attack. In this case a State can resort to pre-emptive self-defence if all other means of neutralizing the cyber threat fail.\nThere is finally the question of whether cyber incidents that do not rise to the level of an armed attack as far as their gravity is concerned can trigger forcible reactions. 'Low intensity' cyber incidents are perhaps more likely to happen because they require less technical sophistication or means. The harm they\n¹² E Tikk, K Kaska and L Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence 2010) 14–33.\n¹³ NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Annual Session 2009, Committee Report 173 DSCFC 09 E bis-‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ <http: default.asp?shortcut=\"1782\" www.nato-pa.int=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) paras 58–61.</http:>\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 233\ncan cause may also be low. If one is to follow the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, such low-level attacks do not amount to armed attack for self-defence purposes and the only option available to the victim State is to take proportional and non-forcible countermeasures.¹⁴ Whether this is reasonable depends on the circumstances, but if the underlying strategy behind the low-intensity attacks and their cumulative effects are taken into account, one may reach a different conclusion. For example, frequent—albeit mildly disruptive attacks—on a State’s financial system may cause limited damage; but the cumulative effect may be substantial if overall trust in the system is destroyed, which may have been the aim of the individual attacks. It is perhaps in such cases that the accumulation of minor cyber provocations could rise to the level of an armed attack for self-defence purposes.\n# 3. Attribution: Technical and Political Aspects\nIf a cyber attack can activate the right of self-defence, what is important is to assign the attack to an author against whom self-defence action will be taken. Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks—as the case of terrorism demonstrates—and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain. Three particular characteristics of cyberspace make attribution extremely difficult. The first is ‘anonymity’ in that cyber attackers can hide their identity; the second is the possibility of launching multi-stage cyber attacks, in that a number of computers operated by different people and placed in different jurisdictions are infiltrated before an attack is launched; and the third is the speed with which a cyber attack can materialize. What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack; and it is especially critical that all of the above are done in a timely manner and accurately.¹⁵ To give an example, the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85 000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries,¹⁶ which makes the eventual identification of the physical operators of the computers and, above all, of the coordinators or real masterminds behind the attack, very difficult.\nAttribution of cyber attacks is thus a multifaceted process; it has technical, legal and political aspects, with each aspect feeding into the other. I will deal with the legal aspects of attribution in the next section but it is important to explain the technical and political aspects of attribution first.\n¹⁴ Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 249. Also see in this volume ME O’Connell, ‘Cyber Security without Cyber War’ s 4.1.\n¹⁵ DD Clark and S Landau, ‘Untangling Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 25 at 37.\n¹⁶ Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 20, 23.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nRegarding the technical aspects of attribution, although science is continuously developing attribution mechanisms which can trace back the machine that launched the attack, or its geolocation, at the same time, ‘anti-attribution’ mechanisms are also developing which can hide the provenance of the attack. Moreover, certain systems—such as ‘Tor’, used by the military—anonymize their user. As a result, although technical attribution can yield good results it can never be absolutely exact and, moreover, it cannot always identify the person who operated the machine or her/his affiliations.¹⁷ For this reason, in addition to technical investigation, intelligence and information analysis is needed in order to profile the authors of the attack, and to provide information about their capabilities and intentions or their links with States or other entities.¹⁸ As was aptly noted in the context of weapons of mass destruction, but which applies also to cyber war, ‘ultimately the central issue is assessment by the risk-averse security specialists of one international actor of the intentions of another actor’.¹⁹ To this end, the political climate within which the attack took place or who benefited from the attack need also to be taken into account.\nFrom the above it transpires that attribution combines technical investigation with intelligence and political assessments.\nThis however gives rise to questions about the availability and the probity of evidence upon which assessments are made. With regard to the availability of evidence, it is often difficult to obtain evidence concerning security matters or the evidence that becomes available is often truncated. In the Nicaragua Case the ICJ recognized that problem when it said that ‘the problem is not… the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State… but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator’.²⁰ In the case of a cyber attack this will be compounded by the speed of the attack, its anonymity, the possibility of ‘spoofing’, as well as the fact that it may have travelled through many different jurisdictions—in which case collecting evidence may not be physically possible, or may counter many legal as well as political hurdles.²¹ In the Corfu Channel Case the ICJ recognized the difficulties in furnishing evidence if the territory is under the control of another State and for this reason, the Court allowed ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.²²\n¹⁷ W Earl Boebert, ‘A Survey of Challenges in Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 43–48.\n¹⁸ ibid 49–50.\n¹⁹ WM Reisman and A Armstrong, ‘The Past and Future of the Claim of Preemptive Self-Defense’ (2006) 100 AJIL 525, 526.\n²⁰ Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 57.\n²¹ With regard to the Estonian attacks, see Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 27–28.\n²² Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 9, 18 (Corfu Channel Case).\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 235\nThis leads to the second issue, which is the probity of the evidence. International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence.²³ The only generic threshold that perhaps exists is that ‘claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive. The same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts’.²⁴ This standard is less strict than the ‘beyond any doubt’ or ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’²⁵ standard but is higher than the ‘balance of evidence’ or the ‘balance of probabilities’.²⁶ However, how can even that standard be satisfied if evidence relies on intelligence information—as it usually does—which can be withheld or be severely truncated because of its confidential nature? If the ICJ’s practice regarding confidential evidence is of any value, it demonstrates a lack of serious probing. In the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, for example, as in the *Corfu Channel Case*,²⁷ the Court did not even demand the production of classified documents by the Respondent²⁸—a failure criticized by one of the judges because the document could have ‘shed light on the central questions of intent and attributability’.²⁹\nFrom the above it transpires that standards concerning the availability and probity of evidence in cases involving armed attacks, uses of force or interventions are rather lax and are even more so in the case of cyber attacks because of their particular characteristics as mentioned above. That said, even if the standard of proof is not the same as the one required for the criminal prosecution of individuals³⁰ and even if ‘a more political approach to attribution…might accept less exacting standards’;³¹ it should be stressed that a State should not resort to self-defence on the basis of casual evidence or wild political inferences.\n²³ Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v USA) (Merits) [2003] ICJ Rep 161 para 30 (Oil Platforms Case).\n²⁴ *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia) [2007] ICJ Rep 43 para 209 (Bosnia Genocide Case); Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins (n 23) para 33.

International Law Criteria on Attribution\nAssuming now that by combining technical investigations and political analysis the cyber attack is assigned to a State, the victim State can lawfully take self-defence action against that State only if international law’s attribution standards for self-defence are also met. From international law and practice, three main attribution standards can be identified: according to the first, attacks by State organs are attributed to that State; according to the second attacks by state agents that is, by entities instructed, directed or controlled by a State are attributed to that State; and according to the third, attacks by entities tolerated by a State are attributed to that State. In all of the above instances, self-defence action can be taken against the implicated State. If none of the above applies but a non-State actor attacks another State, that non-State actor becomes the direct target of the self-defence action.\n# A. State Organs\nAccording to the first standard, the conduct of state organs is attributed to that State. Thus, if a *de jure* organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces,³² commits a cyber attack, the attack will be attributed to that State, which will then become the lawful target of the self-defence action.\nThis attribution standard is premised on the juridical status of the author of the attack and its validity has been affirmed on many occasions. For example, in the *Nicaragua Case* the ICJ attributed to the USA the acts of its own organs whereas in the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, the ICJ examined the question of whether the acts of genocide committed in Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia as being committed by Serbia’s *de jure* organs, but returned a negative answer because the perpetrators were not organs of that State under Serbian internal law.³³\nIn addition to the conduct of *de jure* organs, acts of a State’s *de facto* organs are also attributed to that State. A *de facto* organ is an entity that is assimilated to, or is absorbed in, the State apparatus. The ICJ had that in mind when it said in the *Nicaragua Case* that there must be a relationship of complete dependence and control.³⁴ The control that the State should exercise over such an entity in order to be treated as *de facto* organ is the control that is inherent in the relation of dependence and covers all fields of the entity’s activities.³⁵ International\n³² Art 4, ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ASR); *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) para 385.\n³³ *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) paras 385–95.\n³⁴ *Nicaragua Case* (n 7) para 109; *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) paras 390–91, 307. See also *Prosecutor v Duško Tadić a/k/a ‘DULE’* (Appeal) ICTY-94-1-A (15 July 1999) para 141 (*Tadić* Appeal).\n³⁵ *Nicaragua Case* (n 7) paras 109, 111.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 237\njurisprudence has not been very specific as to the requisite degree of control over the dependent entity, with the Court in the Nicaragua Case mentioning effective control, in addition to general control³⁶ whereas in the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ spoke of ‘strict control’ or a ‘great degree of control’.³⁷ At any rate, a high degree of control is required because ‘to equate persons or entities with State organs when they do not have that status under internal law must be exceptional’.³⁸ If, however, ‘some qualified, but real, margin of independence’³⁹ exists, the entity does not become a de facto organ and its conduct will not be attributed to a State on that basis. In the Nicaragua Case, for example, the ICJ did not attribute the acts of the Contras to the USA because it was not satisfied that the Contras were completely dependent on the USA, acting as its de facto organs;⁴⁰ and the ICJ reached the same conclusion in the Bosnia Genocide Case with regard to the Republika Srpska, the VRS and certain other paramilitary militias.⁴¹\n## B. State Agents\nThe second standard refers to an agency relationship which arises when an entity acts under the instructions, direction or control of a State.⁴² Thus, a cyber attack committed by an entity instructed by a state organ to do so will be attributed to that State. Instructions establish an ad hoc relationship between the entity that commits the cyber attack and the State and, for this reason, instructions should be proven in relation to the specific cyber attack.⁴³ The same is true with regard to directions. In the Tehran Hostages Case for example, the ICJ opined that, in order to attribute to Iran the occupation of the US Embassy by militants, it should establish that the militants ‘acted on behalf of the State, having been charged by some competent organ of the Iranian State to carry out a specific operation’.⁴⁴ In the same vein Judge Ago said in his Separate Opinion in the Nicaragua Case that to determine that persons or groups acted in the name and on behalf of the USA, they must ‘have been specifically charged by the United States authorities to commit a particular act, or to carry out a particular task of some kind on behalf of the United States’.⁴⁵\nWhereas there is no disagreement as far as the criterion of instructions or directions is concerned, the criterion of ‘control’ appears more problematic\n36 ibid, para 115.\n37 Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) paras 391 and 393.\n38 ibid para 393.\n39 ibid para 394.\n40 Nicaragua Case (n 7) paras 109, 227.\n41 Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 395.\n42 Art 8 ASR.\n43 Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 400.\n44 United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v Iran) [1980] ICJ Rep 3 para 58.\n45 Separate Opinion of Judge Ago, Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 16.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nbecause of an apparent jurisprudential split as to the required degree of control. In the first place, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case introduced a stringent test when it spoke of ‘effective control’.⁴⁶ It will mean that a cyber attack carried out by a group or a person will be attributed to a State only if that State has exerted direct influence on the group or person to commit the attack or has enforced its perpetration. The difference between the case of an attack being committed by an entity under the effective control of a State and a de facto organ is that no relationship of dependence is required in the case of effective control but also, and more importantly, that attribution is premised on the control the State exercises in respect of each specific act whereas in the case of de facto organs it is premised on the control the State exercises over the actor.\nThe ICTY in the Tadic case introduced an alternative—lower—threshold. In that case, the ICTY distinguished the cases of individuals and unorganized groups—where effective control is the requisite standard—from that of organized groups, where overall control suffices. A State ‘wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity’ and, in that case, ‘it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law’.⁴⁷ Overall control covers the case where a State exerts general influence over a group and its activities. It would for example attribute to a State a cyber attack mounted by a group of ‘hacktivists’ to which a State has provided technical or other support and organized their activities even if no involvement in the specific attack can be proven. Overall control thus differs from effective control because the latter requires control over the specific act.⁴⁸ It also differs from the de facto organ test because there is no relationship of dependency between the State and that entity.\nThat said, in the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ criticized the ‘overall control’ test and reaffirmed the effective control test.⁴⁹ Thus, it held that the acts of genocide were not attributable to Serbia because that State did not exercise effective control over the operations in the course of which the acts took place.⁵⁰ Applying the ICJ’s findings to the case at issue, only cyber attacks carried out by entities under the effective control of a State can be attributed to that State.\nIn my view, such a stringent and uniform standard is not warranted but instead the requisite degree of control may differ depending on the context within which the issue of control arises.⁵¹ Such a differentiated approach to ‘control’ is\n⁴⁶ Art 8 ASR; Nicaragua Case (n 7) paras 116–17; Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 398.\n⁴⁷ Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 131.\n⁴⁸ ibid paras 131, 137.\n⁴⁹ Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) paras 402–6.\n⁵⁰ ibid paras 413–14.\n⁵¹ Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 117.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution\nsupported by international jurisprudence and doctrine. In the first place Article 8 of the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility (ASR) speaks of 'control' without any further qualification whereas the commentary suggests that it should apply with a degree of flexibility.⁵² Moreover, Article 55 ASR acknowledges the existence of special regimes which may have their own rules on attribution and responsibility.⁵³ As far as international jurisprudence is concerned, the effective control criterion was employed in the Nicaragua Case in the context of state responsibility for violations of humanitarian law. The question that the Court had to answer was whether violations of humanitarian law committed by the Contras could be attributed to the USA, engaging its international responsibility. The ICTY on its part introduced the overall control criterion in order to characterize the war in Bosnia as international or non-international. The ICTY searched for the requisite criteria in international humanitarian law and decided to revert to the attribution standards found in the law of state responsibility only when it concluded that humanitarian law does not contain any specific criteria in this regard.⁵⁴ Still, the ICTY diverged from the law of state responsibility and introduced the overall control criterion because in its opinion it was more judicious in the circumstances of the case. In the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ applied the effective control standard in the context of the law of state responsibility. The Court also opined that the rules on attribution 'do not vary with the nature of the wrongful act in question in the absence of a clearly expressed lex specialis'.⁵⁵ This was said in order to rebut the suggestion that the attribution criteria should change when responsibility for genocide is at issue. However, the Court did not deny the existence of special regimes in general or within the law of state responsibility more specifically. Regarding the overall control test, the Court admitted that in the context in which it was pronounced by the ICTY it may have been 'applicable and suitable' and that 'logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues [characterisation of a conflict/state responsibility for genocide] which are very different in nature'.⁵⁶ That said, the ICJ rejected the 'overall control' criterion for the law of state responsibility because it 'stretches too far, almost to a breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State's organs and its international responsibility'.⁵⁷\n⁵² J Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility (CUP 2001) 112.\n⁵³ For example, art 3 of Fourth Hague Convention and art 91 of Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) (opened for signature 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1979) 1125 UNTS 3 introduce strict liability in international humanitarian law by providing that a State is to be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces. See also art 59 ASR.\n⁵⁴ Tadic Appeal (n 34) paras 90, 98, 105.\n⁵⁵ Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 401.\n⁵⁶ ibid paras 404-405.\n⁵⁷ ibid para 406.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nThe above bring into light the different rationale of the regimes within which attribution operates. On the one hand, the rationale behind the regime of state responsibility is to hold States responsible for their wrongful conduct but the regime has recognized the modern, narrower, definition of the ‘state’, and attributes to a State only the acts of those entities that are closely linked to it. At the same time, it recognizes different types of responsibility in view of the different ways in which a State can participate in the commission of a wrongful act.⁵⁸ There also exist various international or national, criminal or civil processes to hold into account such sub-entities or their employees. The rationale behind the use of force regime, on the other hand, is to provide the template according to which force can be lawfully used in international relations. However, the use of force regime is very much State oriented. Even if nowadays non-State actors exist that can use large-scale force against other States, they are located in States and operate from within States. As the ICJ opined, it is important to ‘grasp the reality of the relationship between the person taking action and the state’.⁵⁹ Thus, any form or degree of control by a State over a non-State actor that goes on to attack another State will suffice as for the victim State to use force by way of self-defence against the host State.\nThis situation can be distinguished from a situation where a State exercises no control over the non-State actor because it is unable to exert its authority over the whole of its territory or over the non-State actor. In that case, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence directly against the non-State actor.⁶⁰\nThat this is the case has long been established in the customary law of self-defence. According to the Caroline Case (which is treated as the source of the customary law on self-defence), a State can use force by way of self-defence directly against non-State actors.⁶¹ Moreover, according to Article 51 of the UN Charter, the self-defence trigger (an armed attack) is determined on the basis of events, not on the basis of its author.⁶²\nModern State practice relating to terrorism also affirms this approach to self-defence.

It would be unreasonable to deny the attacked State the right to self-defence merely because there is no attacker State, and the Charter does not so require’.⁶⁸ The ICJ had another opportunity to deal with the issue of non-State actors but abstained from making any definite pronouncement. In the Congo v Uganda Case, Uganda claimed that its operations against rebels operating from within DRC were lawful self-defence measures in view of DRC’s inability to control its territory.⁶⁹ The ICJ however declared Uganda’s actions disproportionate and as a result it felt that it was not required to opine on the legality of self-defence in response to attacks by irregular forces.⁷⁰ It may be claimed that, had Uganda’s response been proportionate, it would have been a lawful measure of self-defence but this is arguing a contrario.\nBe that as it may, the ICJ’s assertion that the author of the armed attack should be a State and that the State should exercise ‘effective control’ over the non-State actor in order for the attack to be attributed to a State may also defeat its purpose which is to maintain peace because non-State actors will be able to attack other States with immunity, hiding behind the shield of the host State’s sovereignty and, conversely, States will be able to attack other States hiding behind non-State actors.\n⁶⁴ Letter from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (17 May 1982) UN Doc S/15087; Identical letters from the Chargé d’affaires of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (13 July 2006) UN Doc A/60/938-S/2006/518; Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lebanon pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-2/1* A/HRC/3/2 23 November 2006, paras 42, 54.\n⁶⁵ Identical letters from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (12 July 2006) UN Doc S/2006/515.

State Toleration or Unwillingness\nAs the case of terrorism has shown, cyber attacks can be mounted on States by non-State actors operating from within a State that tolerates them or is unwilling to suppress their activities. According to international law, a State should not allow 'its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states'71 and more specifically its territory is not to be used for military acts against another State.72 This amounts to a State's duty of due diligence which engages its international responsibility when the State fails in this regard. However, if the harmful act amounts to an armed attack, this transforms the legal characterization of the situation and places it within the use of force paradigm. The question then is whether a State that has suffered a cyber attack mounted by a non-State actor operating from within another State and tolerated by that State can use defensive force against that State. If the ICJ's effective control test were to apply in this case, the victim State would not be able to defend itself. However, it would not be much consolation to the victim State to know that it can hold the host State responsible for breaching its duty of due diligence or that it can take countermeasures against that State, but to still not be able to defend itself.73\nIf the duty of due diligence exists in order to protect important international values—such as peace and security—or enforce certain important obligations—such as not to use force—it would be unreasonable not to allow the victim State to defend itself against an armed attack which was suffered because of another State's deliberate failure to exercise due diligence.\nThe attribution standard of toleration and unwillingness was thus developed in the use of force regime in order to cover situations such as those described above, which were not hypothetical but real and pressing as the case of terrorist attacks all very often shows.74 For example, when the '9/11' attacks were committed by Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban regime refused to hand over Al-Qaeda leaders, the USA responded by using force by way of self-defence. This happened against a background of the Security Council making frequent demands on the Taliban regime not to provide sanctuary to international terrorists or organizations and to take effective measures in order to ensure that its territory was not used for terrorist activities.75 The US President justified the 2001 action on the basis of self-defence and declared that no distinction was\n71 Corfu Channel Case (n 22) 22; Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (23 November 2001); GA Res 55/63 (22 January 2001).\n72 The Alabama Claims (United States v Great Britain) 1872 reprinted in JB Moore, History and Digest of International Arbitrations to which the United States has been a Party Vol 1 (GPO 1898), 495ff.\n73 ME O'Connell, 'Cyber Security without Cyber War' (n 14) s 4.1.\n74 B Simma (ed), The Charter of the United Nations, A Commentary vol 1 (2nd edn, OUP 2002) 802.\n75 SC Res 1267 (15 October 1999) para 1.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 243\nto be made between those that committed the attack and those that harboured them.⁷⁶ In the letter to the SC reporting its self-defence action the USA wrote:\nThe attacks on 11 September 2001 and the ongoing threat to the United States and its nationals posed by the Al-Qaeda organization have been made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation. Despite every effort by the United States and the international community, the Taliban regime has refused to change its policy.⁷⁷\nThis position was supported by the SC in Resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) which affirmed the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in response to the attacks.\nIn the Congo v Uganda Case, it seems that the ICJ has recognized that toleration by a State of non-State actors who go on to mount an attack on another State can give rise to a right of self-defence, although in that specific instance the ICJ could not conclude that the absence of action on the part of DRC was tantamount to toleration.⁷⁸\nIn sum, toleration by a State of actors that mount cyber attacks on other States or State unwillingness to suppress their activities will trigger self-defence action against those States. This criterion is in line with the State-centric character of the use of force regime by connecting the attack to the State's overall responsibility over its territory and people.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIt has been claimed in the preceding sections that attribution is critical for the lawfulness of any self-defence action; but attribution is a complex exercise having technical, political and legal aspects. As far as the legal aspects of attribution are concerned, it has been shown that international law has expanded and adapted the attribution standards that apply to the use of force regime to cater for new situations such as terrorism. The attribution standards as they stand today can very much accommodate cyber attacks for self-defence purposes.\nAccordingly, a cyber attack will be attributed to a State if it is perpetrated by a de jure or de facto organ of that State, or by actors under the direction,\n⁷⁶ Presidential Address to the Nation (11 September 2001) available at: <http: 09=\"\" 2001=\"\" 20010911-16.html=\"\" news=\"\" georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> (accessed 18 June 2012).\n⁷⁷ Letter from the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2001/946 and Letter from the Charge d'affaires ai of the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2006/947 (2001).\n⁷⁸ Congo v Uganda (n 22) para 301.</http:>\nNicholas Tsagourias\ninstructions or control of a State, or by actors tolerated by a State. When the territorial State is, however, unable to prevent the attacks or the actors that perpetrated the attack operate independently of a State, the attack will be attributed to the actor itself, which will become the target of the self-defence action.\nThat having been said, it should be stressed that evolving State practice in this area may expand or adapt the attribution standards that apply to cyber attacks and thus the current standards should not be regarded as fixed or immutable.",

More specifically, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence against another State if the attack has been committed by the latter's organs or agents or has been committed by non-State actors tolerated by that State. When no State is implicated in the cyber attack, the victim State can take direct self-defence action against the non-State actor. It is however noted that future State practice may amplify further the attribution standards or introduce new standards.\n## 1. Introduction\nThe term ‘cyber attack’ is used to describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace, but this article will concern itself only with those cyber operations whose aim is to degrade, disrupt, deny or destroy information resident in computers, or to compromise the computers themselves.\nSuch attacks produce not only effects which are internal to a computer or network but also effects which are external thereto by harming connected systems, facilities, materials or people. For example, a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, altering information concerning the position of aeroplanes, produces direct effects on the air traffic control system itself by compromising its operation; but it also demonstrates external effects, by causing air accidents resulting in material destruction and human loss. In fact, such effects may have been the primary aim of the cyber attack.\n* Professor of International Law and Security, University of Glasgow. Email: nicholas.tsagourias@glasgow.ac.uk.

Responses may vary: they may be conventional or cyber and they may be passive, for example making networks and particularly those of critical national infrastructure more secure, or they may be active, for example employing cyber or kinetic force to offset a cyber attack. As the US President declared: ‘[a]ll states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners’.\nA crucial issue in any response is to identify the source of the particular cyber attack and this is what attribution tries to do. It tries to trace back the cyber attack to its source and ascribe it to an author against whom action can be taken. Attribution is thus crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness. The latter aspect of attribution is the focus of this article. More specifically, this article will examine the attribution standards that need to be satisfied in order for a State to use force by way of self-defence against a cyber attack. It is necessary therefore to consider in the first place under what circumstances a cyber attack can activate a State’s right to self-defence.\n## 2. Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\nWhat distinguishes a cyber attack as defined above from other cyber provocations such as cyber exploitations is its harmful effect, in that a cyber attack makes the targeted system unavailable or compromises its integrity and authenticity. The immediate question is whether such effects are in themselves sufficient to trigger self-defence in the absence of other material and/or human harm.\nFor this reason, it is important to recall the circumstances under which self-defence can be exercised. These are prescribed in Article 51 of the UN Charter and in the customary international law of self-defence. Both branches of the law seem to agree that what triggers the right to self-defence is an armed attack. Although no definition of what constitutes an armed attack is provided in\n National Security Council, *The Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative* (2009) <http: cybersecurity=\"\" comprehensive-national-cybersecurity-initiative=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012); *A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: National Security Strategy* (HMSO 2010); *The UK Cyber Security Strategy Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world* (Cabinet Office 2011).\n NATO, ‘NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement’ Expert Report (17 May 2010) 45.\n White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World* (May 2011) <http: default=\"\" files=\"\" rss_viewer=\"\" international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf=\"\" sites=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) 14.\n HS Lin, ‘Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force’ (2010) 4 J Nat Sec Law and Policy 63, 64–68.</http:></http:>\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution\nthe Charter, it has been accepted that an armed attack is a use of force, defined as such by its gravity and its effects rather than by the instrument used.7 As the ICJ put it, an armed attack is the 'most grave form of the use of force' in view of its scale and effects.8 Consequently, a cyber attack that causes substantial human and/or material destruction can be equated to an armed attack for purposes of self-defence.9 That would be the case, for example, when a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, or a cyber attack on a nuclear reactor, caused substantial material or human destruction.\nA more difficult question is whether attacks on critical state infrastructure which cause substantial disruption but no physical or human damage could also constitute an armed attack for self-defence purposes. This of course presupposes a definition of what constitutes 'critical infrastructure'. Although there is no universally accepted definition, it seems that most definitions agree that certain services such as security, food, water, transportation, banking and finance, health, energy, governmental and public services constitute critical infrastructure. The 2001 Patriot Act defines critical infrastructure as 'systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters'. In the view of the present writer, a cyber attack on critical state infrastructure which paralyses or massively disrupts the apparatus of the State should be equated to an armed attack, even if it does not cause any immediate human injury or material damage. For example, an attack on a State's financial system which, by modifying or corrupting data, causes massive disruption to the economic life of a State, should qualify as an armed attack. The situation is similar to the conventional destruction of weapons. It is not their physical destruction as such but their unavailability in the sense of not being able to fulfil the purpose for which they have been set that makes an attack on them an armed attack.\n\nNicholas Tsagourias\nConsequently, neither the attacks on Estonia in 2007 nor those on Georgia in 2008 fall within the definition of armed attack. More specifically, following the decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet era war memorial, governmental and banking websites were hit by a directed denial of service (DDoS) attack in 2007. Similarly, in 2008, Georgian governmental websites were hit by a DDoS attack which coincided with the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Georgia in August of that year. Those attacks did not cause any human or material damage and the disruption that they did cause was contained and was manageable. The view that they did not amount to armed attack is also supported by the fact that in the case of Estonia Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which provides for collective self-defence action if a Member State has been attacked was not invoked but the whole incident was mainly treated under criminal law.\nRelated to the above is the question of whether a cyber attack on a State's military infrastructure can per se constitute an armed attack. Such an attack would satisfy the self-defence criteria if it causes grave harm which, as was suggested above, does not need to be material or human harm but massive disruption that debilitates the State will also suffice. For example, a cyber attack that disables a State's command and control system can be equated to an armed attack because it disables the decision-making nerve of the State. Of course such an attack can also be a prelude to a kinetic attack in which case the right of pre-emptive self-defence arises.\nBe that as it may, identifying the specific cyber act that constitutes the armed attack is very important because cyber attacks are often 'multi-layered' in that the malicious infiltration of the system, the execution of the payload and the production of the harmful effects may take place in different time frames. If an attack is defined as such by its harmful effects including its debilitating effects, an attack would exist from the moment the harmful effects materialize irrespective of when the system has been infiltrated or the payload has been executed. However, if a State becomes aware of the fact that its systems have been compromised, it can take passive or active cyber defence measures to neutralize the threat. A State may even treat the infiltration as a prelude to a cyber or kinetic attack if information exists indicating that the penetration is part of an overall attack. In this case a State can resort to pre-emptive self-defence if all other means of neutralizing the cyber threat fail.\nThere is finally the question of whether cyber incidents that do not rise to the level of an armed attack as far as their gravity is concerned can trigger forcible reactions. 'Low intensity' cyber incidents are perhaps more likely to happen because they require less technical sophistication or means. The harm they\n E Tikk, K Kaska and L Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence 2010) 14–33.\n NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Annual Session 2009, Committee Report 173 DSCFC 09 E bis-‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ <http: default.asp?shortcut=\"1782\" www.nato-pa.int=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) paras 58–61.</http:>\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 233\ncan cause may also be low. If one is to follow the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, such low-level attacks do not amount to armed attack for self-defence purposes and the only option available to the victim State is to take proportional and non-forcible countermeasures. Whether this is reasonable depends on the circumstances, but if the underlying strategy behind the low-intensity attacks and their cumulative effects are taken into account, one may reach a different conclusion. For example, frequent—albeit mildly disruptive attacks—on a State’s financial system may cause limited damage; but the cumulative effect may be substantial if overall trust in the system is destroyed, which may have been the aim of the individual attacks. It is perhaps in such cases that the accumulation of minor cyber provocations could rise to the level of an armed attack for self-defence purposes.\n# 3. Attribution: Technical and Political Aspects\nIf a cyber attack can activate the right of self-defence, what is important is to assign the attack to an author against whom self-defence action will be taken. Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks—as the case of terrorism demonstrates—and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain. Three particular characteristics of cyberspace make attribution extremely difficult. The first is ‘anonymity’ in that cyber attackers can hide their identity; the second is the possibility of launching multi-stage cyber attacks, in that a number of computers operated by different people and placed in different jurisdictions are infiltrated before an attack is launched; and the third is the speed with which a cyber attack can materialize. What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack; and it is especially critical that all of the above are done in a timely manner and accurately. To give an example, the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85 000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries, which makes the eventual identification of the physical operators of the computers and, above all, of the coordinators or real masterminds behind the attack, very difficult.\nAttribution of cyber attacks is thus a multifaceted process; it has technical, legal and political aspects, with each aspect feeding into the other. I will deal with the legal aspects of attribution in the next section but it is important to explain the technical and political aspects of attribution first.\n Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 249. Also see in this volume ME O’Connell, ‘Cyber Security without Cyber War’ s 4.1.\n DD Clark and S Landau, ‘Untangling Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 25 at 37.\n Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 20, 23.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nRegarding the technical aspects of attribution, although science is continuously developing attribution mechanisms which can trace back the machine that launched the attack, or its geolocation, at the same time, ‘anti-attribution’ mechanisms are also developing which can hide the provenance of the attack. Moreover, certain systems—such as ‘Tor’, used by the military—anonymize their user. As a result, although technical attribution can yield good results it can never be absolutely exact and, moreover, it cannot always identify the person who operated the machine or her/his affiliations. For this reason, in addition to technical investigation, intelligence and information analysis is needed in order to profile the authors of the attack, and to provide information about their capabilities and intentions or their links with States or other entities. As was aptly noted in the context of weapons of mass destruction, but which applies also to cyber war, ‘ultimately the central issue is assessment by the risk-averse security specialists of one international actor of the intentions of another actor’. To this end, the political climate within which the attack took place or who benefited from the attack need also to be taken into account.\nFrom the above it transpires that attribution combines technical investigation with intelligence and political assessments.\nThis however gives rise to questions about the availability and the probity of evidence upon which assessments are made. With regard to the availability of evidence, it is often difficult to obtain evidence concerning security matters or the evidence that becomes available is often truncated. In the Nicaragua Case the ICJ recognized that problem when it said that ‘the problem is not… the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State… but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator’. In the case of a cyber attack this will be compounded by the speed of the attack, its anonymity, the possibility of ‘spoofing’, as well as the fact that it may have travelled through many different jurisdictions—in which case collecting evidence may not be physically possible, or may counter many legal as well as political hurdles. In the Corfu Channel Case the ICJ recognized the difficulties in furnishing evidence if the territory is under the control of another State and for this reason, the Court allowed ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.\n W Earl Boebert, ‘A Survey of Challenges in Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 43–48.\n ibid 49–50.\n WM Reisman and A Armstrong, ‘The Past and Future of the Claim of Preemptive Self-Defense’ (2006) 100 AJIL 525, 526.\n Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 57.\n With regard to the Estonian attacks, see Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 27–28.\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 9, 18 (Corfu Channel Case).\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 235\nThis leads to the second issue, which is the probity of the evidence. International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence. The only generic threshold that perhaps exists is that ‘claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive. The same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts’. This standard is less strict than the ‘beyond any doubt’ or ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ standard but is higher than the ‘balance of evidence’ or the ‘balance of probabilities’. However, how can even that standard be satisfied if evidence relies on intelligence information—as it usually does—which can be withheld or be severely truncated because of its confidential nature? If the ICJ’s practice regarding confidential evidence is of any value, it demonstrates a lack of serious probing. In the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, for example, as in the *Corfu Channel Case*, the Court did not even demand the production of classified documents by the Respondent—a failure criticized by one of the judges because the document could have ‘shed light on the central questions of intent and attributability’.\nFrom the above it transpires that standards concerning the availability and probity of evidence in cases involving armed attacks, uses of force or interventions are rather lax and are even more so in the case of cyber attacks because of their particular characteristics as mentioned above. That said, even if the standard of proof is not the same as the one required for the criminal prosecution of individuals and even if ‘a more political approach to attribution…might accept less exacting standards’; it should be stressed that a State should not resort to self-defence on the basis of casual evidence or wild political inferences.\n Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v USA) (Merits) [2003] ICJ Rep 161 para 30 (Oil Platforms Case).\n *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia) [2007] ICJ Rep 43 para 209 (Bosnia Genocide Case); Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins (n 23) para 33. At other times the Court used the ‘conclusive’ or ‘sufficient’ standard. See *Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo* (Democratic Republic of Congo v Uganda) [2005] ICJ Rep 168 paras 91 and 172 (Congo v Uganda).\n The ICJ has also mentioned the ‘beyond any doubt’ standard: see *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) para 422; and the ‘no room for reasonable doubt’ standard see *Corfu Channel Case* (n 22) 18.\n *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) para 208; Memorial of the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1994) 5.3.2.5–5.3.3.10.

International Law Criteria on Attribution\nAssuming now that by combining technical investigations and political analysis the cyber attack is assigned to a State, the victim State can lawfully take self-defence action against that State only if international law’s attribution standards for self-defence are also met. From international law and practice, three main attribution standards can be identified: according to the first, attacks by State organs are attributed to that State; according to the second attacks by state agents that is, by entities instructed, directed or controlled by a State are attributed to that State; and according to the third, attacks by entities tolerated by a State are attributed to that State. In all of the above instances, self-defence action can be taken against the implicated State. If none of the above applies but a non-State actor attacks another State, that non-State actor becomes the direct target of the self-defence action.\n# A. State Organs\nAccording to the first standard, the conduct of state organs is attributed to that State. Thus, if a *de jure* organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces, commits a cyber attack, the attack will be attributed to that State, which will then become the lawful target of the self-defence action.\nThis attribution standard is premised on the juridical status of the author of the attack and its validity has been affirmed on many occasions. For example, in the *Nicaragua Case* the ICJ attributed to the USA the acts of its own organs whereas in the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, the ICJ examined the question of whether the acts of genocide committed in Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia as being committed by Serbia’s *de jure* organs, but returned a negative answer because the perpetrators were not organs of that State under Serbian internal law.\nIn addition to the conduct of *de jure* organs, acts of a State’s *de facto* organs are also attributed to that State. A *de facto* organ is an entity that is assimilated to, or is absorbed in, the State apparatus. The ICJ had that in mind when it said in the *Nicaragua Case* that there must be a relationship of complete dependence and control. The control that the State should exercise over such an entity in order to be treated as *de facto* organ is the control that is inherent in the relation of dependence and covers all fields of the entity’s activities.

At any rate, a high degree of control is required because ‘to equate persons or entities with State organs when they do not have that status under internal law must be exceptional’. If, however, ‘some qualified, but real, margin of independence’ exists, the entity does not become a de facto organ and its conduct will not be attributed to a State on that basis. In the Nicaragua Case, for example, the ICJ did not attribute the acts of the Contras to the USA because it was not satisfied that the Contras were completely dependent on the USA, acting as its de facto organs; and the ICJ reached the same conclusion in the Bosnia Genocide Case with regard to the Republika Srpska, the VRS and certain other paramilitary militias.\n## B. State Agents\nThe second standard refers to an agency relationship which arises when an entity acts under the instructions, direction or control of a State. Thus, a cyber attack committed by an entity instructed by a state organ to do so will be attributed to that State. Instructions establish an ad hoc relationship between the entity that commits the cyber attack and the State and, for this reason, instructions should be proven in relation to the specific cyber attack. The same is true with regard to directions. In the Tehran Hostages Case for example, the ICJ opined that, in order to attribute to Iran the occupation of the US Embassy by militants, it should establish that the militants ‘acted on behalf of the State, having been charged by some competent organ of the Iranian State to carry out a specific operation’. In the same vein Judge Ago said in his Separate Opinion in the Nicaragua Case that to determine that persons or groups acted in the name and on behalf of the USA, they must ‘have been specifically charged by the United States authorities to commit a particular act, or to carry out a particular task of some kind on behalf of the United States’.\nWhereas there is no disagreement as far as the criterion of instructions or directions is concerned, the criterion of ‘control’ appears more problematic\n\nNicholas Tsagourias\nbecause of an apparent jurisprudential split as to the required degree of control. In the first place, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case introduced a stringent test when it spoke of ‘effective control’. It will mean that a cyber attack carried out by a group or a person will be attributed to a State only if that State has exerted direct influence on the group or person to commit the attack or has enforced its perpetration. The difference between the case of an attack being committed by an entity under the effective control of a State and a de facto organ is that no relationship of dependence is required in the case of effective control but also, and more importantly, that attribution is premised on the control the State exercises in respect of each specific act whereas in the case of de facto organs it is premised on the control the State exercises over the actor.\nThe ICTY in the Tadic case introduced an alternative—lower—threshold. In that case, the ICTY distinguished the cases of individuals and unorganized groups—where effective control is the requisite standard—from that of organized groups, where overall control suffices. A State ‘wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity’ and, in that case, ‘it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law’. Overall control covers the case where a State exerts general influence over a group and its activities. It would for example attribute to a State a cyber attack mounted by a group of ‘hacktivists’ to which a State has provided technical or other support and organized their activities even if no involvement in the specific attack can be proven. Overall control thus differs from effective control because the latter requires control over the specific act. It also differs from the de facto organ test because there is no relationship of dependency between the State and that entity.\nThat said, in the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ criticized the ‘overall control’ test and reaffirmed the effective control test. Thus, it held that the acts of genocide were not attributable to Serbia because that State did not exercise effective control over the operations in the course of which the acts took place. Applying the ICJ’s findings to the case at issue, only cyber attacks carried out by entities under the effective control of a State can be attributed to that State.\nIn my view, such a stringent and uniform standard is not warranted but instead the requisite degree of control may differ depending on the context within which the issue of control arises. Such a differentiated approach to ‘control’ is\n Art 8 ASR; Nicaragua Case (n 7) paras 116–17; Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 398.\n Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 131.\n ibid paras 131, 137.\n Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) paras 402–6.\n ibid paras 413–14.\n Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 117.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution\nsupported by international jurisprudence and doctrine. In the first place Article 8 of the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility (ASR) speaks of 'control' without any further qualification whereas the commentary suggests that it should apply with a degree of flexibility. Moreover, Article 55 ASR acknowledges the existence of special regimes which may have their own rules on attribution and responsibility. As far as international jurisprudence is concerned, the effective control criterion was employed in the Nicaragua Case in the context of state responsibility for violations of humanitarian law. The question that the Court had to answer was whether violations of humanitarian law committed by the Contras could be attributed to the USA, engaging its international responsibility. The ICTY on its part introduced the overall control criterion in order to characterize the war in Bosnia as international or non-international. The ICTY searched for the requisite criteria in international humanitarian law and decided to revert to the attribution standards found in the law of state responsibility only when it concluded that humanitarian law does not contain any specific criteria in this regard. Still, the ICTY diverged from the law of state responsibility and introduced the overall control criterion because in its opinion it was more judicious in the circumstances of the case. In the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ applied the effective control standard in the context of the law of state responsibility. The Court also opined that the rules on attribution 'do not vary with the nature of the wrongful act in question in the absence of a clearly expressed lex specialis'. This was said in order to rebut the suggestion that the attribution criteria should change when responsibility for genocide is at issue. However, the Court did not deny the existence of special regimes in general or within the law of state responsibility more specifically. Regarding the overall control test, the Court admitted that in the context in which it was pronounced by the ICTY it may have been 'applicable and suitable' and that 'logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues [characterisation of a conflict/state responsibility for genocide] which are very different in nature'. That said, the ICJ rejected the 'overall control' criterion for the law of state responsibility because it 'stretches too far, almost to a breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State's organs and its international responsibility'.\n J Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility (CUP 2001) 112.\n For example, art 3 of Fourth Hague Convention and art 91 of Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) (opened for signature 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1979) 1125 UNTS 3 introduce strict liability in international humanitarian law by providing that a State is to be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces. See also art 59 ASR.\n Tadic Appeal (n 34) paras 90, 98, 105.\n Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 401.\n ibid paras 404-405.\n ibid para 406.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nThe above bring into light the different rationale of the regimes within which attribution operates. On the one hand, the rationale behind the regime of state responsibility is to hold States responsible for their wrongful conduct but the regime has recognized the modern, narrower, definition of the ‘state’, and attributes to a State only the acts of those entities that are closely linked to it. At the same time, it recognizes different types of responsibility in view of the different ways in which a State can participate in the commission of a wrongful act. There also exist various international or national, criminal or civil processes to hold into account such sub-entities or their employees. The rationale behind the use of force regime, on the other hand, is to provide the template according to which force can be lawfully used in international relations. However, the use of force regime is very much State oriented. Even if nowadays non-State actors exist that can use large-scale force against other States, they are located in States and operate from within States. As the ICJ opined, it is important to ‘grasp the reality of the relationship between the person taking action and the state’. Thus, any form or degree of control by a State over a non-State actor that goes on to attack another State will suffice as for the victim State to use force by way of self-defence against the host State.\nThis situation can be distinguished from a situation where a State exercises no control over the non-State actor because it is unable to exert its authority over the whole of its territory or over the non-State actor. In that case, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence directly against the non-State actor.\nThat this is the case has long been established in the customary law of self-defence. According to the Caroline Case (which is treated as the source of the customary law on self-defence), a State can use force by way of self-defence directly against non-State actors. Moreover, according to Article 51 of the UN Charter, the self-defence trigger (an armed attack) is determined on the basis of events, not on the basis of its author.\nModern State practice relating to terrorism also affirms this approach to self-defence. For example, in 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hizbollah in Lebanon, following Hizbollah attacks which Lebanon was unable to prevent. Lebanon not only denied knowledge of the attacks but also\n See, for example, Art 16 ASR.\n Bosnia Genocide (n 24) para 392.\n N Tsagourias, ‘Non-State Actors and the Use of Force’ in J d’Aspremont (ed), Participants in the International Legal System: Multiple Perspectives on Non-State Actors in International Law, (Routledge 2011) 326ff.\n British and Foreign State Papers (James Ridgeway and Sons 1858) vol 30, 196–98.\n Separate Opinion of Judge Kooijmans in Congo v Uganda (n 24) paras 26–27 and in Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Advisory Opinion) [2004] ICJ Rep 2004, para 35 (Palestinian Wall); E Wilmshurst, ‘The Chatham House Principles of International Law on the Use of Force in Self-Defence’ (2006) 55 ICLQ 963, 969–71.\n SC Res 1310 (27 July 2000); SC Res 1337 (30 January 2001); SC Res 1553 (29 July 2004); SC Res 1559 (2 September 2004).\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 241\ndeclared that it did not condone them. Israel on its part declared that its action was not against the State of Lebanon but against Hizbollah.\nAgainst this, the ICJ pronouncement that self-defence is available only against ‘an armed attack by one State against another State’ is rather peculiar and has been criticized by other judges in their individual opinions. As Judge Kooijmans put it, ‘if armed attacks are carried out by irregular bands from such territory against a neighbouring State, they are still armed attacks even if they cannot be attributed to the territorial State. It would be unreasonable to deny the attacked State the right to self-defence merely because there is no attacker State, and the Charter does not so require’. The ICJ had another opportunity to deal with the issue of non-State actors but abstained from making any definite pronouncement. In the Congo v Uganda Case, Uganda claimed that its operations against rebels operating from within DRC were lawful self-defence measures in view of DRC’s inability to control its territory. The ICJ however declared Uganda’s actions disproportionate and as a result it felt that it was not required to opine on the legality of self-defence in response to attacks by irregular forces. It may be claimed that, had Uganda’s response been proportionate, it would have been a lawful measure of self-defence but this is arguing a contrario.\nBe that as it may, the ICJ’s assertion that the author of the armed attack should be a State and that the State should exercise ‘effective control’ over the non-State actor in order for the attack to be attributed to a State may also defeat its purpose which is to maintain peace because non-State actors will be able to attack other States with immunity, hiding behind the shield of the host State’s sovereignty and, conversely, States will be able to attack other States hiding behind non-State actors.\n Letter from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (17 May 1982) UN Doc S/15087; Identical letters from the Chargé d’affaires of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (13 July 2006) UN Doc A/60/938-S/2006/518; Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lebanon pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-2/1* A/HRC/3/2 23 November 2006, paras 42, 54.\n Identical letters from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (12 July 2006) UN Doc S/2006/515.

State Toleration or Unwillingness\nAs the case of terrorism has shown, cyber attacks can be mounted on States by non-State actors operating from within a State that tolerates them or is unwilling to suppress their activities. According to international law, a State should not allow 'its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states'71 and more specifically its territory is not to be used for military acts against another State.72 This amounts to a State's duty of due diligence which engages its international responsibility when the State fails in this regard. However, if the harmful act amounts to an armed attack, this transforms the legal characterization of the situation and places it within the use of force paradigm. The question then is whether a State that has suffered a cyber attack mounted by a non-State actor operating from within another State and tolerated by that State can use defensive force against that State. If the ICJ's effective control test were to apply in this case, the victim State would not be able to defend itself. However, it would not be much consolation to the victim State to know that it can hold the host State responsible for breaching its duty of due diligence or that it can take countermeasures against that State, but to still not be able to defend itself.73\nIf the duty of due diligence exists in order to protect important international values—such as peace and security—or enforce certain important obligations—such as not to use force—it would be unreasonable not to allow the victim State to defend itself against an armed attack which was suffered because of another State's deliberate failure to exercise due diligence.\nThe attribution standard of toleration and unwillingness was thus developed in the use of force regime in order to cover situations such as those described above, which were not hypothetical but real and pressing as the case of terrorist attacks all very often shows.74 For example, when the '9/11' attacks were committed by Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban regime refused to hand over Al-Qaeda leaders, the USA responded by using force by way of self-defence. This happened against a background of the Security Council making frequent demands on the Taliban regime not to provide sanctuary to international terrorists or organizations and to take effective measures in order to ensure that its territory was not used for terrorist activities.75 The US President justified the 2001 action on the basis of self-defence and declared that no distinction was\n\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 243\nto be made between those that committed the attack and those that harboured them. In the letter to the SC reporting its self-defence action the USA wrote:\nThe attacks on 11 September 2001 and the ongoing threat to the United States and its nationals posed by the Al-Qaeda organization have been made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation. Despite every effort by the United States and the international community, the Taliban regime has refused to change its policy.\nThis position was supported by the SC in Resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) which affirmed the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in response to the attacks.\nIn the Congo v Uganda Case, it seems that the ICJ has recognized that toleration by a State of non-State actors who go on to mount an attack on another State can give rise to a right of self-defence, although in that specific instance the ICJ could not conclude that the absence of action on the part of DRC was tantamount to toleration.\nIn sum, toleration by a State of actors that mount cyber attacks on other States or State unwillingness to suppress their activities will trigger self-defence action against those States. This criterion is in line with the State-centric character of the use of force regime by connecting the attack to the State's overall responsibility over its territory and people.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIt has been claimed in the preceding sections that attribution is critical for the lawfulness of any self-defence action; but attribution is a complex exercise having technical, political and legal aspects. As far as the legal aspects of attribution are concerned, it has been shown that international law has expanded and adapted the attribution standards that apply to the use of force regime to cater for new situations such as terrorism. The attribution standards as they stand today can very much accommodate cyber attacks for self-defence purposes.\nAccordingly, a cyber attack will be attributed to a State if it is perpetrated by a de jure or de facto organ of that State, or by actors under the direction,\n Presidential Address to the Nation (11 September 2001) available at: <http: 09=\"\" 2001=\"\" 20010911-16.html=\"\" news=\"\" georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> (accessed 18 June 2012).\n Letter from the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2001/946 and Letter from the Charge d'affaires ai of the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2006/947 (2001).\n Congo v Uganda (n 22) para 301.</http:>\nNicholas Tsagourias\ninstructions or control of a State, or by actors tolerated by a State. When the territorial State is, however, unable to prevent the attacks or the actors that perpetrated the attack operate independently of a State, the attack will be attributed to the actor itself, which will become the target of the self-defence action.\nThat having been said, it should be stressed that evolving State practice in this area may expand or adapt the attribution standards that apply to cyber attacks and thus the current standards should not be regarded as fixed or immutable.",

More specifically, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence against another State if the attack has been committed by the latter's organs or agents or has been committed by non-State actors tolerated by that State. When no State is implicated in the cyber attack, the victim State can take direct self-defence action against the non-State actor. It is however noted that future State practice may amplify further the attribution standards or introduce new standards.\n## 1. Introduction\nThe term ‘cyber attack’ is used to describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace, but this article will concern itself only with those cyber operations whose aim is to degrade, disrupt, deny or destroy information resident in computers, or to compromise the computers themselves.\nSuch attacks produce not only effects which are internal to a computer or network but also effects which are external thereto by harming connected systems, facilities, materials or people. For example, a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, altering information concerning the position of aeroplanes, produces direct effects on the air traffic control system itself by compromising its operation; but it also demonstrates external effects, by causing air accidents resulting in material destruction and human loss. In fact, such effects may have been the primary aim of the cyber attack.\n* Professor of International Law and Security, University of Glasgow. Email: nicholas.tsagourias@glasgow.ac.uk.

Responses may vary: they may be conventional or cyber and they may be passive, for example making networks and particularly those of critical national infrastructure more secure, or they may be active, for example employing cyber or kinetic force to offset a cyber attack. As the US President declared: ‘[a]ll states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners’.\nA crucial issue in any response is to identify the source of the particular cyber attack and this is what attribution tries to do. It tries to trace back the cyber attack to its source and ascribe it to an author against whom action can be taken. Attribution is thus crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness. The latter aspect of attribution is the focus of this article. More specifically, this article will examine the attribution standards that need to be satisfied in order for a State to use force by way of self-defence against a cyber attack. It is necessary therefore to consider in the first place under what circumstances a cyber attack can activate a State’s right to self-defence.\n## 2. Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\nWhat distinguishes a cyber attack as defined above from other cyber provocations such as cyber exploitations is its harmful effect, in that a cyber attack makes the targeted system unavailable or compromises its integrity and authenticity. The immediate question is whether such effects are in themselves sufficient to trigger self-defence in the absence of other material and/or human harm.\nFor this reason, it is important to recall the circumstances under which self-defence can be exercised. These are prescribed in Article 51 of the UN Charter and in the customary international law of self-defence. Both branches of the law seem to agree that what triggers the right to self-defence is an armed attack. Although no definition of what constitutes an armed attack is provided in\n National Security Council, *The Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative* (2009) <http: cybersecurity=\"\" comprehensive-national-cybersecurity-initiative=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012); *A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: National Security Strategy* (HMSO 2010); *The UK Cyber Security Strategy Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world* (Cabinet Office 2011).\n NATO, ‘NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement’ Expert Report (17 May 2010) 45.\n White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World* (May 2011) <http: default=\"\" files=\"\" rss_viewer=\"\" international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf=\"\" sites=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) 14.\n HS Lin, ‘Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force’ (2010) 4 J Nat Sec Law and Policy 63, 64–68.</http:></http:>\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution\nthe Charter, it has been accepted that an armed attack is a use of force, defined as such by its gravity and its effects rather than by the instrument used.7 As the ICJ put it, an armed attack is the 'most grave form of the use of force' in view of its scale and effects.8 Consequently, a cyber attack that causes substantial human and/or material destruction can be equated to an armed attack for purposes of self-defence.9 That would be the case, for example, when a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, or a cyber attack on a nuclear reactor, caused substantial material or human destruction.\nA more difficult question is whether attacks on critical state infrastructure which cause substantial disruption but no physical or human damage could also constitute an armed attack for self-defence purposes. This of course presupposes a definition of what constitutes 'critical infrastructure'. Although there is no universally accepted definition, it seems that most definitions agree that certain services such as security, food, water, transportation, banking and finance, health, energy, governmental and public services constitute critical infrastructure. The 2001 Patriot Act defines critical infrastructure as 'systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters'. In the view of the present writer, a cyber attack on critical state infrastructure which paralyses or massively disrupts the apparatus of the State should be equated to an armed attack, even if it does not cause any immediate human injury or material damage. For example, an attack on a State's financial system which, by modifying or corrupting data, causes massive disruption to the economic life of a State, should qualify as an armed attack. The situation is similar to the conventional destruction of weapons. It is not their physical destruction as such but their unavailability in the sense of not being able to fulfil the purpose for which they have been set that makes an attack on them an armed attack.\n\nNicholas Tsagourias\nConsequently, neither the attacks on Estonia in 2007 nor those on Georgia in 2008 fall within the definition of armed attack. More specifically, following the decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet era war memorial, governmental and banking websites were hit by a directed denial of service (DDoS) attack in 2007. Similarly, in 2008, Georgian governmental websites were hit by a DDoS attack which coincided with the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Georgia in August of that year. Those attacks did not cause any human or material damage and the disruption that they did cause was contained and was manageable. The view that they did not amount to armed attack is also supported by the fact that in the case of Estonia Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which provides for collective self-defence action if a Member State has been attacked was not invoked but the whole incident was mainly treated under criminal law.\nRelated to the above is the question of whether a cyber attack on a State's military infrastructure can per se constitute an armed attack. Such an attack would satisfy the self-defence criteria if it causes grave harm which, as was suggested above, does not need to be material or human harm but massive disruption that debilitates the State will also suffice. For example, a cyber attack that disables a State's command and control system can be equated to an armed attack because it disables the decision-making nerve of the State. Of course such an attack can also be a prelude to a kinetic attack in which case the right of pre-emptive self-defence arises.\nBe that as it may, identifying the specific cyber act that constitutes the armed attack is very important because cyber attacks are often 'multi-layered' in that the malicious infiltration of the system, the execution of the payload and the production of the harmful effects may take place in different time frames. If an attack is defined as such by its harmful effects including its debilitating effects, an attack would exist from the moment the harmful effects materialize irrespective of when the system has been infiltrated or the payload has been executed. However, if a State becomes aware of the fact that its systems have been compromised, it can take passive or active cyber defence measures to neutralize the threat. A State may even treat the infiltration as a prelude to a cyber or kinetic attack if information exists indicating that the penetration is part of an overall attack. In this case a State can resort to pre-emptive self-defence if all other means of neutralizing the cyber threat fail.\nThere is finally the question of whether cyber incidents that do not rise to the level of an armed attack as far as their gravity is concerned can trigger forcible reactions. 'Low intensity' cyber incidents are perhaps more likely to happen because they require less technical sophistication or means. The harm they\n E Tikk, K Kaska and L Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence 2010) 14–33.\n NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Annual Session 2009, Committee Report 173 DSCFC 09 E bis-‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ <http: default.asp?shortcut=\"1782\" www.nato-pa.int=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) paras 58–61.</http:>\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 233\ncan cause may also be low. If one is to follow the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, such low-level attacks do not amount to armed attack for self-defence purposes and the only option available to the victim State is to take proportional and non-forcible countermeasures. Whether this is reasonable depends on the circumstances, but if the underlying strategy behind the low-intensity attacks and their cumulative effects are taken into account, one may reach a different conclusion. For example, frequent—albeit mildly disruptive attacks—on a State’s financial system may cause limited damage; but the cumulative effect may be substantial if overall trust in the system is destroyed, which may have been the aim of the individual attacks. It is perhaps in such cases that the accumulation of minor cyber provocations could rise to the level of an armed attack for self-defence purposes.\n# 3. Attribution: Technical and Political Aspects\nIf a cyber attack can activate the right of self-defence, what is important is to assign the attack to an author against whom self-defence action will be taken. Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks—as the case of terrorism demonstrates—and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain. Three particular characteristics of cyberspace make attribution extremely difficult. The first is ‘anonymity’ in that cyber attackers can hide their identity; the second is the possibility of launching multi-stage cyber attacks, in that a number of computers operated by different people and placed in different jurisdictions are infiltrated before an attack is launched; and the third is the speed with which a cyber attack can materialize. What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack; and it is especially critical that all of the above are done in a timely manner and accurately. To give an example, the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85 000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries, which makes the eventual identification of the physical operators of the computers and, above all, of the coordinators or real masterminds behind the attack, very difficult.\nAttribution of cyber attacks is thus a multifaceted process; it has technical, legal and political aspects, with each aspect feeding into the other. I will deal with the legal aspects of attribution in the next section but it is important to explain the technical and political aspects of attribution first.\n Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 249. Also see in this volume ME O’Connell, ‘Cyber Security without Cyber War’ s 4.1.\n DD Clark and S Landau, ‘Untangling Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 25 at 37.\n Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 20, 23.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nRegarding the technical aspects of attribution, although science is continuously developing attribution mechanisms which can trace back the machine that launched the attack, or its geolocation, at the same time, ‘anti-attribution’ mechanisms are also developing which can hide the provenance of the attack. Moreover, certain systems—such as ‘Tor’, used by the military—anonymize their user. As a result, although technical attribution can yield good results it can never be absolutely exact and, moreover, it cannot always identify the person who operated the machine or her/his affiliations. For this reason, in addition to technical investigation, intelligence and information analysis is needed in order to profile the authors of the attack, and to provide information about their capabilities and intentions or their links with States or other entities. As was aptly noted in the context of weapons of mass destruction, but which applies also to cyber war, ‘ultimately the central issue is assessment by the risk-averse security specialists of one international actor of the intentions of another actor’. To this end, the political climate within which the attack took place or who benefited from the attack need also to be taken into account.\nFrom the above it transpires that attribution combines technical investigation with intelligence and political assessments.\nThis however gives rise to questions about the availability and the probity of evidence upon which assessments are made. With regard to the availability of evidence, it is often difficult to obtain evidence concerning security matters or the evidence that becomes available is often truncated. In the Nicaragua Case the ICJ recognized that problem when it said that ‘the problem is not… the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State… but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator’. In the case of a cyber attack this will be compounded by the speed of the attack, its anonymity, the possibility of ‘spoofing’, as well as the fact that it may have travelled through many different jurisdictions—in which case collecting evidence may not be physically possible, or may counter many legal as well as political hurdles. In the Corfu Channel Case the ICJ recognized the difficulties in furnishing evidence if the territory is under the control of another State and for this reason, the Court allowed ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.\n W Earl Boebert, ‘A Survey of Challenges in Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 43–48.\n ibid 49–50.\n WM Reisman and A Armstrong, ‘The Past and Future of the Claim of Preemptive Self-Defense’ (2006) 100 AJIL 525, 526.\n Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 57.\n With regard to the Estonian attacks, see Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 27–28.\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 9, 18 (Corfu Channel Case).\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 235\nThis leads to the second issue, which is the probity of the evidence. International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence. The only generic threshold that perhaps exists is that ‘claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive. The same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts’. This standard is less strict than the ‘beyond any doubt’ or ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ standard but is higher than the ‘balance of evidence’ or the ‘balance of probabilities’. However, how can even that standard be satisfied if evidence relies on intelligence information—as it usually does—which can be withheld or be severely truncated because of its confidential nature? If the ICJ’s practice regarding confidential evidence is of any value, it demonstrates a lack of serious probing. In the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, for example, as in the *Corfu Channel Case*, the Court did not even demand the production of classified documents by the Respondent—a failure criticized by one of the judges because the document could have ‘shed light on the central questions of intent and attributability’.\nFrom the above it transpires that standards concerning the availability and probity of evidence in cases involving armed attacks, uses of force or interventions are rather lax and are even more so in the case of cyber attacks because of their particular characteristics as mentioned above. That said, even if the standard of proof is not the same as the one required for the criminal prosecution of individuals and even if ‘a more political approach to attribution…might accept less exacting standards’; it should be stressed that a State should not resort to self-defence on the basis of casual evidence or wild political inferences.\n Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v USA) (Merits) [2003] ICJ Rep 161 para 30 (Oil Platforms Case).\n *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia) [2007] ICJ Rep 43 para 209 (Bosnia Genocide Case); Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins (n 23) para 33.

International Law Criteria on Attribution\nAssuming now that by combining technical investigations and political analysis the cyber attack is assigned to a State, the victim State can lawfully take self-defence action against that State only if international law’s attribution standards for self-defence are also met. From international law and practice, three main attribution standards can be identified: according to the first, attacks by State organs are attributed to that State; according to the second attacks by state agents that is, by entities instructed, directed or controlled by a State are attributed to that State; and according to the third, attacks by entities tolerated by a State are attributed to that State. In all of the above instances, self-defence action can be taken against the implicated State. If none of the above applies but a non-State actor attacks another State, that non-State actor becomes the direct target of the self-defence action.\n# A. State Organs\nAccording to the first standard, the conduct of state organs is attributed to that State. Thus, if a *de jure* organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces, commits a cyber attack, the attack will be attributed to that State, which will then become the lawful target of the self-defence action.\nThis attribution standard is premised on the juridical status of the author of the attack and its validity has been affirmed on many occasions. For example, in the *Nicaragua Case* the ICJ attributed to the USA the acts of its own organs whereas in the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, the ICJ examined the question of whether the acts of genocide committed in Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia as being committed by Serbia’s *de jure* organs, but returned a negative answer because the perpetrators were not organs of that State under Serbian internal law.\nIn addition to the conduct of *de jure* organs, acts of a State’s *de facto* organs are also attributed to that State. A *de facto* organ is an entity that is assimilated to, or is absorbed in, the State apparatus. The ICJ had that in mind when it said in the *Nicaragua Case* that there must be a relationship of complete dependence and control. The control that the State should exercise over such an entity in order to be treated as *de facto* organ is the control that is inherent in the relation of dependence and covers all fields of the entity’s activities.

See also *Prosecutor v Duško Tadić a/k/a ‘DULE’* (Appeal) ICTY-94-1-A (15 July 1999) para 141 (*Tadić* Appeal).\n *Nicaragua Case* (n 7) paras 109, 111.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 237\njurisprudence has not been very specific as to the requisite degree of control over the dependent entity, with the Court in the Nicaragua Case mentioning effective control, in addition to general control whereas in the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ spoke of ‘strict control’ or a ‘great degree of control’. At any rate, a high degree of control is required because ‘to equate persons or entities with State organs when they do not have that status under internal law must be exceptional’. If, however, ‘some qualified, but real, margin of independence’ exists, the entity does not become a de facto organ and its conduct will not be attributed to a State on that basis. In the Nicaragua Case, for example, the ICJ did not attribute the acts of the Contras to the USA because it was not satisfied that the Contras were completely dependent on the USA, acting as its de facto organs; and the ICJ reached the same conclusion in the Bosnia Genocide Case with regard to the Republika Srpska, the VRS and certain other paramilitary militias.\n## B. State Agents\nThe second standard refers to an agency relationship which arises when an entity acts under the instructions, direction or control of a State. Thus, a cyber attack committed by an entity instructed by a state organ to do so will be attributed to that State. Instructions establish an ad hoc relationship between the entity that commits the cyber attack and the State and, for this reason, instructions should be proven in relation to the specific cyber attack. The same is true with regard to directions. In the Tehran Hostages Case for example, the ICJ opined that, in order to attribute to Iran the occupation of the US Embassy by militants, it should establish that the militants ‘acted on behalf of the State, having been charged by some competent organ of the Iranian State to carry out a specific operation’. In the same vein Judge Ago said in his Separate Opinion in the Nicaragua Case that to determine that persons or groups acted in the name and on behalf of the USA, they must ‘have been specifically charged by the United States authorities to commit a particular act, or to carry out a particular task of some kind on behalf of the United States’.\nWhereas there is no disagreement as far as the criterion of instructions or directions is concerned, the criterion of ‘control’ appears more problematic\n\nNicholas Tsagourias\nbecause of an apparent jurisprudential split as to the required degree of control. In the first place, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case introduced a stringent test when it spoke of ‘effective control’. It will mean that a cyber attack carried out by a group or a person will be attributed to a State only if that State has exerted direct influence on the group or person to commit the attack or has enforced its perpetration. The difference between the case of an attack being committed by an entity under the effective control of a State and a de facto organ is that no relationship of dependence is required in the case of effective control but also, and more importantly, that attribution is premised on the control the State exercises in respect of each specific act whereas in the case of de facto organs it is premised on the control the State exercises over the actor.\nThe ICTY in the Tadic case introduced an alternative—lower—threshold. In that case, the ICTY distinguished the cases of individuals and unorganized groups—where effective control is the requisite standard—from that of organized groups, where overall control suffices. A State ‘wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity’ and, in that case, ‘it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law’. Overall control covers the case where a State exerts general influence over a group and its activities. It would for example attribute to a State a cyber attack mounted by a group of ‘hacktivists’ to which a State has provided technical or other support and organized their activities even if no involvement in the specific attack can be proven. Overall control thus differs from effective control because the latter requires control over the specific act. It also differs from the de facto organ test because there is no relationship of dependency between the State and that entity.\nThat said, in the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ criticized the ‘overall control’ test and reaffirmed the effective control test. Thus, it held that the acts of genocide were not attributable to Serbia because that State did not exercise effective control over the operations in the course of which the acts took place. Applying the ICJ’s findings to the case at issue, only cyber attacks carried out by entities under the effective control of a State can be attributed to that State.\nIn my view, such a stringent and uniform standard is not warranted but instead the requisite degree of control may differ depending on the context within which the issue of control arises. Such a differentiated approach to ‘control’ is\n Art 8 ASR; Nicaragua Case (n 7) paras 116–17; Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 398.\n Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 131.\n ibid paras 131, 137.\n Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) paras 402–6.\n ibid paras 413–14.\n Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 117.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution\nsupported by international jurisprudence and doctrine. In the first place Article 8 of the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility (ASR) speaks of 'control' without any further qualification whereas the commentary suggests that it should apply with a degree of flexibility. Moreover, Article 55 ASR acknowledges the existence of special regimes which may have their own rules on attribution and responsibility. As far as international jurisprudence is concerned, the effective control criterion was employed in the Nicaragua Case in the context of state responsibility for violations of humanitarian law. The question that the Court had to answer was whether violations of humanitarian law committed by the Contras could be attributed to the USA, engaging its international responsibility. The ICTY on its part introduced the overall control criterion in order to characterize the war in Bosnia as international or non-international. The ICTY searched for the requisite criteria in international humanitarian law and decided to revert to the attribution standards found in the law of state responsibility only when it concluded that humanitarian law does not contain any specific criteria in this regard. Still, the ICTY diverged from the law of state responsibility and introduced the overall control criterion because in its opinion it was more judicious in the circumstances of the case. In the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ applied the effective control standard in the context of the law of state responsibility. The Court also opined that the rules on attribution 'do not vary with the nature of the wrongful act in question in the absence of a clearly expressed lex specialis'. This was said in order to rebut the suggestion that the attribution criteria should change when responsibility for genocide is at issue. However, the Court did not deny the existence of special regimes in general or within the law of state responsibility more specifically. Regarding the overall control test, the Court admitted that in the context in which it was pronounced by the ICTY it may have been 'applicable and suitable' and that 'logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues [characterisation of a conflict/state responsibility for genocide] which are very different in nature'. That said, the ICJ rejected the 'overall control' criterion for the law of state responsibility because it 'stretches too far, almost to a breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State's organs and its international responsibility'.\n J Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility (CUP 2001) 112.\n For example, art 3 of Fourth Hague Convention and art 91 of Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) (opened for signature 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1979) 1125 UNTS 3 introduce strict liability in international humanitarian law by providing that a State is to be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces. See also art 59 ASR.\n Tadic Appeal (n 34) paras 90, 98, 105.\n Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 401.\n ibid paras 404-405.\n ibid para 406.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nThe above bring into light the different rationale of the regimes within which attribution operates. On the one hand, the rationale behind the regime of state responsibility is to hold States responsible for their wrongful conduct but the regime has recognized the modern, narrower, definition of the ‘state’, and attributes to a State only the acts of those entities that are closely linked to it. At the same time, it recognizes different types of responsibility in view of the different ways in which a State can participate in the commission of a wrongful act. There also exist various international or national, criminal or civil processes to hold into account such sub-entities or their employees. The rationale behind the use of force regime, on the other hand, is to provide the template according to which force can be lawfully used in international relations. However, the use of force regime is very much State oriented. Even if nowadays non-State actors exist that can use large-scale force against other States, they are located in States and operate from within States. As the ICJ opined, it is important to ‘grasp the reality of the relationship between the person taking action and the state’. Thus, any form or degree of control by a State over a non-State actor that goes on to attack another State will suffice as for the victim State to use force by way of self-defence against the host State.\nThis situation can be distinguished from a situation where a State exercises no control over the non-State actor because it is unable to exert its authority over the whole of its territory or over the non-State actor. In that case, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence directly against the non-State actor.\nThat this is the case has long been established in the customary law of self-defence. According to the Caroline Case (which is treated as the source of the customary law on self-defence), a State can use force by way of self-defence directly against non-State actors. Moreover, according to Article 51 of the UN Charter, the self-defence trigger (an armed attack) is determined on the basis of events, not on the basis of its author.\nModern State practice relating to terrorism also affirms this approach to self-defence. For example, in 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hizbollah in Lebanon, following Hizbollah attacks which Lebanon was unable to prevent. Lebanon not only denied knowledge of the attacks but also\n See, for example, Art 16 ASR.\n Bosnia Genocide (n 24) para 392.\n N Tsagourias, ‘Non-State Actors and the Use of Force’ in J d’Aspremont (ed), Participants in the International Legal System: Multiple Perspectives on Non-State Actors in International Law, (Routledge 2011) 326ff.\n British and Foreign State Papers (James Ridgeway and Sons 1858) vol 30, 196–98.\n Separate Opinion of Judge Kooijmans in Congo v Uganda (n 24) paras 26–27 and in Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Advisory Opinion) [2004] ICJ Rep 2004, para 35 (Palestinian Wall); E Wilmshurst, ‘The Chatham House Principles of International Law on the Use of Force in Self-Defence’ (2006) 55 ICLQ 963, 969–71.\n SC Res 1310 (27 July 2000); SC Res 1337 (30 January 2001); SC Res 1553 (29 July 2004); SC Res 1559 (2 September 2004).\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 241\ndeclared that it did not condone them. Israel on its part declared that its action was not against the State of Lebanon but against Hizbollah.\nAgainst this, the ICJ pronouncement that self-defence is available only against ‘an armed attack by one State against another State’ is rather peculiar and has been criticized by other judges in their individual opinions. As Judge Kooijmans put it, ‘if armed attacks are carried out by irregular bands from such territory against a neighbouring State, they are still armed attacks even if they cannot be attributed to the territorial State. It would be unreasonable to deny the attacked State the right to self-defence merely because there is no attacker State, and the Charter does not so require’. The ICJ had another opportunity to deal with the issue of non-State actors but abstained from making any definite pronouncement. In the Congo v Uganda Case, Uganda claimed that its operations against rebels operating from within DRC were lawful self-defence measures in view of DRC’s inability to control its territory. The ICJ however declared Uganda’s actions disproportionate and as a result it felt that it was not required to opine on the legality of self-defence in response to attacks by irregular forces. It may be claimed that, had Uganda’s response been proportionate, it would have been a lawful measure of self-defence but this is arguing a contrario.\nBe that as it may, the ICJ’s assertion that the author of the armed attack should be a State and that the State should exercise ‘effective control’ over the non-State actor in order for the attack to be attributed to a State may also defeat its purpose which is to maintain peace because non-State actors will be able to attack other States with immunity, hiding behind the shield of the host State’s sovereignty and, conversely, States will be able to attack other States hiding behind non-State actors.\n Letter from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (17 May 1982) UN Doc S/15087; Identical letters from the Chargé d’affaires of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (13 July 2006) UN Doc A/60/938-S/2006/518; Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lebanon pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-2/1* A/HRC/3/2 23 November 2006, paras 42, 54.\n Identical letters from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (12 July 2006) UN Doc S/2006/515.

State Toleration or Unwillingness\nAs the case of terrorism has shown, cyber attacks can be mounted on States by non-State actors operating from within a State that tolerates them or is unwilling to suppress their activities. According to international law, a State should not allow 'its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states'71 and more specifically its territory is not to be used for military acts against another State.72 This amounts to a State's duty of due diligence which engages its international responsibility when the State fails in this regard. However, if the harmful act amounts to an armed attack, this transforms the legal characterization of the situation and places it within the use of force paradigm. The question then is whether a State that has suffered a cyber attack mounted by a non-State actor operating from within another State and tolerated by that State can use defensive force against that State. If the ICJ's effective control test were to apply in this case, the victim State would not be able to defend itself. However, it would not be much consolation to the victim State to know that it can hold the host State responsible for breaching its duty of due diligence or that it can take countermeasures against that State, but to still not be able to defend itself.73\nIf the duty of due diligence exists in order to protect important international values—such as peace and security—or enforce certain important obligations—such as not to use force—it would be unreasonable not to allow the victim State to defend itself against an armed attack which was suffered because of another State's deliberate failure to exercise due diligence.\nThe attribution standard of toleration and unwillingness was thus developed in the use of force regime in order to cover situations such as those described above, which were not hypothetical but real and pressing as the case of terrorist attacks all very often shows.74 For example, when the '9/11' attacks were committed by Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban regime refused to hand over Al-Qaeda leaders, the USA responded by using force by way of self-defence. This happened against a background of the Security Council making frequent demands on the Taliban regime not to provide sanctuary to international terrorists or organizations and to take effective measures in order to ensure that its territory was not used for terrorist activities.75 The US President justified the 2001 action on the basis of self-defence and declared that no distinction was\n\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 243\nto be made between those that committed the attack and those that harboured them. In the letter to the SC reporting its self-defence action the USA wrote:\nThe attacks on 11 September 2001 and the ongoing threat to the United States and its nationals posed by the Al-Qaeda organization have been made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation. Despite every effort by the United States and the international community, the Taliban regime has refused to change its policy.\nThis position was supported by the SC in Resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) which affirmed the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in response to the attacks.\nIn the Congo v Uganda Case, it seems that the ICJ has recognized that toleration by a State of non-State actors who go on to mount an attack on another State can give rise to a right of self-defence, although in that specific instance the ICJ could not conclude that the absence of action on the part of DRC was tantamount to toleration.\nIn sum, toleration by a State of actors that mount cyber attacks on other States or State unwillingness to suppress their activities will trigger self-defence action against those States. This criterion is in line with the State-centric character of the use of force regime by connecting the attack to the State's overall responsibility over its territory and people.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIt has been claimed in the preceding sections that attribution is critical for the lawfulness of any self-defence action; but attribution is a complex exercise having technical, political and legal aspects. As far as the legal aspects of attribution are concerned, it has been shown that international law has expanded and adapted the attribution standards that apply to the use of force regime to cater for new situations such as terrorism. The attribution standards as they stand today can very much accommodate cyber attacks for self-defence purposes.\nAccordingly, a cyber attack will be attributed to a State if it is perpetrated by a de jure or de facto organ of that State, or by actors under the direction,\n Presidential Address to the Nation (11 September 2001) available at: <http: 09=\"\" 2001=\"\" 20010911-16.html=\"\" news=\"\" georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> (accessed 18 June 2012).\n Letter from the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2001/946 and Letter from the Charge d'affaires ai of the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2006/947 (2001).\n Congo v Uganda (n 22) para 301.</http:>\nNicholas Tsagourias\ninstructions or control of a State, or by actors tolerated by a State. When the territorial State is, however, unable to prevent the attacks or the actors that perpetrated the attack operate independently of a State, the attack will be attributed to the actor itself, which will become the target of the self-defence action.\nThat having been said, it should be stressed that evolving State practice in this area may expand or adapt the attribution standards that apply to cyber attacks and thus the current standards should not be regarded as fixed or immutable.",

More specifically, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence against another State if the attack has been committed by the latter's organs or agents or has been committed by non-State actors tolerated by that State. When no State is implicated in the cyber attack, the victim State can take direct self-defence action against the non-State actor. It is however noted that future State practice may amplify further the attribution standards or introduce new standards.\n## 1. Introduction\nThe term ‘cyber attack’ is used to describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace, but this article will concern itself only with those cyber operations whose aim is to degrade, disrupt, deny or destroy information resident in computers, or to compromise the computers themselves.\nSuch attacks produce not only effects which are internal to a computer or network but also effects which are external thereto by harming connected systems, facilities, materials or people. For example, a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, altering information concerning the position of aeroplanes, produces direct effects on the air traffic control system itself by compromising its operation; but it also demonstrates external effects, by causing air accidents resulting in material destruction and human loss. In fact, such effects may have been the primary aim of the cyber attack.\n* Professor of International Law and Security, University of Glasgow. Email: nicholas.tsagourias@glasgow.ac.uk.

Responses may vary: they may be conventional or cyber and they may be passive, for example making networks and particularly those of critical national infrastructure more secure, or they may be active, for example employing cyber or kinetic force to offset a cyber attack. As the US President declared: ‘[a]ll states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners’.\nA crucial issue in any response is to identify the source of the particular cyber attack and this is what attribution tries to do. It tries to trace back the cyber attack to its source and ascribe it to an author against whom action can be taken. Attribution is thus crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness. The latter aspect of attribution is the focus of this article. More specifically, this article will examine the attribution standards that need to be satisfied in order for a State to use force by way of self-defence against a cyber attack. It is necessary therefore to consider in the first place under what circumstances a cyber attack can activate a State’s right to self-defence.\n## 2. Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\nWhat distinguishes a cyber attack as defined above from other cyber provocations such as cyber exploitations is its harmful effect, in that a cyber attack makes the targeted system unavailable or compromises its integrity and authenticity. The immediate question is whether such effects are in themselves sufficient to trigger self-defence in the absence of other material and/or human harm.\nFor this reason, it is important to recall the circumstances under which self-defence can be exercised. These are prescribed in Article 51 of the UN Charter and in the customary international law of self-defence. Both branches of the law seem to agree that what triggers the right to self-defence is an armed attack. Although no definition of what constitutes an armed attack is provided in\n National Security Council, *The Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative* (2009) <http: cybersecurity=\"\" comprehensive-national-cybersecurity-initiative=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012); *A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: National Security Strategy* (HMSO 2010); *The UK Cyber Security Strategy Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world* (Cabinet Office 2011).\n NATO, ‘NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement’ Expert Report (17 May 2010) 45.\n White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World* (May 2011) <http: default=\"\" files=\"\" rss_viewer=\"\" international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf=\"\" sites=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) 14.\n HS Lin, ‘Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force’ (2010) 4 J Nat Sec Law and Policy 63, 64–68.</http:></http:>\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution\nthe Charter, it has been accepted that an armed attack is a use of force, defined as such by its gravity and its effects rather than by the instrument used.7 As the ICJ put it, an armed attack is the 'most grave form of the use of force' in view of its scale and effects.8 Consequently, a cyber attack that causes substantial human and/or material destruction can be equated to an armed attack for purposes of self-defence.9 That would be the case, for example, when a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, or a cyber attack on a nuclear reactor, caused substantial material or human destruction.\nA more difficult question is whether attacks on critical state infrastructure which cause substantial disruption but no physical or human damage could also constitute an armed attack for self-defence purposes. This of course presupposes a definition of what constitutes 'critical infrastructure'. Although there is no universally accepted definition, it seems that most definitions agree that certain services such as security, food, water, transportation, banking and finance, health, energy, governmental and public services constitute critical infrastructure. The 2001 Patriot Act defines critical infrastructure as 'systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters'. In the view of the present writer, a cyber attack on critical state infrastructure which paralyses or massively disrupts the apparatus of the State should be equated to an armed attack, even if it does not cause any immediate human injury or material damage. For example, an attack on a State's financial system which, by modifying or corrupting data, causes massive disruption to the economic life of a State, should qualify as an armed attack. The situation is similar to the conventional destruction of weapons. It is not their physical destruction as such but their unavailability in the sense of not being able to fulfil the purpose for which they have been set that makes an attack on them an armed attack.\n\nNicholas Tsagourias\nConsequently, neither the attacks on Estonia in 2007 nor those on Georgia in 2008 fall within the definition of armed attack. More specifically, following the decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet era war memorial, governmental and banking websites were hit by a directed denial of service (DDoS) attack in 2007. Similarly, in 2008, Georgian governmental websites were hit by a DDoS attack which coincided with the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Georgia in August of that year. Those attacks did not cause any human or material damage and the disruption that they did cause was contained and was manageable. The view that they did not amount to armed attack is also supported by the fact that in the case of Estonia Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which provides for collective self-defence action if a Member State has been attacked was not invoked but the whole incident was mainly treated under criminal law.\nRelated to the above is the question of whether a cyber attack on a State's military infrastructure can per se constitute an armed attack. Such an attack would satisfy the self-defence criteria if it causes grave harm which, as was suggested above, does not need to be material or human harm but massive disruption that debilitates the State will also suffice. For example, a cyber attack that disables a State's command and control system can be equated to an armed attack because it disables the decision-making nerve of the State. Of course such an attack can also be a prelude to a kinetic attack in which case the right of pre-emptive self-defence arises.\nBe that as it may, identifying the specific cyber act that constitutes the armed attack is very important because cyber attacks are often 'multi-layered' in that the malicious infiltration of the system, the execution of the payload and the production of the harmful effects may take place in different time frames. If an attack is defined as such by its harmful effects including its debilitating effects, an attack would exist from the moment the harmful effects materialize irrespective of when the system has been infiltrated or the payload has been executed. However, if a State becomes aware of the fact that its systems have been compromised, it can take passive or active cyber defence measures to neutralize the threat. A State may even treat the infiltration as a prelude to a cyber or kinetic attack if information exists indicating that the penetration is part of an overall attack. In this case a State can resort to pre-emptive self-defence if all other means of neutralizing the cyber threat fail.\nThere is finally the question of whether cyber incidents that do not rise to the level of an armed attack as far as their gravity is concerned can trigger forcible reactions. 'Low intensity' cyber incidents are perhaps more likely to happen because they require less technical sophistication or means. The harm they\n E Tikk, K Kaska and L Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence 2010) 14–33.\n NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Annual Session 2009, Committee Report 173 DSCFC 09 E bis-‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ <http: default.asp?shortcut=\"1782\" www.nato-pa.int=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) paras 58–61.</http:>\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 233\ncan cause may also be low. If one is to follow the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, such low-level attacks do not amount to armed attack for self-defence purposes and the only option available to the victim State is to take proportional and non-forcible countermeasures. Whether this is reasonable depends on the circumstances, but if the underlying strategy behind the low-intensity attacks and their cumulative effects are taken into account, one may reach a different conclusion. For example, frequent—albeit mildly disruptive attacks—on a State’s financial system may cause limited damage; but the cumulative effect may be substantial if overall trust in the system is destroyed, which may have been the aim of the individual attacks. It is perhaps in such cases that the accumulation of minor cyber provocations could rise to the level of an armed attack for self-defence purposes.\n# 3. Attribution: Technical and Political Aspects\nIf a cyber attack can activate the right of self-defence, what is important is to assign the attack to an author against whom self-defence action will be taken. Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks—as the case of terrorism demonstrates—and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain. Three particular characteristics of cyberspace make attribution extremely difficult. The first is ‘anonymity’ in that cyber attackers can hide their identity; the second is the possibility of launching multi-stage cyber attacks, in that a number of computers operated by different people and placed in different jurisdictions are infiltrated before an attack is launched; and the third is the speed with which a cyber attack can materialize. What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack; and it is especially critical that all of the above are done in a timely manner and accurately. To give an example, the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85 000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries, which makes the eventual identification of the physical operators of the computers and, above all, of the coordinators or real masterminds behind the attack, very difficult.\nAttribution of cyber attacks is thus a multifaceted process; it has technical, legal and political aspects, with each aspect feeding into the other. I will deal with the legal aspects of attribution in the next section but it is important to explain the technical and political aspects of attribution first.\n Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 249. Also see in this volume ME O’Connell, ‘Cyber Security without Cyber War’ s 4.1.\n DD Clark and S Landau, ‘Untangling Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 25 at 37.\n Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 20, 23.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nRegarding the technical aspects of attribution, although science is continuously developing attribution mechanisms which can trace back the machine that launched the attack, or its geolocation, at the same time, ‘anti-attribution’ mechanisms are also developing which can hide the provenance of the attack. Moreover, certain systems—such as ‘Tor’, used by the military—anonymize their user. As a result, although technical attribution can yield good results it can never be absolutely exact and, moreover, it cannot always identify the person who operated the machine or her/his affiliations. For this reason, in addition to technical investigation, intelligence and information analysis is needed in order to profile the authors of the attack, and to provide information about their capabilities and intentions or their links with States or other entities. As was aptly noted in the context of weapons of mass destruction, but which applies also to cyber war, ‘ultimately the central issue is assessment by the risk-averse security specialists of one international actor of the intentions of another actor’. To this end, the political climate within which the attack took place or who benefited from the attack need also to be taken into account.\nFrom the above it transpires that attribution combines technical investigation with intelligence and political assessments.\nThis however gives rise to questions about the availability and the probity of evidence upon which assessments are made. With regard to the availability of evidence, it is often difficult to obtain evidence concerning security matters or the evidence that becomes available is often truncated. In the Nicaragua Case the ICJ recognized that problem when it said that ‘the problem is not… the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State… but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator’. In the case of a cyber attack this will be compounded by the speed of the attack, its anonymity, the possibility of ‘spoofing’, as well as the fact that it may have travelled through many different jurisdictions—in which case collecting evidence may not be physically possible, or may counter many legal as well as political hurdles. In the Corfu Channel Case the ICJ recognized the difficulties in furnishing evidence if the territory is under the control of another State and for this reason, the Court allowed ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.\n W Earl Boebert, ‘A Survey of Challenges in Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 43–48.\n ibid 49–50.\n WM Reisman and A Armstrong, ‘The Past and Future of the Claim of Preemptive Self-Defense’ (2006) 100 AJIL 525, 526.\n Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 57.\n With regard to the Estonian attacks, see Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 27–28.\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 9, 18 (Corfu Channel Case).\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 235\nThis leads to the second issue, which is the probity of the evidence. International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence. The only generic threshold that perhaps exists is that ‘claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive. The same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts’. This standard is less strict than the ‘beyond any doubt’ or ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ standard but is higher than the ‘balance of evidence’ or the ‘balance of probabilities’. However, how can even that standard be satisfied if evidence relies on intelligence information—as it usually does—which can be withheld or be severely truncated because of its confidential nature? If the ICJ’s practice regarding confidential evidence is of any value, it demonstrates a lack of serious probing. In the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, for example, as in the *Corfu Channel Case*, the Court did not even demand the production of classified documents by the Respondent—a failure criticized by one of the judges because the document could have ‘shed light on the central questions of intent and attributability’.\nFrom the above it transpires that standards concerning the availability and probity of evidence in cases involving armed attacks, uses of force or interventions are rather lax and are even more so in the case of cyber attacks because of their particular characteristics as mentioned above. That said, even if the standard of proof is not the same as the one required for the criminal prosecution of individuals and even if ‘a more political approach to attribution…might accept less exacting standards’; it should be stressed that a State should not resort to self-defence on the basis of casual evidence or wild political inferences.\n Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v USA) (Merits) [2003] ICJ Rep 161 para 30 (Oil Platforms Case).\n *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia) [2007] ICJ Rep 43 para 209 (Bosnia Genocide Case); Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins (n 23) para 33. At other times the Court used the ‘conclusive’ or ‘sufficient’ standard. See *Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo* (Democratic Republic of Congo v Uganda) [2005] ICJ Rep 168 paras 91 and 172 (Congo v Uganda).\n The ICJ has also mentioned the ‘beyond any doubt’ standard: see *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) para 422; and the ‘no room for reasonable doubt’ standard see *Corfu Channel Case* (n 22) 18.\n *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) para 208; Memorial of the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1994) 5.3.2.5–5.3.3.10.

International Law Criteria on Attribution\nAssuming now that by combining technical investigations and political analysis the cyber attack is assigned to a State, the victim State can lawfully take self-defence action against that State only if international law’s attribution standards for self-defence are also met. From international law and practice, three main attribution standards can be identified: according to the first, attacks by State organs are attributed to that State; according to the second attacks by state agents that is, by entities instructed, directed or controlled by a State are attributed to that State; and according to the third, attacks by entities tolerated by a State are attributed to that State. In all of the above instances, self-defence action can be taken against the implicated State. If none of the above applies but a non-State actor attacks another State, that non-State actor becomes the direct target of the self-defence action.\n# A. State Organs\nAccording to the first standard, the conduct of state organs is attributed to that State. Thus, if a *de jure* organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces, commits a cyber attack, the attack will be attributed to that State, which will then become the lawful target of the self-defence action.\nThis attribution standard is premised on the juridical status of the author of the attack and its validity has been affirmed on many occasions. For example, in the *Nicaragua Case* the ICJ attributed to the USA the acts of its own organs whereas in the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, the ICJ examined the question of whether the acts of genocide committed in Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia as being committed by Serbia’s *de jure* organs, but returned a negative answer because the perpetrators were not organs of that State under Serbian internal law.\nIn addition to the conduct of *de jure* organs, acts of a State’s *de facto* organs are also attributed to that State. A *de facto* organ is an entity that is assimilated to, or is absorbed in, the State apparatus. The ICJ had that in mind when it said in the *Nicaragua Case* that there must be a relationship of complete dependence and control. The control that the State should exercise over such an entity in order to be treated as *de facto* organ is the control that is inherent in the relation of dependence and covers all fields of the entity’s activities.

At any rate, a high degree of control is required because ‘to equate persons or entities with State organs when they do not have that status under internal law must be exceptional’. If, however, ‘some qualified, but real, margin of independence’ exists, the entity does not become a de facto organ and its conduct will not be attributed to a State on that basis. In the Nicaragua Case, for example, the ICJ did not attribute the acts of the Contras to the USA because it was not satisfied that the Contras were completely dependent on the USA, acting as its de facto organs; and the ICJ reached the same conclusion in the Bosnia Genocide Case with regard to the Republika Srpska, the VRS and certain other paramilitary militias.\n## B. State Agents\nThe second standard refers to an agency relationship which arises when an entity acts under the instructions, direction or control of a State. Thus, a cyber attack committed by an entity instructed by a state organ to do so will be attributed to that State. Instructions establish an ad hoc relationship between the entity that commits the cyber attack and the State and, for this reason, instructions should be proven in relation to the specific cyber attack. The same is true with regard to directions. In the Tehran Hostages Case for example, the ICJ opined that, in order to attribute to Iran the occupation of the US Embassy by militants, it should establish that the militants ‘acted on behalf of the State, having been charged by some competent organ of the Iranian State to carry out a specific operation’. In the same vein Judge Ago said in his Separate Opinion in the Nicaragua Case that to determine that persons or groups acted in the name and on behalf of the USA, they must ‘have been specifically charged by the United States authorities to commit a particular act, or to carry out a particular task of some kind on behalf of the United States’.\nWhereas there is no disagreement as far as the criterion of instructions or directions is concerned, the criterion of ‘control’ appears more problematic\n\nNicholas Tsagourias\nbecause of an apparent jurisprudential split as to the required degree of control. In the first place, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case introduced a stringent test when it spoke of ‘effective control’. It will mean that a cyber attack carried out by a group or a person will be attributed to a State only if that State has exerted direct influence on the group or person to commit the attack or has enforced its perpetration. The difference between the case of an attack being committed by an entity under the effective control of a State and a de facto organ is that no relationship of dependence is required in the case of effective control but also, and more importantly, that attribution is premised on the control the State exercises in respect of each specific act whereas in the case of de facto organs it is premised on the control the State exercises over the actor.\nThe ICTY in the Tadic case introduced an alternative—lower—threshold. In that case, the ICTY distinguished the cases of individuals and unorganized groups—where effective control is the requisite standard—from that of organized groups, where overall control suffices. A State ‘wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity’ and, in that case, ‘it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law’. Overall control covers the case where a State exerts general influence over a group and its activities. It would for example attribute to a State a cyber attack mounted by a group of ‘hacktivists’ to which a State has provided technical or other support and organized their activities even if no involvement in the specific attack can be proven. Overall control thus differs from effective control because the latter requires control over the specific act. It also differs from the de facto organ test because there is no relationship of dependency between the State and that entity.\nThat said, in the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ criticized the ‘overall control’ test and reaffirmed the effective control test. Thus, it held that the acts of genocide were not attributable to Serbia because that State did not exercise effective control over the operations in the course of which the acts took place. Applying the ICJ’s findings to the case at issue, only cyber attacks carried out by entities under the effective control of a State can be attributed to that State.\nIn my view, such a stringent and uniform standard is not warranted but instead the requisite degree of control may differ depending on the context within which the issue of control arises. Such a differentiated approach to ‘control’ is\n Art 8 ASR; Nicaragua Case (n 7) paras 116–17; Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 398.\n Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 131.\n ibid paras 131, 137.\n Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) paras 402–6.\n ibid paras 413–14.\n Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 117.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution\nsupported by international jurisprudence and doctrine. In the first place Article 8 of the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility (ASR) speaks of 'control' without any further qualification whereas the commentary suggests that it should apply with a degree of flexibility. Moreover, Article 55 ASR acknowledges the existence of special regimes which may have their own rules on attribution and responsibility. As far as international jurisprudence is concerned, the effective control criterion was employed in the Nicaragua Case in the context of state responsibility for violations of humanitarian law. The question that the Court had to answer was whether violations of humanitarian law committed by the Contras could be attributed to the USA, engaging its international responsibility. The ICTY on its part introduced the overall control criterion in order to characterize the war in Bosnia as international or non-international. The ICTY searched for the requisite criteria in international humanitarian law and decided to revert to the attribution standards found in the law of state responsibility only when it concluded that humanitarian law does not contain any specific criteria in this regard. Still, the ICTY diverged from the law of state responsibility and introduced the overall control criterion because in its opinion it was more judicious in the circumstances of the case. In the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ applied the effective control standard in the context of the law of state responsibility. The Court also opined that the rules on attribution 'do not vary with the nature of the wrongful act in question in the absence of a clearly expressed lex specialis'. This was said in order to rebut the suggestion that the attribution criteria should change when responsibility for genocide is at issue. However, the Court did not deny the existence of special regimes in general or within the law of state responsibility more specifically. Regarding the overall control test, the Court admitted that in the context in which it was pronounced by the ICTY it may have been 'applicable and suitable' and that 'logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues [characterisation of a conflict/state responsibility for genocide] which are very different in nature'. That said, the ICJ rejected the 'overall control' criterion for the law of state responsibility because it 'stretches too far, almost to a breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State's organs and its international responsibility'.\n J Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility (CUP 2001) 112.\n For example, art 3 of Fourth Hague Convention and art 91 of Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) (opened for signature 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1979) 1125 UNTS 3 introduce strict liability in international humanitarian law by providing that a State is to be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces. See also art 59 ASR.\n Tadic Appeal (n 34) paras 90, 98, 105.\n Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 401.\n ibid paras 404-405.\n ibid para 406.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nThe above bring into light the different rationale of the regimes within which attribution operates. On the one hand, the rationale behind the regime of state responsibility is to hold States responsible for their wrongful conduct but the regime has recognized the modern, narrower, definition of the ‘state’, and attributes to a State only the acts of those entities that are closely linked to it. At the same time, it recognizes different types of responsibility in view of the different ways in which a State can participate in the commission of a wrongful act. There also exist various international or national, criminal or civil processes to hold into account such sub-entities or their employees. The rationale behind the use of force regime, on the other hand, is to provide the template according to which force can be lawfully used in international relations. However, the use of force regime is very much State oriented. Even if nowadays non-State actors exist that can use large-scale force against other States, they are located in States and operate from within States. As the ICJ opined, it is important to ‘grasp the reality of the relationship between the person taking action and the state’. Thus, any form or degree of control by a State over a non-State actor that goes on to attack another State will suffice as for the victim State to use force by way of self-defence against the host State.\nThis situation can be distinguished from a situation where a State exercises no control over the non-State actor because it is unable to exert its authority over the whole of its territory or over the non-State actor. In that case, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence directly against the non-State actor.\nThat this is the case has long been established in the customary law of self-defence. According to the Caroline Case (which is treated as the source of the customary law on self-defence), a State can use force by way of self-defence directly against non-State actors. Moreover, according to Article 51 of the UN Charter, the self-defence trigger (an armed attack) is determined on the basis of events, not on the basis of its author.\nModern State practice relating to terrorism also affirms this approach to self-defence. For example, in 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hizbollah in Lebanon, following Hizbollah attacks which Lebanon was unable to prevent. Lebanon not only denied knowledge of the attacks but also\n See, for example, Art 16 ASR.\n Bosnia Genocide (n 24) para 392.\n N Tsagourias, ‘Non-State Actors and the Use of Force’ in J d’Aspremont (ed), Participants in the International Legal System: Multiple Perspectives on Non-State Actors in International Law, (Routledge 2011) 326ff.\n British and Foreign State Papers (James Ridgeway and Sons 1858) vol 30, 196–98.\n Separate Opinion of Judge Kooijmans in Congo v Uganda (n 24) paras 26–27 and in Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Advisory Opinion) [2004] ICJ Rep 2004, para 35 (Palestinian Wall); E Wilmshurst, ‘The Chatham House Principles of International Law on the Use of Force in Self-Defence’ (2006) 55 ICLQ 963, 969–71.\n SC Res 1310 (27 July 2000); SC Res 1337 (30 January 2001); SC Res 1553 (29 July 2004); SC Res 1559 (2 September 2004).\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 241\ndeclared that it did not condone them. Israel on its part declared that its action was not against the State of Lebanon but against Hizbollah.\nAgainst this, the ICJ pronouncement that self-defence is available only against ‘an armed attack by one State against another State’ is rather peculiar and has been criticized by other judges in their individual opinions. As Judge Kooijmans put it, ‘if armed attacks are carried out by irregular bands from such territory against a neighbouring State, they are still armed attacks even if they cannot be attributed to the territorial State. It would be unreasonable to deny the attacked State the right to self-defence merely because there is no attacker State, and the Charter does not so require’. The ICJ had another opportunity to deal with the issue of non-State actors but abstained from making any definite pronouncement. In the Congo v Uganda Case, Uganda claimed that its operations against rebels operating from within DRC were lawful self-defence measures in view of DRC’s inability to control its territory. The ICJ however declared Uganda’s actions disproportionate and as a result it felt that it was not required to opine on the legality of self-defence in response to attacks by irregular forces. It may be claimed that, had Uganda’s response been proportionate, it would have been a lawful measure of self-defence but this is arguing a contrario.\nBe that as it may, the ICJ’s assertion that the author of the armed attack should be a State and that the State should exercise ‘effective control’ over the non-State actor in order for the attack to be attributed to a State may also defeat its purpose which is to maintain peace because non-State actors will be able to attack other States with immunity, hiding behind the shield of the host State’s sovereignty and, conversely, States will be able to attack other States hiding behind non-State actors.\n Letter from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (17 May 1982) UN Doc S/15087; Identical letters from the Chargé d’affaires of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (13 July 2006) UN Doc A/60/938-S/2006/518; Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lebanon pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-2/1* A/HRC/3/2 23 November 2006, paras 42, 54.\n Identical letters from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (12 July 2006) UN Doc S/2006/515.

State Toleration or Unwillingness\nAs the case of terrorism has shown, cyber attacks can be mounted on States by non-State actors operating from within a State that tolerates them or is unwilling to suppress their activities. According to international law, a State should not allow 'its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states'71 and more specifically its territory is not to be used for military acts against another State.72 This amounts to a State's duty of due diligence which engages its international responsibility when the State fails in this regard. However, if the harmful act amounts to an armed attack, this transforms the legal characterization of the situation and places it within the use of force paradigm. The question then is whether a State that has suffered a cyber attack mounted by a non-State actor operating from within another State and tolerated by that State can use defensive force against that State. If the ICJ's effective control test were to apply in this case, the victim State would not be able to defend itself. However, it would not be much consolation to the victim State to know that it can hold the host State responsible for breaching its duty of due diligence or that it can take countermeasures against that State, but to still not be able to defend itself.73\nIf the duty of due diligence exists in order to protect important international values—such as peace and security—or enforce certain important obligations—such as not to use force—it would be unreasonable not to allow the victim State to defend itself against an armed attack which was suffered because of another State's deliberate failure to exercise due diligence.\nThe attribution standard of toleration and unwillingness was thus developed in the use of force regime in order to cover situations such as those described above, which were not hypothetical but real and pressing as the case of terrorist attacks all very often shows.74 For example, when the '9/11' attacks were committed by Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban regime refused to hand over Al-Qaeda leaders, the USA responded by using force by way of self-defence. This happened against a background of the Security Council making frequent demands on the Taliban regime not to provide sanctuary to international terrorists or organizations and to take effective measures in order to ensure that its territory was not used for terrorist activities.75 The US President justified the 2001 action on the basis of self-defence and declared that no distinction was\n\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 243\nto be made between those that committed the attack and those that harboured them. In the letter to the SC reporting its self-defence action the USA wrote:\nThe attacks on 11 September 2001 and the ongoing threat to the United States and its nationals posed by the Al-Qaeda organization have been made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation. Despite every effort by the United States and the international community, the Taliban regime has refused to change its policy.\nThis position was supported by the SC in Resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) which affirmed the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in response to the attacks.\nIn the Congo v Uganda Case, it seems that the ICJ has recognized that toleration by a State of non-State actors who go on to mount an attack on another State can give rise to a right of self-defence, although in that specific instance the ICJ could not conclude that the absence of action on the part of DRC was tantamount to toleration.\nIn sum, toleration by a State of actors that mount cyber attacks on other States or State unwillingness to suppress their activities will trigger self-defence action against those States. This criterion is in line with the State-centric character of the use of force regime by connecting the attack to the State's overall responsibility over its territory and people.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIt has been claimed in the preceding sections that attribution is critical for the lawfulness of any self-defence action; but attribution is a complex exercise having technical, political and legal aspects. As far as the legal aspects of attribution are concerned, it has been shown that international law has expanded and adapted the attribution standards that apply to the use of force regime to cater for new situations such as terrorism. The attribution standards as they stand today can very much accommodate cyber attacks for self-defence purposes.\nAccordingly, a cyber attack will be attributed to a State if it is perpetrated by a de jure or de facto organ of that State, or by actors under the direction,\n Presidential Address to the Nation (11 September 2001) available at: <http: 09=\"\" 2001=\"\" 20010911-16.html=\"\" news=\"\" georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> (accessed 18 June 2012).\n Letter from the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2001/946 and Letter from the Charge d'affaires ai of the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2006/947 (2001).\n Congo v Uganda (n 22) para 301.</http:>\nNicholas Tsagourias\ninstructions or control of a State, or by actors tolerated by a State. When the territorial State is, however, unable to prevent the attacks or the actors that perpetrated the attack operate independently of a State, the attack will be attributed to the actor itself, which will become the target of the self-defence action.\nThat having been said, it should be stressed that evolving State practice in this area may expand or adapt the attribution standards that apply to cyber attacks and thus the current standards should not be regarded as fixed or immutable."

More specifically, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence against another State if the attack has been committed by the latter's organs or agents or has been committed by non-State actors tolerated by that State. When no State is implicated in the cyber attack, the victim State can take direct self-defence action against the non-State actor. It is however noted that future State practice may amplify further the attribution standards or introduce new standards.\n## 1. Introduction\nThe term ‘cyber attack’ is used to describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace,¹ but this article will concern itself only with those cyber operations whose aim is to degrade, disrupt, deny or destroy information resident in computers, or to compromise the computers themselves.²\nSuch attacks produce not only effects which are internal to a computer or network but also effects which are external thereto by harming connected systems, facilities, materials or people. For example, a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, altering information concerning the position of aeroplanes, produces direct effects on the air traffic control system itself by compromising its operation; but it also demonstrates external effects, by causing air accidents resulting in material destruction and human loss. In fact, such effects may have been the primary aim of the cyber attack.\n* Professor of International Law and Security, University of Glasgow. Email: nicholas.tsagourias@glasgow.ac.uk.

It tries to trace back the cyber attack to its source and ascribe it to an author against whom action can be taken. Attribution is thus crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness. The latter aspect of attribution is the focus of this article. More specifically, this article will examine the attribution standards that need to be satisfied in order for a State to use force by way of self-defence against a cyber attack. It is necessary therefore to consider in the first place under what circumstances a cyber attack can activate a State’s right to self-defence.\n## 2. Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\nWhat distinguishes a cyber attack as defined above from other cyber provocations such as cyber exploitations is its harmful effect, in that a cyber attack makes the targeted system unavailable or compromises its integrity and authenticity.⁶ The immediate question is whether such effects are in themselves sufficient to trigger self-defence in the absence of other material and/or human harm.\nFor this reason, it is important to recall the circumstances under which self-defence can be exercised. These are prescribed in Article 51 of the UN Charter and in the customary international law of self-defence. Both branches of the law seem to agree that what triggers the right to self-defence is an armed attack. Although no definition of what constitutes an armed attack is provided in\n³ National Security Council, *The Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative* (2009) <http: cybersecurity=\"\" comprehensive-national-cybersecurity-initiative=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012); *A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: National Security Strategy* (HMSO 2010); *The UK Cyber Security Strategy Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world* (Cabinet Office 2011).\n⁴ NATO, ‘NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement’ Expert Report (17 May 2010) 45.\n⁵ White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World* (May 2011) <http: default=\"\" files=\"\" rss_viewer=\"\" international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf=\"\" sites=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) 14.\n⁶ HS Lin, ‘Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force’ (2010) 4 J Nat Sec Law and Policy 63, 64–68.</http:></http:>\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution\nthe Charter, it has been accepted that an armed attack is a use of force, defined as such by its gravity and its effects rather than by the instrument used.7 As the ICJ put it, an armed attack is the 'most grave form of the use of force' in view of its scale and effects.8 Consequently, a cyber attack that causes substantial human and/or material destruction can be equated to an armed attack for purposes of self-defence.9 That would be the case, for example, when a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, or a cyber attack on a nuclear reactor, caused substantial material or human destruction.\nA more difficult question is whether attacks on critical state infrastructure which cause substantial disruption but no physical or human damage could also constitute an armed attack for self-defence purposes. This of course presupposes a definition of what constitutes 'critical infrastructure'. Although there is no universally accepted definition, it seems that most definitions agree that certain services such as security, food, water, transportation, banking and finance, health, energy, governmental and public services constitute critical infrastructure. The 2001 Patriot Act defines critical infrastructure as 'systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters'. In the view of the present writer, a cyber attack on critical state infrastructure which paralyses or massively disrupts the apparatus of the State should be equated to an armed attack, even if it does not cause any immediate human injury or material damage. For example, an attack on a State's financial system which, by modifying or corrupting data, causes massive disruption to the economic life of a State, should qualify as an armed attack. The situation is similar to the conventional destruction of weapons. It is not their physical destruction as such but their unavailability in the sense of not being able to fulfil the purpose for which they have been set that makes an attack on them an armed attack.\n7 Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v USA) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 14 para 39 (Nicaragua Case).\n8 ibid paras 191-95.\n9 Y Dinstein, 'Computer Network Attack and Self-Defence' in MN Schmitt and BT O'Donnell, Computer Network Attack and International Law (US Naval War College, 2002) 99ff; MN Schmitt, 'Cyber Operations in International Law: The Use of Force, Collective Security, Self-Defence, and Armed Conflicts' in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy (National Research Council, National Academies Press 2010) 151ff.

Contra Dinstein (n 9) 105 and Buchan (n 9).\nNicholas Tsagourias\nConsequently, neither the attacks on Estonia in 2007 nor those on Georgia in 2008 fall within the definition of armed attack. More specifically, following the decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet era war memorial, governmental and banking websites were hit by a directed denial of service (DDoS) attack in 2007.¹² Similarly, in 2008, Georgian governmental websites were hit by a DDoS attack which coincided with the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Georgia in August of that year. Those attacks did not cause any human or material damage and the disruption that they did cause was contained and was manageable. The view that they did not amount to armed attack is also supported by the fact that in the case of Estonia Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which provides for collective self-defence action if a Member State has been attacked was not invoked but the whole incident was mainly treated under criminal law.¹³\nRelated to the above is the question of whether a cyber attack on a State's military infrastructure can per se constitute an armed attack. Such an attack would satisfy the self-defence criteria if it causes grave harm which, as was suggested above, does not need to be material or human harm but massive disruption that debilitates the State will also suffice. For example, a cyber attack that disables a State's command and control system can be equated to an armed attack because it disables the decision-making nerve of the State. Of course such an attack can also be a prelude to a kinetic attack in which case the right of pre-emptive self-defence arises.\nBe that as it may, identifying the specific cyber act that constitutes the armed attack is very important because cyber attacks are often 'multi-layered' in that the malicious infiltration of the system, the execution of the payload and the production of the harmful effects may take place in different time frames. If an attack is defined as such by its harmful effects including its debilitating effects, an attack would exist from the moment the harmful effects materialize irrespective of when the system has been infiltrated or the payload has been executed. However, if a State becomes aware of the fact that its systems have been compromised, it can take passive or active cyber defence measures to neutralize the threat. A State may even treat the infiltration as a prelude to a cyber or kinetic attack if information exists indicating that the penetration is part of an overall attack. In this case a State can resort to pre-emptive self-defence if all other means of neutralizing the cyber threat fail.\nThere is finally the question of whether cyber incidents that do not rise to the level of an armed attack as far as their gravity is concerned can trigger forcible reactions. 'Low intensity' cyber incidents are perhaps more likely to happen because they require less technical sophistication or means. The harm they\n¹² E Tikk, K Kaska and L Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence 2010) 14–33.\n¹³ NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Annual Session 2009, Committee Report 173 DSCFC 09 E bis-‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ <http: default.asp?shortcut=\"1782\" www.nato-pa.int=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) paras 58–61.</http:>\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 233\ncan cause may also be low. If one is to follow the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, such low-level attacks do not amount to armed attack for self-defence purposes and the only option available to the victim State is to take proportional and non-forcible countermeasures.¹⁴ Whether this is reasonable depends on the circumstances, but if the underlying strategy behind the low-intensity attacks and their cumulative effects are taken into account, one may reach a different conclusion. For example, frequent—albeit mildly disruptive attacks—on a State’s financial system may cause limited damage; but the cumulative effect may be substantial if overall trust in the system is destroyed, which may have been the aim of the individual attacks. It is perhaps in such cases that the accumulation of minor cyber provocations could rise to the level of an armed attack for self-defence purposes.\n# 3. Attribution: Technical and Political Aspects\nIf a cyber attack can activate the right of self-defence, what is important is to assign the attack to an author against whom self-defence action will be taken. Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks—as the case of terrorism demonstrates—and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain. Three particular characteristics of cyberspace make attribution extremely difficult. The first is ‘anonymity’ in that cyber attackers can hide their identity; the second is the possibility of launching multi-stage cyber attacks, in that a number of computers operated by different people and placed in different jurisdictions are infiltrated before an attack is launched; and the third is the speed with which a cyber attack can materialize. What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack; and it is especially critical that all of the above are done in a timely manner and accurately.¹⁵ To give an example, the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85 000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries,¹⁶ which makes the eventual identification of the physical operators of the computers and, above all, of the coordinators or real masterminds behind the attack, very difficult.\nAttribution of cyber attacks is thus a multifaceted process; it has technical, legal and political aspects, with each aspect feeding into the other. I will deal with the legal aspects of attribution in the next section but it is important to explain the technical and political aspects of attribution first.\n¹⁴ Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 249. Also see in this volume ME O’Connell, ‘Cyber Security without Cyber War’ s 4.1.\n¹⁵ DD Clark and S Landau, ‘Untangling Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 25 at 37.\n¹⁶ Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 20, 23.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nRegarding the technical aspects of attribution, although science is continuously developing attribution mechanisms which can trace back the machine that launched the attack, or its geolocation, at the same time, ‘anti-attribution’ mechanisms are also developing which can hide the provenance of the attack. Moreover, certain systems—such as ‘Tor’, used by the military—anonymize their user. As a result, although technical attribution can yield good results it can never be absolutely exact and, moreover, it cannot always identify the person who operated the machine or her/his affiliations.¹⁷ For this reason, in addition to technical investigation, intelligence and information analysis is needed in order to profile the authors of the attack, and to provide information about their capabilities and intentions or their links with States or other entities.¹⁸ As was aptly noted in the context of weapons of mass destruction, but which applies also to cyber war, ‘ultimately the central issue is assessment by the risk-averse security specialists of one international actor of the intentions of another actor’.¹⁹ To this end, the political climate within which the attack took place or who benefited from the attack need also to be taken into account.\nFrom the above it transpires that attribution combines technical investigation with intelligence and political assessments.\nThis however gives rise to questions about the availability and the probity of evidence upon which assessments are made. With regard to the availability of evidence, it is often difficult to obtain evidence concerning security matters or the evidence that becomes available is often truncated. In the Nicaragua Case the ICJ recognized that problem when it said that ‘the problem is not… the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State… but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator’.²⁰ In the case of a cyber attack this will be compounded by the speed of the attack, its anonymity, the possibility of ‘spoofing’, as well as the fact that it may have travelled through many different jurisdictions—in which case collecting evidence may not be physically possible, or may counter many legal as well as political hurdles.²¹ In the Corfu Channel Case the ICJ recognized the difficulties in furnishing evidence if the territory is under the control of another State and for this reason, the Court allowed ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.²²\n¹⁷ W Earl Boebert, ‘A Survey of Challenges in Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 43–48.\n¹⁸ ibid 49–50.\n¹⁹ WM Reisman and A Armstrong, ‘The Past and Future of the Claim of Preemptive Self-Defense’ (2006) 100 AJIL 525, 526.\n²⁰ Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 57.\n²¹ With regard to the Estonian attacks, see Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 27–28.\n²² Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 9, 18 (Corfu Channel Case).\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 235\nThis leads to the second issue, which is the probity of the evidence. International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence.²³ The only generic threshold that perhaps exists is that ‘claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive. The same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts’.²⁴ This standard is less strict than the ‘beyond any doubt’ or ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’²⁵ standard but is higher than the ‘balance of evidence’ or the ‘balance of probabilities’.²⁶ However, how can even that standard be satisfied if evidence relies on intelligence information—as it usually does—which can be withheld or be severely truncated because of its confidential nature? If the ICJ’s practice regarding confidential evidence is of any value, it demonstrates a lack of serious probing. In the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, for example, as in the *Corfu Channel Case*,²⁷ the Court did not even demand the production of classified documents by the Respondent²⁸—a failure criticized by one of the judges because the document could have ‘shed light on the central questions of intent and attributability’.²⁹\nFrom the above it transpires that standards concerning the availability and probity of evidence in cases involving armed attacks, uses of force or interventions are rather lax and are even more so in the case of cyber attacks because of their particular characteristics as mentioned above. That said, even if the standard of proof is not the same as the one required for the criminal prosecution of individuals³⁰ and even if ‘a more political approach to attribution…might accept less exacting standards’;³¹ it should be stressed that a State should not resort to self-defence on the basis of casual evidence or wild political inferences.\n²³ Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v USA) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 161 para 30 (Oil Platforms Case).\n²⁴ *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia)  ICJ Rep 43 para 209 (Bosnia Genocide Case); Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins (n 23) para 33.

International Law Criteria on Attribution\nAssuming now that by combining technical investigations and political analysis the cyber attack is assigned to a State, the victim State can lawfully take self-defence action against that State only if international law’s attribution standards for self-defence are also met. From international law and practice, three main attribution standards can be identified: according to the first, attacks by State organs are attributed to that State; according to the second attacks by state agents that is, by entities instructed, directed or controlled by a State are attributed to that State; and according to the third, attacks by entities tolerated by a State are attributed to that State. In all of the above instances, self-defence action can be taken against the implicated State. If none of the above applies but a non-State actor attacks another State, that non-State actor becomes the direct target of the self-defence action.\n# A. State Organs\nAccording to the first standard, the conduct of state organs is attributed to that State. Thus, if a *de jure* organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces,³² commits a cyber attack, the attack will be attributed to that State, which will then become the lawful target of the self-defence action.\nThis attribution standard is premised on the juridical status of the author of the attack and its validity has been affirmed on many occasions. For example, in the *Nicaragua Case* the ICJ attributed to the USA the acts of its own organs whereas in the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, the ICJ examined the question of whether the acts of genocide committed in Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia as being committed by Serbia’s *de jure* organs, but returned a negative answer because the perpetrators were not organs of that State under Serbian internal law.³³\nIn addition to the conduct of *de jure* organs, acts of a State’s *de facto* organs are also attributed to that State. A *de facto* organ is an entity that is assimilated to, or is absorbed in, the State apparatus. The ICJ had that in mind when it said in the *Nicaragua Case* that there must be a relationship of complete dependence and control.³⁴ The control that the State should exercise over such an entity in order to be treated as *de facto* organ is the control that is inherent in the relation of dependence and covers all fields of the entity’s activities.³⁵ International\n³² Art 4, ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ASR); *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) para 385.\n³³ *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) paras 385–95.\n³⁴ *Nicaragua Case* (n 7) para 109; *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) paras 390–91, 307. See also *Prosecutor v Duško Tadić a/k/a ‘DULE’* (Appeal) ICTY-94-1-A (15 July 1999) para 141 (*Tadić* Appeal).\n³⁵ *Nicaragua Case* (n 7) paras 109, 111.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 237\njurisprudence has not been very specific as to the requisite degree of control over the dependent entity, with the Court in the Nicaragua Case mentioning effective control, in addition to general control³⁶ whereas in the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ spoke of ‘strict control’ or a ‘great degree of control’.³⁷ At any rate, a high degree of control is required because ‘to equate persons or entities with State organs when they do not have that status under internal law must be exceptional’.³⁸ If, however, ‘some qualified, but real, margin of independence’³⁹ exists, the entity does not become a de facto organ and its conduct will not be attributed to a State on that basis. In the Nicaragua Case, for example, the ICJ did not attribute the acts of the Contras to the USA because it was not satisfied that the Contras were completely dependent on the USA, acting as its de facto organs;⁴⁰ and the ICJ reached the same conclusion in the Bosnia Genocide Case with regard to the Republika Srpska, the VRS and certain other paramilitary militias.⁴¹\n## B. State Agents\nThe second standard refers to an agency relationship which arises when an entity acts under the instructions, direction or control of a State.⁴² Thus, a cyber attack committed by an entity instructed by a state organ to do so will be attributed to that State. Instructions establish an ad hoc relationship between the entity that commits the cyber attack and the State and, for this reason, instructions should be proven in relation to the specific cyber attack.⁴³ The same is true with regard to directions. In the Tehran Hostages Case for example, the ICJ opined that, in order to attribute to Iran the occupation of the US Embassy by militants, it should establish that the militants ‘acted on behalf of the State, having been charged by some competent organ of the Iranian State to carry out a specific operation’.⁴⁴ In the same vein Judge Ago said in his Separate Opinion in the Nicaragua Case that to determine that persons or groups acted in the name and on behalf of the USA, they must ‘have been specifically charged by the United States authorities to commit a particular act, or to carry out a particular task of some kind on behalf of the United States’.⁴⁵\nWhereas there is no disagreement as far as the criterion of instructions or directions is concerned, the criterion of ‘control’ appears more problematic\n36 ibid, para 115.\n37 Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) paras 391 and 393.\n38 ibid para 393.\n39 ibid para 394.\n40 Nicaragua Case (n 7) paras 109, 227.\n41 Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 395.\n42 Art 8 ASR.\n43 Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 400.\n44 United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v Iran)  ICJ Rep 3 para 58.\n45 Separate Opinion of Judge Ago, Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 16.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nbecause of an apparent jurisprudential split as to the required degree of control. In the first place, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case introduced a stringent test when it spoke of ‘effective control’.⁴⁶ It will mean that a cyber attack carried out by a group or a person will be attributed to a State only if that State has exerted direct influence on the group or person to commit the attack or has enforced its perpetration. The difference between the case of an attack being committed by an entity under the effective control of a State and a de facto organ is that no relationship of dependence is required in the case of effective control but also, and more importantly, that attribution is premised on the control the State exercises in respect of each specific act whereas in the case of de facto organs it is premised on the control the State exercises over the actor.\nThe ICTY in the Tadic case introduced an alternative—lower—threshold. In that case, the ICTY distinguished the cases of individuals and unorganized groups—where effective control is the requisite standard—from that of organized groups, where overall control suffices. A State ‘wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity’ and, in that case, ‘it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law’.⁴⁷ Overall control covers the case where a State exerts general influence over a group and its activities. It would for example attribute to a State a cyber attack mounted by a group of ‘hacktivists’ to which a State has provided technical or other support and organized their activities even if no involvement in the specific attack can be proven. Overall control thus differs from effective control because the latter requires control over the specific act.⁴⁸ It also differs from the de facto organ test because there is no relationship of dependency between the State and that entity.\nThat said, in the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ criticized the ‘overall control’ test and reaffirmed the effective control test.⁴⁹ Thus, it held that the acts of genocide were not attributable to Serbia because that State did not exercise effective control over the operations in the course of which the acts took place.⁵⁰ Applying the ICJ’s findings to the case at issue, only cyber attacks carried out by entities under the effective control of a State can be attributed to that State.\nIn my view, such a stringent and uniform standard is not warranted but instead the requisite degree of control may differ depending on the context within which the issue of control arises.⁵¹ Such a differentiated approach to ‘control’ is\n⁴⁶ Art 8 ASR; Nicaragua Case (n 7) paras 116–17; Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 398.\n⁴⁷ Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 131.\n⁴⁸ ibid paras 131, 137.\n⁴⁹ Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) paras 402–6.\n⁵⁰ ibid paras 413–14.\n⁵¹ Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 117.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution\nsupported by international jurisprudence and doctrine. In the first place Article 8 of the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility (ASR) speaks of 'control' without any further qualification whereas the commentary suggests that it should apply with a degree of flexibility.⁵² Moreover, Article 55 ASR acknowledges the existence of special regimes which may have their own rules on attribution and responsibility.⁵³ As far as international jurisprudence is concerned, the effective control criterion was employed in the Nicaragua Case in the context of state responsibility for violations of humanitarian law. The question that the Court had to answer was whether violations of humanitarian law committed by the Contras could be attributed to the USA, engaging its international responsibility. The ICTY on its part introduced the overall control criterion in order to characterize the war in Bosnia as international or non-international. The ICTY searched for the requisite criteria in international humanitarian law and decided to revert to the attribution standards found in the law of state responsibility only when it concluded that humanitarian law does not contain any specific criteria in this regard.⁵⁴ Still, the ICTY diverged from the law of state responsibility and introduced the overall control criterion because in its opinion it was more judicious in the circumstances of the case. In the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ applied the effective control standard in the context of the law of state responsibility. The Court also opined that the rules on attribution 'do not vary with the nature of the wrongful act in question in the absence of a clearly expressed lex specialis'.⁵⁵ This was said in order to rebut the suggestion that the attribution criteria should change when responsibility for genocide is at issue. However, the Court did not deny the existence of special regimes in general or within the law of state responsibility more specifically. Regarding the overall control test, the Court admitted that in the context in which it was pronounced by the ICTY it may have been 'applicable and suitable' and that 'logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues [characterisation of a conflict/state responsibility for genocide] which are very different in nature'.⁵⁶ That said, the ICJ rejected the 'overall control' criterion for the law of state responsibility because it 'stretches too far, almost to a breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State's organs and its international responsibility'.⁵⁷\n⁵² J Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility (CUP 2001) 112.\n⁵³ For example, art 3 of Fourth Hague Convention and art 91 of Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) (opened for signature 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1979) 1125 UNTS 3 introduce strict liability in international humanitarian law by providing that a State is to be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces. See also art 59 ASR.\n⁵⁴ Tadic Appeal (n 34) paras 90, 98, 105.\n⁵⁵ Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 401.\n⁵⁶ ibid paras 404-405.\n⁵⁷ ibid para 406.\nNicholas Tsagourias\nThe above bring into light the different rationale of the regimes within which attribution operates. On the one hand, the rationale behind the regime of state responsibility is to hold States responsible for their wrongful conduct but the regime has recognized the modern, narrower, definition of the ‘state’, and attributes to a State only the acts of those entities that are closely linked to it. At the same time, it recognizes different types of responsibility in view of the different ways in which a State can participate in the commission of a wrongful act.⁵⁸ There also exist various international or national, criminal or civil processes to hold into account such sub-entities or their employees. The rationale behind the use of force regime, on the other hand, is to provide the template according to which force can be lawfully used in international relations. However, the use of force regime is very much State oriented. Even if nowadays non-State actors exist that can use large-scale force against other States, they are located in States and operate from within States. As the ICJ opined, it is important to ‘grasp the reality of the relationship between the person taking action and the state’.⁵⁹ Thus, any form or degree of control by a State over a non-State actor that goes on to attack another State will suffice as for the victim State to use force by way of self-defence against the host State.\nThis situation can be distinguished from a situation where a State exercises no control over the non-State actor because it is unable to exert its authority over the whole of its territory or over the non-State actor. In that case, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence directly against the non-State actor.⁶⁰\nThat this is the case has long been established in the customary law of self-defence. According to the Caroline Case (which is treated as the source of the customary law on self-defence), a State can use force by way of self-defence directly against non-State actors.⁶¹ Moreover, according to Article 51 of the UN Charter, the self-defence trigger (an armed attack) is determined on the basis of events, not on the basis of its author.⁶²\nModern State practice relating to terrorism also affirms this approach to self-defence. For example, in 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hizbollah in Lebanon, following Hizbollah attacks which Lebanon was unable to prevent.⁶³ Lebanon not only denied knowledge of the attacks but also\n⁵⁸ See, for example, Art 16 ASR.\n⁵⁹ Bosnia Genocide (n 24) para 392.\n⁶⁰ N Tsagourias, ‘Non-State Actors and the Use of Force’ in J d’Aspremont (ed), Participants in the International Legal System: Multiple Perspectives on Non-State Actors in International Law, (Routledge 2011) 326ff.\n⁶¹ British and Foreign State Papers (James Ridgeway and Sons 1858) vol 30, 196–98.\n⁶² Separate Opinion of Judge Kooijmans in Congo v Uganda (n 24) paras 26–27 and in Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Advisory Opinion)  ICJ Rep 2004, para 35 (Palestinian Wall); E Wilmshurst, ‘The Chatham House Principles of International Law on the Use of Force in Self-Defence’ (2006) 55 ICLQ 963, 969–71.\n⁶³ SC Res 1310 (27 July 2000); SC Res 1337 (30 January 2001); SC Res 1553 (29 July 2004); SC Res 1559 (2 September 2004).\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 241\ndeclared that it did not condone them.⁶⁴ Israel on its part declared that its action was not against the State of Lebanon but against Hizbollah.⁶⁵\nAgainst this, the ICJ pronouncement that self-defence is available only against ‘an armed attack by one State against another State’⁶⁶ is rather peculiar and has been criticized by other judges in their individual opinions.⁶⁷ As Judge Kooijmans put it, ‘if armed attacks are carried out by irregular bands from such territory against a neighbouring State, they are still armed attacks even if they cannot be attributed to the territorial State. It would be unreasonable to deny the attacked State the right to self-defence merely because there is no attacker State, and the Charter does not so require’.⁶⁸ The ICJ had another opportunity to deal with the issue of non-State actors but abstained from making any definite pronouncement. In the Congo v Uganda Case, Uganda claimed that its operations against rebels operating from within DRC were lawful self-defence measures in view of DRC’s inability to control its territory.⁶⁹ The ICJ however declared Uganda’s actions disproportionate and as a result it felt that it was not required to opine on the legality of self-defence in response to attacks by irregular forces.⁷⁰ It may be claimed that, had Uganda’s response been proportionate, it would have been a lawful measure of self-defence but this is arguing a contrario.\nBe that as it may, the ICJ’s assertion that the author of the armed attack should be a State and that the State should exercise ‘effective control’ over the non-State actor in order for the attack to be attributed to a State may also defeat its purpose which is to maintain peace because non-State actors will be able to attack other States with immunity, hiding behind the shield of the host State’s sovereignty and, conversely, States will be able to attack other States hiding behind non-State actors.\n⁶⁴ Letter from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (17 May 1982) UN Doc S/15087; Identical letters from the Chargé d’affaires of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (13 July 2006) UN Doc A/60/938-S/2006/518; Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lebanon pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-2/1* A/HRC/3/2 23 November 2006, paras 42, 54.\n⁶⁵ Identical letters from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (12 July 2006) UN Doc S/2006/515.

State Toleration or Unwillingness\nAs the case of terrorism has shown, cyber attacks can be mounted on States by non-State actors operating from within a State that tolerates them or is unwilling to suppress their activities. According to international law, a State should not allow 'its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states'71 and more specifically its territory is not to be used for military acts against another State.72 This amounts to a State's duty of due diligence which engages its international responsibility when the State fails in this regard. However, if the harmful act amounts to an armed attack, this transforms the legal characterization of the situation and places it within the use of force paradigm. The question then is whether a State that has suffered a cyber attack mounted by a non-State actor operating from within another State and tolerated by that State can use defensive force against that State. If the ICJ's effective control test were to apply in this case, the victim State would not be able to defend itself. However, it would not be much consolation to the victim State to know that it can hold the host State responsible for breaching its duty of due diligence or that it can take countermeasures against that State, but to still not be able to defend itself.73\nIf the duty of due diligence exists in order to protect important international values—such as peace and security—or enforce certain important obligations—such as not to use force—it would be unreasonable not to allow the victim State to defend itself against an armed attack which was suffered because of another State's deliberate failure to exercise due diligence.\nThe attribution standard of toleration and unwillingness was thus developed in the use of force regime in order to cover situations such as those described above, which were not hypothetical but real and pressing as the case of terrorist attacks all very often shows.74 For example, when the '9/11' attacks were committed by Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban regime refused to hand over Al-Qaeda leaders, the USA responded by using force by way of self-defence. This happened against a background of the Security Council making frequent demands on the Taliban regime not to provide sanctuary to international terrorists or organizations and to take effective measures in order to ensure that its territory was not used for terrorist activities.75 The US President justified the 2001 action on the basis of self-defence and declared that no distinction was\n71 Corfu Channel Case (n 22) 22; Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (23 November 2001); GA Res 55/63 (22 January 2001).\n72 The Alabama Claims (United States v Great Britain) 1872 reprinted in JB Moore, History and Digest of International Arbitrations to which the United States has been a Party Vol 1 (GPO 1898), 495ff.\n73 ME O'Connell, 'Cyber Security without Cyber War' (n 14) s 4.1.\n74 B Simma (ed), The Charter of the United Nations, A Commentary vol 1 (2nd edn, OUP 2002) 802.\n75 SC Res 1267 (15 October 1999) para 1.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 243\nto be made between those that committed the attack and those that harboured them.⁷⁶ In the letter to the SC reporting its self-defence action the USA wrote:\nThe attacks on 11 September 2001 and the ongoing threat to the United States and its nationals posed by the Al-Qaeda organization have been made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation. Despite every effort by the United States and the international community, the Taliban regime has refused to change its policy.⁷⁷\nThis position was supported by the SC in Resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) which affirmed the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in response to the attacks.\nIn the Congo v Uganda Case, it seems that the ICJ has recognized that toleration by a State of non-State actors who go on to mount an attack on another State can give rise to a right of self-defence, although in that specific instance the ICJ could not conclude that the absence of action on the part of DRC was tantamount to toleration.⁷⁸\nIn sum, toleration by a State of actors that mount cyber attacks on other States or State unwillingness to suppress their activities will trigger self-defence action against those States. This criterion is in line with the State-centric character of the use of force regime by connecting the attack to the State's overall responsibility over its territory and people.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIt has been claimed in the preceding sections that attribution is critical for the lawfulness of any self-defence action; but attribution is a complex exercise having technical, political and legal aspects. As far as the legal aspects of attribution are concerned, it has been shown that international law has expanded and adapted the attribution standards that apply to the use of force regime to cater for new situations such as terrorism. The attribution standards as they stand today can very much accommodate cyber attacks for self-defence purposes.\nAccordingly, a cyber attack will be attributed to a State if it is perpetrated by a de jure or de facto organ of that State, or by actors under the direction,\n⁷⁶ Presidential Address to the Nation (11 September 2001) available at: <http: 09=\"\" 2001=\"\" 20010911-16.html=\"\" news=\"\" georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> (accessed 18 June 2012).\n⁷⁷ Letter from the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2001/946 and Letter from the Charge d'affaires ai of the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2006/947 (2001).\n⁷⁸ Congo v Uganda (n 22) para 301.</http:>\nNicholas Tsagourias\ninstructions or control of a State, or by actors tolerated by a State. When the territorial State is, however, unable to prevent the attacks or the actors that perpetrated the attack operate independently of a State, the attack will be attributed to the actor itself, which will become the target of the self-defence action.\nThat having been said, it should be stressed that evolving State practice in this area may expand or adapt the attribution standards that apply to cyber attacks and thus the current standards should not be regarded as fixed or immutable."

More specifically, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence against another State if the attack has been committed by the latter's organs or agents or has been committed by non-State actors tolerated by that State. When no State is implicated in the cyber attack, the victim State can take direct self-defence action against the non-State actor. It is however noted that future State practice may amplify further the attribution standards or introduce new standards.\n## 1. Introduction The term ‘cyber attack’ is used to describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace,¹ but this article will concern itself only with those cyber operations whose aim is to degrade, disrupt, deny or destroy information resident in computers, or to compromise the computers themselves.² Such attacks produce not only effects which are internal to a computer or network but also effects which are external thereto by harming connected systems, facilities, materials or people. For example, a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, altering information concerning the position of aeroplanes, produces direct effects on the air traffic control system itself by compromising its operation; but it also demonstrates external effects, by causing air accidents resulting in material destruction and human loss. In fact, such effects may have been the primary aim of the cyber attack.\n* Professor of International Law and Security, University of Glasgow. Email: nicholas.tsagourias@glasgow.ac.uk. I would like to thank Dr Tim Storer, School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, for our discussions and for explaining some technical issues.

It tries to trace back the cyber attack to its source and ascribe it to an author against whom action can be taken. Attribution is thus crucial for the effectiveness of the counter-action but also for its lawfulness. The latter aspect of attribution is the focus of this article. More specifically, this article will examine the attribution standards that need to be satisfied in order for a State to use force by way of self-defence against a cyber attack. It is necessary therefore to consider in the first place under what circumstances a cyber attack can activate a State’s right to self-defence.\n## 2. Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack What distinguishes a cyber attack as defined above from other cyber provocations such as cyber exploitations is its harmful effect, in that a cyber attack makes the targeted system unavailable or compromises its integrity and authenticity.⁶ The immediate question is whether such effects are in themselves sufficient to trigger self-defence in the absence of other material and/or human harm.\nFor this reason, it is important to recall the circumstances under which self-defence can be exercised. These are prescribed in Article 51 of the UN Charter and in the customary international law of self-defence. Both branches of the law seem to agree that what triggers the right to self-defence is an armed attack. Although no definition of what constitutes an armed attack is provided in ³ National Security Council, *The Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative* (2009) <http: cybersecurity=\"\"comprehensive-national-cybersecurity-initiative=\"\"www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012); *A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: National Security Strategy*; *The UK Cyber Security Strategy Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world* (Cabinet Office 2011).\n⁴ NATO, ‘NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement’ Expert Report (17 May 2010) 45.\n⁵ White House, *International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World* <http: default=\"\"files=\"\"rss_viewer=\"\"international_strategy_for_cyberspace.pdf=\"\"sites=\"\"www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) 14.\n⁶ HS Lin, ‘Offensive Cyber Operations and the Use of Force’ (2010) 4 J Nat Sec Law and Policy 63, 64–68.</http:></http:> Cyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution the Charter, it has been accepted that an armed attack is a use of force, defined as such by its gravity and its effects rather than by the instrument used.7 As the ICJ put it, an armed attack is the 'most grave form of the use of force' in view of its scale and effects.8 Consequently, a cyber attack that causes substantial human and/or material destruction can be equated to an armed attack for purposes of self-defence.9 That would be the case, for example, when a cyber attack on an air traffic control system, or a cyber attack on a nuclear reactor, caused substantial material or human destruction.\nA more difficult question is whether attacks on critical state infrastructure which cause substantial disruption but no physical or human damage could also constitute an armed attack for self-defence purposes. This of course presupposes a definition of what constitutes 'critical infrastructure'. Although there is no universally accepted definition, it seems that most definitions agree that certain services such as security, food, water, transportation, banking and finance, health, energy, governmental and public services constitute critical infrastructure. The 2001 Patriot Act defines critical infrastructure as 'systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters'. In the view of the present writer, a cyber attack on critical state infrastructure which paralyses or massively disrupts the apparatus of the State should be equated to an armed attack, even if it does not cause any immediate human injury or material damage. For example, an attack on a State's financial system which, by modifying or corrupting data, causes massive disruption to the economic life of a State, should qualify as an armed attack. The situation is similar to the conventional destruction of weapons. It is not their physical destruction as such but their unavailability in the sense of not being able to fulfil the purpose for which they have been set that makes an attack on them an armed attack.\n\nNicholas Tsagourias Consequently, neither the attacks on Estonia in 2007 nor those on Georgia in 2008 fall within the definition of armed attack. More specifically, following the decision of the Estonian government to relocate a Soviet era war memorial, governmental and banking websites were hit by a directed denial of service (DDoS) attack in 2007.¹² Similarly, in 2008, Georgian governmental websites were hit by a DDoS attack which coincided with the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Georgia in August of that year. Those attacks did not cause any human or material damage and the disruption that they did cause was contained and was manageable. The view that they did not amount to armed attack is also supported by the fact that in the case of Estonia Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which provides for collective self-defence action if a Member State has been attacked was not invoked but the whole incident was mainly treated under criminal law.¹³ Related to the above is the question of whether a cyber attack on a State's military infrastructure can per se constitute an armed attack. Such an attack would satisfy the self-defence criteria if it causes grave harm which, as was suggested above, does not need to be material or human harm but massive disruption that debilitates the State will also suffice. For example, a cyber attack that disables a State's command and control system can be equated to an armed attack because it disables the decision-making nerve of the State. Of course such an attack can also be a prelude to a kinetic attack in which case the right of pre-emptive self-defence arises.\nBe that as it may, identifying the specific cyber act that constitutes the armed attack is very important because cyber attacks are often 'multi-layered' in that the malicious infiltration of the system, the execution of the payload and the production of the harmful effects may take place in different time frames. If an attack is defined as such by its harmful effects including its debilitating effects, an attack would exist from the moment the harmful effects materialize irrespective of when the system has been infiltrated or the payload has been executed. However, if a State becomes aware of the fact that its systems have been compromised, it can take passive or active cyber defence measures to neutralize the threat. A State may even treat the infiltration as a prelude to a cyber or kinetic attack if information exists indicating that the penetration is part of an overall attack. In this case a State can resort to pre-emptive self-defence if all other means of neutralizing the cyber threat fail.\nThere is finally the question of whether cyber incidents that do not rise to the level of an armed attack as far as their gravity is concerned can trigger forcible reactions. 'Low intensity' cyber incidents are perhaps more likely to happen because they require less technical sophistication or means. The harm they ¹² E Tikk, K Kaska and L Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence 2010) 14–33.\n¹³ NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Annual Session 2009, Committee Report 173 DSCFC 09 E bis-‘NATO and Cyber Defence’ <http: default.asp?shortcut=\"1782\"www.nato-pa.int=\"\"> (accessed 19 June 2012) paras 58–61.</http:> Cyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 233 can cause may also be low. If one is to follow the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, such low-level attacks do not amount to armed attack for self-defence purposes and the only option available to the victim State is to take proportional and non-forcible countermeasures.¹⁴ Whether this is reasonable depends on the circumstances, but if the underlying strategy behind the low-intensity attacks and their cumulative effects are taken into account, one may reach a different conclusion. For example, frequent—albeit mildly disruptive attacks—on a State’s financial system may cause limited damage; but the cumulative effect may be substantial if overall trust in the system is destroyed, which may have been the aim of the individual attacks. It is perhaps in such cases that the accumulation of minor cyber provocations could rise to the level of an armed attack for self-defence purposes.\n# 3. Attribution: Technical and Political Aspects If a cyber attack can activate the right of self-defence, what is important is to assign the attack to an author against whom self-defence action will be taken. Attribution is thus critical but is a very demanding and complicated exercise in the context of conventional attacks—as the case of terrorism demonstrates—and even more so in the case of cyber attacks, because of the nature of the cyber domain. Three particular characteristics of cyberspace make attribution extremely difficult. The first is ‘anonymity’ in that cyber attackers can hide their identity; the second is the possibility of launching multi-stage cyber attacks, in that a number of computers operated by different people and placed in different jurisdictions are infiltrated before an attack is launched; and the third is the speed with which a cyber attack can materialize. What is critical, then, is not only to trace back the attack to its source, for example to a computer, but to identify the person who operated the computer, and more importantly to identify the real ‘mastermind’ behind the attack; and it is especially critical that all of the above are done in a timely manner and accurately.¹⁵ To give an example, the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 involved a large botnet of approximately 85 000 hijacked computers from around 178 countries,¹⁶ which makes the eventual identification of the physical operators of the computers and, above all, of the coordinators or real masterminds behind the attack, very difficult.\nAttribution of cyber attacks is thus a multifaceted process; it has technical, legal and political aspects, with each aspect feeding into the other. I will deal with the legal aspects of attribution in the next section but it is important to explain the technical and political aspects of attribution first.\n¹⁴ Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 249. Also see in this volume ME O’Connell, ‘Cyber Security without Cyber War’ s 4.1.\n¹⁵ DD Clark and S Landau, ‘Untangling Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 25 at 37.\n¹⁶ Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 20, 23.\nNicholas Tsagourias Regarding the technical aspects of attribution, although science is continuously developing attribution mechanisms which can trace back the machine that launched the attack, or its geolocation, at the same time, ‘anti-attribution’ mechanisms are also developing which can hide the provenance of the attack. Moreover, certain systems—such as ‘Tor’, used by the military—anonymize their user. As a result, although technical attribution can yield good results it can never be absolutely exact and, moreover, it cannot always identify the person who operated the machine or her/his affiliations.¹⁷ For this reason, in addition to technical investigation, intelligence and information analysis is needed in order to profile the authors of the attack, and to provide information about their capabilities and intentions or their links with States or other entities.¹⁸ As was aptly noted in the context of weapons of mass destruction, but which applies also to cyber war, ‘ultimately the central issue is assessment by the risk-averse security specialists of one international actor of the intentions of another actor’.¹⁹ To this end, the political climate within which the attack took place or who benefited from the attack need also to be taken into account.\nFrom the above it transpires that attribution combines technical investigation with intelligence and political assessments.\nThis however gives rise to questions about the availability and the probity of evidence upon which assessments are made. With regard to the availability of evidence, it is often difficult to obtain evidence concerning security matters or the evidence that becomes available is often truncated. In the Nicaragua Case the ICJ recognized that problem when it said that ‘the problem is not… the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State… but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator’.²⁰ In the case of a cyber attack this will be compounded by the speed of the attack, its anonymity, the possibility of ‘spoofing’, as well as the fact that it may have travelled through many different jurisdictions—in which case collecting evidence may not be physically possible, or may counter many legal as well as political hurdles.²¹ In the Corfu Channel Case the ICJ recognized the difficulties in furnishing evidence if the territory is under the control of another State and for this reason, the Court allowed ‘a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence’.²² ¹⁷ W Earl Boebert, ‘A Survey of Challenges in Attribution’ in Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (n 9) 43–48.\n¹⁸ ibid 49–50.\n¹⁹ WM Reisman and A Armstrong, ‘The Past and Future of the Claim of Preemptive Self-Defense’ (2006) 100 AJIL 525, 526.\n²⁰ Nicaragua Case (n 7) para 57.\n²¹ With regard to the Estonian attacks, see Tikk, Kaska and Vihul (n 12) 27–28.\n²² Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 9, 18 (Corfu Channel Case).\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 235 This leads to the second issue, which is the probity of the evidence. International law does not lay down any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of force or self-defence.²³ The only generic threshold that perhaps exists is that ‘claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive. The same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts’.²⁴ This standard is less strict than the ‘beyond any doubt’ or ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’²⁵ standard but is higher than the ‘balance of evidence’ or the ‘balance of probabilities’.²⁶ However, how can even that standard be satisfied if evidence relies on intelligence information—as it usually does—which can be withheld or be severely truncated because of its confidential nature? If the ICJ’s practice regarding confidential evidence is of any value, it demonstrates a lack of serious probing. In the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, for example, as in the *Corfu Channel Case*,²⁷ the Court did not even demand the production of classified documents by the Respondent²⁸—a failure criticized by one of the judges because the document could have ‘shed light on the central questions of intent and attributability’.²⁹ From the above it transpires that standards concerning the availability and probity of evidence in cases involving armed attacks, uses of force or interventions are rather lax and are even more so in the case of cyber attacks because of their particular characteristics as mentioned above. That said, even if the standard of proof is not the same as the one required for the criminal prosecution of individuals³⁰ and even if ‘a more political approach to attribution…might accept less exacting standards’;³¹ it should be stressed that a State should not resort to self-defence on the basis of casual evidence or wild political inferences.\n²³ Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v USA) (Merits) [2003] ICJ Rep 161 para 30 (Oil Platforms Case).\n²⁴ *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia) [2007] ICJ Rep 43 para 209 (Bosnia Genocide Case); Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins (n 23) para 33. At other times the Court used the ‘conclusive’ or ‘sufficient’ standard.

International Law Criteria on Attribution Assuming now that by combining technical investigations and political analysis the cyber attack is assigned to a State, the victim State can lawfully take self-defence action against that State only if international law’s attribution standards for self-defence are also met. From international law and practice, three main attribution standards can be identified: according to the first, attacks by State organs are attributed to that State; according to the second attacks by state agents that is, by entities instructed, directed or controlled by a State are attributed to that State; and according to the third, attacks by entities tolerated by a State are attributed to that State. In all of the above instances, self-defence action can be taken against the implicated State. If none of the above applies but a non-State actor attacks another State, that non-State actor becomes the direct target of the self-defence action.\n# A. State Organs According to the first standard, the conduct of state organs is attributed to that State. Thus, if a *de jure* organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces,³² commits a cyber attack, the attack will be attributed to that State, which will then become the lawful target of the self-defence action.\nThis attribution standard is premised on the juridical status of the author of the attack and its validity has been affirmed on many occasions. For example, in the *Nicaragua Case* the ICJ attributed to the USA the acts of its own organs whereas in the *Bosnia Genocide Case*, the ICJ examined the question of whether the acts of genocide committed in Srebrenica were attributable to Serbia as being committed by Serbia’s *de jure* organs, but returned a negative answer because the perpetrators were not organs of that State under Serbian internal law.³³ In addition to the conduct of *de jure* organs, acts of a State’s *de facto* organs are also attributed to that State. A *de facto* organ is an entity that is assimilated to, or is absorbed in, the State apparatus. The ICJ had that in mind when it said in the *Nicaragua Case* that there must be a relationship of complete dependence and control.³⁴ The control that the State should exercise over such an entity in order to be treated as *de facto* organ is the control that is inherent in the relation of dependence and covers all fields of the entity’s activities.³⁵ International ³² Art 4, ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ASR); *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) para 385.\n³³ *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) paras 385–95.\n³⁴ *Nicaragua Case* (n 7) para 109; *Bosnia Genocide Case* (n 24) paras 390–91, 307. See also *Prosecutor v Duško Tadić a/k/a ‘DULE’* (Appeal) ICTY-94-1-A (15 July 1999) para 141 (*Tadić* Appeal).\n³⁵ *Nicaragua Case* (n 7) paras 109, 111.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 237 jurisprudence has not been very specific as to the requisite degree of control over the dependent entity, with the Court in the Nicaragua Case mentioning effective control, in addition to general control³⁶ whereas in the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ spoke of ‘strict control’ or a ‘great degree of control’.³⁷ At any rate, a high degree of control is required because ‘to equate persons or entities with State organs when they do not have that status under internal law must be exceptional’.³⁸ If, however, ‘some qualified, but real, margin of independence’³⁹ exists, the entity does not become a de facto organ and its conduct will not be attributed to a State on that basis. In the Nicaragua Case, for example, the ICJ did not attribute the acts of the Contras to the USA because it was not satisfied that the Contras were completely dependent on the USA, acting as its de facto organs;⁴⁰ and the ICJ reached the same conclusion in the Bosnia Genocide Case with regard to the Republika Srpska, the VRS and certain other paramilitary militias.⁴¹ ## B. State Agents The second standard refers to an agency relationship which arises when an entity acts under the instructions, direction or control of a State.⁴² Thus, a cyber attack committed by an entity instructed by a state organ to do so will be attributed to that State. Instructions establish an ad hoc relationship between the entity that commits the cyber attack and the State and, for this reason, instructions should be proven in relation to the specific cyber attack.⁴³ The same is true with regard to directions. In the Tehran Hostages Case for example, the ICJ opined that, in order to attribute to Iran the occupation of the US Embassy by militants, it should establish that the militants ‘acted on behalf of the State, having been charged by some competent organ of the Iranian State to carry out a specific operation’.⁴⁴ In the same vein Judge Ago said in his Separate Opinion in the Nicaragua Case that to determine that persons or groups acted in the name and on behalf of the USA, they must ‘have been specifically charged by the United States authorities to commit a particular act, or to carry out a particular task of some kind on behalf of the United States’.⁴⁵ Whereas there is no disagreement as far as the criterion of instructions or directions is concerned, the criterion of ‘control’ appears more problematic Nicholas Tsagourias because of an apparent jurisprudential split as to the required degree of control. In the first place, the ICJ in the Nicaragua case introduced a stringent test when it spoke of ‘effective control’.⁴⁶ It will mean that a cyber attack carried out by a group or a person will be attributed to a State only if that State has exerted direct influence on the group or person to commit the attack or has enforced its perpetration. The difference between the case of an attack being committed by an entity under the effective control of a State and a de facto organ is that no relationship of dependence is required in the case of effective control but also, and more importantly, that attribution is premised on the control the State exercises in respect of each specific act whereas in the case of de facto organs it is premised on the control the State exercises over the actor.\nThe ICTY in the Tadic case introduced an alternative—lower—threshold. In that case, the ICTY distinguished the cases of individuals and unorganized groups—where effective control is the requisite standard—from that of organized groups, where overall control suffices. A State ‘wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity’ and, in that case, ‘it is not necessary that, in addition, the State should also issue, either to the head or to members of the group, instructions for the commission of specific acts contrary to international law’.⁴⁷ Overall control covers the case where a State exerts general influence over a group and its activities. It would for example attribute to a State a cyber attack mounted by a group of ‘hacktivists’ to which a State has provided technical or other support and organized their activities even if no involvement in the specific attack can be proven. Overall control thus differs from effective control because the latter requires control over the specific act.⁴⁸ It also differs from the de facto organ test because there is no relationship of dependency between the State and that entity.\nThat said, in the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ criticized the ‘overall control’ test and reaffirmed the effective control test.⁴⁹ Thus, it held that the acts of genocide were not attributable to Serbia because that State did not exercise effective control over the operations in the course of which the acts took place.⁵⁰ Applying the ICJ’s findings to the case at issue, only cyber attacks carried out by entities under the effective control of a State can be attributed to that State.\nIn my view, such a stringent and uniform standard is not warranted but instead the requisite degree of control may differ depending on the context within which the issue of control arises.⁵¹ Such a differentiated approach to ‘control’ is ⁴⁶ Art 8 ASR; Nicaragua Case (n 7) paras 116–17; Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 398.\n⁴⁷ Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 131.\n⁴⁸ ibid paras 131, 137.\n⁴⁹ Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) paras 402–6.\n⁵⁰ ibid paras 413–14.\n⁵¹ Tadic Appeal (n 34) para 117.\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution supported by international jurisprudence and doctrine. In the first place Article 8 of the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility (ASR) speaks of 'control' without any further qualification whereas the commentary suggests that it should apply with a degree of flexibility.⁵² Moreover, Article 55 ASR acknowledges the existence of special regimes which may have their own rules on attribution and responsibility.⁵³ As far as international jurisprudence is concerned, the effective control criterion was employed in the Nicaragua Case in the context of state responsibility for violations of humanitarian law. The question that the Court had to answer was whether violations of humanitarian law committed by the Contras could be attributed to the USA, engaging its international responsibility. The ICTY on its part introduced the overall control criterion in order to characterize the war in Bosnia as international or non-international. The ICTY searched for the requisite criteria in international humanitarian law and decided to revert to the attribution standards found in the law of state responsibility only when it concluded that humanitarian law does not contain any specific criteria in this regard.⁵⁴ Still, the ICTY diverged from the law of state responsibility and introduced the overall control criterion because in its opinion it was more judicious in the circumstances of the case. In the Bosnia Genocide Case the ICJ applied the effective control standard in the context of the law of state responsibility. The Court also opined that the rules on attribution 'do not vary with the nature of the wrongful act in question in the absence of a clearly expressed lex specialis'.⁵⁵ This was said in order to rebut the suggestion that the attribution criteria should change when responsibility for genocide is at issue. However, the Court did not deny the existence of special regimes in general or within the law of state responsibility more specifically. Regarding the overall control test, the Court admitted that in the context in which it was pronounced by the ICTY it may have been 'applicable and suitable' and that 'logic does not require the same test to be adopted in resolving the two issues [characterisation of a conflict/state responsibility for genocide] which are very different in nature'.⁵⁶ That said, the ICJ rejected the 'overall control' criterion for the law of state responsibility because it 'stretches too far, almost to a breaking point, the connection which must exist between the conduct of a State's organs and its international responsibility'.⁵⁷ ⁵² J Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility 112.\n⁵³ For example, art 3 of Fourth Hague Convention and art 91 of Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) (opened for signature 8 June 1977, entered into force 7 December 1979) 1125 UNTS 3 introduce strict liability in international humanitarian law by providing that a State is to be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of its armed forces. See also art 59 ASR.\n⁵⁴ Tadic Appeal (n 34) paras 90, 98, 105.\n⁵⁵ Bosnia Genocide Case (n 24) para 401.\n⁵⁶ ibid paras 404-405.\n⁵⁷ ibid para 406.\nNicholas Tsagourias The above bring into light the different rationale of the regimes within which attribution operates. On the one hand, the rationale behind the regime of state responsibility is to hold States responsible for their wrongful conduct but the regime has recognized the modern, narrower, definition of the ‘state’, and attributes to a State only the acts of those entities that are closely linked to it. At the same time, it recognizes different types of responsibility in view of the different ways in which a State can participate in the commission of a wrongful act.⁵⁸ There also exist various international or national, criminal or civil processes to hold into account such sub-entities or their employees. The rationale behind the use of force regime, on the other hand, is to provide the template according to which force can be lawfully used in international relations. However, the use of force regime is very much State oriented. Even if nowadays non-State actors exist that can use large-scale force against other States, they are located in States and operate from within States. As the ICJ opined, it is important to ‘grasp the reality of the relationship between the person taking action and the state’.⁵⁹ Thus, any form or degree of control by a State over a non-State actor that goes on to attack another State will suffice as for the victim State to use force by way of self-defence against the host State.\nThis situation can be distinguished from a situation where a State exercises no control over the non-State actor because it is unable to exert its authority over the whole of its territory or over the non-State actor. In that case, the victim State can use force by way of self-defence directly against the non-State actor.⁶⁰ That this is the case has long been established in the customary law of self-defence. According to the Caroline Case (which is treated as the source of the customary law on self-defence), a State can use force by way of self-defence directly against non-State actors.⁶¹ Moreover, according to Article 51 of the UN Charter, the self-defence trigger (an armed attack) is determined on the basis of events, not on the basis of its author.⁶² Modern State practice relating to terrorism also affirms this approach to self-defence. For example, in 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hizbollah in Lebanon, following Hizbollah attacks which Lebanon was unable to prevent.⁶³ Lebanon not only denied knowledge of the attacks but also ⁵⁸ See, for example, Art 16 ASR.\n⁵⁹ Bosnia Genocide (n 24) para 392.\n⁶⁰ N Tsagourias, ‘Non-State Actors and the Use of Force’ in J d’Aspremont (ed), Participants in the International Legal System: Multiple Perspectives on Non-State Actors in International Law, 326ff.\n⁶¹ British and Foreign State Papers (James Ridgeway and Sons 1858) vol 30, 196–98.\n⁶² Separate Opinion of Judge Kooijmans in Congo v Uganda (n 24) paras 26–27 and in Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Advisory Opinion) [2004] ICJ Rep 2004, para 35 (Palestinian Wall); E Wilmshurst, ‘The Chatham House Principles of International Law on the Use of Force in Self-Defence’ (2006) 55 ICLQ 963, 969–71.\n⁶³ SC Res 1310 (27 July 2000); SC Res 1337 (30 January 2001); SC Res 1553 (29 July 2004); SC Res 1559 (2 September 2004).\nCyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 241 declared that it did not condone them.⁶⁴ Israel on its part declared that its action was not against the State of Lebanon but against Hizbollah.⁶⁵ Against this, the ICJ pronouncement that self-defence is available only against ‘an armed attack by one State against another State’⁶⁶ is rather peculiar and has been criticized by other judges in their individual opinions.⁶⁷ As Judge Kooijmans put it, ‘if armed attacks are carried out by irregular bands from such territory against a neighbouring State, they are still armed attacks even if they cannot be attributed to the territorial State. It would be unreasonable to deny the attacked State the right to self-defence merely because there is no attacker State, and the Charter does not so require’.⁶⁸ The ICJ had another opportunity to deal with the issue of non-State actors but abstained from making any definite pronouncement. In the Congo v Uganda Case, Uganda claimed that its operations against rebels operating from within DRC were lawful self-defence measures in view of DRC’s inability to control its territory.⁶⁹ The ICJ however declared Uganda’s actions disproportionate and as a result it felt that it was not required to opine on the legality of self-defence in response to attacks by irregular forces.⁷⁰ It may be claimed that, had Uganda’s response been proportionate, it would have been a lawful measure of self-defence but this is arguing a contrario.\nBe that as it may, the ICJ’s assertion that the author of the armed attack should be a State and that the State should exercise ‘effective control’ over the non-State actor in order for the attack to be attributed to a State may also defeat its purpose which is to maintain peace because non-State actors will be able to attack other States with immunity, hiding behind the shield of the host State’s sovereignty and, conversely, States will be able to attack other States hiding behind non-State actors.\n⁶⁴ Letter from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (17 May 1982) UN Doc S/15087; Identical letters from the Chargé d’affaires of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (13 July 2006) UN Doc A/60/938-S/2006/518; Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lebanon pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-2/1* A/HRC/3/2 23 November 2006, paras 42, 54.\n⁶⁵ Identical letters from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council (12 July 2006) UN Doc S/2006/515.

State Toleration or Unwillingness As the case of terrorism has shown, cyber attacks can be mounted on States by non-State actors operating from within a State that tolerates them or is unwilling to suppress their activities. According to international law, a State should not allow 'its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states'71 and more specifically its territory is not to be used for military acts against another State.72 This amounts to a State's duty of due diligence which engages its international responsibility when the State fails in this regard. However, if the harmful act amounts to an armed attack, this transforms the legal characterization of the situation and places it within the use of force paradigm. The question then is whether a State that has suffered a cyber attack mounted by a non-State actor operating from within another State and tolerated by that State can use defensive force against that State. If the ICJ's effective control test were to apply in this case, the victim State would not be able to defend itself. However, it would not be much consolation to the victim State to know that it can hold the host State responsible for breaching its duty of due diligence or that it can take countermeasures against that State, but to still not be able to defend itself.73 If the duty of due diligence exists in order to protect important international values—such as peace and security—or enforce certain important obligations—such as not to use force—it would be unreasonable not to allow the victim State to defend itself against an armed attack which was suffered because of another State's deliberate failure to exercise due diligence.\nThe attribution standard of toleration and unwillingness was thus developed in the use of force regime in order to cover situations such as those described above, which were not hypothetical but real and pressing as the case of terrorist attacks all very often shows.74 For example, when the '9/11' attacks were committed by Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban regime refused to hand over Al-Qaeda leaders, the USA responded by using force by way of self-defence. This happened against a background of the Security Council making frequent demands on the Taliban regime not to provide sanctuary to international terrorists or organizations and to take effective measures in order to ensure that its territory was not used for terrorist activities.75 The US President justified the 2001 action on the basis of self-defence and declared that no distinction was Cyber-attacks, Self-defence and the Problem of Attribution 243 to be made between those that committed the attack and those that harboured them.⁷⁶ In the letter to the SC reporting its self-defence action the USA wrote: The attacks on 11 September 2001 and the ongoing threat to the United States and its nationals posed by the Al-Qaeda organization have been made possible by the decision of the Taliban regime to allow the parts of Afghanistan it controls to be used by this organization as a base of operation. Despite every effort by the United States and the international community, the Taliban regime has refused to change its policy.⁷⁷ This position was supported by the SC in Resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) which affirmed the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in response to the attacks.\nIn the Congo v Uganda Case, it seems that the ICJ has recognized that toleration by a State of non-State actors who go on to mount an attack on another State can give rise to a right of self-defence, although in that specific instance the ICJ could not conclude that the absence of action on the part of DRC was tantamount to toleration.⁷⁸ In sum, toleration by a State of actors that mount cyber attacks on other States or State unwillingness to suppress their activities will trigger self-defence action against those States. This criterion is in line with the State-centric character of the use of force regime by connecting the attack to the State's overall responsibility over its territory and people.\n# 5. Conclusion It has been claimed in the preceding sections that attribution is critical for the lawfulness of any self-defence action; but attribution is a complex exercise having technical, political and legal aspects. As far as the legal aspects of attribution are concerned, it has been shown that international law has expanded and adapted the attribution standards that apply to the use of force regime to cater for new situations such as terrorism. The attribution standards as they stand today can very much accommodate cyber attacks for self-defence purposes.\nAccordingly, a cyber attack will be attributed to a State if it is perpetrated by a de jure or de facto organ of that State, or by actors under the direction, ⁷⁶ Presidential Address to the Nation (11 September 2001) available at: <http: 09=\"\"2001=\"\"20010911-16.html=\"\"news=\"\"georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> (accessed 18 June 2012).\n⁷⁷ Letter from the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2001/946 and Letter from the Charge d'affaires ai of the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (7 October 2001) S/2006/947 (2001).\n⁷⁸ Congo v Uganda (n 22) para 301.</http:> Nicholas Tsagourias instructions or control of a State, or by actors tolerated by a State. When the territorial State is, however, unable to prevent the attacks or the actors that perpetrated the attack operate independently of a State, the attack will be attributed to the actor itself, which will become the target of the self-defence action.\nThat having been said, it should be stressed that evolving State practice in this area may expand or adapt the attribution standards that apply to cyber attacks and thus the current standards should not be regarded as fixed or immutable."
