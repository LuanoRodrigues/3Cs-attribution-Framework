INTRODUCTION\nTwelve years ago, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was the first to warn of the threat of a cyber \"Pearl Harbor\" or a cyber \"9/11\" terrorist attack, as well as of cyber threats that \"could virtually paralyze the nation.\"¹ Ten years later, Costa Rica was the victim of an unprecedented assault when ransomware cyber attacks virtually paralyzed it to the extent that its president had to officially declare a state of emergency. Albania, a NATO member State, severed diplomatic ties with Iran following Iranian cyber attacks that aimed to cripple Albania's online government services and leak sensitive emails and government data.² In an era of global interconnectedness, the risks are borderless, severe global effects are at stake, and even sensitive national security computer control systems can be targeted. Unsurprisingly, these threatening cyber capabilities carry strategic implications for geopolitics, including the \"Great Power Competition.\"³ This rivalry between powers, coupled with deep ideological disparities (democratic versus authoritarian values), has become a major obstacle in ensuring global safety and stability in and through cyberspace. Rather than reaching a universal consensus on binding comprehensive international regulation, the international community, influenced by the conflicting views of competing powers, has made little headway. Consensus has been limited to agreeing in principle that international law, particularly the UN Charter, is applicable to cyberspace and concluding eleven voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace (the \"List of Non-Binding\n1.

This ambiguity provides major powers with enough leeway to strive for “cyberspace superiority”⁵ while ostensibly maintaining their reputation as law-abiding nations. On the other side of the fence, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea (CRINK) have exploited this ambiguity and the technical characteristics of cyberspace for advancing their interests. Under such circumstances, the List of Non-Binding Norms’s effectiveness in changing State behavior and the level of State compliance are low. Moreover, the norms’ effectiveness and State compliance are influenced by the extent to which the norms and the process of application are perceived as legitimate, as well as the degree to which the outcomes align with the expectations derived from these norms and processes.⁶\n⁴.

Dunoff &amp; Mark A. Pollack eds., 2013); Timothy Meyer, *How Compliance Understates Effectiveness*, 108 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW UNBOUND 93 (2014).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nAgainst the backdrop of this normative ambiguity and inherent legal uncertainty, the process of attributing State responsibility stands as an essential and exclusive measure to hold specific States accountable for violating the norms of the List. To gauge the extent to which the United States has developed its attribution policy in the past decade, it is worth revisiting Secretary Panetta's 2012 remarks.⁷ In response to two consecutive destructive cyber attacks, he hinted at the improving technological capabilities to address the attribution problem by identifying cyber attackers and attributing responsibility.⁸ Therefore, “potential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions that may try to harm America.”⁹ However, it is important to note that neither the United States nor the direct victim States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, officially attributed responsibility for these cyber attacks to Iran, even though its responsibility has been widely accepted.\nIn fact, my previous published research on State practice in cyberspace between 2012 and 2018, co-authored with Yuval Shany, revealed that explicit official attributions were the exception during that period.¹⁰ Nonetheless, the last two attribution determinations addressed in that study indicated a shift from national official attributions toward collective attributions.¹¹\nIndeed, the collective activity of nations in attributing responsibility to States for irresponsible behavior in cyberspace and in responding to such behavior has become a vital component of the deterrence pillar within the U.S. National Cyber Strategy. The United Kingdom, the closest ally to the United States, has endorsed this strategy.¹²\n7. Panetta, supra note 1.

In this article “cyber attacks,” “cyber operations,” and “cyber activities” are used interchangeably, but the article focuses on politically motivated incidents, that is, cyber attacks conducted by States through their official organs and agents or through third parties as proxies.\n9.

For the purposes of this article, “official attribution” refers to any public, verbal or non-verbal, statement made by a senior official of a State authorized to formally attribute responsibility for a given cyber attack to another State. Heads of State, ministries of foreign affairs, and other ministries whose mandate includes cybersecurity naturally hold such authority. As such, official attributions must be both public and political. Therefore, in this research, indictments filed or unsealed by the U.S. Department of Justice, personal sanctions imposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury, advisory alerts issued by the U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, and other reports from national law enforcement agencies, cannot on their own constitute an official attribution of responsibility to a State. However, they can certainly provide grounds for the United States and other States to attribute responsibility officially and explicitly to another State. Subsequently, the term “collective attribution” refers to a State’s official attribution joined by at least one other nation’s official attribution. Alternately, it shall apply if the State’s official attribution announcement is accompanied simultaneously and in coordination with another State officially announcing a response to the same cyber operation through indictments, sanctions, or joint advisories.\nThis article evaluates whether the collective attribution process and its outcomes can be perceived as legitimate and credible by the international community, including impartial, nonaligned States. Furthermore, it evaluates whether this process has become a crucial component in effectively holding States accountable for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms and in deterring States from such violations. Analyzing these and related issues requires a sound understanding of the official attribution process in practice, focusing on identifying legitimacy and credibility disparities, and researching the collective attributions announced so far. The article is built exclusively upon open-source intelligence.\nThe article continues as follows. Part II describes the official attribution process, differentiating between technological, legal, and political attributions and discussing the reluctance of States to officially attribute re\nes/deterrence-in-the-cyber-age-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary (presenting the United Kingdom’s deterrence strategy, mirroring the U.S. approach).\n274\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nsponsibility. Part III explores major aspects of the American attribution process, the most influential one, excluding the internal division of labor among the U.S. national security and law enforcement entities. It includes five sections that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could affect the extent to which the process's outcomes would be perceived as credible and legitimate. The first is the instrumental ambiguity the United States has embraced in the absence of a binding international convention, which has an adverse effect on transparency and source-based legitimacy. The subsequent three sections—intelligence-based attribution, attribution by indictment, and the private sector's role in ensuring cyber security—are important for mitigating the challenge of transparency but are still insufficient to ensure credibility and legitimacy. The fifth section explores collaboration between the private sector, particularly American corporations, including the most powerful tech platforms globally, and U.S. national security entities responsible for the American attribution process. This all-American collaboration may raise serious concerns among non-American constituencies about the credibility and legitimacy of the U.S. attribution process and its outcomes. Part IV delves into the specific collective attributions starting with three international initiatives. Two of these, initially planned to catalyze and empower collective attributions, have already faded, while the third initiative holds potential as part of a solution. Section IV(B) is a table that succinctly presents fourteen cases of collective attribution, spanning from the first collective attribution on December 19, 2017, until January 1, 2024. A detailed overview of these fourteen cases appears as an annex at the end of this article. Section IV(C) analyzes the findings. Part V concludes.\n## II. OFFICIAL ATTRIBUTION\nMuch has been written in the literature about detecting, identifying, and attributing responsibility for cyber attacks to a culprit State by the official authorities of the victim State.¹³ Only a decade ago, the prevalent view con\n¹³.

Any savvy hacker, let alone a government or State-sponsored one, is capable of manipulatively concealing their identity and astutely misdirecting would-be trackers. Nonetheless, today, the prevalent view has changed; while still challenging and occasionally time-consuming, it has become more feasible to uncover the true facts. Advanced cyber forensic investigative capabilities, which cyber power States and powerful cyber security firms possess, may enable them to unmask authentic technical features of a cyber attack, including the computers involved in the operation and their geographic locations. They may even identify the hacker or group of hackers according to their authentic technological fingerprints, precluding manipulative attempts to deceive and mislead the investigators. Such technical findings may lead to a technical attribution,¹⁵ which mostly lacks credible responses to the following questions: Who, in fact, stands behind the hackers who conducted the given cyber attack? What are the real motives? Was a State involved, and to what extent?¹⁶\nCompleting the missing pieces of the puzzle by gathering evidence from all-source intelligence may fill the probability gaps, enabling States to officially attribute responsibility to another State for unlawful cyber operations targeting other States. Nevertheless, this task remains easier said than done, particularly considering the challenges associated with legally attributing State responsibility, which I will address in a subsequent article.\n14. Compare Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyberattacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND SECURITY LAW 229 (2012), with Panetta, supra note 1.\n15. The term “technical attribution” is somehow misleading since technical attribution mostly does not result in clear attribution of responsibility to a State. At most, it is an estimated attribution of responsibility to a group of hackers based on the findings of tactics, techniques, and procedures. Reviewing the methods and techniques used in the discourse of technical investigations is beyond the scope of this article. For more information on this topic, see D.D. Clark &amp; S. Landau, Untangling Attribution, in PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY 25, 25–40 (2010); see also sources cited in supra note 13.\n16. Kristen Eichensehr, The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution, 67 UCLA LAW REVIEW 520 (2020); see also Lin, supra note 13, at 8–19 (emphasizing the need for all-source intelligence); GUITTON, supra note 13, at 36.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nEvery victim State thoroughly analyzes the information collected from all sources, including from cyber power State allies and cyber security and tech firms, to conclude whether the information is well-established and sufficient for a definite attribution. Even if the information includes enough evidence for attribution, the victim State's political leadership must weigh a wide range of strategic considerations and then determine whether to officially attribute responsibility; what level of transparency to implement; whether to retaliate, and if so, how, covertly or overtly; and which type of response would be perceived as lawful or legitimate in the given circumstances?\nA State might avoid an official attribution to preclude risks and actions that do not coincide with its national security interests, such as jeopardizing intelligence sources, disclosing intelligence gaps that the victim State may have pertaining to its rivals' cyber capabilities, exposing the victim State's confidential cyber capabilities, and averting the significant risk of misattribution, which could lead policymakers to wrongly engage in retribution and escalation.\nFurthermore, by refraining from public attribution, the victim State eliminates public pressure for retaliation and may lead the culprit State to believe it has not been detected. This strategy could allow the victim State to covertly monitor the operation and gather valuable intelligence about its rival's cyber capabilities. Additionally, it could facilitate the detection of additional covert operations employing the same cyber techniques while also considering disinformation or deception operations.[17] Moreover, powers that still obscure their political and legal approaches to pending cyber legal questions—such as the boundaries of legitimate \"cyber espionage,\" the clear threshold for constituting a prohibited \"use of force\" and a prohibited intervention, and how \"territorial sovereignty\" should be applied in cyberspace—might hesitate to officially attribute responsibility in specific circumstances. This is because such attribution could reduce the legal ambiguity these States have embraced to preserve their technological edge and maintain strategic leeway.\nTherefore, attribution is primarily a political decision relying on prudent and thorough discretion on whether to officially attribute responsibil-\n17.

The attribution determination is not necessarily contingent on legal proceedings. $^{18}$  The reasonableness of such an ex ante attribution must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and under no binding requirements of transparency and standard of proof. $^{19}$  Thus, it is no more than a public political denunciation, especially when not accompanied by legal claims and countermeasures. Although the attribution may rely on technical findings and additional evidence from any other source of information, it does not necessarily have to withstand the legal scrutiny that a formal legal attribution of State responsibility might face.\nAs noted above, the difficulties of legally attributing State responsibility will be addressed in a subsequent article. For the purposes of the present article, it is worth noting the following: pursuant to the rules of State responsibility, a State harmed by a malicious cyber operation that is willing to officially attribute responsibility to an attacking State and has a legal justification for a lawful response, must meet two cumulative requirements.[20] The first is to indicate a breach of an international rule that binds States under circumstances like those of the cyber incident in question. This might be controversial as long as international cyber law remains in its embryonic stage and the extent and conditions under which customary rules of international law would apply to cyberspace as binding law continue to be open-ended. The second requirement is to identify a perpetrator suspected of breaching the international rule and substantiate their connection—either as an official agent or as a proxy—to a specific State.\nThus far, none of the attributing States have faced demands to legally prove their attribution statement within the framework of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Due to cyberspace's unique characteristics and legal ambiguity, the legal demands for substantiating State responsibility in cyberspace are uncertain, making it more difficult to legally attribute such responsibility.[21] While legally attributing State responsibility for international\n18.

In this context, Delbert Tran defined the \"attribution problem\" as a complete \"red herring.\"22 In circumstances where a sufficient degree of certainty (rather than absolute certainty) is enough to impose responsibility, and computer scientists have developed a range of tools to trace the culprits, the problem can be solved by \"configuring the law.\"23 Clement Guitton finds the attribution of State responsibility \"a lot more complex and nuanced,\" adding that the lack of binding standards of proof provides the States involved with great flexibility to manipulatively achieve their political aims.24\nNevertheless, the following section shows that leading cyber power States are not enthusiastic, to put it mildly, about officially attributing responsibility to other States for violating norms of responsible State behavior. This is despite the fact that official attribution is a political act, ostensibly exempt from meeting legal requirements, such as transparent and admissible evidence. To date, this process has never been applied in court with respect to cyber incidents.\n# A. Reluctance of States to Officially Attribute Responsibility\nDuring recent decades, States have conducted hundreds or thousands of disruptive and destructive cyber attacks either through their official organs and agents or through proxies. Only in a tiny fraction of cases did States officially attribute responsibility to other States based on technical and all-source intelligence. At times, these official attributions also relied on private sector contributions through confidential or nonconfidential reports of relevant companies. At least until the second half of 2017, victim States would refrain from officially attributing responsibility to another State unless they were amid an armed conflict, during which they often blamed\nOF INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION (Cesare P.R. Romano, Karen Alter &amp; Yuval Shany eds., 2013).\n22.

GUITTON, supra note 13, at 91.\nInternational Law Studies\n2024\neach other.²⁵ Other victim States announced they were targeted by State-sponsored groups yet refrained from publicly identifying the sponsor State.\nIn fact, until 2017 the United States was the only State that had officially attributed responsibility to another State for executing a specific cyber attack in peacetime. The United States did so only twice, both in rare circumstances: attribution to North Korea for executing the Sony Pictures hack (December 2014), and attribution to Russia for conducting the Democratic National Committee hack and additional cyber operations meddling in the American election campaign (2016).²⁶ Another well-known damaging cyber attack, the Ababil operation (distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against New York's financial sector in 2011–2013), was investigated and, three years later, resulted in indicting in absentia foreign operatives who were Iranian government agents.²⁷ The detailed indictment, on the face of things, could be sufficient for officially attributing responsibility to the Iranian regime. However, the U.S. Administration declined to follow this path, likely due to political and national security considerations. The United States implemented the same approach and refrained from official attributions on additional occasions when the Department of Justice also indicted Chinese, Russian, and North Korean governmental operatives for breaching U.S. law.²⁸\nThe United Kingdom also avoided officially attributing State responsibility until October 2017, when it did so for the first time with respect to the WannaCry cyber attack.²⁹ Interestingly, France continues to embrace a\n25.

Efrony &amp; Shany, supra note 10, at 607, 611–12. Both incidents were investigated and promptly resolved by firms from the private sector concurrently with authorized U.S. agencies. The Sony Pictures hack was the first destructive State cyber attack conducted against targets located on U.S. soil. The Democratic National Committee hack was the first U.S. official attribution to Russia for interfering in the U.S. presidential election despite explicit warnings by the U.S. Administration.\n27.

Consequently, to date, France has never officially, and on its own—as opposed to under the EU's collective attributions detailed below—attributed to another State responsibility for a cyber attack targeted at French national interests.³⁰ Strangely, France even declined to attribute responsibility for the 2017 Macron Leaks, even when the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging six officers of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) for responsibility for this malicious Russian cyber operation.³¹\nGermany has embraced a similar policy, with two exceptions related solely to Russian intervention in German election campaigns.³² The first exception occurred in October 2018, when Germany joined a collective attribution led by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, attributing to the GRU responsibility for a series of severe cyber attacks, including the Bundestag hack of 2015.³³ In 2019, more than four years later, the German\n30.

One possible explanation might have been the relentless Russian attempts to meddle in the tense September 26, 2021, German elections and the urgent need to stop those attempts. The second, and so far, the last, exceptional official attribution reinforced this estimation. On September 5, 2021, Germany officially attributed to Russia responsibility for cyber attacks conducted by a cyber group dubbed Ghostwriter, even though the evidence was not “hard” but “reliable information” that established “suspicions” against the GRU.³⁶ This triggered an official diplomatic protest and an investigation, yet no one waited for its final findings due to the short time left (three weeks) until the elections.\nIt is noteworthy that this was the first report of a State officially holding another State accountable for a cyber attack and responding with an official diplomatic protest, relying on information that merely met the level of “suspicions.” Apparently, this sort of cutting corners or lowering the bar of evidence stemmed from the urgent need to stop or deter Russia from interfering with the quickly approaching German elections race. This coincides with the principle, according to which an official attribution is a purely political decision, not necessarily a legal attribution that should meet specific legal requirements.

The attribution determination does not rely on full transparency or even a significant degree of transparency, let alone the ability to withstand any external, independent, and impartial scrutiny. This provides room for questioning the credibility and legitimacy of the official attribution. Part III addresses several segments of the U.S. national attribution process, examining how they may have potential positive or negative impacts on the legitimacy and credibility of the collective process and its outcomes.\n## III. EVALUATING ASPECTS OF LEGITIMACY AND CREDIBILITY IN THE ATTRIBUTION PROCESS\nNational security interests dictate confidentiality regarding classified intelligence, including information about sensitive cyber tools, detection capabilities, and military cyber capabilities. However, in the absence of multinational, impartial, legal, and professional scrutiny regarding the accuracy and lawfulness of the official attribution in any given situation, attributing States must be mindful of how various constituencies could perceive their attribution statements. Without accepted clear and binding rules, these statements may not be viewed as lawful. Nevertheless, there is a concerted effort to influence public opinion through enhancing the legitimacy of the attribution process. If successful, this could bolster the effectiveness of its attribution determinations.\nThe following sections address five segments that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could positively or negatively influence how the outcomes of the process are perceived for credibility and\n37.

Except for attribution by indictment, these segments are relevant to the UK attribution process, as well as those of other like-minded cyber power States. Unlike authoritarian regimes, these States have embraced the courses of action described in the following sections to contend with the demand for transparency while striving to achieve the best result for their own national security interests.\n# A. An Instrumental Ambiguity\nCyberspace's unique technological attributes produce opportunities for cyber power States to surreptitiously generate significant strategic gains through covert cyber operations, thereby minimizing the risk of being held accountable for breaching the law and harming their reputation as law abiding States. On the one hand, States strive to evade legal responsibility by distancing themselves from any factual or legal linkage to the malicious cyber operations in question. On the other hand, national security interests dictate the non-disclosure of classified information for both victim and attacking States. However, such data could help them substantiate arguments to strengthen or dismiss relevant accusations.\nAs mentioned above, States, particularly the leading powers involved in the Great Power Competition, have embraced instrumental ambiguity, including maintaining silence on questions related to the interpretation and application of recognized principles and rules of customary international law in cyberspace. The primary motive behind this policy is to retain a sufficient margin of maneuver to enable the protection and promotion of strategic national interests in the rapidly evolving cybersphere. This policy of ambiguity inherently leads to accountability gaps that the most influential cyber power States, like the United States, are reluctant to resolve. Nevertheless, it is crucial for these States to play a decisive role in shaping international cyber law in a manner and at a time that aligns best with their national security interests. Unsurprisingly, they seek to avoid situations requiring an independent, international, judicial forum, such as the International Court of Justice, to resolve legal ambiguities surrounding State conduct in cyberspace.\nNotwithstanding the growing number of States that have clarified, albeit partially and cautiously, their views about a limited number of legal questions, the policy of ambiguity still prevails. The policy influences policymakers when considering whether to officially attribute responsibility and\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nwhen considering how transparent to be regarding relevant evidence and legal arguments.³⁹\nOfficial attribution regarding cyber incidents in itself does not eliminate the need for transparency. This requirement is inherent in the legal obligation to substantiate State responsibility in both non-cyber and cyber incidents.⁴⁰ Transparency is essential to legitimize the official attribution by reflecting its “right process” through its process-based and outcome-based legitimacy.⁴¹ In the absence of accessible international judicial or quasi-judicial forums, as well as an impartial international monitoring institution, conflicting States might seek to influence the final “judgment” of the “international court of legitimacy.” This type of influence often involves legitimizing one side while delegitimizing the other. To achieve this, States should enhance transparency regarding their findings and, more importantly, with respect to processes and procedures undertaken. This includes ensuring that they align with Thomas Franck’s concept of the “right process.”⁴² The degree to which this transparency is genuine and comprehensive serves to strengthen their arguments in attributing responsibility or denying it, respectively.\nRelying solely on the investigative role of the United States or the United Kingdom, coupled with limited transparency and unwillingness to disclose persuasive evidence, opens the door to plausible deniability. Excluding independent, objective, and multinational experts, as well as representatives from other States, from participating in the attribution process also provides grounds for criticizing the integrity of the process. The absence of these persons may raise concerns about the process being flawed, unfounded, politically biased, and non-transparent, thus, not credible or legit-\n³⁹.

These concerns are particularly significant given the common reality of blanket denials by accused States.\nShould a State that officially attributes State responsibility for wrongful acts in cyberspace evade disclosure of the evidence and confidential information upon which the attribution and, if undertaken, retribution rely?\nThe first to address this question, in November 2016, was Brian Egan, U.S. State Department Legal Advisor, who noted that States are not required to act with full transparency when attributing responsibility to another State.43 Since then, a growing number of States have embraced a legal stance that denies the obligation to reveal classified evidence prior to attribution or countermeasures, making the extent of disclosure a matter of policy that often involves complex considerations.44 Striking a balance between accountability, diplomatic relations, and, most importantly, national security, including the strategic interest of maintaining instrumental ambiguity, remains a significant challenge in the evolving landscape of cyberspace governance. Yet simply prioritizing national security interests to the extent of excluding transparency may erode trust in the attribution statement. Nevertheless, powers like the United States and the United Kingdom, which possess advanced cyber capabilities and robust intelligence, do not hesitate to base their attribution claims solely on their intelligence assessment system, thereby preserving confidentiality and national security interests.\n## B. Intelligence-Based Attribution\nThe term \"intelligence assessment\" usually does not imply absolute certainty nor admissibility in court but rather the degree of certainty and credibility with which a certain factual narrative should be perceived, using the qualifiers of the national intelligence community about high, moderate, or low likelihood/certainty of the narrative as described in the attribution statement.45 The degree of certainty obviously depends on the level of trust in the information collected and the extent to which it is considered reliable and credible. The more reliable and credible, the higher the degree of cer\n43.

Cyber Law Toolkit, supra note 39.\n45. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, supra note 13.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ntainty, and the more that information may whet the policymakers' appetites to officially attribute responsibility to the culprit State if additional political considerations justify such an attribution.\nUp to this point, the United States and the United Kingdom have adhered to this official format of attribution, responding publicly with measures such as diplomatic démarche and sanctions when attributions were based on an intelligence assessment of high certainty and the interest of national security allowed a limited transparency to withstand an appropriate judicial or administrative review. By endorsing this practice, both States have averted compromising sensitive intelligence to justify their official attribution and retorsion, which is a response within the prerogative of any State. Even if the attribution of State responsibility proves to be mistaken, the response undertaken remains lawful, albeit unfriendly, and is often reciprocally retaliated. Nevertheless, covert cyber operations remain a viable response, either alongside or instead of retorsions. However, if exposed, their legality would inevitably be challenged.\nCritics of intelligence assessment as major grounds for attribution argue that it relies on criteria that \"may at best amount to circumstantial evidence,\" far below the evidentiary standards used in courts.[46] This allows States to manipulate cases to fit preconceived narratives and embody political agendas; it may lead to misleading results involving the misinterpretation of information influenced by what later turns out to be a false conception.[47]\nNone of the official American attributions since 2014, nor any of the collective attributions that the United States and the United Kingdom have announced since 2017, have corroborated this criticism. Both States have officially attributed responsibility relying on their intelligence and a high degree of certainty (\"almost certainly\"). Some of these attributions have also referred to open-source investigative reports and technological findings of tech and cyber security companies, mostly American, as discussed below. Others were also followed, months or even years later, by detailed American indictments delivering the message that they rely on sufficient and admissible evidence. However, only a limited number of States have been sufficiently convinced or politically motivated to officially adopt and join these attribution statements. Even these States did not do so because they truly participated in the attribution process itself or obtained access to\n46. GUITTON, supra note 13, at 98–99.\n47. Id.\n287\nInternational Law Studies\n2024\nhighly classified and credible intelligence materials supporting the intelligence assessment. The “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance (“FVEY”)—United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—is exceptional. However, the United States shares its classified intelligence with its partners in this alliance and occasionally extends this practice to additional allied States such as France, Germany, and Japan.\nNevertheless, the investigation team determining the attribution remains exclusively American. The limited number of participating States might also indicate that those States, which the United States and the United Kingdom interchangeably have not allowed to participate in the process or share classified information, are hesitant to blindly trust American or British intelligence assessments. Considering that the United States is the driving force behind these attributions and that its rivals, such as the CRINK States, are consistently on the receiving end underscores the importance of challenging the credibility of the process and its outcomes.\nConcurrently with intelligence-based attribution, the United States has endorsed, on its own, another method to mitigate the demand for transparency. This is attribution by indictment (\"naming and shaming\"). The next section will demonstrate that, despite its relative transparency, attribution by indictment has not proven a benchmark for credibility and trust.\n## C. Attribution by Indictment\nUntil now, the United States stands as the first and only State to “name and shame” by indicting, in absentia, foreign State-sponsored hackers, mostly citizens of the CRINK. They have been accused of breaching the U.S. Code by committing cybercrimes against Americans and U.S. entities. These indictments provide an opportunity to describe their worldwide malicious cyber activity. They include declassified information about unlawful cyber activities, shedding light on relevant State responsibility. This responsibility stems from the fact that, while committing the unlawful activities, the defendants were either State agents (such as soldiers, officers, or other government officials) or third parties under the State’s control, direction, instruction, or empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority.⁴⁸\nHowever, indicting unlawful combatants, such as spies captured during peacetime or armed conflict while conducting their mission in the territory\n⁴⁸. Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 20, arts. 4–5, 8.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nof the accusing State, is unexceptional and reflects customary international law.⁴⁹ Nevertheless, indicting, in absentia, defendants identified as official agents of a foreign State for remotely hacking and damaging, during peacetime, targets located in the territory of the accusing State is both exceptional and unprecedented.⁵⁰ This could be acceptable if the hacks were criminally motivated and could not be attributed to a specific State, according to the Articles on State Responsibility.\nThe U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, admitted that “traditional military and intelligence activity is a separate sphere of conduct that ought not be subject to domestic criminal law,” with the recognized exception noted above of charging intelligence officers operating undercover in the United States.⁵¹ Barr introduced new and unprecedented exceptions such as State-sponsored computer intrusions “for the purpose of intellectual property theft for the use of [the Chinese] private sector, bank robbery, and interfering with our democratic elections” and “deliberate, indiscriminate theft of vast amounts of sensitive personal data of civilians,”⁵² as occurred in the case of hacking Equifax. In Barr’s words, such cases “cannot be countenanced.”⁵³ In fact, such cases have led to the submission of indictments in deviation from the customary principles of international law and the recognized principle of criminal responsibility. One scholar labeled this a “judicialized attribution,” a new tool to convey more concrete and less political attribution focusing on the evidence and lawfulness of the behavior according to domestic law rather than international law.⁵⁴ This is despite the fact that both the superiors and subordinates who followed their orders purportedly committed the attributed crimes remotely from\n49.

While both superiors and subordinates are official agents of rival States and out of reach for American law enforcement authorities, indicting only the subordinates in absentia is legally contested. Unsurprisingly, such a practice has not been adopted by other States.\nFurthermore, invoking this policy of indictments requires proceeding in front of a federal grand jury to investigate and decide whether and on what charges to indict. This process is expected to be unbiased, reinforcing the indictment's credibility. However, the jury operates behind closed doors, hearing the federal prosecutor and live testimonies of relevant witnesses, mostly federal investigators, and American cyber security and technology experts. In fact, the process is controlled and guided by the federal prosecutor of the case rather than a judge. Moreover, the indictments may also rely on evidence from American tech and cybersecurity companies, which, as explored below, closely collaborate with local governmental authorities. The national loyalty of these companies is often taken for granted.55 While this perception may not be entirely accurate, it is sufficient to undermine the trust in the impartiality and credibility of the American attribution process by significant portions of the international community, particularly populations and governments in the Global South.\nMoreover, Article 28(f) of the 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report approved by the UN General Assembly asserts that \"the accusation of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against states should be substantiated.\"56 The question of whether the American and British practice in this regard meets this requirement is still contested. As mentioned above, a growing number of States have publicly endorsed the view that States attributing responsibility do not need to disclose classified evidence. States like the United States and the United Kingdom maintain that their findings are substantiated by the professional work of criminal investigators, tech experts, and intelligence professionals who\n55.

U.N. Doc. A/70/174, supra note 4.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ndo not violate Article 28, which is silent about the ways in which accusations should be substantiated.\nIn contrast, the CRINK States, the exclusive subjects of such attribution processes, often disregard or automatically reject the accusations against them. Russia consistently demands that attributing States substantiate their accusations by revealing evidence, particularly forensic or technical evidence.57 China, which always criticizes the U.S. tendency to function as the \"global sheriff,\" has recently responded by employing the same attribution approach, directing accusations toward the United States for cyber attacks allegedly conducted against Chinese entities.58\nInterestingly, the Obama Administration, striving to avoid escalation and miscalculation, refrained from officially attributing explicit responsibility to States for specific cyber attacks and preferred to do so indirectly by unsealing an indictment against Iranians three years later.59 A shift has been noted since 2018 when indictments started to complement the administration's official attribution statements. However, the policy in this regard remains inconsistent. Not every official attribution is accompanied by indictment, and conversely, not every indictment is accompanied by an official attribution.\n57.

Thus, when indictments accompany official attributions, they are expected to bolster the attributions' \"overall credibility.\"60 The target audiences for the indictments are particularly like-minded and neutral governments that are expected to be aware of the credibility of the American criminal proceedings. Consequently, they are likely to perceive this implicit attribution of responsibility through such indictments as credible enough to draw lessons. Subsequently, they may consider whether and to what extent these lessons should affect their own policy, particularly regarding the \"irresponsible behavior\" of a State and its respective risks in cyberspace.\nThus far, the United States has not succeeded in prompting even a single State, not even its closest ally, the United Kingdom, to follow it in implementing this \"naming and shaming\" strategy. Unsurprisingly, this American strategy has not deterred the CRINK States. As the FBI's Deputy Director put it when announcing another indictment: \"Time and again, Russia has made it clear: They will not abide by accepted norms, and instead, they intend to continue their destructive, destabilizing cyber behavior.\"61 Additionally, U.S. federal indictments, even when accompanied by collective attributions, have not significantly increased the number of States joining the collective attribution.62 This, coupled with the growing number of CRINK-sponsored cyber attacks, raises significant doubts about the extent to which this strategy is indeed effective. The responses to these doubts vary widely. Some scholars opine that this strategy appears to be a failure and \"even might be self-defeating.\"63 In contrast, others argue that it serves more than just deterrence, notably enabling other actions like sanctions to\n60.

On the one hand, it purportedly maintains credible evidence and a reasonable degree of transparency through detailed charges sufficient for imposing ex parte administrative personal sanctions against unreachable foreign defendants. On the other hand, none of these defendants are likely to extradite themselves to challenge the legal and administrative proceedings, including the credibility of the evidence. The U.S. Assistant Attorney General described the indictments as “just a piece of the puzzle,” representing a critical, credible step towards imposing meaningful consequences, adding that it is part of building consensus inside and outside the United States about responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace.⁶⁵\nIn conclusion, the benefit of attribution through indictment may be associated with three possible objectives: using the prestige of the American justice proceedings along with a degree of transparency to reinforce the attribution’s credibility through the lens of other impartial States; deterring States from launching similar attacks and damaging their reputation as law-abiding States; and building a broad international consensus to compel States to adhere to norms of responsible State behavior, such as the prohibition on conducting cyber attacks against critical infrastructure facilities. Nevertheless, the experience of recent years has not indicated any remarkable success in accomplishing all these objectives, at least not enhancing the credibility of the attributions through such indirect measures, nor significantly increasing the number of States joining the collective attributions\n⁶⁴.

However, neither provides transparent evidence that could withstand external and impartial scrutiny, subsequently substantiating the attribution determinations and ensuring their credibility.\nThe next section delves into the significant role played by the private sector, particularly in the United States, illustrating how private sector collaboration with the U.S. Government may enhance the level of transparency in determining and announcing official attributions. However, concurrently, it may raise concerns about the legitimacy and credibility of such attributions.\n## D. The Role of the Private Sector\nThe private sector, through its major tech and cyber security firms, plays a key role in the attribution process, as it possesses significant tech capabilities for detecting and investigating cyber incidents. Western companies, mostly American, such as Meta (Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram), Microsoft (Windows, Azure), Amazon (Amazon Web Services), Alphabet (Google, YouTube), X (previously Twitter), Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Verizon, dominate cyberspace in both software and hardware, encompassing global social media, big data, cloud services, artificial intelligence, computer operating systems, and search engines. Each of these realms is a playground where any vulnerability exposed by third parties could be exploited, posing serious threats to the company's reputation and business success. Thus, these companies invest vast resources to consistently lead in technology, developing cutting-edge capabilities to detect, investigate, and thwart any threat, regardless of its motives through in-house cyber threat intelligence teams. Moreover, global tech platforms, in particular, have achieved worldwide dominance and maintain a formidable presence in cyberspace, a level of control that State cyber powers, including a cyber superpower like the United States, struggle to maintain.⁶⁷ Additional-\n⁶⁶.

Eichensehr, Public-Private Cybersecurity, 95 TEXAS LAW REVIEW 467 (2017) (describing the roles of the U.S. Government and the private sector in the context of contending with international cybersecurity threats, including botnet takedowns, remediating zero-day vulnerabilities, and attributing cyber intrusions to States or Statesponsored cyber attackers); see also Jennifer Maddocks, Outsourcing of Governmental Functions in Contemporary Conflict: Rethinking the Issue of Attribution, 59 VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 47, 68 (2019) (discussing the option of attributing to States responsibility for private companies' activities by virtue of Article 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility).\n⁶⁹ Kris Oosthoek &amp; Christian Doerr, Cyber Threat Intelligence: A Product Without a Process?, 34 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 300, 302 (2020).\n⁷⁰ Id. at 301; see also Nicholas Tsagourias &amp; Michael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges, 31 EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 941 (2020); Sasha Romanosky &amp; Benjamin Boudreaux, Private-Sector Attribution of Cyber Incidents: Benefits and Risks to the U.S. Government, 34 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 463 (2021); Eichensehr, supra note 16, 547–50.\nInternational Law Studies\n2024\nnoted above, the decision whether to name the culprit State and officially attribute responsibility is purely political, and concerned vendor firms tend to comply with this.71 Experience thus far indicates that when tech and cyber security companies detect anomalies and even malicious cyber operations through their routine preventive and researching cyber security activities, rather than as a part of a service ordered by the victim State, they generally avoid involvement in what might be inter-State conflicts. Unless biased (as discussed in the following section), they tend to classify the hostile cyber operation as sophisticated, suggesting potential execution by either an anonymous cyber power State or hackers sponsored by such a State.72 Technical attributions are usually faster, more detailed, and more transparent than official attributions, which are, to a greater extent restricted by confidentiality and related considerations of national security. This course of action characterizes private sector companies and has a double motivation, rooted both in business interests (business-based) and adherence to norms (norms-based). Naturally, the firms that are driven by business motives are interested in branding themselves—domestically and internationally—as the leading and most reliable professional actors in their fields, ahead of any existing or potential competitor. Such branding should go hand in hand with positioning the firms as prioritizing and aligning with values of universal human rights and other major norms included in the List of Non-Binding Norms, which reflect responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. In this context, national and international responsibility to secure human life and well-being in an unregulated and risky cyberspace, at least by sharing relevant information with the public, has become a matter of utmost importance.\nPrivate sector firms that investigate and expose malicious cyber tools and methodologies used in specific cyber attacks publish their findings to\n71. See, e.g., A. L. Johnson, The Shameon Attacks, BROADCOM (Aug. 16, 2012), https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=281521ea-2d18-4bf9-9e88-8b1dc41cfdb6&amp;CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&amp;tab=librarydocuments (identifying the destructive malware, Shameon, as \"W32.Disttrack\" and refraining from explicitly attributing it to Iran at any level of probability. Similarly, the Saudi authorities refrained from making such an attribution); see also Eichensehr, supra note 16, at 547–50.\n72. Oosthoek &amp; Doerr, supra note 69, at 309 (signifying an existing bias in the cyber threat intelligence production of major cyber security firms, like Russian-based Kaspersky, which scarcely reports on Russian cyber operations and yet does report on U.S. cyber operations. Vice versa, a U.S. firm like CrowdStrike reports on Russian cyber activities and avoids similar reports on its own national side.).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nraise awareness about these threats among both governmental and nongovernmental users. More importantly, this helps enhance their cyber security capabilities and their preparedness to detect and thwart such threats. At the same time, such information may raise suspicions that a specific cyber attack is, in fact, an act of State or a State-sponsored operation. Occasionally, a private sector technological investigation may lead to complete attribution, including identification of the culprit State or its official organ.73 This occurs despite the general business orientation to avoid involvement in inter-State conflicts. Such attribution is a proper alternative to the official attribution that the victim State may avoid due to its strategic and national security considerations, as noted above. In such circumstances, the company's explicit technological attribution may influence international public opinion, delegitimizing the suspected State in the eyes of other States. Furthermore, any State could become a victim of similar unacceptable behavior at any time, and each may use such attributions to politically attribute responsibility to the suspected State.\nThe following section addresses the collaboration U.S. national security agencies maintain with relevant American private sector companies, including in the context of the attribution process. Naturally, this partnership is not completely transparent, nor is it exclusive to the United States. It also encompasses attribution determinations, raising doubts about the extent to which these determinations should be perceived as credible and legitimate through the lens of neutral observers.\n## E. Private Sector Collaboration with Governments\nA voluntary contribution by private sector companies to national efforts to defend the country from external threats is common, self-evident, and not limited to wartime. Thus, authorities of States cooperate and maintain close and confidential ties with leading domestic entities in the private sector in every relevant field, including health, transportation, tech-industry, telecommunications, and cybersecurity. Liberal democracies, as opposed to authoritarian regimes, maintain such cooperation within the boundaries of law. The Snowden disclosures of June 2013 about secret National Security Agency (NSA) operations involving American telecom companies rein\n73. Mandiant, for instance, was the first to attribute APT1 to China in a detailed attribution report based on technical findings and other, not necessarily technical, information gathered by the firm. CrowdStrike was the first to attribute responsibility to Russia for the Democratic National Committee hack during the 2016 U.S. elections.\nInternational Law Studies\n2024\nforce the perception that companies in established democracies assist their governments \"even above and beyond their legal obligations to do so.\"74 Conversely, authoritarian regimes are guided primarily by their self-interest in ensuring the regime's security and sustainability and would, therefore, do whatever it takes to secure their regime. As the end justifies the means, not even universal human rights would pose a barrier. As a corollary, the private sector companies, including foreign multinational platform companies operating under such regimes, must comply with their orders and restrictive regulations. Otherwise, the companies might pay excessive prices, which could include restricting, and even terminating, voluntarily or nonvoluntarily, their operations in the countries concerned.75\nDue to the Great Power Competition and the intensifying tension, particularly in cyberspace, the U.S. Administration has preemptively imposed a Federal ban on procuring software and services from certain Chinese and Russian tech and software companies that may secretly serve as long arms for both competitor powers in the sensitive fields of cyberspace and telecommunications. Moreover, the U.S. Administration has also urged its allies and relevant companies to follow suit.76 Recently, the U.S. Bureau of\n74.

Eichensehr, supra notes 67, at 68.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nScholars have already examined different facets of Private Sector-U.S. Government collaboration.⁸³ For the purposes of this article, it is important to focus on whether the collaboration of American multinational tech platforms with the American national security authorities undermines or, on the contrary, bolsters the credibility of the U.S. attribution process.⁸⁴ This is especially significant considering its key role in the collective attributions detailed in the following Part.\nUndoubtedly, such collaboration bolsters capabilities for revealing the truth behind any given cyber incident and establishing a solid attribution claim. However, in the absence of an independent international mechanism of accountability, the American attribution process, including the said collaboration, should withstand the scrutiny of its primary target constituency—the international community or international public opinion. Naturally, national security aspects of this collaboration remain confidential, though not always entirely so. Similarly, transparency may partially manifest itself in three dimensions: unexpected and undesired transparency—by leakers and whistleblowers; forced and balanced transparency—exclusively by virtue of judicial warrants that balance between conflicted interests, usually national security on one side and human rights on the other; and coordinated transparency—at the initiative of federal authorities in concert with the respective tech platforms.\n⁸³.

Have such American corporations ever wittingly and publicly exposed an American clandestine illegitimate cyber operation and dismantled it?87 Furthermore, how plausible is it that American tech platforms such as Meta, Microsoft, or Google would maintain confidential professional ties with States and secretly provide them with services that could be used for defensive and offensive cyber operations while keeping the pertinent American authorities out of the loop and in the dark?\nBrad Smith opines that the global tech and cyber security sector \"need[s] to become a trusted and neutral Digital Switzerland,\"88 and the\n85. Eichensehr, supra note 67, at 668 (\"the companies remain strongly associated with the United States, where they are headquartered, and subject to compulsion wherever they operate.

Conversely, if the companies are not willing to do something for any government, they will also not do it for the U.S.90\nHowever, she finds that despite all their efforts to appear neutral, “the companies have not yet achieved—and quite likely will never succeed in achieving—perfect neutrality. They are still strongly associated with the U.S., where they remain domiciled and maintain their headquarters.”91 Additionally, they cannot ignore that the U.S. Government is their most significant customer, and just as importantly, the U.S. Government possesses the power to adversely affect their business operations through new domestic legislation that subsequently may also impact their global operations.\nNonetheless, scholars have indicated a shift in the way the major U.S. global tech companies treat U.S. Government requests for collaboration.92 This shift stemmed from the urgent need to salvage the reputations of companies in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures, and it refers primarily to governmental requests that collide with constitutional rights like freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Accordingly, the companies have begun implementing a policy of publicly rejecting and litigating against such governmental demands. In this context, companies will not carry out governmental requests that may collide with human rights unless litigation fails and explicit court warrants are issued, as almost occurred in the San Bernardino case.93 Therefore, Ashley Deeks counts private sector tech compa\nblogs.microsoft.com/uploads/2017/03/Transcript-of-Brad-Smiths-Keynote-Address-at-the-RSA-Conference-2017.pdf.\n89.

Therefore, the strong and confidential ties between these companies and the U.S. government are taken for granted by foreign governments, particularly by U.S. rival States.\nIndeed, tech platforms and cybersecurity firms such as Microsoft, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, and Symantec have deviated from the cautious approach of avoiding full attribution and have increased the number of occasions in which they clearly attributed responsibility for a cyber attack to a State from the CRINK group.⁹⁵ It is safe to assume that any explicit private sector attribution of responsibility to a State, even for a State-sponsored cyber attack, would not have been made public before being shared with the FBI, NSA, or any other pertinent American authority.⁹⁶ This would\nno-apple-iphone-fbi/ (The Justice Department obtained a court order directing Apple to write software to bypass the security feature in the iPhone used by a terrorist who was killed after shooting and killing fourteen people and injuring others.

Given the experience to date, should this policy be welcomed or re-evaluated? That is the question discussed below.\n## IV. COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION\nIn 2017, in the wake of two developments—the collapse of the fifth round of the UN–GGE and large-scale cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya—the United States and the United Kingdom extended the policy of official attribution to a new pattern of collective attribution aimed at deterring States from violating norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. As the table below shows, all the reviewed collective attributions, except one, relied on the national attribution processes of the United States and the United Kingdom regarding cyber attacks that targeted them or their allies. Prior to discussing the cumulative experience of the collective attribution concept per se, and to illustrate the complete picture in this context, the first section of this Part reviews three international initiatives that the United States introduced to deter States and advance responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace in conjunction with holding States accountable by relying on the concept of collective attribution.\n## A. Collective Attribution Within International Initiatives\nDespite the legal obstacles and instrumental ambiguity noted above, the List of Non-Binding Norms remains the main international instrument to hold States accountable for wrongdoing that violates the voluntary norms of responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. This accountability is essential for establishing effective deterrence, while the attribution determination is a keystone for invoking accountability in any given incident.\nIn its updated National Cyber Strategy, the Trump Administration announced the launch of the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative to re\n2023), https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/huawei_china_claims/ (reporting on post of China’s Ministry of State Security on WeChat, in which the United States is accused of running cyber attacks and espionage for more than ten years against China, Russia, and forty-five other countries and regions, and of implanting backdoors in equipment and software and using American global technology brands to monitor and steal data).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ninforce efforts to deter States from violating the List of Non-Binding Norms through “official attribution,” “collective attribution,” a “naming and shaming” strategy, and through a “collective response” by jointly imposing sanctions against States accused of violating the List.¹⁰⁹ Ultimately, no State has officially announced that it will join the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, not even the closest ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, although it promptly endorsed the pillars of the U.S. strategy.¹¹⁰ The International Cyber Deterrence Initiative has not evolved into an effective international initiative, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative¹¹¹ or the International Counter Ransomware Initiative discussed below. In fact, the United States never officially launched the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, and senior U.S. officials have rarely referred to it.¹¹²\nThe literature includes only one study that references the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, focusing solely on the collective response rather than the credible collective attribution that is implicitly a prerequisite to any collective response.¹¹³ Within this study, the scholar examined the policy embraced by each State party in the FVEY in building offensive cyber capabilities. The findings reveal that the FVEY States, excluding New Zealand, align with the approach of responding firmly to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Additionally, those States have developed the offensive cyber capabilities needed, among others, to uphold such a policy. The scholar concludes by suggesting that the FVEY and other like-minded allies enhance the credibility of their deterrent collective response\n¹⁰⁹. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12.\n¹¹⁰.

Nevertheless, for a collective response, the attribution must be credible, and this credibility cannot be taken for granted. Admittedly, the findings of this article bolster the conclusion that the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative never materialized as an active initiative for collectively imposing costs on States violating the List of Non-Binding Norms.\nIn September 2019, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands co-sponsored a new international initiative and, together with twenty-five other States, issued a Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace.[114] This statement includes a commitment to hold States accountable, that is, to collectively attribute State responsibility for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms. It also calls on States to transparently impose costs under international law. The Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has only been invoked once since 2019. On February 21, 2020, fifteen out of the twenty-eight Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace partner States teamed up with Georgia and attributed responsibility to Russia for a disruptive cyber campaign conducted by the GRU. They politically denounced Russia and demanded it comply with the List of Non-Binding Norms.[115]\nTwo months later, on April 16, 2020, the Czech Republic's National Cyber and Information Security Agency warned of a real threat of serious cyber attacks against its healthcare sector amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The day after, the U.S. Secretary of State released a statement in which he mentioned the Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace framework and warned against conducting such dangerous cyber attacks or knowingly allowing them: \"Anyone that engages in such an action should expect consequences.\"[116] Eventually, the threat was not real\n114.

Moreover, neither the Czech nor the American authorities were transparent enough to convince observers that this was not a shot in the dark, but rather a successful preventive response to a credible and imminent threat.\nAs indicated above, neither the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative nor the Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has gained political significance. Unsurprisingly, the anticipation that States beyond the closest allies of the United States would align with American or British attribution statements and impose various costs—political, economic, and otherwise—proved unfounded. It appears that the United States has relinquished both initiatives and, together with its partners in the FVEY, has remained focused on the collective attribution endeavor, as detailed in the following section.\nHowever, beyond the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, in October 2021 the United States established an international initiative to counter the threat of ransomware cyber operations, which the Biden Administration has recently defined as a threat to U.S. national security.¹¹⁸ Although this International Counter Ransomware Initiative¹¹⁹ deals exclusively with criminally motivated ransomware cyber operations, it remains relevant in the context of the present discussion of collective attribution by States. This is because its primary goal is to uphold multinational cooperation to counteract ransomware threats and bolster both resiliency and deterrence. To achieve this, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative strengthens cooperation by facilitating the sharing of information and professional expertise among the participating States and private sector companies. More crucially for the focus of this article is its collaborative effort to detect and identify hackers or hacker groups involved in ransomware attacks, whether independently\n¹¹⁷.

In other words, the Initiative establishes and maintains multinational collaboration to detect, identify, and attribute responsibility for malicious cyber attacks.\nSince its establishment in 2021, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative has consistently increased its membership and actively devised strategies to confront the substantial threat.[120] Despite these efforts, the Initiative has not yet urged its members to collectively attribute responsibility to States involved in conducting ransomware cyber attacks, either through their official State organs or third parties. Similarly, the Initiative has not yet led to the attribution of responsibility to States that tolerate recurring cyber attacks initiated from their sovereign territories.\nRussia has already demonstrated that Russian ransomware gangs, such as REvil, may thrive or decline depending on the regime's willingness to cooperate.[121] Ultimately, increasing collaboration among the International Counter Ransomware Initiative States may encompass holding States accountable for ransomware cyber operations, even when initiated and directed from their sovereign territory, violating the due diligence principle. Apart from addressing the legal complexities associated with such accusations, the Initiative's parties may also seek to attribute responsibility and hold States accountable for what they have already defined as prohibited \"irresponsible behaviors.\"\nNonetheless, when upheld by a common multinational investigative team, the resulting attribution is collective and certainly more legitimate and credible.

This criminal hacking group is recognized as the world's most harmful cybercrime group. The outcomes of this operation included the seizure in three countries of LockBit's data exfiltration infrastructure by members of the task force. Two LockBit operatives were arrested in coordination with Europol. The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against two Russian citizens for conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks. The Department of Justice also announced that two defendants responsible for using LockBit to execute ransomware attacks were in custody and would face trial in the United States. The lessons learned from this experience could prove valuable for the United States and the United Kingdom in addressing the pitfalls of the current collective attribution process and response. This could serve as a test case demonstrating how successful cooperation between International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States can be in fighting criminally motivated, as well as politically motivated, cybercrime. Thus, the Initiative, in particular, may serve as an appropriate pilot for exploring optional solutions to better tackle the challenges associated with collective attributions and responses. More importantly, such solutions would enhance State accountability and the effectiveness of attributions in changing State behavior in cyberspace.\n## B. Table of Collective Attributions as of January 1, 2024\nThe number of collective attributions has been steadily increasing at a slow pace since the first on December 19, 2017. Thus far, the number has reached fourteen collective attributions.¹²³ Each may refer to a single cyber attack or a campaign comprising a bulk of cyber activities that may even span over years.

First, this article relies only on open-source intelligence. Second, the\nInternational Law Studies\n2024\nselection of fourteen cases is the result of a meticulous search conducted in relevant FVEY State governmental websites where collective attributions are published, as well as the site of the EU High Representative's Office. In addition, information about cyber attacks was gathered from other sources, and a comparison was conducted against results from other sources.¹²⁵ Finally, the results, as reflected in the table above, do not purport to be exhaustive. Nevertheless, in a cautious estimate, analogous to the wording of the attributions' intelligence assessment, it can be stated that almost all the collective attributions, as defined at the outset of this article, are highly likely to be included in the table, and all the most prominent attributions are almost certainly included.¹²⁶\n## C. Analysis: Remarks and Insights\n### 1. Remarks on the Process in Practice\n#### i. Five Eyes' Key Role\nDespite being an intelligence alliance, the FVEY partners are not obligated to full transparency between their intelligence agencies. However, they do share intelligence at a level of confidentiality not extended to other allies. This alliance is the core of the collective attribution strategy, while the United States and the United Kingdom are its driving forces. They cooperate in investigating wide-scale cyber attacks by exchanging confidential information and mobilizing, separately or in conjunction, to assist victim\n¹²⁵.

One indication reinforcing this assessment is taken from the recent Canadian attribution statement. Press Release, Glob. Affairs Canada, Statement on Russia’s Malicious Cyber Activity Affecting Europe and Ukraine (May 10, 2022), https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2022/05/statement-on-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-affecting-europe-and-ukraine.html (recalling each of the seven previous malicious cyber operations attributed to Russia. All are included in the table.). Another indication can be taken from the Press Release, UK Att’y Gen’s Off., Attorney General to Set Out the UK’s Position on Cybersecurity and International Law (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-to-set-out-the-uks-position-on-cybersecurity-and-international-law (this report enumerated examples of cyber attacks where the United Kingdom “named and shamed” State actors. All are included in the table.).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nStates upon their request, especially when their capability to investigate cyber attacks independently is poor or limited.¹²⁷ Both the United States and the United Kingdom are responsible for all collective attributions listed in the table presented above, except one (Case 10), to be discussed below. The FVEY's attribution announcements are made concurrently and in coordination.¹²⁸ However, they rely on sharing classified information, not on the findings of an independent FVEY multinational investigative team or any other form of international investigative mechanism. Like the decision to officially attribute State responsibility itself, endorsing an official attribution made by another State is a political prerogative for each sovereign State, which may announce it as its own official attribution. Such attribution determinations rely on various cumulative considerations, including the accuracy and credibility of evidence shared with all partners. While Canada has, thus far, actively participated in all collective attributions initiated by the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia refrained in three instances (Cases 6, 7, 13) and New Zealand in four (Cases 6, 7, 11, 13). Neither New Zealand nor Australia publicly justified their decision to refrain in each of these instances.\n## ii. EU and NATO Attributions or Partial Attribution Statements\nThe EU, representing twenty-seven European States, has had a notable practice of declarations in support of collective attributions. Thus far, it participated in eleven out of fourteen collective attributions, while NATO participated in six out of these same eleven attributions. However, the attribution statements on behalf of the EU and NATO could hardly be considered fully attributive. Instead, they may be perceived as a partial attribution of responsibility, making a limited contribution to the collective attribution strategy.\n¹²⁷. See, e.g., Cases 5, 13, supra Section IV(B) (providing examples in which the United Kingdom assisted the Georgian authorities in contending with and investigating the malicious cyber campaign); see Press Release, U.S. Embassy Tirana, Committed Partners in Cyberspace: U.S. Concludes First Defensive Hunt Operation in Albania (Mar. 23, 2023), https://al.usembassy.gov/committed-partners-in-cyberspace-u-s-concludes-first-defensive-hunt-operation-in-albania/.\n¹²⁸. At times, the dates on statements from Australia and New Zealand may not match those of other FVEY partners. However, the announcements are most likely published simultaneously with those of the FVEY partners, and at times the incompatibility of dates may be due to the different time zones.\nInternational Law Studies\n2024\nThe following are some probable causes driving this partial level of EU and NATO participation in collective attributions:\n(a) The EU and NATO do not possess independent cyber investigative capabilities. Both rely heavily on more capable allies, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, EU and NATO member States, like Sweden, the Netherlands, Estonia, Austria, France, and Germany, each of which possess independent investigative capabilities, allegedly provide the EU security authorities with “deficient and incomplete” evidence in order to preserve the confidentiality of their cyber capabilities.¹²⁹ To date, the EU has joined an official attribution initiated by one of its members only once (Case 10), and the attribution is highly questionable. NATO has never joined an attribution that was not initiated by the United States or the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that both States also face challenges in implementing a high degree of transparency with the EU security authorities due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of their intelligence sources. Nevertheless, the direct involvement of the United States and the United Kingdom in investigating cyber attacks appears to be a differentiating factor, possibly explaining why both, along with Canada and New Zealand, refrained from participating in the EU and Germany collective attribution (Case 10), while Australia settled for expressing solidarity.¹³⁰\n(b) The EU and NATO have joined collective attributions through brief declarations or statements issued on behalf of both Councils. The wording of these official declarations or statements must be cautious and measured to achieve unanimity within a truly brief period. Typically, they condemn the cyber attack in question, express concerns about it, and show solidarity with the affected States. The EU and NATO choose to avoid any explicit attribution of responsibility to the CRINK States. At the same time, the United States and the United Kingdom explicitly attribute responsibility primarily to specific official agents or organs of any State within the\n¹²⁹.

The EU and NATO refrain from attributing responsibility even to CRINK's official entities, such as intelligence agencies and national security institutions, which some of the U.S. or UK attribution determinations refer to in detail. In Case 9, for instance, the North Atlantic Council's statement acknowledges official statements made by its members—United States, United Kingdom, and Canada—attributing to China responsibility for compromising the Microsoft Exchange Server. The statement continues expressing solidarity with those who were affected, calling on \"all states, including China,\" to uphold their international commitments and \"act responsibly, including in cyberspace.\"131 Similarly, the EU's declaration refrains from explicitly attributing responsibility to China for malicious cyber activities, as opposed to the FVEY attribution statements.132 Instead, the EU \"strongly denounces\" these malicious cyber activities, urging China to comply with norms of responsible State behavior and prevent the use of its territory for such activities.133 The EU approach further differs from the FVEY by emphasizing adherence to the List of Non-Binding Norms, including due diligence, rather than strictly assigning State responsibility. However, challenges arise when applying due diligence to cyberspace, given uncertainties about its compatibility with the specific circumstances and the contested nature of its application in this\n131.

Thus, rather than assigning strict and explicit State responsibility, the EU declarations lean toward a partial attribution statement. $^{134}$\n(c) Each of the EU member States may publish official attribution statements independently, like any sovereign State. Such statements may be more blatant and explicit than the EU's soft and general statements. An increased frequency of explicit independent statements, especially from cyber power States, aligning around the same conclusion in a specific cyber incident might impact the perceived legitimacy and credibility of the attribution determination in question. Nevertheless, such alignment is infrequent, contingent on the political cost-benefit calculation of each EU member State when deciding whether to act directly with full political responsibility through an official and independent statement.[135]\n# iii. Incoherency and Lack of Standardization\nThe collective FVEY attributions reviewed indicated incoherency, a lack of standardization, and an absence of transparent criteria, primarily in selecting which cyber operations the United States or the United Kingdom would lead the FVEY to collectively attribute. Likewise, there is uncertainty about the criteria guiding the EU and NATO in determining which attributions to publicly support, all while navigating possible political storms.[136] Questions persist regarding the degree of certainty justifying an attribution in the first place and how to measure that degree.[137] Further considerations involve the timing and format of coordinated announcements, whether through verbal statements by senior government officials (such as heads of states, relevant ministers, and senior officials from the U.S. National Security Council and their counterparts in other States), or by written statements of an authorized governmental agency or ministry, or both in concert.\n134.

See Cases 10, 11, supra Section IV(B).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nThe United States has been inconsistent in the way it has chosen to express its official attribution and synchronize it with its partners in the FVEY. At times, it settles for filing or unsealing indictments in absentia (e.g., Cases 4, 7) or for joining advisories (e.g., Case 6). Occasionally, the U.S. action of indicting and/or joining an advisory is in addition to an explicit official political announcement (e.g., Case 9). Conversely, the other \"Four Eyes\" always officially attribute responsibility through official announcements of senior officials, mostly by written statements of the relevant ministers.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of Case 10 as a collective attribution in the table is highly questionable. This marks the inaugural and sole instance where the EU independently initiated, on behalf of its member States, a statement, purported to collectively attribute responsibility.[138] It was primarily in response to Germany's official attribution and ostensibly at its request.[139] Ultimately, the declaration was more of an urgent general warning to Russia against interfering in European national democratic processes rather than a distinct attribution of responsibility for enduring wrongdoings.[140] However, to enable consensus among the twenty-seven EU member States, the statement's wording was softened and generalized, using \"some\" member States, instead of specifying the States, and \"associating\" the wrongdoing with them, instead of clearly \"attributing\" it to Russia.[141] Unsurprisingly, this declaration did not spur additional States to participate in this collective \"attribution,\" except Australia, which expressed its solidarity.[142] By stark contrast, the EU declaration in Case 14, which addresses the same threat of Russian interference in foreign States' democratic pro\n138.

Doubtful Credibility\nThere are only a small number of official attributions and an even smaller number of collective attributions that do not rely primarily on the American attribution process. The credibility and legitimacy deficiencies of the American attribution process, as highlighted in the previous Part—such as ambiguous normativity, limited transparency, and reliance on potentially biased American investigative teams instead of impartial multinational teams—persist unresolved in collective attributions. These issues may deter States from participating in explicit attributions as opposed to partial attributions. The cases reviewed indicate that States' willingness to participate in collective attributions based on the outcome of another State's national attribution process is limited, even if this system belongs to a cyber power State such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, the deterrence and effectiveness of such attributions also remain low.¹⁴⁴\nCase 11 requires a closer look as it raises serious doubts about the credibility of both the American and British attribution processes, and whether their outcomes are credible and persuasive enough to encourage a growing number of States to participate in such collective attributions. In this case, the Ukrainian Government suspected Russia just because it was then the only State interested in destabilizing Ukraine.¹⁴⁵ Just forty-eight hours later, the United States and the United Kingdom provided the fastest attribution determination each of these allies had ever announced. It relied primarily on some technical information \"almost certainly\" linking the GRU to this cyber attack.¹⁴⁶ Anne Neuberger, the White House's Deputy National Secu\n¹⁴³.

While the swift collective attribution may be linked to the looming possibility of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine set to commence in a few days, it does not necessarily justify what might be perceived by any impartial observer as taking shortcuts in the attribution process. This certainly does not enhance trust in the process; on the contrary, it raises concerns.\nThe absence of transparent standardization and criteria is crucial to maintain flexibility in reconciling two conflicting characteristics. On one hand, the List of Non-Binding Norms is non-enforceable due to legal ambiguities and difficulties that are not easily resolved in the contemporary geopolitical situation, as described above. On the other hand, there is the challenge of enhancing State compliance with the List to reduce global risks and instability. However, this flexibility is not necessarily an ad-\n147.

Shaping “Rules of the Road”\nAiming to bolster deterrence, the United States and the United Kingdom initiated the collective attribution process as a response to attacking States in cyberspace.[150] However, in the absence of normative clarity, attribution announcements refer to unacceptable and irresponsible State behavior, rather than specifying international rules or norms allegedly breached by the given cyber attack. Thus, the policy implemented usually involves delegitimization (\"naming and shaming\") and retorsions, lawful measures that can be imposed without the need for detailed legal justification. The objective is to shape \"rules of the road\" by specifying instances of unacceptable cyber activity on case-by-case bases and to develop State practice accordingly. This involves instilling among the entire community of nations the perspectives of collective attributors regarding which cyber operations may constitute irresponsible State behavior.[151] Such activities would be deemed irresponsible State behavior when conducted by official State agents or entities, as well as by hacking groups affiliated with these entities, operating under their instruction, direction, or control.[152] Although the List of Non-Binding Norms does not refer to economic or national security espionage, bilateral agreements and multinational commitments prohibit the theft of intellectual property (IP), trade secrets, and business information to gain competitive commercial advantages.[153] Such multinational commitments may be an additional source for shaping \"rules of the road\" in the commitments' context.\nThe cases reviewed can be categorized into subcategories representing types of irresponsible State behavior. Each subcategory has the potential to form specific prohibitions on certain types of conduct, akin to rules of the road. Below is a classification of the cases reviewed into four subcategories,\n150.

See, e.g., G20 Leaders' Communique, Antalya Summit ¶ 26 (Nov. 2015), https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/23729/g20-antalya-leaders-summit-communique.pdf.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nwith one caveat. This is not a one-size-fits-all classification. Some cases can be classified under more than one subcategory (as exemplified below by Case 3).\n(a) Interfering with State democratic processes, primarily elections (Cases 3, 10, 14).\n(b) Endangerment of critical infrastructure and supply chain (Cases 3, 11, 12).\n(c) Interference in inherently governmental functions $^{154}$ (Cases 1, 2, 5, 7, 13).\n(d) Theft of IP and commercial secrets (economic espionage) $^{155}$ (Cases 4, 6, 8, 9).\nShaping rules of the road, case by case, could be more effective if the collective attributing States use each case as an opportunity to shape the applicable international rules in the given context. However, the United States and the United Kingdom have not yet taken any significant action in this direction. $^{156}$\nIn May 2022, the UK Attorney General addressed collective attribution and the ensuing response to the wrongdoing as important measures in shaping the international order in cyberspace. $^{157}$ She emphasized that\nThe law needs to be clear and well understood if it is to be part of a framework for governing international relations and to rein in irresponsible cyber behaviour.

For additional clarity, she also suggests defining types of disruptive State cyber activities in various vulnerable sectors, such as energy security, essential medical care, economic stability, and democratic processes. Identifying a type of such cyber activity and examining it in its relevant context would determine whether it disrupts or denies another State’s ability to exercise its sovereign power to freely decide and act. If so, it would constitute a clear violation of the non-intervention norm, rendering it an unlawful activity. Since the UK Attorney General proposed this approach, the United States and the United Kingdom have jointly undertaken only two additional collective attributions (Cases 13, 14). However, instead of attributing unlawful cyber activities to Iran and Russia, the UK Foreign Secretary characterized Iranian actions as “reckless” and “unacceptable”¹⁵⁹ and Russian actions as “completely unacceptable.”¹⁶⁰ This aligns with the established practice of the FVEY, as evidenced in the cases reviewed. Nevertheless, adopting and implementing the British Attorney General’s integrated legal and political approach within the collective attribution strategy could potentially confer a more binding aspect to norms, such as the prohibitions on intervention and use of force, sovereignty of States, due diligence, and the boundaries of permitted espionage. This might create incentives for States, mindful of their reputation as responsible and law-abiding entities, to adhere to these norms as interpreted and applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, enforcing them through collective attribution and responses would be more consistent and coherent, thus, more effective in shaping State practice and international law.\n¹⁵⁸. Id.

Sanctions as a Collective Response\nAnother dimension of the legality of the attributed violation lies in the appropriate response. As mentioned earlier, both the FVEY and the EU confine their responses to retorsions, such as travel bans and asset freezing, undertaken against the entities and persons engaged in conducting the malicious cyber attacks in question. The expectation that a collective attribution would prompt retorsions from a high number of participating States, forming an effective collective deterrent response, has not materialized as of yet.¹⁶¹ Nevertheless, such a response has become a common practice of the United States and to a lesser extent, the EU and the FVEY.\nAt the level of the United States, sanctions are imposed with greater frequency against individuals and entities based on findings and charges detailed in joint advisories or unsealed indictments and law enforcement investigations. Despite the considerable number of sanctioned individuals and entities, many are government personnel and entities associated with the CRINK, and a significant number have also been indicted.¹⁶² While the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish but to bring about a positive change in behavior,¹⁶³ this change has not materialized as of yet. At the level of the FVEY partners, the United Kingdom has regulated its own independent cyber related sanctions regime and occasionally imposed sanctions in coordination with the United States.¹⁶⁴ Australia legislated a cyber sanctions law in December 2021. In January 2024, it implemented it for the first time against a Russian cybercriminal found responsible for the Medibank\n¹⁶¹.

Moreover, the EU's process of imposing sanctions in response to cyber attacks is too slow and less effective; it may extend even beyond a year, as the decision must be unanimous and rely on evidence that can withstand judicial scrutiny. Thus far, the EU has sanctioned, under its cyber-related sanctions framework, only eight individuals and four entities affiliated with the CRINK, encompassing both asset freezes and travel bans. These sanctions were instituted in two phases, in July and October of 2020. As of now, no additional sanctions have been imposed through this channel, and there have been no challenges to review any of these sanctions before the European Court of Justice.¹⁶⁶ Therefore, it seems that the EU cyber-sanction regime may have “already run its course,” as anticipated by some critics.¹⁶⁷ Furthermore, a German research team, which analyzed the EU's collective response in Cases 1–4, questioned the effectiveness of such responses, doubting whether they “really have a deterrent effect on aggressors or are ultimately just symbolic politics.”¹⁶⁸\nDespite the above, this article does not purport to reach an unequivocal conclusion, based on sufficient credible information, regarding the effectiveness of the collective attribution and sanctions policy in achieving its primary objectives. These goals include deterring, disrupting, and demonstrating readiness to defend international norms¹⁶⁹ and inducing a change in\n165. Media Release, Austl.

Ultimately, sanctions are not designed to punish but rather to motivate positive changes in State behavior.¹⁷⁰ Given that the main outlaw States in cyberspace—Russia, Iran, and North Korea—are already subject to extensive multinational sanctions regimes for reasons unrelated to “irresponsible” malicious cyber operations,¹⁷¹ the impact of sanctions imposed as a response to malicious cyber activities is difficult to evaluate decisively. Nevertheless, the increasing frequency and scale of politically motivated cyber operations suggest that the deterring effect of collective attributions, along with retorsions, is weak.¹⁷² Due to the lack of authorized information regarding the outcomes of these sanctions and in the face of persistent politically motivated cyber attacks originating from the same culpable States and orchestrated by their governmental entities, it would not be inaccurate to argue that the effectiveness of this policy has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Meanwhile, it still has a symbolic, declarative impact needed to emphasize the red lines that States should not cross.\nIn conclusion, at present, collective attribution is no more than the upshot of the national attribution process, mostly American and British, with the addition of evidence sharing with like-minded States, in a manner that imposes no burden on the U.S. or UK intelligence community. The United States and the United Kingdom are always the driving force, while a CRINK State almost always stands on the receiving end. States and alliances participating in collective attributions, particularly the EU and FVEY, do not determine whether to join the attribution through direct involvement in investigative and attribution processes, but rather are influenced by political affiliations and international commitments within international frameworks, such as the G7, G20, and U.S.-EU or UK-EU dialogues. As a result, the collectiveness as implemented in the attribution process does not bolster the credibility of the American or British attribution determinations. This could notably change if the number of States committed to joining the attributions significantly increases, not due to political pressure or other political considerations, but rather due to an enhanced, joint, impartial, transparent, professional, and multinational process as the International Cyber Ransomware Initiative has recently demonstrated within its limited\n¹⁷⁰.

CONCLUSION\nMore than a decade has passed since Leon Panetta first used the metaphor of the Pearl Harbor attack to depict how serious and risky a cyber attack could be, warning “potential aggressors . . . that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.” $^{174}$ Even graver and more precise warnings have been issued recurringly by U.S. presidents and senior officials in administrations since 2012. $^{175}$ President Biden, who during his first weeks in office had to handle a series of serious ransomware cyber operations originating in Russia that dealt a blow to U.S. public interests, announced: “I made it clear to President Putin . . . that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions—interfering with our elections . . .—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia . . .” $^{176}$ In the same speech, the President emphasized that only nations “working together and in common” can solve “the accelerating global challenges.” He added, “we [the United States] cannot do it alone.” That is easier said than done in the international arena. Despite technological developments that have improved attribution capabilities, the international community has not yet established a binding legal framework for cyberspace. Instead, the United States, along with the United Kingdom, has chosen to build upon a national official attribution system by imposing collective attribution and responses to the wrongdoing, aiming to concurrently achieve two goals: (1) to reinforce State deterrence through public collective attribution and imposing costs; and (2) shaping and internalizing “rules of the road” for responsible State behavior in cyberspace. $^{177}$\n173.

The United States, as the major attributor, assigns responsibility to specific States without allowing transparency regarding the evidence, the criteria of selecting the cases, and maintaining ambiguity about the legal grounds on which their charges rely. Furthermore, since the attribution determination in any given case is not subject to external and objective scrutiny, it is hard to indicate impartiality, legality, coherency, and consistency in the process, which collapses into one measure—attribution, accusation, judging, and punishing by retorsions. This is a far cry from satisfying any \"right\" or \"fair process.\" Thus far, the overwhelming majority of collective attributions have been American-led. The participants are American governmental experts, in cooperation mostly with American tech platforms whose loyalty to American national security interests is not questioned. There is no effort to involve independent, reputable international experts in the process, which is not sufficiently transparent and, on the face of things, may be perceived as one-sided. At most, the American process may constitute an exchange of views and intelligence sharing with counterpart agencies in the FVEY.\nClose and clandestine cooperation—among the FVEY—and sharing information with the EU's relevant institutions, as well as with a few like-minded States, is not enough to replace a proper procedure that would lend credibility and legitimacy to the process and its outcomes. The absence of representative, impartial multinational experts in the process exacerbates the legitimacy gap. This is even more true when the State at the receiving end of the attribution process is always a rival State from the CRINK group. Such dynamics erode the process' legitimacy and may discourage States from embracing its findings and joining the collective attributions, let alone responses. Moreover, it can explain the ineffectiveness of international initiatives, such as the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, and the negligible effectiveness of the collective attributions.

The motive, whether political or criminal, does not matter when ransomware cripples major governmental services, even more so when it prompts States to declare an emergency, as happened in Costa Rica. $^{178}$  If the International Counter Ransomware Initiative proves itself effective, it could be part of a mechanism to tackle politically motivated cyber attacks by expanding its designation.\nThis article presents the considerable cumulative experience gained from destructive and disruptive State or State-sponsored cyber attacks and their accompanying attribution processes. This, coupled with the growing number of States expressing their perspectives in enduring public debates regarding the terms and boundaries for applying major international norms to cyberspace,[179] illustrate the image of a wide-open field that must be fenced in by further development and regulation. In my opinion, there is fertile ground for a justified reevaluation of the collective attribution process and the responses to cyber wrongdoing. This is critical to bolster the credibility, legitimacy, and subsequently the effectiveness of these collective attributions in shaping the rules of road and enhancing State accountability.\n178.

WannaCry (May 2017)¹⁸⁰\nA ransomware cyber operation in which hundreds of thousands of computers were hacked and encrypted in over 150 States, causing serious economic damage and disrupting vital public services like healthcare, transportation, banks, etc.\nOn December 19, 2017, the United States and the United Kingdom led the FVEY members to attribute this cyber attack to North Korea, simultaneously and in coordination, constituting the first collective attribution. Shortly after, more than ten like-minded States joined this attribution.\nIn April 2018, the European Council published a statement of support, which included condemnation while avoiding clear identification of the culprit States. This declaration addressed both WannaCry and NotPetya.¹⁸¹\nIn September 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted a North Korean hacker associated with Lazarus Group, which works for the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau. The charges were related to his involvement in the Sony Hack (2014) and the WannaCry attack.¹⁸² In February 2021, The U.S. Department of Justice indicted three more North Korean military hackers with the same hacking group (Lazarus) in the Sony Hack and WannaCry.¹⁸³\n¹⁸⁰.

NotPetya (June 2017)¹⁸⁴\nThe NotPetya malware targeted Ukraine but spilled over to more than sixty States, including Russia. This malware acted as ransomware, causing enormous economic damage amounting to billions of dollars and serious disruptions in important public services. This cyber operation was politely motivated to damage Ukrainian businesses and sow public anger.\nIn February 2018, the FVEY collectively attributed this cyber attack to the GRU. Shortly after, more than fifteen like-minded States officially supported this attribution.¹⁸⁵ The U.S. Department of Justice indicted GRU officers involved in these cyber activities while the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions.\nIn July 2020, the EU approved sanctions against Unit 74455 of the GRU for the NotPetya cyber attack, the Lazarus group for the WannaCry attack, and against Russians and North Koreans who have been indicted in the United States.¹⁸⁶\n## 3. Series of GRU Cyber Attacks (2015–2018)¹⁸⁷\nOn October 4, 2018, the United States and the United Kingdom attributed to Russia responsibility for a series of politically motivated cyber attacks conducted by the GRU against various targets. These attacks included, among others, the BadRabbit ransomware campaign (October 2017), a ransomware cyber attack aimed at Ukrainian targets that also spilled over to other European countries; the Democratic National Committee hack during the American elections (2016); the cyber attacks (December 2015 and\n¹⁸⁴.

Germany supported this attribution and added the Bundestag hack as another cyber attack attributed to GRU operatives.\nOn October 4, 2018, the Dutch and UK Prime Ministers made a joint statement attributing to the GRU responsibility for attempting to access the secure computer systems of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague. The statement explicitly connected this GRU cyber operation to other reckless cyber operations revealed on the same day.¹⁸⁸\nAlso on this day, the EU published a joint statement by the presidents of the Council of Europe and the European Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The statement was limited to the attack on the OPCW, with a general reference to the British accusations about further unacceptable cyber activities.\nThe United States indicted and sanctioned officers of the GRU for being involved in those cyber attacks.¹⁸⁹ In July 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against four GRU officers who attempted a cyber attack against the OPCW. In October 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against the GRU’s Unit 26165 and two GRU officers who participated in the Bundestag Hack in 2015.¹⁹⁰\n¹⁸⁸.

Operation Cloud Hopper (2006–December 2018)¹⁹¹\nThis was an economic cyber espionage campaign targeting the IP and sensitive commercial data of large-scale service providers operating in the United States, Europe, and Asia. It is highly likely that the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) ran this campaign through a hacker group known as the APT10, which was almost certainly responsible for a campaign of activity against global Managed Service Providers (MSPs) since at least 2016, widely known as Cloud Hopper.\nOn December 20, 2018, the United Kingdom officially attributed responsibility for this campaign to China's MSS. The U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously indicted and imposed personal sanctions on two Chinese hackers allegedly part of APT10 and involved in this cyber campaign.¹⁹² The following day, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada published official attribution statements with similar content. Japan and Germany joined these attribution determinations.¹⁹³\nAfter a four-month delay, the EU published a declaration focusing on APT10 malicious cyber activities, including IP theft, while avoiding explicit attribution to the Chinese Government.¹⁹⁴\n¹⁹¹.

The FVEY and twelve EU member States joined the Georgian official statement of attribution.¹⁹⁶ It seems that at least the United Kingdom, through its National Cyber Security Centre, might have collaborated with the Georgian investigation authorities to determine who should bear State responsibility for these cyber attacks.¹⁹⁷\n6.

The suspected perpetrators, APT29 (also known as the “Dukes” or “Cozy Bear”), were identified “almost certainly” as part of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).199 Based on this alert, the United Kingdom and Canada, through their ministries of foreign affairs, were the sole members of the FVEY to officially attribute responsibility to Russia, while the United States simultaneously published the aforementioned joint advisory warning. Australia and New Zealand did not join this attribution. It should be noted that two days later, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two Chinese hackers working with China’s MSS of targeting IP, including COVID-19 research.200\n## 7. Malicious Cyber Activity—2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games\nOn October 19, 2020, the United Kingdom attributed to Russia (the GRU) the destructive cyber campaign conducted against the 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in South Korea and the cyber reconnaissance that targeted officials and organizations involved in the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo, prior to its postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the United Kingdom officially announced its attribution determination,[201] the U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously unsealed an indictment charging Russians involved in the cyber attacks in 2018.[202] Although the aim was to call out Russia and pressure it to cancel its plans to disrupt the upcoming Olympic Games, the United Kingdom\n199.

The other three State parties of the FVEY joined the collective attribution, whereas the EU statement²⁰⁶ expressed solidarity with the United States concerning the impact of malicious cyber activities, notably the SolarWinds hack, which, “the United States assesses,”²⁰⁷ was conducted by Russia. Similarly, the North Atlantic Council’s statement also expressed solidarity with the United States based on its assessments regarding Russia’s responsibility for the SolarWinds hack and called on Russia to comply with its international obligations.²⁰⁸\n203.

Hafnium Hack (Microsoft Exchange Server) (March 2021) 209\nIn July 2021, the United States, joined by the FVEY and Japan, attributed malicious cyber activity and irresponsible State behavior to China for stealing IP for commercial advantage and espionage through hackers contracted to the MSS (APT 31, APT 40). The EU statement did not assign direct responsibility to China but emphasized that the malicious cyber activities were undertaken from China's territory, urging it to prevent such activities.²¹⁰ The North Atlantic Council's statement \"acknowledges\" the statements made by the FVEY member States and expresses \"solidarity\" with those who were affected, calling on all States, \"including China,\" to uphold their international commitments.²¹¹\n10. Interference in European States' Democratic Processes (September 2021)\nOn September 24, 2021, shortly before the German elections, the EU High Representative denounced Russia for trying to interfere in European democratic processes by accessing computer systems and personal accounts in the EU member States and stealing data. The official statement relied on \"some EU member states\" that have observed malicious cyber activities, \"collectively designated as Ghostwriter and associated these with the Russian state.\"²¹² The statement asserts that such activities contradict the List of Non-Binding Norms, calling to immediately cease them and urging Russia to adhere to the List. It is the first and only case in which the EU independently initiated a statement that purported to express a collective attribution.\n209.

DDoS Attack Against Ukraine (February 15–16, 2022)\nA week prior to the Russian invasion, an unprecedented DDoS attack crashed Ukrainian banks and government websites. Although the head of the Cybersecurity Department of Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it was too early to identify specific perpetrators, Ukraine pointed the finger at Russia as the only country interested in destabilizing Ukraine.[213] Forty-eight hours later, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia collectively blamed Russia for conducting the operation through its GRU. This collective attribution is exceptional primarily for one reason: It is the fastest political decision made to date officially attributing State responsibility.\n# 12. Blocking the KA-SAT Network (February 16, 2022)\nOn May 10, 2022, the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre assessed that Russia's GRU was almost certainly responsible for the cyber attack against ViaSat, a multinational communications provider, one hour prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This cyber attack, which is believed to have targeted the KA-SAT network to disrupt or cut off Ukraine's military communication, spilled over to civilian customers in Ukraine and across Europe, making tens of thousands of terminals inoperable in a manner that was irreversible. Based on these findings and new intelligence, the United Kingdom[214] and the United States,[215] joined by their partners in the FVEY[216] and the EU,[217] collectively attributed responsibility\n213.

Cyber Attacks Targeting Albanian Governmental Websites (July 15, 2022)\nOn September 7, 2022, Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran. The reason for such a serious response was a major cyber-campaign conducted against it nearly two months earlier. This campaign targeted significant Albanian government websites, including websites for providing essential public services and websites of the Albanian Parliament and Prime Minister's office.[218] Consequently, essential websites were shut down, and governmental data, including sensitive emails, were leaked. Although Albania is a NATO member State, it has not applied to activate Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Albania is not a cyber-power State. Therefore, it appealed to the United States, United Kingdom, and other capable States to investigate these cyber attacks and assist in ensuring resiliency. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have attributed State responsibility to Iran, while the EU and NATO have not deviated from their cautious path, avoiding explicit attribution statements.[219]\nIn September 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security and its Minister of Intelligence as engaging in cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies.[220]\n14.

Such malicious Russian activity has been conducted in the United Kingdom and other like-minded States at least since 2015. Simultaneously and in coordination, the relevant ministries in each of the other four partners to the FVEY published statements of support. In addition, and also simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against two Russian operatives allegedly subordinate to the FSB Center 18 for targeting current and former U.S. federal employees from 2016 to 2022, and UK government officials, think tank researchers, and journalists in the United Kingdom.

INTRODUCTION\nTwelve years ago, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was the first to warn of the threat of a cyber \"Pearl Harbor\" or a cyber \"9/11\" terrorist attack, as well as of cyber threats that \"could virtually paralyze the nation.\" Ten years later, Costa Rica was the victim of an unprecedented assault when ransomware cyber attacks virtually paralyzed it to the extent that its president had to officially declare a state of emergency. Albania, a NATO member State, severed diplomatic ties with Iran following Iranian cyber attacks that aimed to cripple Albania's online government services and leak sensitive emails and government data. In an era of global interconnectedness, the risks are borderless, severe global effects are at stake, and even sensitive national security computer control systems can be targeted. Unsurprisingly, these threatening cyber capabilities carry strategic implications for geopolitics, including the \"Great Power Competition.\" This rivalry between powers, coupled with deep ideological disparities (democratic versus authoritarian values), has become a major obstacle in ensuring global safety and stability in and through cyberspace. Rather than reaching a universal consensus on binding comprehensive international regulation, the international community, influenced by the conflicting views of competing powers, has made little headway. Consensus has been limited to agreeing in principle that international law, particularly the UN Charter, is applicable to cyberspace and concluding eleven voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace (the \"List of Non-Binding\n1.

This ambiguity provides major powers with enough leeway to strive for “cyberspace superiority” while ostensibly maintaining their reputation as law-abiding nations. On the other side of the fence, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea (CRINK) have exploited this ambiguity and the technical characteristics of cyberspace for advancing their interests. Under such circumstances, the List of Non-Binding Norms’s effectiveness in changing State behavior and the level of State compliance are low. Moreover, the norms’ effectiveness and State compliance are influenced by the extent to which the norms and the process of application are perceived as legitimate, as well as the degree to which the outcomes align with the expectations derived from these norms and processes.\n.

For a broader discussion on legitimacy, how it is reflected in the weakened normative layer and affects its effectiveness, State compliance, and related processes and outcomes in underregulated cyberspace, see Dan Efrony, *Enhancing Accountability in Cyberspace Through a Three-Tiered International Governance Regime*, 103 INTERNATIONAL LAW STUDIES (forthcoming 2024) (Part II); THOMAS M.

Dunoff &amp; Mark A. Pollack eds., 2013); Timothy Meyer, *How Compliance Understates Effectiveness*, 108 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW UNBOUND 93 (2014).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nAgainst the backdrop of this normative ambiguity and inherent legal uncertainty, the process of attributing State responsibility stands as an essential and exclusive measure to hold specific States accountable for violating the norms of the List. To gauge the extent to which the United States has developed its attribution policy in the past decade, it is worth revisiting Secretary Panetta's 2012 remarks. In response to two consecutive destructive cyber attacks, he hinted at the improving technological capabilities to address the attribution problem by identifying cyber attackers and attributing responsibility. Therefore, “potential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions that may try to harm America.” However, it is important to note that neither the United States nor the direct victim States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, officially attributed responsibility for these cyber attacks to Iran, even though its responsibility has been widely accepted.\nIn fact, my previous published research on State practice in cyberspace between 2012 and 2018, co-authored with Yuval Shany, revealed that explicit official attributions were the exception during that period. Nonetheless, the last two attribution determinations addressed in that study indicated a shift from national official attributions toward collective attributions.\nIndeed, the collective activity of nations in attributing responsibility to States for irresponsible behavior in cyberspace and in responding to such behavior has become a vital component of the deterrence pillar within the U.S. National Cyber Strategy. The United Kingdom, the closest ally to the United States, has endorsed this strategy.\n7. Panetta, supra note 1.

In this article “cyber attacks,” “cyber operations,” and “cyber activities” are used interchangeably, but the article focuses on politically motivated incidents, that is, cyber attacks conducted by States through their official organs and agents or through third parties as proxies.\n9.

Furthermore, it evaluates whether this process has become a crucial component in effectively holding States accountable for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms and in deterring States from such violations. Analyzing these and related issues requires a sound understanding of the official attribution process in practice, focusing on identifying legitimacy and credibility disparities, and researching the collective attributions announced so far. The article is built exclusively upon open-source intelligence.\nThe article continues as follows. Part II describes the official attribution process, differentiating between technological, legal, and political attributions and discussing the reluctance of States to officially attribute re\nes/deterrence-in-the-cyber-age-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary (presenting the United Kingdom’s deterrence strategy, mirroring the U.S. approach).\n\nVol. 103\nsponsibility. Part III explores major aspects of the American attribution process, the most influential one, excluding the internal division of labor among the U.S. national security and law enforcement entities. It includes five sections that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could affect the extent to which the process's outcomes would be perceived as credible and legitimate. The first is the instrumental ambiguity the United States has embraced in the absence of a binding international convention, which has an adverse effect on transparency and source-based legitimacy. The subsequent three sections—intelligence-based attribution, attribution by indictment, and the private sector's role in ensuring cyber security—are important for mitigating the challenge of transparency but are still insufficient to ensure credibility and legitimacy. The fifth section explores collaboration between the private sector, particularly American corporations, including the most powerful tech platforms globally, and U.S. national security entities responsible for the American attribution process. This all-American collaboration may raise serious concerns among non-American constituencies about the credibility and legitimacy of the U.S. attribution process and its outcomes. Part IV delves into the specific collective attributions starting with three international initiatives. Two of these, initially planned to catalyze and empower collective attributions, have already faded, while the third initiative holds potential as part of a solution. Section IV(B) is a table that succinctly presents fourteen cases of collective attribution, spanning from the first collective attribution on December 19, 2017, until January 1, 2024. A detailed overview of these fourteen cases appears as an annex at the end of this article. Section IV(C) analyzes the findings. Part V concludes.\n## II. OFFICIAL ATTRIBUTION\nMuch has been written in the literature about detecting, identifying, and attributing responsibility for cyber attacks to a culprit State by the official authorities of the victim State.

Nevertheless, this task remains easier said than done, particularly considering the challenges associated with legally attributing State responsibility, which I will address in a subsequent article.\n14. Compare Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyberattacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND SECURITY LAW 229 (2012), with Panetta, supra note 1.\n15. The term “technical attribution” is somehow misleading since technical attribution mostly does not result in clear attribution of responsibility to a State. At most, it is an estimated attribution of responsibility to a group of hackers based on the findings of tactics, techniques, and procedures. Reviewing the methods and techniques used in the discourse of technical investigations is beyond the scope of this article. For more information on this topic, see D.D. Clark &amp; S. Landau, Untangling Attribution, in PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY 25, 25–40 (2010); see also sources cited in supra note 13.\n16.

Even if the information includes enough evidence for attribution, the victim State's political leadership must weigh a wide range of strategic considerations and then determine whether to officially attribute responsibility; what level of transparency to implement; whether to retaliate, and if so, how, covertly or overtly; and which type of response would be perceived as lawful or legitimate in the given circumstances?\nA State might avoid an official attribution to preclude risks and actions that do not coincide with its national security interests, such as jeopardizing intelligence sources, disclosing intelligence gaps that the victim State may have pertaining to its rivals' cyber capabilities, exposing the victim State's confidential cyber capabilities, and averting the significant risk of misattribution, which could lead policymakers to wrongly engage in retribution and escalation.\nFurthermore, by refraining from public attribution, the victim State eliminates public pressure for retaliation and may lead the culprit State to believe it has not been detected. This strategy could allow the victim State to covertly monitor the operation and gather valuable intelligence about its rival's cyber capabilities. Additionally, it could facilitate the detection of additional covert operations employing the same cyber techniques while also considering disinformation or deception operations.[17] Moreover, powers that still obscure their political and legal approaches to pending cyber legal questions—such as the boundaries of legitimate \"cyber espionage,\" the clear threshold for constituting a prohibited \"use of force\" and a prohibited intervention, and how \"territorial sovereignty\" should be applied in cyberspace—might hesitate to officially attribute responsibility in specific circumstances. This is because such attribution could reduce the legal ambiguity these States have embraced to preserve their technological edge and maintain strategic leeway.\nTherefore, attribution is primarily a political decision relying on prudent and thorough discretion on whether to officially attribute responsibil-\n17.

For the purposes of the present article, it is worth noting the following: pursuant to the rules of State responsibility, a State harmed by a malicious cyber operation that is willing to officially attribute responsibility to an attacking State and has a legal justification for a lawful response, must meet two cumulative requirements.[20] The first is to indicate a breach of an international rule that binds States under circumstances like those of the cyber incident in question. This might be controversial as long as international cyber law remains in its embryonic stage and the extent and conditions under which customary rules of international law would apply to cyberspace as binding law continue to be open-ended. The second requirement is to identify a perpetrator suspected of breaching the international rule and substantiate their connection—either as an official agent or as a proxy—to a specific State.\nThus far, none of the attributing States have faced demands to legally prove their attribution statement within the framework of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Due to cyberspace's unique characteristics and legal ambiguity, the legal demands for substantiating State responsibility in cyberspace are uncertain, making it more difficult to legally attribute such responsibility.[21] While legally attributing State responsibility for international\n18.

In this context, Delbert Tran defined the \"attribution problem\" as a complete \"red herring.\"22 In circumstances where a sufficient degree of certainty (rather than absolute certainty) is enough to impose responsibility, and computer scientists have developed a range of tools to trace the culprits, the problem can be solved by \"configuring the law.\"23 Clement Guitton finds the attribution of State responsibility \"a lot more complex and nuanced,\" adding that the lack of binding standards of proof provides the States involved with great flexibility to manipulatively achieve their political aims.24\nNevertheless, the following section shows that leading cyber power States are not enthusiastic, to put it mildly, about officially attributing responsibility to other States for violating norms of responsible State behavior. This is despite the fact that official attribution is a political act, ostensibly exempt from meeting legal requirements, such as transparent and admissible evidence. To date, this process has never been applied in court with respect to cyber incidents.\n# A. Reluctance of States to Officially Attribute Responsibility\nDuring recent decades, States have conducted hundreds or thousands of disruptive and destructive cyber attacks either through their official organs and agents or through proxies. Only in a tiny fraction of cases did States officially attribute responsibility to other States based on technical and all-source intelligence. At times, these official attributions also relied on private sector contributions through confidential or nonconfidential reports of relevant companies. At least until the second half of 2017, victim States would refrain from officially attributing responsibility to another State unless they were amid an armed conflict, during which they often blamed\nOF INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION (Cesare P.R.

GUITTON, supra note 13, at 91.\nInternational Law Studies\n\nIn fact, until 2017 the United States was the only State that had officially attributed responsibility to another State for executing a specific cyber attack in peacetime. The United States did so only twice, both in rare circumstances: attribution to North Korea for executing the Sony Pictures hack (December 2014), and attribution to Russia for conducting the Democratic National Committee hack and additional cyber operations meddling in the American election campaign (2016). Another well-known damaging cyber attack, the Ababil operation (distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against New York's financial sector in 2011–2013), was investigated and, three years later, resulted in indicting in absentia foreign operatives who were Iranian government agents. The detailed indictment, on the face of things, could be sufficient for officially attributing responsibility to the Iranian regime. However, the U.S. Administration declined to follow this path, likely due to political and national security considerations. The United States implemented the same approach and refrained from official attributions on additional occasions when the Department of Justice also indicted Chinese, Russian, and North Korean governmental operatives for breaching U.S. law.\nThe United Kingdom also avoided officially attributing State responsibility until October 2017, when it did so for the first time with respect to the WannaCry cyber attack. Interestingly, France continues to embrace a\n25.

Efrony &amp; Shany, supra note 10, at 607, 611–12. Both incidents were investigated and promptly resolved by firms from the private sector concurrently with authorized U.S. agencies. The Sony Pictures hack was the first destructive State cyber attack conducted against targets located on U.S. soil. The Democratic National Committee hack was the first U.S. official attribution to Russia for interfering in the U.S. presidential election despite explicit warnings by the U.S. Administration.\n27.

Consequently, to date, France has never officially, and on its own—as opposed to under the EU's collective attributions detailed below—attributed to another State responsibility for a cyber attack targeted at French national interests. Strangely, France even declined to attribute responsibility for the 2017 Macron Leaks, even when the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging six officers of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) for responsibility for this malicious Russian cyber operation.\nGermany has embraced a similar policy, with two exceptions related solely to Russian intervention in German election campaigns. The first exception occurred in October 2018, when Germany joined a collective attribution led by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, attributing to the GRU responsibility for a series of severe cyber attacks, including the Bundestag hack of 2015.

The attribution determination does not rely on full transparency or even a significant degree of transparency, let alone the ability to withstand any external, independent, and impartial scrutiny. This provides room for questioning the credibility and legitimacy of the official attribution.

EVALUATING ASPECTS OF LEGITIMACY AND CREDIBILITY IN THE ATTRIBUTION PROCESS\nNational security interests dictate confidentiality regarding classified intelligence, including information about sensitive cyber tools, detection capabilities, and military cyber capabilities. However, in the absence of multinational, impartial, legal, and professional scrutiny regarding the accuracy and lawfulness of the official attribution in any given situation, attributing States must be mindful of how various constituencies could perceive their attribution statements. Without accepted clear and binding rules, these statements may not be viewed as lawful. Nevertheless, there is a concerted effort to influence public opinion through enhancing the legitimacy of the attribution process. If successful, this could bolster the effectiveness of its attribution determinations.\nThe following sections address five segments that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could positively or negatively influence how the outcomes of the process are perceived for credibility and\n37.

An Instrumental Ambiguity\nCyberspace's unique technological attributes produce opportunities for cyber power States to surreptitiously generate significant strategic gains through covert cyber operations, thereby minimizing the risk of being held accountable for breaching the law and harming their reputation as law abiding States. On the one hand, States strive to evade legal responsibility by distancing themselves from any factual or legal linkage to the malicious cyber operations in question. On the other hand, national security interests dictate the non-disclosure of classified information for both victim and attacking States. However, such data could help them substantiate arguments to strengthen or dismiss relevant accusations.\nAs mentioned above, States, particularly the leading powers involved in the Great Power Competition, have embraced instrumental ambiguity, including maintaining silence on questions related to the interpretation and application of recognized principles and rules of customary international law in cyberspace. The primary motive behind this policy is to retain a sufficient margin of maneuver to enable the protection and promotion of strategic national interests in the rapidly evolving cybersphere. This policy of ambiguity inherently leads to accountability gaps that the most influential cyber power States, like the United States, are reluctant to resolve. Nevertheless, it is crucial for these States to play a decisive role in shaping international cyber law in a manner and at a time that aligns best with their national security interests. Unsurprisingly, they seek to avoid situations requiring an independent, international, judicial forum, such as the International Court of Justice, to resolve legal ambiguities surrounding State conduct in cyberspace.\nNotwithstanding the growing number of States that have clarified, albeit partially and cautiously, their views about a limited number of legal questions, the policy of ambiguity still prevails. The policy influences policymakers when considering whether to officially attribute responsibility and\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nwhen considering how transparent to be regarding relevant evidence and legal arguments.\nOfficial attribution regarding cyber incidents in itself does not eliminate the need for transparency. This requirement is inherent in the legal obligation to substantiate State responsibility in both non-cyber and cyber incidents. Transparency is essential to legitimize the official attribution by reflecting its “right process” through its process-based and outcome-based legitimacy. In the absence of accessible international judicial or quasi-judicial forums, as well as an impartial international monitoring institution, conflicting States might seek to influence the final “judgment” of the “international court of legitimacy.” This type of influence often involves legitimizing one side while delegitimizing the other. To achieve this, States should enhance transparency regarding their findings and, more importantly, with respect to processes and procedures undertaken. This includes ensuring that they align with Thomas Franck’s concept of the “right process.” The degree to which this transparency is genuine and comprehensive serves to strengthen their arguments in attributing responsibility or denying it, respectively.\nRelying solely on the investigative role of the United States or the United Kingdom, coupled with limited transparency and unwillingness to disclose persuasive evidence, opens the door to plausible deniability. Excluding independent, objective, and multinational experts, as well as representatives from other States, from participating in the attribution process also provides grounds for criticizing the integrity of the process. The absence of these persons may raise concerns about the process being flawed, unfounded, politically biased, and non-transparent, thus, not credible or legit-\n.

Yet simply prioritizing national security interests to the extent of excluding transparency may erode trust in the attribution statement. Nevertheless, powers like the United States and the United Kingdom, which possess advanced cyber capabilities and robust intelligence, do not hesitate to base their attribution claims solely on their intelligence assessment system, thereby preserving confidentiality and national security interests.\n## B. Intelligence-Based Attribution\nThe term \"intelligence assessment\" usually does not imply absolute certainty nor admissibility in court but rather the degree of certainty and credibility with which a certain factual narrative should be perceived, using the qualifiers of the national intelligence community about high, moderate, or low likelihood/certainty of the narrative as described in the attribution statement.45 The degree of certainty obviously depends on the level of trust in the information collected and the extent to which it is considered reliable and credible. The more reliable and credible, the higher the degree of cer\n43.

Cyber Law Toolkit, supra note 39.\n45. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, supra note 13.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ntainty, and the more that information may whet the policymakers' appetites to officially attribute responsibility to the culprit State if additional political considerations justify such an attribution.\nUp to this point, the United States and the United Kingdom have adhered to this official format of attribution, responding publicly with measures such as diplomatic démarche and sanctions when attributions were based on an intelligence assessment of high certainty and the interest of national security allowed a limited transparency to withstand an appropriate judicial or administrative review. By endorsing this practice, both States have averted compromising sensitive intelligence to justify their official attribution and retorsion, which is a response within the prerogative of any State. Even if the attribution of State responsibility proves to be mistaken, the response undertaken remains lawful, albeit unfriendly, and is often reciprocally retaliated. Nevertheless, covert cyber operations remain a viable response, either alongside or instead of retorsions. However, if exposed, their legality would inevitably be challenged.\nCritics of intelligence assessment as major grounds for attribution argue that it relies on criteria that \"may at best amount to circumstantial evidence,\" far below the evidentiary standards used in courts.[46] This allows States to manipulate cases to fit preconceived narratives and embody political agendas; it may lead to misleading results involving the misinterpretation of information influenced by what later turns out to be a false conception.[47]\nNone of the official American attributions since 2014, nor any of the collective attributions that the United States and the United Kingdom have announced since 2017, have corroborated this criticism. Both States have officially attributed responsibility relying on their intelligence and a high degree of certainty (\"almost certainly\"). Some of these attributions have also referred to open-source investigative reports and technological findings of tech and cyber security companies, mostly American, as discussed below. Others were also followed, months or even years later, by detailed American indictments delivering the message that they rely on sufficient and admissible evidence. However, only a limited number of States have been sufficiently convinced or politically motivated to officially adopt and join these attribution statements. Even these States did not do so because they truly participated in the attribution process itself or obtained access to\n46. GUITTON, supra note 13, at 98–99.\n47. Id.\n\nNevertheless, the investigation team determining the attribution remains exclusively American. The limited number of participating States might also indicate that those States, which the United States and the United Kingdom interchangeably have not allowed to participate in the process or share classified information, are hesitant to blindly trust American or British intelligence assessments. Considering that the United States is the driving force behind these attributions and that its rivals, such as the CRINK States, are consistently on the receiving end underscores the importance of challenging the credibility of the process and its outcomes.\nConcurrently with intelligence-based attribution, the United States has endorsed, on its own, another method to mitigate the demand for transparency. This is attribution by indictment (\"naming and shaming\"). The next section will demonstrate that, despite its relative transparency, attribution by indictment has not proven a benchmark for credibility and trust.\n## C. Attribution by Indictment\nUntil now, the United States stands as the first and only State to “name and shame” by indicting, in absentia, foreign State-sponsored hackers, mostly citizens of the CRINK. They have been accused of breaching the U.S. Code by committing cybercrimes against Americans and U.S. entities. These indictments provide an opportunity to describe their worldwide malicious cyber activity. They include declassified information about unlawful cyber activities, shedding light on relevant State responsibility. This responsibility stems from the fact that, while committing the unlawful activities, the defendants were either State agents (such as soldiers, officers, or other government officials) or third parties under the State’s control, direction, instruction, or empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority.\nHowever, indicting unlawful combatants, such as spies captured during peacetime or armed conflict while conducting their mission in the territory\n. Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 20, arts. 4–5, 8.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nof the accusing State, is unexceptional and reflects customary international law. Nevertheless, indicting, in absentia, defendants identified as official agents of a foreign State for remotely hacking and damaging, during peacetime, targets located in the territory of the accusing State is both exceptional and unprecedented. This could be acceptable if the hacks were criminally motivated and could not be attributed to a specific State, according to the Articles on State Responsibility.\nThe U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, admitted that “traditional military and intelligence activity is a separate sphere of conduct that ought not be subject to domestic criminal law,” with the recognized exception noted above of charging intelligence officers operating undercover in the United States. Barr introduced new and unprecedented exceptions such as State-sponsored computer intrusions “for the purpose of intellectual property theft for the use of [the Chinese] private sector, bank robbery, and interfering with our democratic elections” and “deliberate, indiscriminate theft of vast amounts of sensitive personal data of civilians,” as occurred in the case of hacking Equifax. In Barr’s words, such cases “cannot be countenanced.” In fact, such cases have led to the submission of indictments in deviation from the customary principles of international law and the recognized principle of criminal responsibility. One scholar labeled this a “judicialized attribution,” a new tool to convey more concrete and less political attribution focusing on the evidence and lawfulness of the behavior according to domestic law rather than international law. This is despite the fact that both the superiors and subordinates who followed their orders purportedly committed the attributed crimes remotely from\n49.

FRANÇOIS DELERUE, CYBER OPERATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW 183–84 (2020).\nInternational Law Studies\n\nFurthermore, invoking this policy of indictments requires proceeding in front of a federal grand jury to investigate and decide whether and on what charges to indict. This process is expected to be unbiased, reinforcing the indictment's credibility. However, the jury operates behind closed doors, hearing the federal prosecutor and live testimonies of relevant witnesses, mostly federal investigators, and American cyber security and technology experts. In fact, the process is controlled and guided by the federal prosecutor of the case rather than a judge. Moreover, the indictments may also rely on evidence from American tech and cybersecurity companies, which, as explored below, closely collaborate with local governmental authorities. The national loyalty of these companies is often taken for granted.55 While this perception may not be entirely accurate, it is sufficient to undermine the trust in the impartiality and credibility of the American attribution process by significant portions of the international community, particularly populations and governments in the Global South.\nMoreover, Article 28(f) of the 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report approved by the UN General Assembly asserts that \"the accusation of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against states should be substantiated.\"56 The question of whether the American and British practice in this regard meets this requirement is still contested. As mentioned above, a growing number of States have publicly endorsed the view that States attributing responsibility do not need to disclose classified evidence. States like the United States and the United Kingdom maintain that their findings are substantiated by the professional work of criminal investigators, tech experts, and intelligence professionals who\n55.

U.N. Doc. A/70/174, supra note 4.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ndo not violate Article 28, which is silent about the ways in which accusations should be substantiated.\nIn contrast, the CRINK States, the exclusive subjects of such attribution processes, often disregard or automatically reject the accusations against them. Russia consistently demands that attributing States substantiate their accusations by revealing evidence, particularly forensic or technical evidence.57 China, which always criticizes the U.S. tendency to function as the \"global sheriff,\" has recently responded by employing the same attribution approach, directing accusations toward the United States for cyber attacks allegedly conducted against Chinese entities.58\nInterestingly, the Obama Administration, striving to avoid escalation and miscalculation, refrained from officially attributing explicit responsibility to States for specific cyber attacks and preferred to do so indirectly by unsealing an indictment against Iranians three years later.59 A shift has been noted since 2018 when indictments started to complement the administration's official attribution statements. However, the policy in this regard remains inconsistent. Not every official attribution is accompanied by indictment, and conversely, not every indictment is accompanied by an official attribution.\n57.

Unsurprisingly, this American strategy has not deterred the CRINK States. As the FBI's Deputy Director put it when announcing another indictment: \"Time and again, Russia has made it clear: They will not abide by accepted norms, and instead, they intend to continue their destructive, destabilizing cyber behavior.\"61 Additionally, U.S. federal indictments, even when accompanied by collective attributions, have not significantly increased the number of States joining the collective attribution.62 This, coupled with the growing number of CRINK-sponsored cyber attacks, raises significant doubts about the extent to which this strategy is indeed effective. The responses to these doubts vary widely. Some scholars opine that this strategy appears to be a failure and \"even might be self-defeating.\"63 In contrast, others argue that it serves more than just deterrence, notably enabling other actions like sanctions to\n60.

For the purposes of this article, it suffices to note that by unsealing indictments in absentia, the United States strives to have it all. On the one hand, it purportedly maintains credible evidence and a reasonable degree of transparency through detailed charges sufficient for imposing ex parte administrative personal sanctions against unreachable foreign defendants. On the other hand, none of these defendants are likely to extradite themselves to challenge the legal and administrative proceedings, including the credibility of the evidence. The U.S. Assistant Attorney General described the indictments as “just a piece of the puzzle,” representing a critical, credible step towards imposing meaningful consequences, adding that it is part of building consensus inside and outside the United States about responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace.\nIn conclusion, the benefit of attribution through indictment may be associated with three possible objectives: using the prestige of the American justice proceedings along with a degree of transparency to reinforce the attribution’s credibility through the lens of other impartial States; deterring States from launching similar attacks and damaging their reputation as law-abiding States; and building a broad international consensus to compel States to adhere to norms of responsible State behavior, such as the prohibition on conducting cyber attacks against critical infrastructure facilities. Nevertheless, the experience of recent years has not indicated any remarkable success in accomplishing all these objectives, at least not enhancing the credibility of the attributions through such indirect measures, nor significantly increasing the number of States joining the collective attributions\n.

However, neither provides transparent evidence that could withstand external and impartial scrutiny, subsequently substantiating the attribution determinations and ensuring their credibility.\nThe next section delves into the significant role played by the private sector, particularly in the United States, illustrating how private sector collaboration with the U.S. Government may enhance the level of transparency in determining and announcing official attributions. However, concurrently, it may raise concerns about the legitimacy and credibility of such attributions.\n## D. The Role of the Private Sector\nThe private sector, through its major tech and cyber security firms, plays a key role in the attribution process, as it possesses significant tech capabilities for detecting and investigating cyber incidents. Western companies, mostly American, such as Meta (Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram), Microsoft (Windows, Azure), Amazon (Amazon Web Services), Alphabet (Google, YouTube), X (previously Twitter), Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Verizon, dominate cyberspace in both software and hardware, encompassing global social media, big data, cloud services, artificial intelligence, computer operating systems, and search engines. Each of these realms is a playground where any vulnerability exposed by third parties could be exploited, posing serious threats to the company's reputation and business success. Thus, these companies invest vast resources to consistently lead in technology, developing cutting-edge capabilities to detect, investigate, and thwart any threat, regardless of its motives through in-house cyber threat intelligence teams. Moreover, global tech platforms, in particular, have achieved worldwide dominance and maintain a formidable presence in cyberspace, a level of control that State cyber powers, including a cyber superpower like the United States, struggle to maintain.

Typically, such aid would involve collaboration with domestic or global cyber security and tech companies that have become major players in the field of cyber threat intelligence, holding capabilities that may even exceed those of government intelligence agencies. These capabilities are crucial for gathering, processing, and analyzing technological findings to promptly establish situational awareness for the State's decision-makers. Multiple firms have already engaged in such activities and provided their client States, and sometimes the public, with relatively prompt and detailed technical reports. These reports may include clear-cut technical evidence to detect and distinctly identify the perpetrators.

More importantly, this helps enhance their cyber security capabilities and their preparedness to detect and thwart such threats. At the same time, such information may raise suspicions that a specific cyber attack is, in fact, an act of State or a State-sponsored operation. Occasionally, a private sector technological investigation may lead to complete attribution, including identification of the culprit State or its official organ.73 This occurs despite the general business orientation to avoid involvement in inter-State conflicts. Such attribution is a proper alternative to the official attribution that the victim State may avoid due to its strategic and national security considerations, as noted above. In such circumstances, the company's explicit technological attribution may influence international public opinion, delegitimizing the suspected State in the eyes of other States. Furthermore, any State could become a victim of similar unacceptable behavior at any time, and each may use such attributions to politically attribute responsibility to the suspected State.\nThe following section addresses the collaboration U.S. national security agencies maintain with relevant American private sector companies, including in the context of the attribution process. Naturally, this partnership is not completely transparent, nor is it exclusive to the United States. It also encompasses attribution determinations, raising doubts about the extent to which these determinations should be perceived as credible and legitimate through the lens of neutral observers.\n## E. Private Sector Collaboration with Governments\nA voluntary contribution by private sector companies to national efforts to defend the country from external threats is common, self-evident, and not limited to wartime. Thus, authorities of States cooperate and maintain close and confidential ties with leading domestic entities in the private sector in every relevant field, including health, transportation, tech-industry, telecommunications, and cybersecurity. Liberal democracies, as opposed to authoritarian regimes, maintain such cooperation within the boundaries of law.

Mandiant, for instance, was the first to attribute APT1 to China in a detailed attribution report based on technical findings and other, not necessarily technical, information gathered by the firm.

For the purposes of this article, it is important to focus on whether the collaboration of American multinational tech platforms with the American national security authorities undermines or, on the contrary, bolsters the credibility of the U.S. attribution process. This is especially significant considering its key role in the collective attributions detailed in the following Part.\nUndoubtedly, such collaboration bolsters capabilities for revealing the truth behind any given cyber incident and establishing a solid attribution claim. However, in the absence of an independent international mechanism of accountability, the American attribution process, including the said collaboration, should withstand the scrutiny of its primary target constituency—the international community or international public opinion. Naturally, national security aspects of this collaboration remain confidential, though not always entirely so. Similarly, transparency may partially manifest itself in three dimensions: unexpected and undesired transparency—by leakers and whistleblowers; forced and balanced transparency—exclusively by virtue of judicial warrants that balance between conflicted interests, usually national security on one side and human rights on the other; and coordinated transparency—at the initiative of federal authorities in concert with the respective tech platforms.\n.

Conversely, if the companies are not willing to do something for any government, they will also not do it for the U.S.90\nHowever, she finds that despite all their efforts to appear neutral, “the companies have not yet achieved—and quite likely will never succeed in achieving—perfect neutrality. They are still strongly associated with the U.S., where they remain domiciled and maintain their headquarters.”91 Additionally, they cannot ignore that the U.S. Government is their most significant customer, and just as importantly, the U.S. Government possesses the power to adversely affect their business operations through new domestic legislation that subsequently may also impact their global operations.\nNonetheless, scholars have indicated a shift in the way the major U.S. global tech companies treat U.S. Government requests for collaboration.92 This shift stemmed from the urgent need to salvage the reputations of companies in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures, and it refers primarily to governmental requests that collide with constitutional rights like freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Accordingly, the companies have begun implementing a policy of publicly rejecting and litigating against such governmental demands. In this context, companies will not carry out governmental requests that may collide with human rights unless litigation fails and explicit court warrants are issued, as almost occurred in the San Bernardino case.93 Therefore, Ashley Deeks counts private sector tech compa\nblogs.microsoft.com/uploads/2017/03/Transcript-of-Brad-Smiths-Keynote-Address-at-the-RSA-Conference-2017.pdf.\n89.

Given the experience to date, should this policy be welcomed or re-evaluated? That is the question discussed below.\n## IV. COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION\nIn 2017, in the wake of two developments—the collapse of the fifth round of the UN–GGE and large-scale cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya—the United States and the United Kingdom extended the policy of official attribution to a new pattern of collective attribution aimed at deterring States from violating norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. As the table below shows, all the reviewed collective attributions, except one, relied on the national attribution processes of the United States and the United Kingdom regarding cyber attacks that targeted them or their allies. Prior to discussing the cumulative experience of the collective attribution concept per se, and to illustrate the complete picture in this context, the first section of this Part reviews three international initiatives that the United States introduced to deter States and advance responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace in conjunction with holding States accountable by relying on the concept of collective attribution.\n## A. Collective Attribution Within International Initiatives\nDespite the legal obstacles and instrumental ambiguity noted above, the List of Non-Binding Norms remains the main international instrument to hold States accountable for wrongdoing that violates the voluntary norms of responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. This accountability is essential for establishing effective deterrence, while the attribution determination is a keystone for invoking accountability in any given incident.\nIn its updated National Cyber Strategy, the Trump Administration announced the launch of the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative to re\n2023), https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/huawei_china_claims/ (reporting on post of China’s Ministry of State Security on WeChat, in which the United States is accused of running cyber attacks and espionage for more than ten years against China, Russia, and forty-five other countries and regions, and of implanting backdoors in equipment and software and using American global technology brands to monitor and steal data).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ninforce efforts to deter States from violating the List of Non-Binding Norms through “official attribution,” “collective attribution,” a “naming and shaming” strategy, and through a “collective response” by jointly imposing sanctions against States accused of violating the List. Ultimately, no State has officially announced that it will join the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, not even the closest ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, although it promptly endorsed the pillars of the U.S. strategy. The International Cyber Deterrence Initiative has not evolved into an effective international initiative, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative or the International Counter Ransomware Initiative discussed below. In fact, the United States never officially launched the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, and senior U.S. officials have rarely referred to it.\nThe literature includes only one study that references the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, focusing solely on the collective response rather than the credible collective attribution that is implicitly a prerequisite to any collective response. Within this study, the scholar examined the policy embraced by each State party in the FVEY in building offensive cyber capabilities. The findings reveal that the FVEY States, excluding New Zealand, align with the approach of responding firmly to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Additionally, those States have developed the offensive cyber capabilities needed, among others, to uphold such a policy. The scholar concludes by suggesting that the FVEY and other like-minded allies enhance the credibility of their deterrent collective response\n. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12.\n.

It also calls on States to transparently impose costs under international law. The Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has only been invoked once since 2019. On February 21, 2020, fifteen out of the twenty-eight Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace partner States teamed up with Georgia and attributed responsibility to Russia for a disruptive cyber campaign conducted by the GRU. They politically denounced Russia and demanded it comply with the List of Non-Binding Norms.[115]\nTwo months later, on April 16, 2020, the Czech Republic's National Cyber and Information Security Agency warned of a real threat of serious cyber attacks against its healthcare sector amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The day after, the U.S. Secretary of State released a statement in which he mentioned the Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace framework and warned against conducting such dangerous cyber attacks or knowingly allowing them: \"Anyone that engages in such an action should expect consequences.\"[116] Eventually, the threat was not real\n114.

However, since the warning statements declined to identify the State allegedly behind the malicious plan, this cannot be labeled as a collective attribution. Moreover, neither the Czech nor the American authorities were transparent enough to convince observers that this was not a shot in the dark, but rather a successful preventive response to a credible and imminent threat.\nAs indicated above, neither the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative nor the Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has gained political significance. Unsurprisingly, the anticipation that States beyond the closest allies of the United States would align with American or British attribution statements and impose various costs—political, economic, and otherwise—proved unfounded. It appears that the United States has relinquished both initiatives and, together with its partners in the FVEY, has remained focused on the collective attribution endeavor, as detailed in the following section.\nHowever, beyond the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, in October 2021 the United States established an international initiative to counter the threat of ransomware cyber operations, which the Biden Administration has recently defined as a threat to U.S. national security. Although this International Counter Ransomware Initiative deals exclusively with criminally motivated ransomware cyber operations, it remains relevant in the context of the present discussion of collective attribution by States. This is because its primary goal is to uphold multinational cooperation to counteract ransomware threats and bolster both resiliency and deterrence. To achieve this, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative strengthens cooperation by facilitating the sharing of information and professional expertise among the participating States and private sector companies. More crucially for the focus of this article is its collaborative effort to detect and identify hackers or hacker groups involved in ransomware attacks, whether independently\n.

Similarly, the Initiative has not yet led to the attribution of responsibility to States that tolerate recurring cyber attacks initiated from their sovereign territories.\nRussia has already demonstrated that Russian ransomware gangs, such as REvil, may thrive or decline depending on the regime's willingness to cooperate.[121] Ultimately, increasing collaboration among the International Counter Ransomware Initiative States may encompass holding States accountable for ransomware cyber operations, even when initiated and directed from their sovereign territory, violating the due diligence principle. Apart from addressing the legal complexities associated with such accusations, the Initiative's parties may also seek to attribute responsibility and hold States accountable for what they have already defined as prohibited \"irresponsible behaviors.\"\nNonetheless, when upheld by a common multinational investigative team, the resulting attribution is collective and certainly more legitimate and credible.

An international law enforcement task force led by the UK's National Crime Agency and the FBI and consisting of eleven International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States (United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Netherlands, Finland, and Germany) successfully executed an international disruption campaign, taking control of the website and services (ransomware-as-a-service) of LockBit. This criminal hacking group is recognized as the world's most harmful cybercrime group. The outcomes of this operation included the seizure in three countries of LockBit's data exfiltration infrastructure by members of the task force. Two LockBit operatives were arrested in coordination with Europol. The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against two Russian citizens for conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks. The Department of Justice also announced that two defendants responsible for using LockBit to execute ransomware attacks were in custody and would face trial in the United States. The lessons learned from this experience could prove valuable for the United States and the United Kingdom in addressing the pitfalls of the current collective attribution process and response. This could serve as a test case demonstrating how successful cooperation between International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States can be in fighting criminally motivated, as well as politically motivated, cybercrime. Thus, the Initiative, in particular, may serve as an appropriate pilot for exploring optional solutions to better tackle the challenges associated with collective attributions and responses. More importantly, such solutions would enhance State accountability and the effectiveness of attributions in changing State behavior in cyberspace.\n## B. Table of Collective Attributions as of January 1, 2024\nThe number of collective attributions has been steadily increasing at a slow pace since the first on December 19, 2017. Thus far, the number has reached fourteen collective attributions. Each may refer to a single cyber attack or a campaign comprising a bulk of cyber activities that may even span over years.

Five Eyes' Key Role\nDespite being an intelligence alliance, the FVEY partners are not obligated to full transparency between their intelligence agencies. However, they do share intelligence at a level of confidentiality not extended to other allies. This alliance is the core of the collective attribution strategy, while the United States and the United Kingdom are its driving forces. They cooperate in investigating wide-scale cyber attacks by exchanging confidential information and mobilizing, separately or in conjunction, to assist victim\n.

One indication reinforcing this assessment is taken from the recent Canadian attribution statement. Press Release, Glob. Affairs Canada, Statement on Russia’s Malicious Cyber Activity Affecting Europe and Ukraine (May 10, 2022), https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2022/05/statement-on-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-affecting-europe-and-ukraine.html (recalling each of the seven previous malicious cyber operations attributed to Russia. All are included in the table.). Another indication can be taken from the Press Release, UK Att’y Gen’s Off., Attorney General to Set Out the UK’s Position on Cybersecurity and International Law (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-to-set-out-the-uks-position-on-cybersecurity-and-international-law (this report enumerated examples of cyber attacks where the United Kingdom “named and shamed” State actors. All are included in the table.).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nStates upon their request, especially when their capability to investigate cyber attacks independently is poor or limited. Both the United States and the United Kingdom are responsible for all collective attributions listed in the table presented above, except one (Case 10), to be discussed below. The FVEY's attribution announcements are made concurrently and in coordination. However, they rely on sharing classified information, not on the findings of an independent FVEY multinational investigative team or any other form of international investigative mechanism. Like the decision to officially attribute State responsibility itself, endorsing an official attribution made by another State is a political prerogative for each sovereign State, which may announce it as its own official attribution. Such attribution determinations rely on various cumulative considerations, including the accuracy and credibility of evidence shared with all partners. While Canada has, thus far, actively participated in all collective attributions initiated by the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia refrained in three instances (Cases 6, 7, 13) and New Zealand in four (Cases 6, 7, 11, 13). Neither New Zealand nor Australia publicly justified their decision to refrain in each of these instances.\n## ii. EU and NATO Attributions or Partial Attribution Statements\nThe EU, representing twenty-seven European States, has had a notable practice of declarations in support of collective attributions. Thus far, it participated in eleven out of fourteen collective attributions, while NATO participated in six out of these same eleven attributions. However, the attribution statements on behalf of the EU and NATO could hardly be considered fully attributive. Instead, they may be perceived as a partial attribution of responsibility, making a limited contribution to the collective attribution strategy.\n. See, e.g., Cases 5, 13, supra Section IV(B) (providing examples in which the United Kingdom assisted the Georgian authorities in contending with and investigating the malicious cyber campaign); see Press Release, U.S. Embassy Tirana, Committed Partners in Cyberspace: U.S. Concludes First Defensive Hunt Operation in Albania (Mar. 23, 2023), https://al.usembassy.gov/committed-partners-in-cyberspace-u-s-concludes-first-defensive-hunt-operation-in-albania/.\n. At times, the dates on statements from Australia and New Zealand may not match those of other FVEY partners. However, the announcements are most likely published simultaneously with those of the FVEY partners, and at times the incompatibility of dates may be due to the different time zones.\nInternational Law Studies\n\n(a) The EU and NATO do not possess independent cyber investigative capabilities. Both rely heavily on more capable allies, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, EU and NATO member States, like Sweden, the Netherlands, Estonia, Austria, France, and Germany, each of which possess independent investigative capabilities, allegedly provide the EU security authorities with “deficient and incomplete” evidence in order to preserve the confidentiality of their cyber capabilities. To date, the EU has joined an official attribution initiated by one of its members only once (Case 10), and the attribution is highly questionable. NATO has never joined an attribution that was not initiated by the United States or the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that both States also face challenges in implementing a high degree of transparency with the EU security authorities due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of their intelligence sources. Nevertheless, the direct involvement of the United States and the United Kingdom in investigating cyber attacks appears to be a differentiating factor, possibly explaining why both, along with Canada and New Zealand, refrained from participating in the EU and Germany collective attribution (Case 10), while Australia settled for expressing solidarity.\n(b) The EU and NATO have joined collective attributions through brief declarations or statements issued on behalf of both Councils. The wording of these official declarations or statements must be cautious and measured to achieve unanimity within a truly brief period. Typically, they condemn the cyber attack in question, express concerns about it, and show solidarity with the affected States. The EU and NATO choose to avoid any explicit attribution of responsibility to the CRINK States. At the same time, the United States and the United Kingdom explicitly attribute responsibility primarily to specific official agents or organs of any State within the\n.

The EU and NATO refrain from attributing responsibility even to CRINK's official entities, such as intelligence agencies and national security institutions, which some of the U.S. or UK attribution determinations refer to in detail. In Case 9, for instance, the North Atlantic Council's statement acknowledges official statements made by its members—United States, United Kingdom, and Canada—attributing to China responsibility for compromising the Microsoft Exchange Server. The statement continues expressing solidarity with those who were affected, calling on \"all states, including China,\" to uphold their international commitments and \"act responsibly, including in cyberspace.\"131 Similarly, the EU's declaration refrains from explicitly attributing responsibility to China for malicious cyber activities, as opposed to the FVEY attribution statements.132 Instead, the EU \"strongly denounces\" these malicious cyber activities, urging China to comply with norms of responsible State behavior and prevent the use of its territory for such activities.133 The EU approach further differs from the FVEY by emphasizing adherence to the List of Non-Binding Norms, including due diligence, rather than strictly assigning State responsibility. However, challenges arise when applying due diligence to cyberspace, given uncertainties about its compatibility with the specific circumstances and the contested nature of its application in this\n131.

Such statements may be more blatant and explicit than the EU's soft and general statements. An increased frequency of explicit independent statements, especially from cyber power States, aligning around the same conclusion in a specific cyber incident might impact the perceived legitimacy and credibility of the attribution determination in question. Nevertheless, such alignment is infrequent, contingent on the political cost-benefit calculation of each EU member State when deciding whether to act directly with full political responsibility through an official and independent statement.[135]\n# iii. Incoherency and Lack of Standardization\nThe collective FVEY attributions reviewed indicated incoherency, a lack of standardization, and an absence of transparent criteria, primarily in selecting which cyber operations the United States or the United Kingdom would lead the FVEY to collectively attribute. Likewise, there is uncertainty about the criteria guiding the EU and NATO in determining which attributions to publicly support, all while navigating possible political storms.[136] Questions persist regarding the degree of certainty justifying an attribution in the first place and how to measure that degree.[137] Further considerations involve the timing and format of coordinated announcements, whether through verbal statements by senior government officials (such as heads of states, relevant ministers, and senior officials from the U.S. National Security Council and their counterparts in other States), or by written statements of an authorized governmental agency or ministry, or both in concert.\n134.

Working Paper 11/2021), https://media.realinstitutoelcano.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wp11-2021-soesanto-the-19th-july-divided-or-united-in-cyberspace-from-eu-nato-five-eyes-japan.pdf (describing the EU statements, including existing discrepancies in relation to the FVEY attribution statements).\n135.

See Cases 10, 11, supra Section IV(B).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nThe United States has been inconsistent in the way it has chosen to express its official attribution and synchronize it with its partners in the FVEY. At times, it settles for filing or unsealing indictments in absentia (e.g., Cases 4, 7) or for joining advisories (e.g., Case 6). Occasionally, the U.S. action of indicting and/or joining an advisory is in addition to an explicit official political announcement (e.g., Case 9). Conversely, the other \"Four Eyes\" always officially attribute responsibility through official announcements of senior officials, mostly by written statements of the relevant ministers.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of Case 10 as a collective attribution in the table is highly questionable. This marks the inaugural and sole instance where the EU independently initiated, on behalf of its member States, a statement, purported to collectively attribute responsibility.[138] It was primarily in response to Germany's official attribution and ostensibly at its request.[139] Ultimately, the declaration was more of an urgent general warning to Russia against interfering in European national democratic processes rather than a distinct attribution of responsibility for enduring wrongdoings.[140] However, to enable consensus among the twenty-seven EU member States, the statement's wording was softened and generalized, using \"some\" member States, instead of specifying the States, and \"associating\" the wrongdoing with them, instead of clearly \"attributing\" it to Russia.[141] Unsurprisingly, this declaration did not spur additional States to participate in this collective \"attribution,\" except Australia, which expressed its solidarity.[142] By stark contrast, the EU declaration in Case 14, which addresses the same threat of Russian interference in foreign States' democratic pro\n138.

Austl. Dept. of Foreign Affairs and Trade, supra note 130.\nInternational Law Studies\n\n## 2. Doubtful Credibility\nThere are only a small number of official attributions and an even smaller number of collective attributions that do not rely primarily on the American attribution process. The credibility and legitimacy deficiencies of the American attribution process, as highlighted in the previous Part—such as ambiguous normativity, limited transparency, and reliance on potentially biased American investigative teams instead of impartial multinational teams—persist unresolved in collective attributions. These issues may deter States from participating in explicit attributions as opposed to partial attributions. The cases reviewed indicate that States' willingness to participate in collective attributions based on the outcome of another State's national attribution process is limited, even if this system belongs to a cyber power State such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, the deterrence and effectiveness of such attributions also remain low.\nCase 11 requires a closer look as it raises serious doubts about the credibility of both the American and British attribution processes, and whether their outcomes are credible and persuasive enough to encourage a growing number of States to participate in such collective attributions. In this case, the Ukrainian Government suspected Russia just because it was then the only State interested in destabilizing Ukraine. Just forty-eight hours later, the United States and the United Kingdom provided the fastest attribution determination each of these allies had ever announced. It relied primarily on some technical information \"almost certainly\" linking the GRU to this cyber attack. Anne Neuberger, the White House's Deputy National Secu\n. Soesanto, supra note 141.\n.

Despite the United States sharing information with its allies for this swift attribution, only the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia joined this attribution while New Zealand and, more significantly, the EU, opted out. While the swift collective attribution may be linked to the looming possibility of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine set to commence in a few days, it does not necessarily justify what might be perceived by any impartial observer as taking shortcuts in the attribution process. This certainly does not enhance trust in the process; on the contrary, it raises concerns.\nThe absence of transparent standardization and criteria is crucial to maintain flexibility in reconciling two conflicting characteristics. On one hand, the List of Non-Binding Norms is non-enforceable due to legal ambiguities and difficulties that are not easily resolved in the contemporary geopolitical situation, as described above. On the other hand, there is the challenge of enhancing State compliance with the List to reduce global risks and instability. However, this flexibility is not necessarily an ad-\n147.

None of the United Kingdom’s partners in the FVEY joined the United Kingdom’s official attribution, nor did the victim States, South Korea and Japan.).\nInternational Law Studies\n\n# 3. Shaping “Rules of the Road”\nAiming to bolster deterrence, the United States and the United Kingdom initiated the collective attribution process as a response to attacking States in cyberspace.[150] However, in the absence of normative clarity, attribution announcements refer to unacceptable and irresponsible State behavior, rather than specifying international rules or norms allegedly breached by the given cyber attack. Thus, the policy implemented usually involves delegitimization (\"naming and shaming\") and retorsions, lawful measures that can be imposed without the need for detailed legal justification. The objective is to shape \"rules of the road\" by specifying instances of unacceptable cyber activity on case-by-case bases and to develop State practice accordingly. This involves instilling among the entire community of nations the perspectives of collective attributors regarding which cyber operations may constitute irresponsible State behavior.[151] Such activities would be deemed irresponsible State behavior when conducted by official State agents or entities, as well as by hacking groups affiliated with these entities, operating under their instruction, direction, or control.[152] Although the List of Non-Binding Norms does not refer to economic or national security espionage, bilateral agreements and multinational commitments prohibit the theft of intellectual property (IP), trade secrets, and business information to gain competitive commercial advantages.[153] Such multinational commitments may be an additional source for shaping \"rules of the road\" in the commitments' context.\nThe cases reviewed can be categorized into subcategories representing types of irresponsible State behavior. Each subcategory has the potential to form specific prohibitions on certain types of conduct, akin to rules of the road. Below is a classification of the cases reviewed into four subcategories,\n150.

However, the United States and the United Kingdom have not yet taken any significant action in this direction. $^{156}$\nIn May 2022, the UK Attorney General addressed collective attribution and the ensuing response to the wrongdoing as important measures in shaping the international order in cyberspace. $^{157}$ She emphasized that\nThe law needs to be clear and well understood if it is to be part of a framework for governing international relations and to rein in irresponsible cyber behaviour.

Suella Braverman, UK Att'y Gen., International Law in Future Frontiers, Speech at Chatham House (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/international-law-in-future-frontiers.\n\nIn articulating this perspective using the norm of non-intervention, she recommends applying it to any State’s cyber activity that undermines another State’s ability to exercise control over matters that it is entitled to decide autonomously through the principle of State sovereignty. For additional clarity, she also suggests defining types of disruptive State cyber activities in various vulnerable sectors, such as energy security, essential medical care, economic stability, and democratic processes. Identifying a type of such cyber activity and examining it in its relevant context would determine whether it disrupts or denies another State’s ability to exercise its sovereign power to freely decide and act. If so, it would constitute a clear violation of the non-intervention norm, rendering it an unlawful activity. Since the UK Attorney General proposed this approach, the United States and the United Kingdom have jointly undertaken only two additional collective attributions (Cases 13, 14). However, instead of attributing unlawful cyber activities to Iran and Russia, the UK Foreign Secretary characterized Iranian actions as “reckless” and “unacceptable” and Russian actions as “completely unacceptable.” This aligns with the established practice of the FVEY, as evidenced in the cases reviewed. Nevertheless, adopting and implementing the British Attorney General’s integrated legal and political approach within the collective attribution strategy could potentially confer a more binding aspect to norms, such as the prohibitions on intervention and use of force, sovereignty of States, due diligence, and the boundaries of permitted espionage. This might create incentives for States, mindful of their reputation as responsible and law-abiding entities, to adhere to these norms as interpreted and applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, enforcing them through collective attribution and responses would be more consistent and coherent, thus, more effective in shaping State practice and international law.\n. Id.

Sanctions as a Collective Response\nAnother dimension of the legality of the attributed violation lies in the appropriate response. As mentioned earlier, both the FVEY and the EU confine their responses to retorsions, such as travel bans and asset freezing, undertaken against the entities and persons engaged in conducting the malicious cyber attacks in question. The expectation that a collective attribution would prompt retorsions from a high number of participating States, forming an effective collective deterrent response, has not materialized as of yet. Nevertheless, such a response has become a common practice of the United States and to a lesser extent, the EU and the FVEY.\nAt the level of the United States, sanctions are imposed with greater frequency against individuals and entities based on findings and charges detailed in joint advisories or unsealed indictments and law enforcement investigations. Despite the considerable number of sanctioned individuals and entities, many are government personnel and entities associated with the CRINK, and a significant number have also been indicted. While the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish but to bring about a positive change in behavior, this change has not materialized as of yet. At the level of the FVEY partners, the United Kingdom has regulated its own independent cyber related sanctions regime and occasionally imposed sanctions in coordination with the United States. Australia legislated a cyber sanctions law in December 2021. In January 2024, it implemented it for the first time against a Russian cybercriminal found responsible for the Medibank\n.

Moreover, the EU's process of imposing sanctions in response to cyber attacks is too slow and less effective; it may extend even beyond a year, as the decision must be unanimous and rely on evidence that can withstand judicial scrutiny. Thus far, the EU has sanctioned, under its cyber-related sanctions framework, only eight individuals and four entities affiliated with the CRINK, encompassing both asset freezes and travel bans. These sanctions were instituted in two phases, in July and October of 2020. As of now, no additional sanctions have been imposed through this channel, and there have been no challenges to review any of these sanctions before the European Court of Justice. Therefore, it seems that the EU cyber-sanction regime may have “already run its course,” as anticipated by some critics. Furthermore, a German research team, which analyzed the EU's collective response in Cases 1–4, questioned the effectiveness of such responses, doubting whether they “really have a deterrent effect on aggressors or are ultimately just symbolic politics.”\nDespite the above, this article does not purport to reach an unequivocal conclusion, based on sufficient credible information, regarding the effectiveness of the collective attribution and sanctions policy in achieving its primary objectives. These goals include deterring, disrupting, and demonstrating readiness to defend international norms and inducing a change in\n165. Media Release, Austl.

Ultimately, sanctions are not designed to punish but rather to motivate positive changes in State behavior. Given that the main outlaw States in cyberspace—Russia, Iran, and North Korea—are already subject to extensive multinational sanctions regimes for reasons unrelated to “irresponsible” malicious cyber operations, the impact of sanctions imposed as a response to malicious cyber activities is difficult to evaluate decisively. Nevertheless, the increasing frequency and scale of politically motivated cyber operations suggest that the deterring effect of collective attributions, along with retorsions, is weak. Due to the lack of authorized information regarding the outcomes of these sanctions and in the face of persistent politically motivated cyber attacks originating from the same culpable States and orchestrated by their governmental entities, it would not be inaccurate to argue that the effectiveness of this policy has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Meanwhile, it still has a symbolic, declarative impact needed to emphasize the red lines that States should not cross.\nIn conclusion, at present, collective attribution is no more than the upshot of the national attribution process, mostly American and British, with the addition of evidence sharing with like-minded States, in a manner that imposes no burden on the U.S. or UK intelligence community. The United States and the United Kingdom are always the driving force, while a CRINK State almost always stands on the receiving end. States and alliances participating in collective attributions, particularly the EU and FVEY, do not determine whether to join the attribution through direct involvement in investigative and attribution processes, but rather are influenced by political affiliations and international commitments within international frameworks, such as the G7, G20, and U.S.-EU or UK-EU dialogues. As a result, the collectiveness as implemented in the attribution process does not bolster the credibility of the American or British attribution determinations. This could notably change if the number of States committed to joining the attributions significantly increases, not due to political pressure or other political considerations, but rather due to an enhanced, joint, impartial, transparent, professional, and multinational process as the International Cyber Ransomware Initiative has recently demonstrated within its limited\n.

See Goldman, supra note 144.\nInternational Law Studies\n\n# V. CONCLUSION\nMore than a decade has passed since Leon Panetta first used the metaphor of the Pearl Harbor attack to depict how serious and risky a cyber attack could be, warning “potential aggressors . . . that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.” $^{174}$ Even graver and more precise warnings have been issued recurringly by U.S. presidents and senior officials in administrations since 2012. $^{175}$ President Biden, who during his first weeks in office had to handle a series of serious ransomware cyber operations originating in Russia that dealt a blow to U.S. public interests, announced: “I made it clear to President Putin . . . that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions—interfering with our elections . . .—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia . . .” $^{176}$ In the same speech, the President emphasized that only nations “working together and in common” can solve “the accelerating global challenges.” He added, “we [the United States] cannot do it alone.” That is easier said than done in the international arena. Despite technological developments that have improved attribution capabilities, the international community has not yet established a binding legal framework for cyberspace. Instead, the United States, along with the United Kingdom, has chosen to build upon a national official attribution system by imposing collective attribution and responses to the wrongdoing, aiming to concurrently achieve two goals: (1) to reinforce State deterrence through public collective attribution and imposing costs; and (2) shaping and internalizing “rules of the road” for responsible State behavior in cyberspace. $^{177}$\n173.

The United States, as the major attributor, assigns responsibility to specific States without allowing transparency regarding the evidence, the criteria of selecting the cases, and maintaining ambiguity about the legal grounds on which their charges rely. Furthermore, since the attribution determination in any given case is not subject to external and objective scrutiny, it is hard to indicate impartiality, legality, coherency, and consistency in the process, which collapses into one measure—attribution, accusation, judging, and punishing by retorsions. This is a far cry from satisfying any \"right\" or \"fair process.\" Thus far, the overwhelming majority of collective attributions have been American-led. The participants are American governmental experts, in cooperation mostly with American tech platforms whose loyalty to American national security interests is not questioned. There is no effort to involve independent, reputable international experts in the process, which is not sufficiently transparent and, on the face of things, may be perceived as one-sided. At most, the American process may constitute an exchange of views and intelligence sharing with counterpart agencies in the FVEY.\nClose and clandestine cooperation—among the FVEY—and sharing information with the EU's relevant institutions, as well as with a few like-minded States, is not enough to replace a proper procedure that would lend credibility and legitimacy to the process and its outcomes. The absence of representative, impartial multinational experts in the process exacerbates the legitimacy gap. This is even more true when the State at the receiving end of the attribution process is always a rival State from the CRINK group. Such dynamics erode the process' legitimacy and may discourage States from embracing its findings and joining the collective attributions, let alone responses. Moreover, it can explain the ineffectiveness of international initiatives, such as the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, and the negligible effectiveness of the collective attributions. This article pointed to one initiative, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which, in my opinion, has the potential to become more effective in countering ransomware and cooperating in law enforcement once the ransomware is detected or when credible intelligence can anticipate the details of the upcom\nsignal to Russia without any reference to specific international rules about the cost Russia might pay if it continues with its destabilizing actions).\n\nThis article presents the considerable cumulative experience gained from destructive and disruptive State or State-sponsored cyber attacks and their accompanying attribution processes. This, coupled with the growing number of States expressing their perspectives in enduring public debates regarding the terms and boundaries for applying major international norms to cyberspace,[179] illustrate the image of a wide-open field that must be fenced in by further development and regulation. In my opinion, there is fertile ground for a justified reevaluation of the collective attribution process and the responses to cyber wrongdoing. This is critical to bolster the credibility, legitimacy, and subsequently the effectiveness of these collective attributions in shaping the rules of road and enhancing State accountability.\n178.

Shortly after, more than ten like-minded States joined this attribution.\nIn April 2018, the European Council published a statement of support, which included condemnation while avoiding clear identification of the culprit States. This declaration addressed both WannaCry and NotPetya.\nIn September 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted a North Korean hacker associated with Lazarus Group, which works for the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau. The charges were related to his involvement in the Sony Hack (2014) and the WannaCry attack. In February 2021, The U.S. Department of Justice indicted three more North Korean military hackers with the same hacking group (Lazarus) in the Sony Hack and WannaCry.\n.

This malware acted as ransomware, causing enormous economic damage amounting to billions of dollars and serious disruptions in important public services. This cyber operation was politely motivated to damage Ukrainian businesses and sow public anger.\nIn February 2018, the FVEY collectively attributed this cyber attack to the GRU. Shortly after, more than fifteen like-minded States officially supported this attribution. The U.S. Department of Justice indicted GRU officers involved in these cyber activities while the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions.\nIn July 2020, the EU approved sanctions against Unit 74455 of the GRU for the NotPetya cyber attack, the Lazarus group for the WannaCry attack, and against Russians and North Koreans who have been indicted in the United States.\n## 3. Series of GRU Cyber Attacks (2015–2018)\nOn October 4, 2018, the United States and the United Kingdom attributed to Russia responsibility for a series of politically motivated cyber attacks conducted by the GRU against various targets.

The statement explicitly connected this GRU cyber operation to other reckless cyber operations revealed on the same day.\nAlso on this day, the EU published a joint statement by the presidents of the Council of Europe and the European Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The statement was limited to the attack on the OPCW, with a general reference to the British accusations about further unacceptable cyber activities.\nThe United States indicted and sanctioned officers of the GRU for being involved in those cyber attacks. In July 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against four GRU officers who attempted a cyber attack against the OPCW. In October 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against the GRU’s Unit 26165 and two GRU officers who participated in the Bundestag Hack in 2015.\n.

It is highly likely that the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) ran this campaign through a hacker group known as the APT10, which was almost certainly responsible for a campaign of activity against global Managed Service Providers (MSPs) since at least 2016, widely known as Cloud Hopper.\nOn December 20, 2018, the United Kingdom officially attributed responsibility for this campaign to China's MSS. The U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously indicted and imposed personal sanctions on two Chinese hackers allegedly part of APT10 and involved in this cyber campaign. The following day, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada published official attribution statements with similar content.

The SolarWinds Cyber Espionage (exposed in November 2020)\nOn April 15, 2021, the United States, joined by the United Kingdom, accused Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) operatives of conducting the SolarWinds cyber espionage operation, gaining access to tens of thousands of entities, including governmental, in the United States and worldwide. The other three State parties of the FVEY joined the collective attribution, whereas the EU statement expressed solidarity with the United States concerning the impact of malicious cyber activities, notably the SolarWinds hack, which, “the United States assesses,” was conducted by Russia. Similarly, the North Atlantic Council’s statement also expressed solidarity with the United States based on its assessments regarding Russia’s responsibility for the SolarWinds hack and called on Russia to comply with its international obligations.\n203.

The EU statement did not assign direct responsibility to China but emphasized that the malicious cyber activities were undertaken from China's territory, urging it to prevent such activities.

Interference in European States' Democratic Processes (September 2021)\nOn September 24, 2021, shortly before the German elections, the EU High Representative denounced Russia for trying to interfere in European democratic processes by accessing computer systems and personal accounts in the EU member States and stealing data. The official statement relied on \"some EU member states\" that have observed malicious cyber activities, \"collectively designated as Ghostwriter and associated these with the Russian state.\" The statement asserts that such activities contradict the List of Non-Binding Norms, calling to immediately cease them and urging Russia to adhere to the List.

DDoS Attack Against Ukraine (February 15–16, 2022)\nA week prior to the Russian invasion, an unprecedented DDoS attack crashed Ukrainian banks and government websites. Although the head of the Cybersecurity Department of Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it was too early to identify specific perpetrators, Ukraine pointed the finger at Russia as the only country interested in destabilizing Ukraine.[213] Forty-eight hours later, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia collectively blamed Russia for conducting the operation through its GRU. This collective attribution is exceptional primarily for one reason: It is the fastest political decision made to date officially attributing State responsibility.\n# 12. Blocking the KA-SAT Network (February 16, 2022)\nOn May 10, 2022, the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre assessed that Russia's GRU was almost certainly responsible for the cyber attack against ViaSat, a multinational communications provider, one hour prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This cyber attack, which is believed to have targeted the KA-SAT network to disrupt or cut off Ukraine's military communication, spilled over to civilian customers in Ukraine and across Europe, making tens of thousands of terminals inoperable in a manner that was irreversible. Based on these findings and new intelligence, the United Kingdom[214] and the United States,[215] joined by their partners in the FVEY[216] and the EU,[217] collectively attributed responsibility\n213.

Cyber Attacks Targeting Albanian Governmental Websites (July 15, 2022)\nOn September 7, 2022, Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran. The reason for such a serious response was a major cyber-campaign conducted against it nearly two months earlier. This campaign targeted significant Albanian government websites, including websites for providing essential public services and websites of the Albanian Parliament and Prime Minister's office.[218] Consequently, essential websites were shut down, and governmental data, including sensitive emails, were leaked. Although Albania is a NATO member State, it has not applied to activate Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Albania is not a cyber-power State. Therefore, it appealed to the United States, United Kingdom, and other capable States to investigate these cyber attacks and assist in ensuring resiliency. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have attributed State responsibility to Iran, while the EU and NATO have not deviated from their cautious path, avoiding explicit attribution statements.[219]\nIn September 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security and its Minister of Intelligence as engaging in cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies.[220]\n14.

Formerly, Chief Military Advocate of the Israel Defense Forces. The author is particularly indebted to Yuval Shany for his guidance and insightful comments on the draft of this article.\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of the State of Israel, the Israel Defense Forces, the U.S. government, the U.S. Department of the Navy, or the U.S. Naval War College.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 # I. INTRODUCTION Twelve years ago, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was the first to warn of the threat of a cyber\"Pearl Harbor\"or a cyber\"9/11\"terrorist attack, as well as of cyber threats that\"could virtually paralyze the nation.\"¹ Ten years later, Costa Rica was the victim of an unprecedented assault when ransomware cyber attacks virtually paralyzed it to the extent that its president had to officially declare a state of emergency. Albania, a NATO member State, severed diplomatic ties with Iran following Iranian cyber attacks that aimed to cripple Albania's online government services and leak sensitive emails and government data.² In an era of global interconnectedness, the risks are borderless, severe global effects are at stake, and even sensitive national security computer control systems can be targeted. Unsurprisingly, these threatening cyber capabilities carry strategic implications for geopolitics, including the\"Great Power Competition.\"³ This rivalry between powers, coupled with deep ideological disparities (democratic versus authoritarian values), has become a major obstacle in ensuring global safety and stability in and through cyberspace. Rather than reaching a universal consensus on binding comprehensive international regulation, the international community, influenced by the conflicting views of competing powers, has made little headway. Consensus has been limited to agreeing in principle that international law, particularly the UN Charter, is applicable to cyberspace and concluding eleven voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace (the\"List of Non-Binding These disparities, coupled with the policy of silence or ambiguity that major power States embrace and implement regarding disputed legal issues, have resulted in a normative ambiguity. This ambiguity provides major powers with enough leeway to strive for “cyberspace superiority”⁵ while ostensibly maintaining their reputation as law-abiding nations. On the other side of the fence, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea (CRINK) have exploited this ambiguity and the technical characteristics of cyberspace for advancing their interests. Under such circumstances, the List of Non-Binding Norms’s effectiveness in changing State behavior and the level of State compliance are low. Moreover, the norms’ effectiveness and State compliance are influenced by the extent to which the norms and the process of application are perceived as legitimate, as well as the degree to which the outcomes align with the expectations derived from these norms and processes.⁶ ⁴.

Doc. A/70/174 (July 22, 2015) (paragraph 13 includes the List of Non-Binding Norms and paragraph 28 offers “non-exhaustive views” on principles of international law such as sovereign equality, due diligence, non-intervention, and the prohibition on the use of force that should apply to cyberspace.

For a broader discussion on legitimacy, how it is reflected in the weakened normative layer and affects its effectiveness, State compliance, and related processes and outcomes in underregulated cyberspace, see Dan Efrony, *Enhancing Accountability in Cyberspace Through a Three-Tiered International Governance Regime*, 103 INTERNATIONAL LAW STUDIES (forthcoming 2024) (Part II); THOMAS M.

Dunoff &amp; Mark A. Pollack eds., 2013); Timothy Meyer, *How Compliance Understates Effectiveness*, 108 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW UNBOUND 93 (2014).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 Against the backdrop of this normative ambiguity and inherent legal uncertainty, the process of attributing State responsibility stands as an essential and exclusive measure to hold specific States accountable for violating the norms of the List. To gauge the extent to which the United States has developed its attribution policy in the past decade, it is worth revisiting Secretary Panetta's 2012 remarks.⁷ In response to two consecutive destructive cyber attacks, he hinted at the improving technological capabilities to address the attribution problem by identifying cyber attackers and attributing responsibility.⁸ Therefore, “potential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions that may try to harm America.”⁹ However, it is important to note that neither the United States nor the direct victim States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, officially attributed responsibility for these cyber attacks to Iran, even though its responsibility has been widely accepted.\nIn fact, my previous published research on State practice in cyberspace between 2012 and 2018, co-authored with Yuval Shany, revealed that explicit official attributions were the exception during that period.¹⁰ Nonetheless, the last two attribution determinations addressed in that study indicated a shift from national official attributions toward collective attributions.¹¹ Indeed, the collective activity of nations in attributing responsibility to States for irresponsible behavior in cyberspace and in responding to such behavior has become a vital component of the deterrence pillar within the U.S. National Cyber Strategy. The United Kingdom, the closest ally to the United States, has endorsed this strategy.¹²\nInternational Law Studies\nThis article evaluates whether the collective attribution process and its outcomes can be perceived as legitimate and credible by the international community, including impartial, nonaligned States. Furthermore, it evaluates whether this process has become a crucial component in effectively holding States accountable for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms and in deterring States from such violations. Analyzing these and related issues requires a sound understanding of the official attribution process in practice, focusing on identifying legitimacy and credibility disparities, and researching the collective attributions announced so far. The article is built exclusively upon open-source intelligence.\nThe article continues as follows. Part II describes the official attribution process, differentiating between technological, legal, and political attributions and discussing the reluctance of States to officially attribute re es/deterrence-in-the-cyber-age-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary (presenting the United Kingdom’s deterrence strategy, mirroring the U.S. approach).\nVol. 103 sponsibility. Part III explores major aspects of the American attribution process, the most influential one, excluding the internal division of labor among the U.S. national security and law enforcement entities. It includes five sections that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could affect the extent to which the process's outcomes would be perceived as credible and legitimate. The first is the instrumental ambiguity the United States has embraced in the absence of a binding international convention, which has an adverse effect on transparency and source-based legitimacy. The subsequent three sections—intelligence-based attribution, attribution by indictment, and the private sector's role in ensuring cyber security—are important for mitigating the challenge of transparency but are still insufficient to ensure credibility and legitimacy. The fifth section explores collaboration between the private sector, particularly American corporations, including the most powerful tech platforms globally, and U.S. national security entities responsible for the American attribution process. This all-American collaboration may raise serious concerns among non-American constituencies about the credibility and legitimacy of the U.S. attribution process and its outcomes. Part IV delves into the specific collective attributions starting with three international initiatives. Two of these, initially planned to catalyze and empower collective attributions, have already faded, while the third initiative holds potential as part of a solution. Section IV(B) is a table that succinctly presents fourteen cases of collective attribution, spanning from the first collective attribution on December 19, 2017, until January 1, 2024. A detailed overview of these fourteen cases appears as an annex at the end of this article. Section IV(C) analyzes the findings. Part V concludes.",

Romano, Karen Alter &amp; Yuval Shany eds., 2013).": "International Law Studies\nIn fact, until 2017 the United States was the only State that had officially attributed responsibility to another State for executing a specific cyber attack in peacetime. The United States did so only twice, both in rare circumstances: attribution to North Korea for executing the Sony Pictures hack (December 2014), and attribution to Russia for conducting the Democratic National Committee hack and additional cyber operations meddling in the American election campaign (2016).²⁶ Another well-known damaging cyber attack, the Ababil operation (distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against New York's financial sector in 2011–2013), was investigated and, three years later, resulted in indicting in absentia foreign operatives who were Iranian government agents.²⁷ The detailed indictment, on the face of things, could be sufficient for officially attributing responsibility to the Iranian regime. However, the U.S. Administration declined to follow this path, likely due to political and national security considerations. The United States implemented the same approach and refrained from official attributions on additional occasions when the Department of Justice also indicted Chinese, Russian, and North Korean governmental operatives for breaching U.S. law.²⁸ The United Kingdom also avoided officially attributing State responsibility until October 2017, when it did so for the first time with respect to the WannaCry cyber attack.²⁹ Interestingly, France continues to embrace a Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 more cautious approach, preferring discreet diplomatic channels to increase the odds of peacefully resolving tense situations while averting the risk of escalation. Consequently, to date, France has never officially, and on its own—as opposed to under the EU's collective attributions detailed below—attributed to another State responsibility for a cyber attack targeted at French national interests.³⁰ Strangely, France even declined to attribute responsibility for the 2017 Macron Leaks, even when the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging six officers of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) for responsibility for this malicious Russian cyber operation.³¹ Germany has embraced a similar policy, with two exceptions related solely to Russian intervention in German election campaigns.³² The first exception occurred in October 2018, when Germany joined a collective attribution led by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, attributing to the GRU responsibility for a series of severe cyber attacks, including the Bundestag hack of 2015.³³ In 2019, more than four years later, the German\nInternational Law Studies\nIt is noteworthy that this was the first report of a State officially holding another State accountable for a cyber attack and responding with an official diplomatic protest, relying on information that merely met the level of “suspicions.” Apparently, this sort of cutting corners or lowering the bar of evidence stemmed from the urgent need to stop or deter Russia from interfering with the quickly approaching German elections race. This coincides with the principle, according to which an official attribution is a purely political decision, not necessarily a legal attribution that should meet specific legal requirements. It is no surprise that two months later, an updated Mandiant Threat Intelligence Research report asserted that it could not that the GRU was, “‘with almost absolute certainty,’ behind the APT28 cyberespionage campaign, which attacked a number of targets worldwide, including the German Bundestag...” (emphasis added).\nVol. 103\"rule out Russian contributions to either UNC1151 or Ghostwriter.\"³⁷ However, it stated that their researchers had not uncovered direct evidence of such contributions.³⁸ While official attribution is a political decision, it still relies solely on the outcomes of the national attribution process. The attribution determination does not rely on full transparency or even a significant degree of transparency, let alone the ability to withstand any external, independent, and impartial scrutiny. This provides room for questioning the credibility and legitimacy of the official attribution. Part III addresses several segments of the U.S. national attribution process, examining how they may have potential positive or negative impacts on the legitimacy and credibility of the collective process and its outcomes.\n## III. EVALUATING ASPECTS OF LEGITIMACY AND CREDIBILITY IN THE ATTRIBUTION PROCESS National security interests dictate confidentiality regarding classified intelligence, including information about sensitive cyber tools, detection capabilities, and military cyber capabilities. However, in the absence of multinational, impartial, legal, and professional scrutiny regarding the accuracy and lawfulness of the official attribution in any given situation, attributing States must be mindful of how various constituencies could perceive their attribution statements. Without accepted clear and binding rules, these statements may not be viewed as lawful. Nevertheless, there is a concerted effort to influence public opinion through enhancing the legitimacy of the attribution process. If successful, this could bolster the effectiveness of its attribution determinations.\nThe following sections address five segments that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could positively or negatively influence how the outcomes of the process are perceived for credibility and\nInternational Law Studies",
    "# A. An Instrumental Ambiguity": "Cyberspace's unique technological attributes produce opportunities for cyber power States to surreptitiously generate significant strategic gains through covert cyber operations, thereby minimizing the risk of being held accountable for breaching the law and harming their reputation as law abiding States. On the one hand, States strive to evade legal responsibility by distancing themselves from any factual or legal linkage to the malicious cyber operations in question. On the other hand, national security interests dictate the non-disclosure of classified information for both victim and attacking States. However, such data could help them substantiate arguments to strengthen or dismiss relevant accusations.\nAs mentioned above, States, particularly the leading powers involved in the Great Power Competition, have embraced instrumental ambiguity, including maintaining silence on questions related to the interpretation and application of recognized principles and rules of customary international law in cyberspace. The primary motive behind this policy is to retain a sufficient margin of maneuver to enable the protection and promotion of strategic national interests in the rapidly evolving cybersphere. This policy of ambiguity inherently leads to accountability gaps that the most influential cyber power States, like the United States, are reluctant to resolve. Nevertheless, it is crucial for these States to play a decisive role in shaping international cyber law in a manner and at a time that aligns best with their national security interests. Unsurprisingly, they seek to avoid situations requiring an independent, international, judicial forum, such as the International Court of Justice, to resolve legal ambiguities surrounding State conduct in cyberspace.\nNotwithstanding the growing number of States that have clarified, albeit partially and cautiously, their views about a limited number of legal questions, the policy of ambiguity still prevails. The policy influences policymakers when considering whether to officially attribute responsibility and\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nwhen considering how transparent to be regarding relevant evidence and legal arguments.³⁹\nOfficial attribution regarding cyber incidents in itself does not eliminate the need for transparency. This requirement is inherent in the legal obligation to substantiate State responsibility in both non-cyber and cyber incidents.⁴⁰ Transparency is essential to legitimize the official attribution by reflecting its “right process” through its process-based and outcome-based legitimacy.⁴¹ In the absence of accessible international judicial or quasi-judicial forums, as well as an impartial international monitoring institution, conflicting States might seek to influence the final “judgment” of the “international court of legitimacy.” This type of influence often involves legitimizing one side while delegitimizing the other. To achieve this, States should enhance transparency regarding their findings and, more importantly, with respect to processes and procedures undertaken. This includes ensuring that they align with Thomas Franck’s concept of the “right process.”⁴² The degree to which this transparency is genuine and comprehensive serves to strengthen their arguments in attributing responsibility or denying it, respectively.\nRelying solely on the investigative role of the United States or the United Kingdom, coupled with limited transparency and unwillingness to disclose persuasive evidence, opens the door to plausible deniability. Excluding independent, objective, and multinational experts, as well as representatives from other States, from participating in the attribution process also provides grounds for criticizing the integrity of the process.

FRANCK, supra note 6, at 19, 24, 235 (the institution’s, or rule’s legitimacy derives from a generally held belief that each of them has been established and operates according to accepted principles of right process).\nShould a State that officially attributes State responsibility for wrongful acts in cyberspace evade disclosure of the evidence and confidential information upon which the attribution and, if undertaken, retribution rely?\nThe first to address this question, in November 2016, was Brian Egan, U.S. State Department Legal Advisor, who noted that States are not required to act with full transparency when attributing responsibility to another State.43 Since then, a growing number of States have embraced a legal stance that denies the obligation to reveal classified evidence prior to attribution or countermeasures, making the extent of disclosure a matter of policy that often involves complex considerations.44 Striking a balance between accountability, diplomatic relations, and, most importantly, national security, including the strategic interest of maintaining instrumental ambiguity, remains a significant challenge in the evolving landscape of cyberspace governance. Yet simply prioritizing national security interests to the extent of excluding transparency may erode trust in the attribution statement. Nevertheless, powers like the United States and the United Kingdom, which possess advanced cyber capabilities and robust intelligence, do not hesitate to base their attribution claims solely on their intelligence assessment system, thereby preserving confidentiality and national security interests.\n## B. Intelligence-Based Attribution The term\"intelligence assessment\"usually does not imply absolute certainty nor admissibility in court but rather the degree of certainty and credibility with which a certain factual narrative should be perceived, using the qualifiers of the national intelligence community about high, moderate, or low likelihood/certainty of the narrative as described in the attribution statement.45 The degree of certainty obviously depends on the level of trust in the information collected and the extent to which it is considered reliable and credible. The more reliable and credible, the higher the degree of cer Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 tainty, and the more that information may whet the policymakers' appetites to officially attribute responsibility to the culprit State if additional political considerations justify such an attribution.\nUp to this point, the United States and the United Kingdom have adhered to this official format of attribution, responding publicly with measures such as diplomatic démarche and sanctions when attributions were based on an intelligence assessment of high certainty and the interest of national security allowed a limited transparency to withstand an appropriate judicial or administrative review. By endorsing this practice, both States have averted compromising sensitive intelligence to justify their official attribution and retorsion, which is a response within the prerogative of any State. Even if the attribution of State responsibility proves to be mistaken, the response undertaken remains lawful, albeit unfriendly, and is often reciprocally retaliated. Nevertheless, covert cyber operations remain a viable response, either alongside or instead of retorsions. However, if exposed, their legality would inevitably be challenged.\nCritics of intelligence assessment as major grounds for attribution argue that it relies on criteria that\"may at best amount to circumstantial evidence,\"far below the evidentiary standards used in courts.[46] This allows States to manipulate cases to fit preconceived narratives and embody political agendas; it may lead to misleading results involving the misinterpretation of information influenced by what later turns out to be a false conception.[47] None of the official American attributions since 2014, nor any of the collective attributions that the United States and the United Kingdom have announced since 2017, have corroborated this criticism. Both States have officially attributed responsibility relying on their intelligence and a high degree of certainty (\"almost certainly\"). Some of these attributions have also referred to open-source investigative reports and technological findings of tech and cyber security companies, mostly American, as discussed below. Others were also followed, months or even years later, by detailed American indictments delivering the message that they rely on sufficient and admissible evidence. However, only a limited number of States have been sufficiently convinced or politically motivated to officially adopt and join these attribution statements. Even these States did not do so because they truly participated in the attribution process itself or obtained access to Nevertheless, the investigation team determining the attribution remains exclusively American. The limited number of participating States might also indicate that those States, which the United States and the United Kingdom interchangeably have not allowed to participate in the process or share classified information, are hesitant to blindly trust American or British intelligence assessments. Considering that the United States is the driving force behind these attributions and that its rivals, such as the CRINK States, are consistently on the receiving end underscores the importance of challenging the credibility of the process and its outcomes.\nConcurrently with intelligence-based attribution, the United States has endorsed, on its own, another method to mitigate the demand for transparency. This is attribution by indictment (\"naming and shaming\"). The next section will demonstrate that, despite its relative transparency, attribution by indictment has not proven a benchmark for credibility and trust.\n## C. Attribution by Indictment Until now, the United States stands as the first and only State to “name and shame” by indicting, in absentia, foreign State-sponsored hackers, mostly citizens of the CRINK. They have been accused of breaching the U.S. Code by committing cybercrimes against Americans and U.S. entities. These indictments provide an opportunity to describe their worldwide malicious cyber activity. They include declassified information about unlawful cyber activities, shedding light on relevant State responsibility. This responsibility stems from the fact that, while committing the unlawful activities, the defendants were either State agents (such as soldiers, officers, or other government officials) or third parties under the State’s control, direction, instruction, or empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority.⁴⁸ However, indicting unlawful combatants, such as spies captured during peacetime or armed conflict while conducting their mission in the territory ⁴⁸. Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 20, arts. 4–5, 8.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 of the accusing State, is unexceptional and reflects customary international law.⁴⁹ Nevertheless, indicting, in absentia, defendants identified as official agents of a foreign State for remotely hacking and damaging, during peacetime, targets located in the territory of the accusing State is both exceptional and unprecedented.⁵⁰ This could be acceptable if the hacks were criminally motivated and could not be attributed to a specific State, according to the Articles on State Responsibility.\nThe U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, admitted that “traditional military and intelligence activity is a separate sphere of conduct that ought not be subject to domestic criminal law,” with the recognized exception noted above of charging intelligence officers operating undercover in the United States.⁵¹ Barr introduced new and unprecedented exceptions such as State-sponsored computer intrusions “for the purpose of intellectual property theft for the use of [the Chinese] private sector, bank robbery, and interfering with our democratic elections” and “deliberate, indiscriminate theft of vast amounts of sensitive personal data of civilians,”⁵² as occurred in the case of hacking Equifax. In Barr’s words, such cases “cannot be countenanced.”⁵³ In fact, such cases have led to the submission of indictments in deviation from the customary principles of international law and the recognized principle of criminal responsibility. One scholar labeled this a “judicialized attribution,” a new tool to convey more concrete and less political attribution focusing on the evidence and lawfulness of the behavior according to domestic law rather than international law.⁵⁴ This is despite the fact that both the superiors and subordinates who followed their orders purportedly committed the attributed crimes remotely from\nInternational Law Studies\nFurthermore, invoking this policy of indictments requires proceeding in front of a federal grand jury to investigate and decide whether and on what charges to indict. This process is expected to be unbiased, reinforcing the indictment's credibility. However, the jury operates behind closed doors, hearing the federal prosecutor and live testimonies of relevant witnesses, mostly federal investigators, and American cyber security and technology experts. In fact, the process is controlled and guided by the federal prosecutor of the case rather than a judge. Moreover, the indictments may also rely on evidence from American tech and cybersecurity companies, which, as explored below, closely collaborate with local governmental authorities. The national loyalty of these companies is often taken for granted.55 While this perception may not be entirely accurate, it is sufficient to undermine the trust in the impartiality and credibility of the American attribution process by significant portions of the international community, particularly populations and governments in the Global South.\nMoreover, Article 28(f) of the 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report approved by the UN General Assembly asserts that\"the accusation of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against states should be substantiated.\"56 The question of whether the American and British practice in this regard meets this requirement is still contested. As mentioned above, a growing number of States have publicly endorsed the view that States attributing responsibility do not need to disclose classified evidence. States like the United States and the United Kingdom maintain that their findings are substantiated by the professional work of criminal investigators, tech experts, and intelligence professionals who Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 do not violate Article 28, which is silent about the ways in which accusations should be substantiated.\nIn contrast, the CRINK States, the exclusive subjects of such attribution processes, often disregard or automatically reject the accusations against them. Russia consistently demands that attributing States substantiate their accusations by revealing evidence, particularly forensic or technical evidence.57 China, which always criticizes the U.S. tendency to function as the\"global sheriff,\"has recently responded by employing the same attribution approach, directing accusations toward the United States for cyber attacks allegedly conducted against Chinese entities.58 Interestingly, the Obama Administration, striving to avoid escalation and miscalculation, refrained from officially attributing explicit responsibility to States for specific cyber attacks and preferred to do so indirectly by unsealing an indictment against Iranians three years later.59 A shift has been noted since 2018 when indictments started to complement the administration's official attribution statements. However, the policy in this regard remains inconsistent. Not every official attribution is accompanied by indictment, and conversely, not every indictment is accompanied by an official attribution.\nInternational Law Studies\nThus far, the United States has not succeeded in prompting even a single State, not even its closest ally, the United Kingdom, to follow it in implementing this\"naming and shaming\"strategy. Unsurprisingly, this American strategy has not deterred the CRINK States. As the FBI's Deputy Director put it when announcing another indictment:\"Time and again, Russia has made it clear: They will not abide by accepted norms, and instead, they intend to continue their destructive, destabilizing cyber behavior.\"61 Additionally, U.S. federal indictments, even when accompanied by collective attributions, have not significantly increased the number of States joining the collective attribution.62 This, coupled with the growing number of CRINK-sponsored cyber attacks, raises significant doubts about the extent to which this strategy is indeed effective. The responses to these doubts vary widely. Some scholars opine that this strategy appears to be a failure and\"even might be self-defeating.\"63 In contrast, others argue that it serves more than just deterrence, notably enabling other actions like sanctions to Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 assist the U.S. efforts in constructing the desired international norms for cyberspace.⁶⁴ For the purposes of this article, it suffices to note that by unsealing indictments in absentia, the United States strives to have it all. On the one hand, it purportedly maintains credible evidence and a reasonable degree of transparency through detailed charges sufficient for imposing ex parte administrative personal sanctions against unreachable foreign defendants. On the other hand, none of these defendants are likely to extradite themselves to challenge the legal and administrative proceedings, including the credibility of the evidence. The U.S. Assistant Attorney General described the indictments as “just a piece of the puzzle,” representing a critical, credible step towards imposing meaningful consequences, adding that it is part of building consensus inside and outside the United States about responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace.⁶⁵ In conclusion, the benefit of attribution through indictment may be associated with three possible objectives: using the prestige of the American justice proceedings along with a degree of transparency to reinforce the attribution’s credibility through the lens of other impartial States; deterring States from launching similar attacks and damaging their reputation as law-abiding States; and building a broad international consensus to compel States to adhere to norms of responsible State behavior, such as the prohibition on conducting cyber attacks against critical infrastructure facilities. Nevertheless, the experience of recent years has not indicated any remarkable success in accomplishing all these objectives, at least not enhancing the credibility of the attributions through such indirect measures, nor significantly increasing the number of States joining the collective attributions ⁶⁴.

However, neither provides transparent evidence that could withstand external and impartial scrutiny, subsequently substantiating the attribution determinations and ensuring their credibility.\nThe next section delves into the significant role played by the private sector, particularly in the United States, illustrating how private sector collaboration with the U.S. Government may enhance the level of transparency in determining and announcing official attributions. However, concurrently, it may raise concerns about the legitimacy and credibility of such attributions.\n## D. The Role of the Private Sector The private sector, through its major tech and cyber security firms, plays a key role in the attribution process, as it possesses significant tech capabilities for detecting and investigating cyber incidents. Western companies, mostly American, such as Meta (Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram), Microsoft (Windows, Azure), Amazon (Amazon Web Services), Alphabet (Google, YouTube), X (previously Twitter), Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Verizon, dominate cyberspace in both software and hardware, encompassing global social media, big data, cloud services, artificial intelligence, computer operating systems, and search engines. Each of these realms is a playground where any vulnerability exposed by third parties could be exploited, posing serious threats to the company's reputation and business success. Thus, these companies invest vast resources to consistently lead in technology, developing cutting-edge capabilities to detect, investigate, and thwart any threat, regardless of its motives through in-house cyber threat intelligence teams. Moreover, global tech platforms, in particular, have achieved worldwide dominance and maintain a formidable presence in cyberspace, a level of control that State cyber powers, including a cyber superpower like the United States, struggle to maintain.⁶⁷ Additional- ⁶⁶.

Eichensehr, Digital Switzerland, 167 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW 665, 691 (2019) (noting that the major U.S. technology companies are both powerful and sophisticated actors in the international sphere. Nevertheless, voices are growing, as embodied in proposals and decisions, calling to limit the global impact of Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 ly, civil society organizations, such as the Citizen Lab, which focus mostly on safeguarding human rights from malicious cyber operations, and leading multinational cyber security firms, such as Mandiant, CrowdStrike, Kaspersky, and Symantec, have been evolving their cyber security expertise to successfully detect, thwart, and investigate any harmful cyber operation from any source.⁶⁸ That said, victim States less capable in cyberspace would seek immediate assistance from a cyber power ally to confront any hostile cyber operation or campaign and investigate accountability. Typically, such aid would involve collaboration with domestic or global cyber security and tech companies that have become major players in the field of cyber threat intelligence, holding capabilities that may even exceed those of government intelligence agencies.⁶⁹ These capabilities are crucial for gathering, processing, and analyzing technological findings to promptly establish situational awareness for the State's decision-makers.⁷⁰ Multiple firms have already engaged in such activities and provided their client States, and sometimes the public, with relatively prompt and detailed technical reports. These reports may include clear-cut technical evidence to detect and distinctly identify the perpetrators. However, technical attribution alone is not always sufficient for attributing responsibility with a full or high level of certainty. As these companies); see also Elena Chachko, National Security by Platform, 25 STANFORD TECHNOLOGY LAW REVIEW 55 (2021). The Russia-Ukraine war has raised a serious debate regarding the unique and unprecedented role that powerful tech platforms, like Starlink and Microsoft, have independently realized during this war. Addressing this intriguing issue is beyond the scope of this article.\n⁶⁸ Kristen E. Eichensehr, Public-Private Cybersecurity, 95 TEXAS LAW REVIEW 467 (2017) (describing the roles of the U.S. Government and the private sector in the context of contending with international cybersecurity threats, including botnet takedowns, remediating zero-day vulnerabilities, and attributing cyber intrusions to States or Statesponsored cyber attackers); see also Jennifer Maddocks, Outsourcing of Governmental Functions in Contemporary Conflict: Rethinking the Issue of Attribution, 59 VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 47, 68 (2019) (discussing the option of attributing to States responsibility for private companies' activities by virtue of Article 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility).\n⁶⁹ Kris Oosthoek &amp; Christian Doerr, Cyber Threat Intelligence: A Product Without a Process?, 34 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 300, 302 (2020).\n⁷⁰ Id. at 301; see also Nicholas Tsagourias &amp; Michael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges, 31 EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 941 (2020); Sasha Romanosky &amp; Benjamin Boudreaux, Private-Sector Attribution of Cyber Incidents: Benefits and Risks to the U.S. Government, 34 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 463 (2021); Eichensehr, supra note 16, 547–50.\nInternational Law Studies Private sector firms that investigate and expose malicious cyber tools and methodologies used in specific cyber attacks publish their findings to Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 raise awareness about these threats among both governmental and nongovernmental users. More importantly, this helps enhance their cyber security capabilities and their preparedness to detect and thwart such threats. At the same time, such information may raise suspicions that a specific cyber attack is, in fact, an act of State or a State-sponsored operation. Occasionally, a private sector technological investigation may lead to complete attribution, including identification of the culprit State or its official organ.73 This occurs despite the general business orientation to avoid involvement in inter-State conflicts. Such attribution is a proper alternative to the official attribution that the victim State may avoid due to its strategic and national security considerations, as noted above. In such circumstances, the company's explicit technological attribution may influence international public opinion, delegitimizing the suspected State in the eyes of other States. Furthermore, any State could become a victim of similar unacceptable behavior at any time, and each may use such attributions to politically attribute responsibility to the suspected State.\nThe following section addresses the collaboration U.S. national security agencies maintain with relevant American private sector companies, including in the context of the attribution process. Naturally, this partnership is not completely transparent, nor is it exclusive to the United States. It also encompasses attribution determinations, raising doubts about the extent to which these determinations should be perceived as credible and legitimate through the lens of neutral observers.\n## E. Private Sector Collaboration with Governments A voluntary contribution by private sector companies to national efforts to defend the country from external threats is common, self-evident, and not limited to wartime. Thus, authorities of States cooperate and maintain close and confidential ties with leading domestic entities in the private sector in every relevant field, including health, transportation, tech-industry, telecommunications, and cybersecurity. Liberal democracies, as opposed to authoritarian regimes, maintain such cooperation within the boundaries of law. The Snowden disclosures of June 2013 about secret National Security Agency (NSA) operations involving American telecom companies rein\nInternational Law Studies\nDue to the Great Power Competition and the intensifying tension, particularly in cyberspace, the U.S. Administration has preemptively imposed a Federal ban on procuring software and services from certain Chinese and Russian tech and software companies that may secretly serve as long arms for both competitor powers in the sensitive fields of cyberspace and telecommunications. Moreover, the U.S. Administration has also urged its allies and relevant companies to follow suit.76 Recently, the U.S. Bureau of Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 Industry and Security has published its first final determination, prohibiting Kaspersky from directly or indirectly providing cybersecurity products and services in the United States or to U.S. persons and entities. Shortly before this, President Biden signed a bill requiring ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, to divest TikTok's U.S. assets by January 2025 or face a national ban, unless the U.S. courts find this legislation unconstitutional.77 Nevertheless, given the cyberspace architecture and its unique features, such governmental bans or new restrictive legislation may not be sufficient to meet the challenge of ensuring cybersecurity. The major American tech platforms have consistently developed their leading technological competencies and exercise significant control over information flow and cyber access to sensitive critical infrastructure through their technological systems. Furthermore, they have become a predominant global force in cyberspace.

However, in the absence of an independent international mechanism of accountability, the American attribution process, including the said collaboration, should withstand the scrutiny of its primary target constituency—the international community or international public opinion. Naturally, national security aspects of this collaboration remain confidential, though not always entirely so. Similarly, transparency may partially manifest itself in three dimensions: unexpected and undesired transparency—by leakers and whistleblowers; forced and balanced transparency—exclusively by virtue of judicial warrants that balance between conflicted interests, usually national security on one side and human rights on the other; and coordinated transparency—at the initiative of federal authorities in concert with the respective tech platforms.\n⁸³.

Conversely, if the companies are not willing to do something for any government, they will also not do it for the U.S.90 However, she finds that despite all their efforts to appear neutral, “the companies have not yet achieved—and quite likely will never succeed in achieving—perfect neutrality. They are still strongly associated with the U.S., where they remain domiciled and maintain their headquarters.”91 Additionally, they cannot ignore that the U.S. Government is their most significant customer, and just as importantly, the U.S. Government possesses the power to adversely affect their business operations through new domestic legislation that subsequently may also impact their global operations.\nNonetheless, scholars have indicated a shift in the way the major U.S. global tech companies treat U.S. Government requests for collaboration.92 This shift stemmed from the urgent need to salvage the reputations of companies in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures, and it refers primarily to governmental requests that collide with constitutional rights like freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Accordingly, the companies have begun implementing a policy of publicly rejecting and litigating against such governmental demands. In this context, companies will not carry out governmental requests that may collide with human rights unless litigation fails and explicit court warrants are issued, as almost occurred in the San Bernardino case.93 Therefore, Ashley Deeks counts private sector tech compa blogs.microsoft.com/uploads/2017/03/Transcript-of-Brad-Smiths-Keynote-Address-at-the-RSA-Conference-2017.pdf.\nInternational Law Studies\nIndeed, tech platforms and cybersecurity firms such as Microsoft, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, and Symantec have deviated from the cautious approach of avoiding full attribution and have increased the number of occasions in which they clearly attributed responsibility for a cyber attack to a State from the CRINK group.⁹⁵ It is safe to assume that any explicit private sector attribution of responsibility to a State, even for a State-sponsored cyber attack, would not have been made public before being shared with the FBI, NSA, or any other pertinent American authority.⁹⁶ This would no-apple-iphone-fbi/ (The Justice Department obtained a court order directing Apple to write software to bypass the security feature in the iPhone used by a terrorist who was killed after shooting and killing fourteen people and injuring others.

Twelve years later, the company admitted that a\"sophisticated nation-state hacking unit\"other than the NSA had exploited that backdoor, at least starting in December 2015. Bloomberg's investigation found that the hacking group was Chinese and connected to the Chinese government.\nUnsurprisingly, a significant part of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission's¹⁰³ recommendations were devoted to cybersecurity collaboration with the private sector. President Biden embraced this by issuing the Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, calling on private sector companies to partner with the federal government to foster a Vol. 103 more secure cyberspace. Subsequently, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency established the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, and the NSA launched the Cybersecurity Collaboration Center. The NSA's Director left no room for doubt, saying,\"in this era of strategic competition, government, academia and industry partners must work together as a coalition with shared risks, shared goals and shared solutions.\"For both sides, the U.S. government and the American tech platforms, close collaboration is a force multiplier in serving shared values and national interests. Conversely, the CRINK group and its allies use this visible all-American collaboration, and more significantly, the invisible collaboration, as a force multiplier in criticizing the credibility, legitimacy, and neutrality of the American attribution process and its unsurprising outcomes. Neutral or\nInternational Law Studies\nThe next Part focuses on the collective attribution policy that the United States, along with its closest allies, has been implementing since 2017. Given the experience to date, should this policy be welcomed or re-evaluated? That is the question discussed below.\n## IV. COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION In 2017, in the wake of two developments—the collapse of the fifth round of the UN–GGE and large-scale cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya—the United States and the United Kingdom extended the policy of official attribution to a new pattern of collective attribution aimed at deterring States from violating norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. As the table below shows, all the reviewed collective attributions, except one, relied on the national attribution processes of the United States and the United Kingdom regarding cyber attacks that targeted them or their allies. Prior to discussing the cumulative experience of the collective attribution concept per se, and to illustrate the complete picture in this context, the first section of this Part reviews three international initiatives that the United States introduced to deter States and advance responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace in conjunction with holding States accountable by relying on the concept of collective attribution.\n## A. Collective Attribution Within International Initiatives Despite the legal obstacles and instrumental ambiguity noted above, the List of Non-Binding Norms remains the main international instrument to hold States accountable for wrongdoing that violates the voluntary norms of responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. This accountability is essential for establishing effective deterrence, while the attribution determination is a keystone for invoking accountability in any given incident.\nIn its updated National Cyber Strategy, the Trump Administration announced the launch of the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative to re 2023), https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/huawei_china_claims/ (reporting on post of China’s Ministry of State Security on WeChat, in which the United States is accused of running cyber attacks and espionage for more than ten years against China, Russia, and forty-five other countries and regions, and of implanting backdoors in equipment and software and using American global technology brands to monitor and steal data).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 inforce efforts to deter States from violating the List of Non-Binding Norms through “official attribution,” “collective attribution,” a “naming and shaming” strategy, and through a “collective response” by jointly imposing sanctions against States accused of violating the List.¹⁰⁹ Ultimately, no State has officially announced that it will join the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, not even the closest ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, although it promptly endorsed the pillars of the U.S. strategy.¹¹⁰ The International Cyber Deterrence Initiative has not evolved into an effective international initiative, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative¹¹¹ or the International Counter Ransomware Initiative discussed below. In fact, the United States never officially launched the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, and senior U.S. officials have rarely referred to it.¹¹² The literature includes only one study that references the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, focusing solely on the collective response rather than the credible collective attribution that is implicitly a prerequisite to any collective response.¹¹³ Within this study, the scholar examined the policy embraced by each State party in the FVEY in building offensive cyber capabilities. The findings reveal that the FVEY States, excluding New Zealand, align with the approach of responding firmly to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Additionally, those States have developed the offensive cyber capabilities needed, among others, to uphold such a policy. The scholar concludes by suggesting that the FVEY and other like-minded allies enhance the credibility of their deterrent collective response ¹⁰⁹. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12.\n¹¹⁰.

It also calls on States to transparently impose costs under international law. The Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has only been invoked once since 2019. On February 21, 2020, fifteen out of the twenty-eight Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace partner States teamed up with Georgia and attributed responsibility to Russia for a disruptive cyber campaign conducted by the GRU. They politically denounced Russia and demanded it comply with the List of Non-Binding Norms.[115] Two months later, on April 16, 2020, the Czech Republic's National Cyber and Information Security Agency warned of a real threat of serious cyber attacks against its healthcare sector amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The day after, the U.S. Secretary of State released a statement in which he mentioned the Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace framework and warned against conducting such dangerous cyber attacks or knowingly allowing them:\"Anyone that engages in such an action should expect consequences.\"[116] Eventually, the threat was not real Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 ized and Christopher Ford, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State, credited American deterrence for this.¹¹⁷ However, since the warning statements declined to identify the State allegedly behind the malicious plan, this cannot be labeled as a collective attribution. Moreover, neither the Czech nor the American authorities were transparent enough to convince observers that this was not a shot in the dark, but rather a successful preventive response to a credible and imminent threat.\nAs indicated above, neither the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative nor the Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has gained political significance. Unsurprisingly, the anticipation that States beyond the closest allies of the United States would align with American or British attribution statements and impose various costs—political, economic, and otherwise—proved unfounded. It appears that the United States has relinquished both initiatives and, together with its partners in the FVEY, has remained focused on the collective attribution endeavor, as detailed in the following section.\nHowever, beyond the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, in October 2021 the United States established an international initiative to counter the threat of ransomware cyber operations, which the Biden Administration has recently defined as a threat to U.S. national security.¹¹⁸ Although this International Counter Ransomware Initiative¹¹⁹ deals exclusively with criminally motivated ransomware cyber operations, it remains relevant in the context of the present discussion of collective attribution by States. This is because its primary goal is to uphold multinational cooperation to counteract ransomware threats and bolster both resiliency and deterrence. To achieve this, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative strengthens cooperation by facilitating the sharing of information and professional expertise among the participating States and private sector companies. More crucially for the focus of this article is its collaborative effort to detect and identify hackers or hacker groups involved in ransomware attacks, whether independently ¹¹⁷. Ford, supra note 112.\n¹¹⁸. THE WHITE HOUSE, NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY 17 (Mar. 2023), https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf.\n¹¹⁹. Press Release, The White House, Joint Statement of the Ministers and Representatives from the Counter Ransomware Initiative Meeting (Oct. 14, 2021), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/14/joint-statement-of-the-ministers-and-representatives-from-the-counter-ransomware-initiative-meeting-october-2021/.\nInternational Law Studies Since its establishment in 2021, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative has consistently increased its membership and actively devised strategies to confront the substantial threat.[120] Despite these efforts, the Initiative has not yet urged its members to collectively attribute responsibility to States involved in conducting ransomware cyber attacks, either through their official State organs or third parties. Similarly, the Initiative has not yet led to the attribution of responsibility to States that tolerate recurring cyber attacks initiated from their sovereign territories.\nRussia has already demonstrated that Russian ransomware gangs, such as REvil, may thrive or decline depending on the regime's willingness to cooperate.[121] Ultimately, increasing collaboration among the International Counter Ransomware Initiative States may encompass holding States accountable for ransomware cyber operations, even when initiated and directed from their sovereign territory, violating the due diligence principle. Apart from addressing the legal complexities associated with such accusations, the Initiative's parties may also seek to attribute responsibility and hold States accountable for what they have already defined as prohibited\"irresponsible behaviors.\"Nonetheless, when upheld by a common multinational investigative team, the resulting attribution is collective and certainly more legitimate and credible. During the concluding stages of this article's preparation, the United Kingdom's National Crime Agency publicly exposed Operation Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 Cronos.¹²² An international law enforcement task force led by the UK's National Crime Agency and the FBI and consisting of eleven International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States (United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Netherlands, Finland, and Germany) successfully executed an international disruption campaign, taking control of the website and services (ransomware-as-a-service) of LockBit. This criminal hacking group is recognized as the world's most harmful cybercrime group. The outcomes of this operation included the seizure in three countries of LockBit's data exfiltration infrastructure by members of the task force. Two LockBit operatives were arrested in coordination with Europol. The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against two Russian citizens for conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks. The Department of Justice also announced that two defendants responsible for using LockBit to execute ransomware attacks were in custody and would face trial in the United States. The lessons learned from this experience could prove valuable for the United States and the United Kingdom in addressing the pitfalls of the current collective attribution process and response. This could serve as a test case demonstrating how successful cooperation between International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States can be in fighting criminally motivated, as well as politically motivated, cybercrime. Thus, the Initiative, in particular, may serve as an appropriate pilot for exploring optional solutions to better tackle the challenges associated with collective attributions and responses. More importantly, such solutions would enhance State accountability and the effectiveness of attributions in changing State behavior in cyberspace.\n## B. Table of Collective Attributions as of January 1, 2024 The number of collective attributions has been steadily increasing at a slow pace since the first on December 19, 2017. Thus far, the number has reached fourteen collective attributions.¹²³ Each may refer to a single cyber attack or a campaign comprising a bulk of cyber activities that may even span over years. The fourteen cases are described in an expanded list at- ¹²².

Five Eyes' Key Role\nDespite being an intelligence alliance, the FVEY partners are not obligated to full transparency between their intelligence agencies. However, they do share intelligence at a level of confidentiality not extended to other allies. This alliance is the core of the collective attribution strategy, while the United States and the United Kingdom are its driving forces. They cooperate in investigating wide-scale cyber attacks by exchanging confidential information and mobilizing, separately or in conjunction, to assist victim\n¹²⁵.

One indication reinforcing this assessment is taken from the recent Canadian attribution statement. Press Release, Glob. Affairs Canada, Statement on Russia’s Malicious Cyber Activity Affecting Europe and Ukraine (May 10, 2022), https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2022/05/statement-on-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-affecting-europe-and-ukraine.html (recalling each of the seven previous malicious cyber operations attributed to Russia. All are included in the table.). Another indication can be taken from the Press Release, UK Att’y Gen’s Off., Attorney General to Set Out the UK’s Position on Cybersecurity and International Law (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-to-set-out-the-uks-position-on-cybersecurity-and-international-law (this report enumerated examples of cyber attacks where the United Kingdom “named and shamed” State actors. All are included in the table.).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nStates upon their request, especially when their capability to investigate cyber attacks independently is poor or limited.¹²⁷ Both the United States and the United Kingdom are responsible for all collective attributions listed in the table presented above, except one (Case 10), to be discussed below. The FVEY's attribution announcements are made concurrently and in coordination.¹²⁸ However, they rely on sharing classified information, not on the findings of an independent FVEY multinational investigative team or any other form of international investigative mechanism. Like the decision to officially attribute State responsibility itself, endorsing an official attribution made by another State is a political prerogative for each sovereign State, which may announce it as its own official attribution. Such attribution determinations rely on various cumulative considerations, including the accuracy and credibility of evidence shared with all partners. While Canada has, thus far, actively participated in all collective attributions initiated by the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia refrained in three instances (Cases 6, 7, 13) and New Zealand in four (Cases 6, 7, 11, 13). Neither New Zealand nor Australia publicly justified their decision to refrain in each of these instances.\n## ii. EU and NATO Attributions or Partial Attribution Statements\nThe EU, representing twenty-seven European States, has had a notable practice of declarations in support of collective attributions. Thus far, it participated in eleven out of fourteen collective attributions, while NATO participated in six out of these same eleven attributions. However, the attribution statements on behalf of the EU and NATO could hardly be considered fully attributive. Instead, they may be perceived as a partial attribution of responsibility, making a limited contribution to the collective attribution strategy.\n¹²⁷. See, e.g., Cases 5, 13, supra Section IV(B) (providing examples in which the United Kingdom assisted the Georgian authorities in contending with and investigating the malicious cyber campaign); see Press Release, U.S. Embassy Tirana, Committed Partners in Cyberspace: U.S. Concludes First Defensive Hunt Operation in Albania (Mar. 23, 2023), https://al.usembassy.gov/committed-partners-in-cyberspace-u-s-concludes-first-defensive-hunt-operation-in-albania/.\n¹²⁸. At times, the dates on statements from Australia and New Zealand may not match those of other FVEY partners. However, the announcements are most likely published simultaneously with those of the FVEY partners, and at times the incompatibility of dates may be due to the different time zones.\nInternational Law Studies\n(a) The EU and NATO do not possess independent cyber investigative capabilities. Both rely heavily on more capable allies, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, EU and NATO member States, like Sweden, the Netherlands, Estonia, Austria, France, and Germany, each of which possess independent investigative capabilities, allegedly provide the EU security authorities with “deficient and incomplete” evidence in order to preserve the confidentiality of their cyber capabilities.¹²⁹ To date, the EU has joined an official attribution initiated by one of its members only once (Case 10), and the attribution is highly questionable. NATO has never joined an attribution that was not initiated by the United States or the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that both States also face challenges in implementing a high degree of transparency with the EU security authorities due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of their intelligence sources. Nevertheless, the direct involvement of the United States and the United Kingdom in investigating cyber attacks appears to be a differentiating factor, possibly explaining why both, along with Canada and New Zealand, refrained from participating in the EU and Germany collective attribution (Case 10), while Australia settled for expressing solidarity.¹³⁰ (b) The EU and NATO have joined collective attributions through brief declarations or statements issued on behalf of both Councils. The wording of these official declarations or statements must be cautious and measured to achieve unanimity within a truly brief period. Typically, they condemn the cyber attack in question, express concerns about it, and show solidarity with the affected States. The EU and NATO choose to avoid any explicit attribution of responsibility to the CRINK States. At the same time, the United States and the United Kingdom explicitly attribute responsibility primarily to specific official agents or organs of any State within the ¹²⁹.

The EU and NATO refrain from attributing responsibility even to CRINK's official entities, such as intelligence agencies and national security institutions, which some of the U.S. or UK attribution determinations refer to in detail. In Case 9, for instance, the North Atlantic Council's statement acknowledges official statements made by its members—United States, United Kingdom, and Canada—attributing to China responsibility for compromising the Microsoft Exchange Server. The statement continues expressing solidarity with those who were affected, calling on\"all states, including China,\"to uphold their international commitments and\"act responsibly, including in cyberspace.\"131 Similarly, the EU's declaration refrains from explicitly attributing responsibility to China for malicious cyber activities, as opposed to the FVEY attribution statements.132 Instead, the EU\"strongly denounces\"these malicious cyber activities, urging China to comply with norms of responsible State behavior and prevent the use of its territory for such activities.133 The EU approach further differs from the FVEY by emphasizing adherence to the List of Non-Binding Norms, including due diligence, rather than strictly assigning State responsibility. However, challenges arise when applying due diligence to cyberspace, given uncertainties about its compatibility with the specific circumstances and the contested nature of its application in this\nInternational Law Studies\n(c) Each of the EU member States may publish official attribution statements independently, like any sovereign State. Such statements may be more blatant and explicit than the EU's soft and general statements. An increased frequency of explicit independent statements, especially from cyber power States, aligning around the same conclusion in a specific cyber incident might impact the perceived legitimacy and credibility of the attribution determination in question. Nevertheless, such alignment is infrequent, contingent on the political cost-benefit calculation of each EU member State when deciding whether to act directly with full political responsibility through an official and independent statement.[135] # iii. Incoherency and Lack of Standardization The collective FVEY attributions reviewed indicated incoherency, a lack of standardization, and an absence of transparent criteria, primarily in selecting which cyber operations the United States or the United Kingdom would lead the FVEY to collectively attribute. Likewise, there is uncertainty about the criteria guiding the EU and NATO in determining which attributions to publicly support, all while navigating possible political storms.[136] Questions persist regarding the degree of certainty justifying an attribution in the first place and how to measure that degree.[137] Further considerations involve the timing and format of coordinated announcements, whether through verbal statements by senior government officials (such as heads of states, relevant ministers, and senior officials from the U.S. National Security Council and their counterparts in other States), or by written statements of an authorized governmental agency or ministry, or both in concert.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 The United States has been inconsistent in the way it has chosen to express its official attribution and synchronize it with its partners in the FVEY. At times, it settles for filing or unsealing indictments in absentia (e.g., Cases 4, 7) or for joining advisories (e.g., Case 6). Occasionally, the U.S. action of indicting and/or joining an advisory is in addition to an explicit official political announcement (e.g., Case 9). Conversely, the other\"Four Eyes\"always officially attribute responsibility through official announcements of senior officials, mostly by written statements of the relevant ministers.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of Case 10 as a collective attribution in the table is highly questionable. This marks the inaugural and sole instance where the EU independently initiated, on behalf of its member States, a statement, purported to collectively attribute responsibility.[138] It was primarily in response to Germany's official attribution and ostensibly at its request.[139] Ultimately, the declaration was more of an urgent general warning to Russia against interfering in European national democratic processes rather than a distinct attribution of responsibility for enduring wrongdoings.[140] However, to enable consensus among the twenty-seven EU member States, the statement's wording was softened and generalized, using\"some\"member States, instead of specifying the States, and\"associating\"the wrongdoing with them, instead of clearly\"attributing\"it to Russia.[141] Unsurprisingly, this declaration did not spur additional States to participate in this collective\"attribution,\"except Australia, which expressed its solidarity.[142] By stark contrast, the EU declaration in Case 14, which addresses the same threat of Russian interference in foreign States' democratic pro\nInternational Law Studies\n## 2. Doubtful Credibility\nThere are only a small number of official attributions and an even smaller number of collective attributions that do not rely primarily on the American attribution process. The credibility and legitimacy deficiencies of the American attribution process, as highlighted in the previous Part—such as ambiguous normativity, limited transparency, and reliance on potentially biased American investigative teams instead of impartial multinational teams—persist unresolved in collective attributions. These issues may deter States from participating in explicit attributions as opposed to partial attributions. The cases reviewed indicate that States' willingness to participate in collective attributions based on the outcome of another State's national attribution process is limited, even if this system belongs to a cyber power State such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, the deterrence and effectiveness of such attributions also remain low.¹⁴⁴\nCase 11 requires a closer look as it raises serious doubts about the credibility of both the American and British attribution processes, and whether their outcomes are credible and persuasive enough to encourage a growing number of States to participate in such collective attributions. In this case, the Ukrainian Government suspected Russia just because it was then the only State interested in destabilizing Ukraine.¹⁴⁵ Just forty-eight hours later, the United States and the United Kingdom provided the fastest attribution determination each of these allies had ever announced. It relied primarily on some technical information \"almost certainly\" linking the GRU to this cyber attack.¹⁴⁶ Anne Neuberger, the White House's Deputy National Secu\n¹⁴³.

While the swift collective attribution may be linked to the looming possibility of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine set to commence in a few days, it does not necessarily justify what might be perceived by any impartial observer as taking shortcuts in the attribution process. This certainly does not enhance trust in the process; on the contrary, it raises concerns.\nThe absence of transparent standardization and criteria is crucial to maintain flexibility in reconciling two conflicting characteristics. On one hand, the List of Non-Binding Norms is non-enforceable due to legal ambiguities and difficulties that are not easily resolved in the contemporary geopolitical situation, as described above. On the other hand, there is the challenge of enhancing State compliance with the List to reduce global risks and instability. However, this flexibility is not necessarily an ad-\nInternational Law Studies",
    "# 3. Shaping “Rules of the Road”": "Aiming to bolster deterrence, the United States and the United Kingdom initiated the collective attribution process as a response to attacking States in cyberspace.[150] However, in the absence of normative clarity, attribution announcements refer to unacceptable and irresponsible State behavior, rather than specifying international rules or norms allegedly breached by the given cyber attack. Thus, the policy implemented usually involves delegitimization (\"naming and shaming\") and retorsions, lawful measures that can be imposed without the need for detailed legal justification. The objective is to shape \"rules of the road\" by specifying instances of unacceptable cyber activity on case-by-case bases and to develop State practice accordingly. This involves instilling among the entire community of nations the perspectives of collective attributors regarding which cyber operations may constitute irresponsible State behavior.[151] Such activities would be deemed irresponsible State behavior when conducted by official State agents or entities, as well as by hacking groups affiliated with these entities, operating under their instruction, direction, or control.[152] Although the List of Non-Binding Norms does not refer to economic or national security espionage, bilateral agreements and multinational commitments prohibit the theft of intellectual property (IP), trade secrets, and business information to gain competitive commercial advantages.[153] Such multinational commitments may be an additional source for shaping \"rules of the road\" in the commitments' context.\nThe cases reviewed can be categorized into subcategories representing types of irresponsible State behavior. Each subcategory has the potential to form specific prohibitions on certain types of conduct, akin to rules of the road. Below is a classification of the cases reviewed into four subcategories,\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 with one caveat. This is not a one-size-fits-all classification. Some cases can be classified under more than one subcategory (as exemplified below by Case 3).\n(a) Interfering with State democratic processes, primarily elections (Cases 3, 10, 14).\n(b) Endangerment of critical infrastructure and supply chain (Cases 3, 11, 12).\n(c) Interference in inherently governmental functions (Cases 1, 2, 5, 7, 13).\n(d) Theft of IP and commercial secrets (economic espionage) (Cases 4, 6, 8, 9).\nShaping rules of the road, case by case, could be more effective if the collective attributing States use each case as an opportunity to shape the applicable international rules in the given context. However, the United States and the United Kingdom have not yet taken any significant action in this direction. \nIn May 2022, the UK Attorney General addressed collective attribution and the ensuing response to the wrongdoing as important measures in shaping the international order in cyberspace. She emphasized that The law needs to be clear and well understood if it is to be part of a framework for governing international relations and to rein in irresponsible cyber behaviour. Setting out more detail on what constitutes unlawful In articulating this perspective using the norm of non-intervention, she recommends applying it to any State’s cyber activity that undermines another State’s ability to exercise control over matters that it is entitled to decide autonomously through the principle of State sovereignty. For additional clarity, she also suggests defining types of disruptive State cyber activities in various vulnerable sectors, such as energy security, essential medical care, economic stability, and democratic processes. Identifying a type of such cyber activity and examining it in its relevant context would determine whether it disrupts or denies another State’s ability to exercise its sovereign power to freely decide and act. If so, it would constitute a clear violation of the non-intervention norm, rendering it an unlawful activity. Since the UK Attorney General proposed this approach, the United States and the United Kingdom have jointly undertaken only two additional collective attributions (Cases 13, 14). However, instead of attributing unlawful cyber activities to Iran and Russia, the UK Foreign Secretary characterized Iranian actions as “reckless” and “unacceptable”¹⁵⁹ and Russian actions as “completely unacceptable.”¹⁶⁰ This aligns with the established practice of the FVEY, as evidenced in the cases reviewed. Nevertheless, adopting and implementing the British Attorney General’s integrated legal and political approach within the collective attribution strategy could potentially confer a more binding aspect to norms, such as the prohibitions on intervention and use of force, sovereignty of States, due diligence, and the boundaries of permitted espionage. This might create incentives for States, mindful of their reputation as responsible and law-abiding entities, to adhere to these norms as interpreted and applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, enforcing them through collective attribution and responses would be more consistent and coherent, thus, more effective in shaping State practice and international law.\n¹⁵⁸. Id.

Sanctions as a Collective Response Another dimension of the legality of the attributed violation lies in the appropriate response. As mentioned earlier, both the FVEY and the EU confine their responses to retorsions, such as travel bans and asset freezing, undertaken against the entities and persons engaged in conducting the malicious cyber attacks in question. The expectation that a collective attribution would prompt retorsions from a high number of participating States, forming an effective collective deterrent response, has not materialized as of yet.¹⁶¹ Nevertheless, such a response has become a common practice of the United States and to a lesser extent, the EU and the FVEY.\nAt the level of the United States, sanctions are imposed with greater frequency against individuals and entities based on findings and charges detailed in joint advisories or unsealed indictments and law enforcement investigations. Despite the considerable number of sanctioned individuals and entities, many are government personnel and entities associated with the CRINK, and a significant number have also been indicted.¹⁶² While the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish but to bring about a positive change in behavior,¹⁶³ this change has not materialized as of yet. At the level of the FVEY partners, the United Kingdom has regulated its own independent cyber related sanctions regime and occasionally imposed sanctions in coordination with the United States.¹⁶⁴ Australia legislated a cyber sanctions law in December 2021. In January 2024, it implemented it for the first time against a Russian cybercriminal found responsible for the Medibank ¹⁶¹. See discussion supra Section IV(A) (International Cyber Deterrence Initiative).\n¹⁶².

Moreover, the EU's process of imposing sanctions in response to cyber attacks is too slow and less effective; it may extend even beyond a year, as the decision must be unanimous and rely on evidence that can withstand judicial scrutiny. Thus far, the EU has sanctioned, under its cyber-related sanctions framework, only eight individuals and four entities affiliated with the CRINK, encompassing both asset freezes and travel bans. These sanctions were instituted in two phases, in July and October of 2020. As of now, no additional sanctions have been imposed through this channel, and there have been no challenges to review any of these sanctions before the European Court of Justice.¹⁶⁶ Therefore, it seems that the EU cyber-sanction regime may have “already run its course,” as anticipated by some critics.¹⁶⁷ Furthermore, a German research team, which analyzed the EU's collective response in Cases 1–4, questioned the effectiveness of such responses, doubting whether they “really have a deterrent effect on aggressors or are ultimately just symbolic politics.”¹⁶⁸ Despite the above, this article does not purport to reach an unequivocal conclusion, based on sufficient credible information, regarding the effectiveness of the collective attribution and sanctions policy in achieving its primary objectives. These goals include deterring, disrupting, and demonstrating readiness to defend international norms¹⁶⁹ and inducing a change in Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 State behavior to align with norms of responsible State behavior. Ultimately, sanctions are not designed to punish but rather to motivate positive changes in State behavior.¹⁷⁰ Given that the main outlaw States in cyberspace—Russia, Iran, and North Korea—are already subject to extensive multinational sanctions regimes for reasons unrelated to “irresponsible” malicious cyber operations,¹⁷¹ the impact of sanctions imposed as a response to malicious cyber activities is difficult to evaluate decisively. Nevertheless, the increasing frequency and scale of politically motivated cyber operations suggest that the deterring effect of collective attributions, along with retorsions, is weak.¹⁷² Due to the lack of authorized information regarding the outcomes of these sanctions and in the face of persistent politically motivated cyber attacks originating from the same culpable States and orchestrated by their governmental entities, it would not be inaccurate to argue that the effectiveness of this policy has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Meanwhile, it still has a symbolic, declarative impact needed to emphasize the red lines that States should not cross.\nIn conclusion, at present, collective attribution is no more than the upshot of the national attribution process, mostly American and British, with the addition of evidence sharing with like-minded States, in a manner that imposes no burden on the U.S. or UK intelligence community. The United States and the United Kingdom are always the driving force, while a CRINK State almost always stands on the receiving end. States and alliances participating in collective attributions, particularly the EU and FVEY, do not determine whether to join the attribution through direct involvement in investigative and attribution processes, but rather are influenced by political affiliations and international commitments within international frameworks, such as the G7, G20, and U.S.-EU or UK-EU dialogues. As a result, the collectiveness as implemented in the attribution process does not bolster the credibility of the American or British attribution determinations. This could notably change if the number of States committed to joining the attributions significantly increases, not due to political pressure or other political considerations, but rather due to an enhanced, joint, impartial, transparent, professional, and multinational process as the International Cyber Ransomware Initiative has recently demonstrated within its limited ¹⁷⁰.

    "# V. CONCLUSION": "More than a decade has passed since Leon Panetta first used the metaphor of the Pearl Harbor attack to depict how serious and risky a cyber attack could be, warning “potential aggressors . . . that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.” $^{174}$ Even graver and more precise warnings have been issued recurringly by U.S. presidents and senior officials in administrations since 2012. $^{175}$ President Biden, who during his first weeks in office had to handle a series of serious ransomware cyber operations originating in Russia that dealt a blow to U.S. public interests, announced: “I made it clear to President Putin . . . that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions—interfering with our elections . . .—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia . . .” $^{176}$ In the same speech, the President emphasized that only nations “working together and in common” can solve “the accelerating global challenges.” He added, “we [the United States] cannot do it alone.” That is easier said than done in the international arena. Despite technological developments that have improved attribution capabilities, the international community has not yet established a binding legal framework for cyberspace. Instead, the United States, along with the United Kingdom, has chosen to build upon a national official attribution system by imposing collective attribution and responses to the wrongdoing, aiming to concurrently achieve two goals: (1) to reinforce State deterrence through public collective attribution and imposing costs; and (2) shaping and internalizing “rules of the road” for responsible State behavior in cyberspace. $^{177}$\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 However, this article highlights fundamental flaws that impact the credibility and legitimacy of this attribution process and subsequently its effectiveness. The United States, as the major attributor, assigns responsibility to specific States without allowing transparency regarding the evidence, the criteria of selecting the cases, and maintaining ambiguity about the legal grounds on which their charges rely. Furthermore, since the attribution determination in any given case is not subject to external and objective scrutiny, it is hard to indicate impartiality, legality, coherency, and consistency in the process, which collapses into one measure—attribution, accusation, judging, and punishing by retorsions. This is a far cry from satisfying any\"right\"or\"fair process.\"Thus far, the overwhelming majority of collective attributions have been American-led. The participants are American governmental experts, in cooperation mostly with American tech platforms whose loyalty to American national security interests is not questioned. There is no effort to involve independent, reputable international experts in the process, which is not sufficiently transparent and, on the face of things, may be perceived as one-sided. At most, the American process may constitute an exchange of views and intelligence sharing with counterpart agencies in the FVEY.\nClose and clandestine cooperation—among the FVEY—and sharing information with the EU's relevant institutions, as well as with a few like-minded States, is not enough to replace a proper procedure that would lend credibility and legitimacy to the process and its outcomes. The absence of representative, impartial multinational experts in the process exacerbates the legitimacy gap. This is even more true when the State at the receiving end of the attribution process is always a rival State from the CRINK group. Such dynamics erode the process' legitimacy and may discourage States from embracing its findings and joining the collective attributions, let alone responses. Moreover, it can explain the ineffectiveness of international initiatives, such as the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, and the negligible effectiveness of the collective attributions. This article pointed to one initiative, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which, in my opinion, has the potential to become more effective in countering ransomware and cooperating in law enforcement once the ransomware is detected or when credible intelligence can anticipate the details of the upcom signal to Russia without any reference to specific international rules about the cost Russia might pay if it continues with its destabilizing actions).\nThis article presents the considerable cumulative experience gained from destructive and disruptive State or State-sponsored cyber attacks and their accompanying attribution processes. This, coupled with the growing number of States expressing their perspectives in enduring public debates regarding the terms and boundaries for applying major international norms to cyberspace,[179] illustrate the image of a wide-open field that must be fenced in by further development and regulation. In my opinion, there is fertile ground for a justified reevaluation of the collective attribution process and the responses to cyber wrongdoing. This is critical to bolster the credibility, legitimacy, and subsequently the effectiveness of these collective attributions in shaping the rules of road and enhancing State accountability.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 # ANNEX—A DETAILED OVERVIEW OF COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTIONS 2017–2024 A ransomware cyber operation in which hundreds of thousands of computers were hacked and encrypted in over 150 States, causing serious economic damage and disrupting vital public services like healthcare, transportation, banks, etc.\nOn December 19, 2017, the United States and the United Kingdom led the FVEY members to attribute this cyber attack to North Korea, simultaneously and in coordination, constituting the first collective attribution. Shortly after, more than ten like-minded States joined this attribution.\nIn April 2018, the European Council published a statement of support, which included condemnation while avoiding clear identification of the culprit States. This declaration addressed both WannaCry and NotPetya.¹⁸¹ In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted a North Korean hacker associated with Lazarus Group, which works for the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau. The charges were related to his involvement in the Sony Hack (2014) and the WannaCry attack.¹⁸² In February 2021, The U.S. Department of Justice indicted three more North Korean military hackers with the same hacking group (Lazarus) in the Sony Hack and WannaCry.¹⁸³ ¹⁸⁰.

This malware acted as ransomware, causing enormous economic damage amounting to billions of dollars and serious disruptions in important public services. This cyber operation was politely motivated to damage Ukrainian businesses and sow public anger.\nIn February 2018, the FVEY collectively attributed this cyber attack to the GRU. Shortly after, more than fifteen like-minded States officially supported this attribution.¹⁸⁵ The U.S. Department of Justice indicted GRU officers involved in these cyber activities while the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions.\nIn July 2020, the EU approved sanctions against Unit 74455 of the GRU for the NotPetya cyber attack, the Lazarus group for the WannaCry attack, and against Russians and North Koreans who have been indicted in the United States.¹⁸⁶ ## 3.

Malicious Cyber Activity—2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games\nOn October 19, 2020, the United Kingdom attributed to Russia (the GRU) the destructive cyber campaign conducted against the 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in South Korea and the cyber reconnaissance that targeted officials and organizations involved in the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo, prior to its postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the United Kingdom officially announced its attribution determination,[201] the U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously unsealed an indictment charging Russians involved in the cyber attacks in 2018.[202] Although the aim was to call out Russia and pressure it to cancel its plans to disrupt the upcoming Olympic Games, the United Kingdom\nVol. 103 failed to expand the international support. Interestingly, the targeted States (Japan and South Korea), the other partners in the FVEY, as well as the EU, remained passive, excluding Canada²⁰³ and Poland.²⁰⁴ On April 15, 2021, the United States, joined by the United Kingdom, accused Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) operatives of conducting the SolarWinds cyber espionage operation, gaining access to tens of thousands of entities, including governmental, in the United States and worldwide. The other three State parties of the FVEY joined the collective attribution, whereas the EU statement²⁰⁶ expressed solidarity with the United States concerning the impact of malicious cyber activities, notably the SolarWinds hack, which, “the United States assesses,”²⁰⁷ was conducted by Russia. Similarly, the North Atlantic Council’s statement also expressed solidarity with the United States based on its assessments regarding Russia’s responsibility for the SolarWinds hack and called on Russia to comply with its international obligations.²⁰⁸\nInternational Law Studies\nIn July 2021, the United States, joined by the FVEY and Japan, attributed malicious cyber activity and irresponsible State behavior to China for stealing IP for commercial advantage and espionage through hackers contracted to the MSS (APT 31, APT 40). The EU statement did not assign direct responsibility to China but emphasized that the malicious cyber activities were undertaken from China's territory, urging it to prevent such activities.²¹⁰ The North Atlantic Council's statement\"acknowledges\"the statements made by the FVEY member States and expresses\"solidarity\"with those who were affected, calling on all States,\"including China,\"to uphold their international commitments.²¹¹ On September 24, 2021, shortly before the German elections, the EU High Representative denounced Russia for trying to interfere in European democratic processes by accessing computer systems and personal accounts in the EU member States and stealing data. The official statement relied on\"some EU member states\"that have observed malicious cyber activities,\"collectively designated as Ghostwriter and associated these with the Russian state.\"²¹² The statement asserts that such activities contradict the List of Non-Binding Norms, calling to immediately cease them and urging Russia to adhere to the List. It is the first and only case in which the EU independently initiated a statement that purported to express a collective attribution.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 # 11. DDoS Attack Against Ukraine (February 15–16, 2022) A week prior to the Russian invasion, an unprecedented DDoS attack crashed Ukrainian banks and government websites. Although the head of the Cybersecurity Department of Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it was too early to identify specific perpetrators, Ukraine pointed the finger at Russia as the only country interested in destabilizing Ukraine.[213] Forty-eight hours later, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia collectively blamed Russia for conducting the operation through its GRU. This collective attribution is exceptional primarily for one reason: It is the fastest political decision made to date officially attributing State responsibility.\n# 12. Blocking the KA-SAT Network (February 16, 2022) On May 10, 2022, the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre assessed that Russia's GRU was almost certainly responsible for the cyber attack against ViaSat, a multinational communications provider, one hour prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This cyber attack, which is believed to have targeted the KA-SAT network to disrupt or cut off Ukraine's military communication, spilled over to civilian customers in Ukraine and across Europe, making tens of thousands of terminals inoperable in a manner that was irreversible. Based on these findings and new intelligence, the United Kingdom[214] and the United States,[215] joined by their partners in the FVEY[216] and the EU,[217] collectively attributed responsibility\nInternational Law Studies\nOn September 7, 2022, Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran. The reason for such a serious response was a major cyber-campaign conducted against it nearly two months earlier. This campaign targeted significant Albanian government websites, including websites for providing essential public services and websites of the Albanian Parliament and Prime Minister's office.[218] Consequently, essential websites were shut down, and governmental data, including sensitive emails, were leaked. Although Albania is a NATO member State, it has not applied to activate Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Albania is not a cyber-power State. Therefore, it appealed to the United States, United Kingdom, and other capable States to investigate these cyber attacks and assist in ensuring resiliency. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have attributed State responsibility to Iran, while the EU and NATO have not deviated from their cautious path, avoiding explicit attribution statements.[219] In September 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security and its Minister of Intelligence as engaging in cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies.[220] On December 7, 2023, the United Kingdom attributed to Russia responsibility for enduring attempts by a Russian State hacker group to interfere in Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 UK politics, seeking to threaten the UK democratic process.²²¹ The National Cyber Security Centre assesses that this group is subordinate to Center 18 in the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). This malicious activity has targeted, among others, UK politicians, UK think tanks, and journalists and has selectively leaked information obtained to undermine trust in the democratic process. Such malicious Russian activity has been conducted in the United Kingdom and other like-minded States at least since 2015. Simultaneously and in coordination, the relevant ministries in each of the other four partners to the FVEY published statements of support. In addition, and also simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against two Russian operatives allegedly subordinate to the FSB Center 18 for targeting current and former U.S. federal employees from 2016 to 2022, and UK government officials, think tank researchers, and journalists in the United Kingdom. The United States and the United Kingdom also imposed personal sanctions on both operatives.²²² The EU High Representative simultaneously published a statement on behalf of the EU, avoiding an explicit reference to Russia and calling States to comply with the norms of due diligence and responsible State behavior.²²³ 343"

INTRODUCTION\nTwelve years ago, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was the first to warn of the threat of a cyber \"Pearl Harbor\" or a cyber \"9/11\" terrorist attack, as well as of cyber threats that \"could virtually paralyze the nation.\" Ten years later, Costa Rica was the victim of an unprecedented assault when ransomware cyber attacks virtually paralyzed it to the extent that its president had to officially declare a state of emergency. Albania, a NATO member State, severed diplomatic ties with Iran following Iranian cyber attacks that aimed to cripple Albania's online government services and leak sensitive emails and government data. In an era of global interconnectedness, the risks are borderless, severe global effects are at stake, and even sensitive national security computer control systems can be targeted. Unsurprisingly, these threatening cyber capabilities carry strategic implications for geopolitics, including the \"Great Power Competition.\" This rivalry between powers, coupled with deep ideological disparities (democratic versus authoritarian values), has become a major obstacle in ensuring global safety and stability in and through cyberspace. Rather than reaching a universal consensus on binding comprehensive international regulation, the international community, influenced by the conflicting views of competing powers, has made little headway. Consensus has been limited to agreeing in principle that international law, particularly the UN Charter, is applicable to cyberspace and concluding eleven voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace (the \"List of Non-Binding\n1.

This ambiguity provides major powers with enough leeway to strive for “cyberspace superiority” while ostensibly maintaining their reputation as law-abiding nations. On the other side of the fence, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea (CRINK) have exploited this ambiguity and the technical characteristics of cyberspace for advancing their interests. Under such circumstances, the List of Non-Binding Norms’s effectiveness in changing State behavior and the level of State compliance are low. Moreover, the norms’ effectiveness and State compliance are influenced by the extent to which the norms and the process of application are perceived as legitimate, as well as the degree to which the outcomes align with the expectations derived from these norms and processes.\n. Rep. of Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, transmitted by Letter dated June 26, 2015 from the Chair of the Group to Secretary-General, Established Pursuant to Resolution 68/243, ¶ 13, 28, U.N. Doc. A/70/174 (July 22, 2015) (paragraph 13 includes the List of Non-Binding Norms and paragraph 28 offers “non-exhaustive views” on principles of international law such as sovereign equality, due diligence, non-intervention, and the prohibition on the use of force that should apply to cyberspace. Hereinafter the List refers to both paragraphs 13 and 28.).\n.

For a broader discussion on legitimacy, how it is reflected in the weakened normative layer and affects its effectiveness, State compliance, and related processes and outcomes in underregulated cyberspace, see Dan Efrony, *Enhancing Accountability in Cyberspace Through a Three-Tiered International Governance Regime*, 103 INTERNATIONAL LAW STUDIES (forthcoming 2024) (Part II); THOMAS M.

Dunoff &amp; Mark A. Pollack eds., 2013); Timothy Meyer, *How Compliance Understates Effectiveness*, 108 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW UNBOUND 93 (2014).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nAgainst the backdrop of this normative ambiguity and inherent legal uncertainty, the process of attributing State responsibility stands as an essential and exclusive measure to hold specific States accountable for violating the norms of the List. To gauge the extent to which the United States has developed its attribution policy in the past decade, it is worth revisiting Secretary Panetta's 2012 remarks. In response to two consecutive destructive cyber attacks, he hinted at the improving technological capabilities to address the attribution problem by identifying cyber attackers and attributing responsibility. Therefore, “potential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions that may try to harm America.” However, it is important to note that neither the United States nor the direct victim States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, officially attributed responsibility for these cyber attacks to Iran, even though its responsibility has been widely accepted.\nIn fact, my previous published research on State practice in cyberspace between 2012 and 2018, co-authored with Yuval Shany, revealed that explicit official attributions were the exception during that period. Nonetheless, the last two attribution determinations addressed in that study indicated a shift from national official attributions toward collective attributions.\nIndeed, the collective activity of nations in attributing responsibility to States for irresponsible behavior in cyberspace and in responding to such behavior has become a vital component of the deterrence pillar within the U.S. National Cyber Strategy. The United Kingdom, the closest ally to the United States, has endorsed this strategy.\n7. Panetta, supra note 1. The backdrop of Panetta’s remarks—two destructive cyber attacks in August 2012 targeting and paralyzing Aramco, the largest oil company in the world, located in Saudi Arabia, and RasGas, the second-biggest liquefied natural gas company in Qatar.\n8. In this article “cyber attacks,” “cyber operations,” and “cyber activities” are used interchangeably, but the article focuses on politically motivated incidents, that is, cyber attacks conducted by States through their official organs and agents or through third parties as proxies.\n9.

Furthermore, it evaluates whether this process has become a crucial component in effectively holding States accountable for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms and in deterring States from such violations. Analyzing these and related issues requires a sound understanding of the official attribution process in practice, focusing on identifying legitimacy and credibility disparities, and researching the collective attributions announced so far. The article is built exclusively upon open-source intelligence.\nThe article continues as follows. Part II describes the official attribution process, differentiating between technological, legal, and political attributions and discussing the reluctance of States to officially attribute re\nes/deterrence-in-the-cyber-age-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary (presenting the United Kingdom’s deterrence strategy, mirroring the U.S. approach).\n\nVol. 103\nsponsibility. Part III explores major aspects of the American attribution process, the most influential one, excluding the internal division of labor among the U.S. national security and law enforcement entities. It includes five sections that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could affect the extent to which the process's outcomes would be perceived as credible and legitimate. The first is the instrumental ambiguity the United States has embraced in the absence of a binding international convention, which has an adverse effect on transparency and source-based legitimacy. The subsequent three sections—intelligence-based attribution, attribution by indictment, and the private sector's role in ensuring cyber security—are important for mitigating the challenge of transparency but are still insufficient to ensure credibility and legitimacy. The fifth section explores collaboration between the private sector, particularly American corporations, including the most powerful tech platforms globally, and U.S. national security entities responsible for the American attribution process. This all-American collaboration may raise serious concerns among non-American constituencies about the credibility and legitimacy of the U.S. attribution process and its outcomes. Part IV delves into the specific collective attributions starting with three international initiatives. Two of these, initially planned to catalyze and empower collective attributions, have already faded, while the third initiative holds potential as part of a solution. Section IV(B) is a table that succinctly presents fourteen cases of collective attribution, spanning from the first collective attribution on December 19, 2017, until January 1, 2024. A detailed overview of these fourteen cases appears as an annex at the end of this article. Section IV(C) analyzes the findings. Part V concludes.\n## II. OFFICIAL ATTRIBUTION\nMuch has been written in the literature about detecting, identifying, and attributing responsibility for cyber attacks to a culprit State by the official authorities of the victim State. Only a decade ago, the prevalent view con\n.

Nevertheless, this task remains easier said than done, particularly considering the challenges associated with legally attributing State responsibility, which I will address in a subsequent article.\n14. Compare Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyberattacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND SECURITY LAW 229 (2012), with Panetta, supra note 1.\n15. The term “technical attribution” is somehow misleading since technical attribution mostly does not result in clear attribution of responsibility to a State. At most, it is an estimated attribution of responsibility to a group of hackers based on the findings of tactics, techniques, and procedures. Reviewing the methods and techniques used in the discourse of technical investigations is beyond the scope of this article. For more information on this topic, see D.D. Clark &amp; S. Landau, Untangling Attribution, in PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY 25, 25–40 (2010); see also sources cited in supra note 13.\n16. Kristen Eichensehr, The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution, 67 UCLA LAW REVIEW 520 (2020); see also Lin, supra note 13, at 8–19 (emphasizing the need for all-source intelligence); GUITTON, supra note 13, at 36.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nEvery victim State thoroughly analyzes the information collected from all sources, including from cyber power State allies and cyber security and tech firms, to conclude whether the information is well-established and sufficient for a definite attribution. Even if the information includes enough evidence for attribution, the victim State's political leadership must weigh a wide range of strategic considerations and then determine whether to officially attribute responsibility; what level of transparency to implement; whether to retaliate, and if so, how, covertly or overtly; and which type of response would be perceived as lawful or legitimate in the given circumstances?\nA State might avoid an official attribution to preclude risks and actions that do not coincide with its national security interests, such as jeopardizing intelligence sources, disclosing intelligence gaps that the victim State may have pertaining to its rivals' cyber capabilities, exposing the victim State's confidential cyber capabilities, and averting the significant risk of misattribution, which could lead policymakers to wrongly engage in retribution and escalation.\nFurthermore, by refraining from public attribution, the victim State eliminates public pressure for retaliation and may lead the culprit State to believe it has not been detected. This strategy could allow the victim State to covertly monitor the operation and gather valuable intelligence about its rival's cyber capabilities. Additionally, it could facilitate the detection of additional covert operations employing the same cyber techniques while also considering disinformation or deception operations.[17] Moreover, powers that still obscure their political and legal approaches to pending cyber legal questions—such as the boundaries of legitimate \"cyber espionage,\" the clear threshold for constituting a prohibited \"use of force\" and a prohibited intervention, and how \"territorial sovereignty\" should be applied in cyberspace—might hesitate to officially attribute responsibility in specific circumstances. This is because such attribution could reduce the legal ambiguity these States have embraced to preserve their technological edge and maintain strategic leeway.\nTherefore, attribution is primarily a political decision relying on prudent and thorough discretion on whether to officially attribute responsibil-\n17.

For the purposes of the present article, it is worth noting the following: pursuant to the rules of State responsibility, a State harmed by a malicious cyber operation that is willing to officially attribute responsibility to an attacking State and has a legal justification for a lawful response, must meet two cumulative requirements.[20] The first is to indicate a breach of an international rule that binds States under circumstances like those of the cyber incident in question. This might be controversial as long as international cyber law remains in its embryonic stage and the extent and conditions under which customary rules of international law would apply to cyberspace as binding law continue to be open-ended. The second requirement is to identify a perpetrator suspected of breaching the international rule and substantiate their connection—either as an official agent or as a proxy—to a specific State.\nThus far, none of the attributing States have faced demands to legally prove their attribution statement within the framework of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Due to cyberspace's unique characteristics and legal ambiguity, the legal demands for substantiating State responsibility in cyberspace are uncertain, making it more difficult to legally attribute such responsibility.[21] While legally attributing State responsibility for international\n18.

In this context, Delbert Tran defined the \"attribution problem\" as a complete \"red herring.\"22 In circumstances where a sufficient degree of certainty (rather than absolute certainty) is enough to impose responsibility, and computer scientists have developed a range of tools to trace the culprits, the problem can be solved by \"configuring the law.\"23 Clement Guitton finds the attribution of State responsibility \"a lot more complex and nuanced,\" adding that the lack of binding standards of proof provides the States involved with great flexibility to manipulatively achieve their political aims.24\nNevertheless, the following section shows that leading cyber power States are not enthusiastic, to put it mildly, about officially attributing responsibility to other States for violating norms of responsible State behavior. This is despite the fact that official attribution is a political act, ostensibly exempt from meeting legal requirements, such as transparent and admissible evidence. To date, this process has never been applied in court with respect to cyber incidents.\n# A. Reluctance of States to Officially Attribute Responsibility\nDuring recent decades, States have conducted hundreds or thousands of disruptive and destructive cyber attacks either through their official organs and agents or through proxies. Only in a tiny fraction of cases did States officially attribute responsibility to other States based on technical and all-source intelligence. At times, these official attributions also relied on private sector contributions through confidential or nonconfidential reports of relevant companies. At least until the second half of 2017, victim States would refrain from officially attributing responsibility to another State unless they were amid an armed conflict, during which they often blamed\nOF INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION (Cesare P.R. Romano, Karen Alter &amp; Yuval Shany eds., 2013).\n22.

GUITTON, supra note 13, at 91.\nInternational Law Studies\n\nIn fact, until 2017 the United States was the only State that had officially attributed responsibility to another State for executing a specific cyber attack in peacetime. The United States did so only twice, both in rare circumstances: attribution to North Korea for executing the Sony Pictures hack (December 2014), and attribution to Russia for conducting the Democratic National Committee hack and additional cyber operations meddling in the American election campaign (2016). Another well-known damaging cyber attack, the Ababil operation (distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against New York's financial sector in 2011–2013), was investigated and, three years later, resulted in indicting in absentia foreign operatives who were Iranian government agents. The detailed indictment, on the face of things, could be sufficient for officially attributing responsibility to the Iranian regime. However, the U.S. Administration declined to follow this path, likely due to political and national security considerations. The United States implemented the same approach and refrained from official attributions on additional occasions when the Department of Justice also indicted Chinese, Russian, and North Korean governmental operatives for breaching U.S. law.\nThe United Kingdom also avoided officially attributing State responsibility until October 2017, when it did so for the first time with respect to the WannaCry cyber attack. Interestingly, France continues to embrace a\n25.

Efrony &amp; Shany, supra note 10, at 607, 611–12. Both incidents were investigated and promptly resolved by firms from the private sector concurrently with authorized U.S. agencies. The Sony Pictures hack was the first destructive State cyber attack conducted against targets located on U.S. soil. The Democratic National Committee hack was the first U.S. official attribution to Russia for interfering in the U.S. presidential election despite explicit warnings by the U.S. Administration.\n27.

Consequently, to date, France has never officially, and on its own—as opposed to under the EU's collective attributions detailed below—attributed to another State responsibility for a cyber attack targeted at French national interests. Strangely, France even declined to attribute responsibility for the 2017 Macron Leaks, even when the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging six officers of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) for responsibility for this malicious Russian cyber operation.\nGermany has embraced a similar policy, with two exceptions related solely to Russian intervention in German election campaigns.

The attribution determination does not rely on full transparency or even a significant degree of transparency, let alone the ability to withstand any external, independent, and impartial scrutiny. This provides room for questioning the credibility and legitimacy of the official attribution. Part III addresses several segments of the U.S. national attribution process, examining how they may have potential positive or negative impacts on the legitimacy and credibility of the collective process and its outcomes.\n## III. EVALUATING ASPECTS OF LEGITIMACY AND CREDIBILITY IN THE ATTRIBUTION PROCESS\nNational security interests dictate confidentiality regarding classified intelligence, including information about sensitive cyber tools, detection capabilities, and military cyber capabilities. However, in the absence of multinational, impartial, legal, and professional scrutiny regarding the accuracy and lawfulness of the official attribution in any given situation, attributing States must be mindful of how various constituencies could perceive their attribution statements. Without accepted clear and binding rules, these statements may not be viewed as lawful. Nevertheless, there is a concerted effort to influence public opinion through enhancing the legitimacy of the attribution process. If successful, this could bolster the effectiveness of its attribution determinations.\nThe following sections address five segments that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could positively or negatively influence how the outcomes of the process are perceived for credibility and\n37.

An Instrumental Ambiguity\nCyberspace's unique technological attributes produce opportunities for cyber power States to surreptitiously generate significant strategic gains through covert cyber operations, thereby minimizing the risk of being held accountable for breaching the law and harming their reputation as law abiding States. On the one hand, States strive to evade legal responsibility by distancing themselves from any factual or legal linkage to the malicious cyber operations in question. On the other hand, national security interests dictate the non-disclosure of classified information for both victim and attacking States. However, such data could help them substantiate arguments to strengthen or dismiss relevant accusations.\nAs mentioned above, States, particularly the leading powers involved in the Great Power Competition, have embraced instrumental ambiguity, including maintaining silence on questions related to the interpretation and application of recognized principles and rules of customary international law in cyberspace. The primary motive behind this policy is to retain a sufficient margin of maneuver to enable the protection and promotion of strategic national interests in the rapidly evolving cybersphere. This policy of ambiguity inherently leads to accountability gaps that the most influential cyber power States, like the United States, are reluctant to resolve. Nevertheless, it is crucial for these States to play a decisive role in shaping international cyber law in a manner and at a time that aligns best with their national security interests. Unsurprisingly, they seek to avoid situations requiring an independent, international, judicial forum, such as the International Court of Justice, to resolve legal ambiguities surrounding State conduct in cyberspace.\nNotwithstanding the growing number of States that have clarified, albeit partially and cautiously, their views about a limited number of legal questions, the policy of ambiguity still prevails. The policy influences policymakers when considering whether to officially attribute responsibility and\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nwhen considering how transparent to be regarding relevant evidence and legal arguments.\nOfficial attribution regarding cyber incidents in itself does not eliminate the need for transparency. This requirement is inherent in the legal obligation to substantiate State responsibility in both non-cyber and cyber incidents. Transparency is essential to legitimize the official attribution by reflecting its “right process” through its process-based and outcome-based legitimacy. In the absence of accessible international judicial or quasi-judicial forums, as well as an impartial international monitoring institution, conflicting States might seek to influence the final “judgment” of the “international court of legitimacy.” This type of influence often involves legitimizing one side while delegitimizing the other. To achieve this, States should enhance transparency regarding their findings and, more importantly, with respect to processes and procedures undertaken. This includes ensuring that they align with Thomas Franck’s concept of the “right process.” The degree to which this transparency is genuine and comprehensive serves to strengthen their arguments in attributing responsibility or denying it, respectively.\nRelying solely on the investigative role of the United States or the United Kingdom, coupled with limited transparency and unwillingness to disclose persuasive evidence, opens the door to plausible deniability. Excluding independent, objective, and multinational experts, as well as representatives from other States, from participating in the attribution process also provides grounds for criticizing the integrity of the process. The absence of these persons may raise concerns about the process being flawed, unfounded, politically biased, and non-transparent, thus, not credible or legit-\n.

Yet simply prioritizing national security interests to the extent of excluding transparency may erode trust in the attribution statement. Nevertheless, powers like the United States and the United Kingdom, which possess advanced cyber capabilities and robust intelligence, do not hesitate to base their attribution claims solely on their intelligence assessment system, thereby preserving confidentiality and national security interests.\n## B. Intelligence-Based Attribution\nThe term \"intelligence assessment\" usually does not imply absolute certainty nor admissibility in court but rather the degree of certainty and credibility with which a certain factual narrative should be perceived, using the qualifiers of the national intelligence community about high, moderate, or low likelihood/certainty of the narrative as described in the attribution statement.45 The degree of certainty obviously depends on the level of trust in the information collected and the extent to which it is considered reliable and credible. The more reliable and credible, the higher the degree of cer\n43.

Cyber Law Toolkit, supra note 39.\n45. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, supra note 13.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ntainty, and the more that information may whet the policymakers' appetites to officially attribute responsibility to the culprit State if additional political considerations justify such an attribution.\nUp to this point, the United States and the United Kingdom have adhered to this official format of attribution, responding publicly with measures such as diplomatic démarche and sanctions when attributions were based on an intelligence assessment of high certainty and the interest of national security allowed a limited transparency to withstand an appropriate judicial or administrative review. By endorsing this practice, both States have averted compromising sensitive intelligence to justify their official attribution and retorsion, which is a response within the prerogative of any State. Even if the attribution of State responsibility proves to be mistaken, the response undertaken remains lawful, albeit unfriendly, and is often reciprocally retaliated. Nevertheless, covert cyber operations remain a viable response, either alongside or instead of retorsions. However, if exposed, their legality would inevitably be challenged.\nCritics of intelligence assessment as major grounds for attribution argue that it relies on criteria that \"may at best amount to circumstantial evidence,\" far below the evidentiary standards used in courts.[46] This allows States to manipulate cases to fit preconceived narratives and embody political agendas; it may lead to misleading results involving the misinterpretation of information influenced by what later turns out to be a false conception.[47]\nNone of the official American attributions since 2014, nor any of the collective attributions that the United States and the United Kingdom have announced since 2017, have corroborated this criticism. Both States have officially attributed responsibility relying on their intelligence and a high degree of certainty (\"almost certainly\"). Some of these attributions have also referred to open-source investigative reports and technological findings of tech and cyber security companies, mostly American, as discussed below. Others were also followed, months or even years later, by detailed American indictments delivering the message that they rely on sufficient and admissible evidence. However, only a limited number of States have been sufficiently convinced or politically motivated to officially adopt and join these attribution statements. Even these States did not do so because they truly participated in the attribution process itself or obtained access to\n46. GUITTON, supra note 13, at 98–99.\n47. Id.\n\nNevertheless, the investigation team determining the attribution remains exclusively American. The limited number of participating States might also indicate that those States, which the United States and the United Kingdom interchangeably have not allowed to participate in the process or share classified information, are hesitant to blindly trust American or British intelligence assessments. Considering that the United States is the driving force behind these attributions and that its rivals, such as the CRINK States, are consistently on the receiving end underscores the importance of challenging the credibility of the process and its outcomes.\nConcurrently with intelligence-based attribution, the United States has endorsed, on its own, another method to mitigate the demand for transparency. This is attribution by indictment (\"naming and shaming\"). The next section will demonstrate that, despite its relative transparency, attribution by indictment has not proven a benchmark for credibility and trust.\n## C. Attribution by Indictment\nUntil now, the United States stands as the first and only State to “name and shame” by indicting, in absentia, foreign State-sponsored hackers, mostly citizens of the CRINK. They have been accused of breaching the U.S. Code by committing cybercrimes against Americans and U.S. entities. These indictments provide an opportunity to describe their worldwide malicious cyber activity. They include declassified information about unlawful cyber activities, shedding light on relevant State responsibility. This responsibility stems from the fact that, while committing the unlawful activities, the defendants were either State agents (such as soldiers, officers, or other government officials) or third parties under the State’s control, direction, instruction, or empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority.\nHowever, indicting unlawful combatants, such as spies captured during peacetime or armed conflict while conducting their mission in the territory\n. Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 20, arts. 4–5, 8.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nof the accusing State, is unexceptional and reflects customary international law. Nevertheless, indicting, in absentia, defendants identified as official agents of a foreign State for remotely hacking and damaging, during peacetime, targets located in the territory of the accusing State is both exceptional and unprecedented. This could be acceptable if the hacks were criminally motivated and could not be attributed to a specific State, according to the Articles on State Responsibility.\nThe U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, admitted that “traditional military and intelligence activity is a separate sphere of conduct that ought not be subject to domestic criminal law,” with the recognized exception noted above of charging intelligence officers operating undercover in the United States. Barr introduced new and unprecedented exceptions such as State-sponsored computer intrusions “for the purpose of intellectual property theft for the use of [the Chinese] private sector, bank robbery, and interfering with our democratic elections” and “deliberate, indiscriminate theft of vast amounts of sensitive personal data of civilians,” as occurred in the case of hacking Equifax. In Barr’s words, such cases “cannot be countenanced.” In fact, such cases have led to the submission of indictments in deviation from the customary principles of international law and the recognized principle of criminal responsibility. One scholar labeled this a “judicialized attribution,” a new tool to convey more concrete and less political attribution focusing on the evidence and lawfulness of the behavior according to domestic law rather than international law. This is despite the fact that both the superiors and subordinates who followed their orders purportedly committed the attributed crimes remotely from\n49.

FRANÇOIS DELERUE, CYBER OPERATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW 183–84 (2020).\nInternational Law Studies\n\nFurthermore, invoking this policy of indictments requires proceeding in front of a federal grand jury to investigate and decide whether and on what charges to indict. This process is expected to be unbiased, reinforcing the indictment's credibility. However, the jury operates behind closed doors, hearing the federal prosecutor and live testimonies of relevant witnesses, mostly federal investigators, and American cyber security and technology experts. In fact, the process is controlled and guided by the federal prosecutor of the case rather than a judge. Moreover, the indictments may also rely on evidence from American tech and cybersecurity companies, which, as explored below, closely collaborate with local governmental authorities. The national loyalty of these companies is often taken for granted.55 While this perception may not be entirely accurate, it is sufficient to undermine the trust in the impartiality and credibility of the American attribution process by significant portions of the international community, particularly populations and governments in the Global South.\nMoreover, Article 28(f) of the 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report approved by the UN General Assembly asserts that \"the accusation of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against states should be substantiated.\"56 The question of whether the American and British practice in this regard meets this requirement is still contested. As mentioned above, a growing number of States have publicly endorsed the view that States attributing responsibility do not need to disclose classified evidence. States like the United States and the United Kingdom maintain that their findings are substantiated by the professional work of criminal investigators, tech experts, and intelligence professionals who\n55.

U.N. Doc. A/70/174, supra note 4.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ndo not violate Article 28, which is silent about the ways in which accusations should be substantiated.\nIn contrast, the CRINK States, the exclusive subjects of such attribution processes, often disregard or automatically reject the accusations against them. Russia consistently demands that attributing States substantiate their accusations by revealing evidence, particularly forensic or technical evidence.57 China, which always criticizes the U.S. tendency to function as the \"global sheriff,\" has recently responded by employing the same attribution approach, directing accusations toward the United States for cyber attacks allegedly conducted against Chinese entities.58\nInterestingly, the Obama Administration, striving to avoid escalation and miscalculation, refrained from officially attributing explicit responsibility to States for specific cyber attacks and preferred to do so indirectly by unsealing an indictment against Iranians three years later.59 A shift has been noted since 2018 when indictments started to complement the administration's official attribution statements. However, the policy in this regard remains inconsistent. Not every official attribution is accompanied by indictment, and conversely, not every indictment is accompanied by an official attribution.\n57.

Unsurprisingly, this American strategy has not deterred the CRINK States. As the FBI's Deputy Director put it when announcing another indictment: \"Time and again, Russia has made it clear: They will not abide by accepted norms, and instead, they intend to continue their destructive, destabilizing cyber behavior.\"61 Additionally, U.S. federal indictments, even when accompanied by collective attributions, have not significantly increased the number of States joining the collective attribution.62 This, coupled with the growing number of CRINK-sponsored cyber attacks, raises significant doubts about the extent to which this strategy is indeed effective. The responses to these doubts vary widely. Some scholars opine that this strategy appears to be a failure and \"even might be self-defeating.\"63 In contrast, others argue that it serves more than just deterrence, notably enabling other actions like sanctions to\n60.

For the purposes of this article, it suffices to note that by unsealing indictments in absentia, the United States strives to have it all. On the one hand, it purportedly maintains credible evidence and a reasonable degree of transparency through detailed charges sufficient for imposing ex parte administrative personal sanctions against unreachable foreign defendants. On the other hand, none of these defendants are likely to extradite themselves to challenge the legal and administrative proceedings, including the credibility of the evidence. The U.S. Assistant Attorney General described the indictments as “just a piece of the puzzle,” representing a critical, credible step towards imposing meaningful consequences, adding that it is part of building consensus inside and outside the United States about responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace.\nIn conclusion, the benefit of attribution through indictment may be associated with three possible objectives: using the prestige of the American justice proceedings along with a degree of transparency to reinforce the attribution’s credibility through the lens of other impartial States; deterring States from launching similar attacks and damaging their reputation as law-abiding States; and building a broad international consensus to compel States to adhere to norms of responsible State behavior, such as the prohibition on conducting cyber attacks against critical infrastructure facilities. Nevertheless, the experience of recent years has not indicated any remarkable success in accomplishing all these objectives, at least not enhancing the credibility of the attributions through such indirect measures, nor significantly increasing the number of States joining the collective attributions\n.

However, neither provides transparent evidence that could withstand external and impartial scrutiny, subsequently substantiating the attribution determinations and ensuring their credibility.\nThe next section delves into the significant role played by the private sector, particularly in the United States, illustrating how private sector collaboration with the U.S. Government may enhance the level of transparency in determining and announcing official attributions. However, concurrently, it may raise concerns about the legitimacy and credibility of such attributions.\n## D. The Role of the Private Sector\nThe private sector, through its major tech and cyber security firms, plays a key role in the attribution process, as it possesses significant tech capabilities for detecting and investigating cyber incidents. Western companies, mostly American, such as Meta (Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram), Microsoft (Windows, Azure), Amazon (Amazon Web Services), Alphabet (Google, YouTube), X (previously Twitter), Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Verizon, dominate cyberspace in both software and hardware, encompassing global social media, big data, cloud services, artificial intelligence, computer operating systems, and search engines. Each of these realms is a playground where any vulnerability exposed by third parties could be exploited, posing serious threats to the company's reputation and business success. Thus, these companies invest vast resources to consistently lead in technology, developing cutting-edge capabilities to detect, investigate, and thwart any threat, regardless of its motives through in-house cyber threat intelligence teams. Moreover, global tech platforms, in particular, have achieved worldwide dominance and maintain a formidable presence in cyberspace, a level of control that State cyber powers, including a cyber superpower like the United States, struggle to maintain.

Typically, such aid would involve collaboration with domestic or global cyber security and tech companies that have become major players in the field of cyber threat intelligence, holding capabilities that may even exceed those of government intelligence agencies. These capabilities are crucial for gathering, processing, and analyzing technological findings to promptly establish situational awareness for the State's decision-makers.

More importantly, this helps enhance their cyber security capabilities and their preparedness to detect and thwart such threats. At the same time, such information may raise suspicions that a specific cyber attack is, in fact, an act of State or a State-sponsored operation. Occasionally, a private sector technological investigation may lead to complete attribution, including identification of the culprit State or its official organ.73 This occurs despite the general business orientation to avoid involvement in inter-State conflicts. Such attribution is a proper alternative to the official attribution that the victim State may avoid due to its strategic and national security considerations, as noted above. In such circumstances, the company's explicit technological attribution may influence international public opinion, delegitimizing the suspected State in the eyes of other States. Furthermore, any State could become a victim of similar unacceptable behavior at any time, and each may use such attributions to politically attribute responsibility to the suspected State.\nThe following section addresses the collaboration U.S. national security agencies maintain with relevant American private sector companies, including in the context of the attribution process. Naturally, this partnership is not completely transparent, nor is it exclusive to the United States. It also encompasses attribution determinations, raising doubts about the extent to which these determinations should be perceived as credible and legitimate through the lens of neutral observers.\n## E. Private Sector Collaboration with Governments\nA voluntary contribution by private sector companies to national efforts to defend the country from external threats is common, self-evident, and not limited to wartime. Thus, authorities of States cooperate and maintain close and confidential ties with leading domestic entities in the private sector in every relevant field, including health, transportation, tech-industry, telecommunications, and cybersecurity. Liberal democracies, as opposed to authoritarian regimes, maintain such cooperation within the boundaries of law.

Mandiant, for instance, was the first to attribute APT1 to China in a detailed attribution report based on technical findings and other, not necessarily technical, information gathered by the firm.

Eichensehr, supra notes 67, at 68.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nScholars have already examined different facets of Private Sector-U.S. Government collaboration. For the purposes of this article, it is important to focus on whether the collaboration of American multinational tech platforms with the American national security authorities undermines or, on the contrary, bolsters the credibility of the U.S. attribution process. This is especially significant considering its key role in the collective attributions detailed in the following Part.\nUndoubtedly, such collaboration bolsters capabilities for revealing the truth behind any given cyber incident and establishing a solid attribution claim. However, in the absence of an independent international mechanism of accountability, the American attribution process, including the said collaboration, should withstand the scrutiny of its primary target constituency—the international community or international public opinion. Naturally, national security aspects of this collaboration remain confidential, though not always entirely so. Similarly, transparency may partially manifest itself in three dimensions: unexpected and undesired transparency—by leakers and whistleblowers; forced and balanced transparency—exclusively by virtue of judicial warrants that balance between conflicted interests, usually national security on one side and human rights on the other; and coordinated transparency—at the initiative of federal authorities in concert with the respective tech platforms.\n.

Conversely, if the companies are not willing to do something for any government, they will also not do it for the U.S.90\nHowever, she finds that despite all their efforts to appear neutral, “the companies have not yet achieved—and quite likely will never succeed in achieving—perfect neutrality. They are still strongly associated with the U.S., where they remain domiciled and maintain their headquarters.”91 Additionally, they cannot ignore that the U.S. Government is their most significant customer, and just as importantly, the U.S. Government possesses the power to adversely affect their business operations through new domestic legislation that subsequently may also impact their global operations.\nNonetheless, scholars have indicated a shift in the way the major U.S. global tech companies treat U.S. Government requests for collaboration.92 This shift stemmed from the urgent need to salvage the reputations of companies in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures, and it refers primarily to governmental requests that collide with constitutional rights like freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Accordingly, the companies have begun implementing a policy of publicly rejecting and litigating against such governmental demands. In this context, companies will not carry out governmental requests that may collide with human rights unless litigation fails and explicit court warrants are issued, as almost occurred in the San Bernardino case.93 Therefore, Ashley Deeks counts private sector tech compa\nblogs.microsoft.com/uploads/2017/03/Transcript-of-Brad-Smiths-Keynote-Address-at-the-RSA-Conference-2017.pdf.\n89.

Given the experience to date, should this policy be welcomed or re-evaluated? That is the question discussed below.\n## IV. COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION\nIn 2017, in the wake of two developments—the collapse of the fifth round of the UN–GGE and large-scale cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya—the United States and the United Kingdom extended the policy of official attribution to a new pattern of collective attribution aimed at deterring States from violating norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. As the table below shows, all the reviewed collective attributions, except one, relied on the national attribution processes of the United States and the United Kingdom regarding cyber attacks that targeted them or their allies. Prior to discussing the cumulative experience of the collective attribution concept per se, and to illustrate the complete picture in this context, the first section of this Part reviews three international initiatives that the United States introduced to deter States and advance responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace in conjunction with holding States accountable by relying on the concept of collective attribution.\n## A. Collective Attribution Within International Initiatives\nDespite the legal obstacles and instrumental ambiguity noted above, the List of Non-Binding Norms remains the main international instrument to hold States accountable for wrongdoing that violates the voluntary norms of responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. This accountability is essential for establishing effective deterrence, while the attribution determination is a keystone for invoking accountability in any given incident.\nIn its updated National Cyber Strategy, the Trump Administration announced the launch of the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative to re\n2023), https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/huawei_china_claims/ (reporting on post of China’s Ministry of State Security on WeChat, in which the United States is accused of running cyber attacks and espionage for more than ten years against China, Russia, and forty-five other countries and regions, and of implanting backdoors in equipment and software and using American global technology brands to monitor and steal data).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ninforce efforts to deter States from violating the List of Non-Binding Norms through “official attribution,” “collective attribution,” a “naming and shaming” strategy, and through a “collective response” by jointly imposing sanctions against States accused of violating the List. Ultimately, no State has officially announced that it will join the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, not even the closest ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, although it promptly endorsed the pillars of the U.S. strategy. The International Cyber Deterrence Initiative has not evolved into an effective international initiative, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative or the International Counter Ransomware Initiative discussed below. In fact, the United States never officially launched the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, and senior U.S. officials have rarely referred to it.\nThe literature includes only one study that references the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, focusing solely on the collective response rather than the credible collective attribution that is implicitly a prerequisite to any collective response. Within this study, the scholar examined the policy embraced by each State party in the FVEY in building offensive cyber capabilities. The findings reveal that the FVEY States, excluding New Zealand, align with the approach of responding firmly to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Additionally, those States have developed the offensive cyber capabilities needed, among others, to uphold such a policy. The scholar concludes by suggesting that the FVEY and other like-minded allies enhance the credibility of their deterrent collective response\n. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12.\n.

It also calls on States to transparently impose costs under international law. The Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has only been invoked once since 2019. On February 21, 2020, fifteen out of the twenty-eight Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace partner States teamed up with Georgia and attributed responsibility to Russia for a disruptive cyber campaign conducted by the GRU. They politically denounced Russia and demanded it comply with the List of Non-Binding Norms.[115]\nTwo months later, on April 16, 2020, the Czech Republic's National Cyber and Information Security Agency warned of a real threat of serious cyber attacks against its healthcare sector amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The day after, the U.S. Secretary of State released a statement in which he mentioned the Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace framework and warned against conducting such dangerous cyber attacks or knowingly allowing them: \"Anyone that engages in such an action should expect consequences.\"[116] Eventually, the threat was not real\n114.

However, since the warning statements declined to identify the State allegedly behind the malicious plan, this cannot be labeled as a collective attribution. Moreover, neither the Czech nor the American authorities were transparent enough to convince observers that this was not a shot in the dark, but rather a successful preventive response to a credible and imminent threat.\nAs indicated above, neither the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative nor the Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has gained political significance. Unsurprisingly, the anticipation that States beyond the closest allies of the United States would align with American or British attribution statements and impose various costs—political, economic, and otherwise—proved unfounded. It appears that the United States has relinquished both initiatives and, together with its partners in the FVEY, has remained focused on the collective attribution endeavor, as detailed in the following section.\nHowever, beyond the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, in October 2021 the United States established an international initiative to counter the threat of ransomware cyber operations, which the Biden Administration has recently defined as a threat to U.S. national security. Although this International Counter Ransomware Initiative deals exclusively with criminally motivated ransomware cyber operations, it remains relevant in the context of the present discussion of collective attribution by States. This is because its primary goal is to uphold multinational cooperation to counteract ransomware threats and bolster both resiliency and deterrence. To achieve this, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative strengthens cooperation by facilitating the sharing of information and professional expertise among the participating States and private sector companies. More crucially for the focus of this article is its collaborative effort to detect and identify hackers or hacker groups involved in ransomware attacks, whether independently\n.

Similarly, the Initiative has not yet led to the attribution of responsibility to States that tolerate recurring cyber attacks initiated from their sovereign territories.\nRussia has already demonstrated that Russian ransomware gangs, such as REvil, may thrive or decline depending on the regime's willingness to cooperate.[121] Ultimately, increasing collaboration among the International Counter Ransomware Initiative States may encompass holding States accountable for ransomware cyber operations, even when initiated and directed from their sovereign territory, violating the due diligence principle. Apart from addressing the legal complexities associated with such accusations, the Initiative's parties may also seek to attribute responsibility and hold States accountable for what they have already defined as prohibited \"irresponsible behaviors.\"\nNonetheless, when upheld by a common multinational investigative team, the resulting attribution is collective and certainly more legitimate and credible.

An international law enforcement task force led by the UK's National Crime Agency and the FBI and consisting of eleven International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States (United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Netherlands, Finland, and Germany) successfully executed an international disruption campaign, taking control of the website and services (ransomware-as-a-service) of LockBit. This criminal hacking group is recognized as the world's most harmful cybercrime group. The outcomes of this operation included the seizure in three countries of LockBit's data exfiltration infrastructure by members of the task force. Two LockBit operatives were arrested in coordination with Europol. The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against two Russian citizens for conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks. The Department of Justice also announced that two defendants responsible for using LockBit to execute ransomware attacks were in custody and would face trial in the United States. The lessons learned from this experience could prove valuable for the United States and the United Kingdom in addressing the pitfalls of the current collective attribution process and response. This could serve as a test case demonstrating how successful cooperation between International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States can be in fighting criminally motivated, as well as politically motivated, cybercrime. Thus, the Initiative, in particular, may serve as an appropriate pilot for exploring optional solutions to better tackle the challenges associated with collective attributions and responses. More importantly, such solutions would enhance State accountability and the effectiveness of attributions in changing State behavior in cyberspace.\n## B. Table of Collective Attributions as of January 1, 2024\nThe number of collective attributions has been steadily increasing at a slow pace since the first on December 19, 2017. Thus far, the number has reached fourteen collective attributions. Each may refer to a single cyber attack or a campaign comprising a bulk of cyber activities that may even span over years.

Five Eyes' Key Role\nDespite being an intelligence alliance, the FVEY partners are not obligated to full transparency between their intelligence agencies. However, they do share intelligence at a level of confidentiality not extended to other allies. This alliance is the core of the collective attribution strategy, while the United States and the United Kingdom are its driving forces. They cooperate in investigating wide-scale cyber attacks by exchanging confidential information and mobilizing, separately or in conjunction, to assist victim\n. Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, *Significant Cyber Incidents*, https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents (last visited July 25, 2024) (timeline records significant cyber incidents since 2006); Congressional Research Service, *Cybersecurity: Selected Cyberattacks, 2012–2022* (updated Aug. 9, 2023), https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46974.\n. One indication reinforcing this assessment is taken from the recent Canadian attribution statement. Press Release, Glob. Affairs Canada, Statement on Russia’s Malicious Cyber Activity Affecting Europe and Ukraine (May 10, 2022), https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2022/05/statement-on-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-affecting-europe-and-ukraine.html (recalling each of the seven previous malicious cyber operations attributed to Russia. All are included in the table.). Another indication can be taken from the Press Release, UK Att’y Gen’s Off., Attorney General to Set Out the UK’s Position on Cybersecurity and International Law (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-to-set-out-the-uks-position-on-cybersecurity-and-international-law (this report enumerated examples of cyber attacks where the United Kingdom “named and shamed” State actors. All are included in the table.).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nStates upon their request, especially when their capability to investigate cyber attacks independently is poor or limited. Both the United States and the United Kingdom are responsible for all collective attributions listed in the table presented above, except one (Case 10), to be discussed below. The FVEY's attribution announcements are made concurrently and in coordination. However, they rely on sharing classified information, not on the findings of an independent FVEY multinational investigative team or any other form of international investigative mechanism. Like the decision to officially attribute State responsibility itself, endorsing an official attribution made by another State is a political prerogative for each sovereign State, which may announce it as its own official attribution. Such attribution determinations rely on various cumulative considerations, including the accuracy and credibility of evidence shared with all partners. While Canada has, thus far, actively participated in all collective attributions initiated by the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia refrained in three instances (Cases 6, 7, 13) and New Zealand in four (Cases 6, 7, 11, 13). Neither New Zealand nor Australia publicly justified their decision to refrain in each of these instances.\n## ii. EU and NATO Attributions or Partial Attribution Statements\nThe EU, representing twenty-seven European States, has had a notable practice of declarations in support of collective attributions. Thus far, it participated in eleven out of fourteen collective attributions, while NATO participated in six out of these same eleven attributions. However, the attribution statements on behalf of the EU and NATO could hardly be considered fully attributive. Instead, they may be perceived as a partial attribution of responsibility, making a limited contribution to the collective attribution strategy.\n. See, e.g., Cases 5, 13, supra Section IV(B) (providing examples in which the United Kingdom assisted the Georgian authorities in contending with and investigating the malicious cyber campaign); see Press Release, U.S. Embassy Tirana, Committed Partners in Cyberspace: U.S. Concludes First Defensive Hunt Operation in Albania (Mar. 23, 2023), https://al.usembassy.gov/committed-partners-in-cyberspace-u-s-concludes-first-defensive-hunt-operation-in-albania/.\n. At times, the dates on statements from Australia and New Zealand may not match those of other FVEY partners. However, the announcements are most likely published simultaneously with those of the FVEY partners, and at times the incompatibility of dates may be due to the different time zones.\nInternational Law Studies\n\n(a) The EU and NATO do not possess independent cyber investigative capabilities. Both rely heavily on more capable allies, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, EU and NATO member States, like Sweden, the Netherlands, Estonia, Austria, France, and Germany, each of which possess independent investigative capabilities, allegedly provide the EU security authorities with “deficient and incomplete” evidence in order to preserve the confidentiality of their cyber capabilities. To date, the EU has joined an official attribution initiated by one of its members only once (Case 10), and the attribution is highly questionable. NATO has never joined an attribution that was not initiated by the United States or the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that both States also face challenges in implementing a high degree of transparency with the EU security authorities due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of their intelligence sources. Nevertheless, the direct involvement of the United States and the United Kingdom in investigating cyber attacks appears to be a differentiating factor, possibly explaining why both, along with Canada and New Zealand, refrained from participating in the EU and Germany collective attribution (Case 10), while Australia settled for expressing solidarity.\n(b) The EU and NATO have joined collective attributions through brief declarations or statements issued on behalf of both Councils. The wording of these official declarations or statements must be cautious and measured to achieve unanimity within a truly brief period. Typically, they condemn the cyber attack in question, express concerns about it, and show solidarity with the affected States. The EU and NATO choose to avoid any explicit attribution of responsibility to the CRINK States. At the same time, the United States and the United Kingdom explicitly attribute responsibility primarily to specific official agents or organs of any State within the\n.

The EU and NATO refrain from attributing responsibility even to CRINK's official entities, such as intelligence agencies and national security institutions, which some of the U.S. or UK attribution determinations refer to in detail. In Case 9, for instance, the North Atlantic Council's statement acknowledges official statements made by its members—United States, United Kingdom, and Canada—attributing to China responsibility for compromising the Microsoft Exchange Server. The statement continues expressing solidarity with those who were affected, calling on \"all states, including China,\" to uphold their international commitments and \"act responsibly, including in cyberspace.\"131 Similarly, the EU's declaration refrains from explicitly attributing responsibility to China for malicious cyber activities, as opposed to the FVEY attribution statements.132 Instead, the EU \"strongly denounces\" these malicious cyber activities, urging China to comply with norms of responsible State behavior and prevent the use of its territory for such activities.133 The EU approach further differs from the FVEY by emphasizing adherence to the List of Non-Binding Norms, including due diligence, rather than strictly assigning State responsibility. However, challenges arise when applying due diligence to cyberspace, given uncertainties about its compatibility with the specific circumstances and the contested nature of its application in this\n131.

But see United States Joins with Allies, Including NATO, to Attribute Malicious Cyber Activities to China, 115 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 714, 715-21 (2021) (emphasizing coordination among the United States, NATO, and the EU, but overlooking the substantial discrepancies between the United States explicit attribution statement and the mitigated messages of the EU and North Atlantic Council statements).\n133.

Such statements may be more blatant and explicit than the EU's soft and general statements. An increased frequency of explicit independent statements, especially from cyber power States, aligning around the same conclusion in a specific cyber incident might impact the perceived legitimacy and credibility of the attribution determination in question. Nevertheless, such alignment is infrequent, contingent on the political cost-benefit calculation of each EU member State when deciding whether to act directly with full political responsibility through an official and independent statement.[135]\n# iii. Incoherency and Lack of Standardization\nThe collective FVEY attributions reviewed indicated incoherency, a lack of standardization, and an absence of transparent criteria, primarily in selecting which cyber operations the United States or the United Kingdom would lead the FVEY to collectively attribute. Likewise, there is uncertainty about the criteria guiding the EU and NATO in determining which attributions to publicly support, all while navigating possible political storms.[136] Questions persist regarding the degree of certainty justifying an attribution in the first place and how to measure that degree.[137] Further considerations involve the timing and format of coordinated announcements, whether through verbal statements by senior government officials (such as heads of states, relevant ministers, and senior officials from the U.S. National Security Council and their counterparts in other States), or by written statements of an authorized governmental agency or ministry, or both in concert.\n134.

See Cases 10, 11, supra Section IV(B).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nThe United States has been inconsistent in the way it has chosen to express its official attribution and synchronize it with its partners in the FVEY. At times, it settles for filing or unsealing indictments in absentia (e.g., Cases 4, 7) or for joining advisories (e.g., Case 6). Occasionally, the U.S. action of indicting and/or joining an advisory is in addition to an explicit official political announcement (e.g., Case 9). Conversely, the other \"Four Eyes\" always officially attribute responsibility through official announcements of senior officials, mostly by written statements of the relevant ministers.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of Case 10 as a collective attribution in the table is highly questionable. This marks the inaugural and sole instance where the EU independently initiated, on behalf of its member States, a statement, purported to collectively attribute responsibility.[138] It was primarily in response to Germany's official attribution and ostensibly at its request.[139] Ultimately, the declaration was more of an urgent general warning to Russia against interfering in European national democratic processes rather than a distinct attribution of responsibility for enduring wrongdoings.[140] However, to enable consensus among the twenty-seven EU member States, the statement's wording was softened and generalized, using \"some\" member States, instead of specifying the States, and \"associating\" the wrongdoing with them, instead of clearly \"attributing\" it to Russia.[141] Unsurprisingly, this declaration did not spur additional States to participate in this collective \"attribution,\" except Australia, which expressed its solidarity.[142] By stark contrast, the EU declaration in Case 14, which addresses the same threat of Russian interference in foreign States' democratic pro\n138.

Doubtful Credibility\nThere are only a small number of official attributions and an even smaller number of collective attributions that do not rely primarily on the American attribution process. The credibility and legitimacy deficiencies of the American attribution process, as highlighted in the previous Part—such as ambiguous normativity, limited transparency, and reliance on potentially biased American investigative teams instead of impartial multinational teams—persist unresolved in collective attributions. These issues may deter States from participating in explicit attributions as opposed to partial attributions. The cases reviewed indicate that States' willingness to participate in collective attributions based on the outcome of another State's national attribution process is limited, even if this system belongs to a cyber power State such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, the deterrence and effectiveness of such attributions also remain low.\nCase 11 requires a closer look as it raises serious doubts about the credibility of both the American and British attribution processes, and whether their outcomes are credible and persuasive enough to encourage a growing number of States to participate in such collective attributions. In this case, the Ukrainian Government suspected Russia just because it was then the only State interested in destabilizing Ukraine. Just forty-eight hours later, the United States and the United Kingdom provided the fastest attribution determination each of these allies had ever announced. It relied primarily on some technical information \"almost certainly\" linking the GRU to this cyber attack. Anne Neuberger, the White House's Deputy National Secu\n. Soesanto, supra note 141.\n.

Despite the United States sharing information with its allies for this swift attribution, only the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia joined this attribution while New Zealand and, more significantly, the EU, opted out. While the swift collective attribution may be linked to the looming possibility of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine set to commence in a few days, it does not necessarily justify what might be perceived by any impartial observer as taking shortcuts in the attribution process. This certainly does not enhance trust in the process; on the contrary, it raises concerns.\nThe absence of transparent standardization and criteria is crucial to maintain flexibility in reconciling two conflicting characteristics. On one hand, the List of Non-Binding Norms is non-enforceable due to legal ambiguities and difficulties that are not easily resolved in the contemporary geopolitical situation, as described above. On the other hand, there is the challenge of enhancing State compliance with the List to reduce global risks and instability. However, this flexibility is not necessarily an ad-\n147.

Shaping “Rules of the Road”\nAiming to bolster deterrence, the United States and the United Kingdom initiated the collective attribution process as a response to attacking States in cyberspace.[150] However, in the absence of normative clarity, attribution announcements refer to unacceptable and irresponsible State behavior, rather than specifying international rules or norms allegedly breached by the given cyber attack. Thus, the policy implemented usually involves delegitimization (\"naming and shaming\") and retorsions, lawful measures that can be imposed without the need for detailed legal justification. The objective is to shape \"rules of the road\" by specifying instances of unacceptable cyber activity on case-by-case bases and to develop State practice accordingly. This involves instilling among the entire community of nations the perspectives of collective attributors regarding which cyber operations may constitute irresponsible State behavior.[151] Such activities would be deemed irresponsible State behavior when conducted by official State agents or entities, as well as by hacking groups affiliated with these entities, operating under their instruction, direction, or control.[152] Although the List of Non-Binding Norms does not refer to economic or national security espionage, bilateral agreements and multinational commitments prohibit the theft of intellectual property (IP), trade secrets, and business information to gain competitive commercial advantages.[153] Such multinational commitments may be an additional source for shaping \"rules of the road\" in the commitments' context.\nThe cases reviewed can be categorized into subcategories representing types of irresponsible State behavior. Each subcategory has the potential to form specific prohibitions on certain types of conduct, akin to rules of the road. Below is a classification of the cases reviewed into four subcategories,\n150.

This is not a one-size-fits-all classification. Some cases can be classified under more than one subcategory (as exemplified below by Case 3).\n(a) Interfering with State democratic processes, primarily elections (Cases 3, 10, 14).\n(b) Endangerment of critical infrastructure and supply chain (Cases 3, 11, 12).\n(c) Interference in inherently governmental functions $^{154}$ (Cases 1, 2, 5, 7, 13).\n(d) Theft of IP and commercial secrets (economic espionage) $^{155}$ (Cases 4, 6, 8, 9).\nShaping rules of the road, case by case, could be more effective if the collective attributing States use each case as an opportunity to shape the applicable international rules in the given context. However, the United States and the United Kingdom have not yet taken any significant action in this direction. $^{156}$\nIn May 2022, the UK Attorney General addressed collective attribution and the ensuing response to the wrongdoing as important measures in shaping the international order in cyberspace. $^{157}$ She emphasized that\nThe law needs to be clear and well understood if it is to be part of a framework for governing international relations and to rein in irresponsible cyber behaviour.

Suella Braverman, UK Att'y Gen., International Law in Future Frontiers, Speech at Chatham House (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/international-law-in-future-frontiers.\n\nIn articulating this perspective using the norm of non-intervention, she recommends applying it to any State’s cyber activity that undermines another State’s ability to exercise control over matters that it is entitled to decide autonomously through the principle of State sovereignty. For additional clarity, she also suggests defining types of disruptive State cyber activities in various vulnerable sectors, such as energy security, essential medical care, economic stability, and democratic processes. Identifying a type of such cyber activity and examining it in its relevant context would determine whether it disrupts or denies another State’s ability to exercise its sovereign power to freely decide and act. If so, it would constitute a clear violation of the non-intervention norm, rendering it an unlawful activity. Since the UK Attorney General proposed this approach, the United States and the United Kingdom have jointly undertaken only two additional collective attributions (Cases 13, 14). However, instead of attributing unlawful cyber activities to Iran and Russia, the UK Foreign Secretary characterized Iranian actions as “reckless” and “unacceptable” and Russian actions as “completely unacceptable.” This aligns with the established practice of the FVEY, as evidenced in the cases reviewed. Nevertheless, adopting and implementing the British Attorney General’s integrated legal and political approach within the collective attribution strategy could potentially confer a more binding aspect to norms, such as the prohibitions on intervention and use of force, sovereignty of States, due diligence, and the boundaries of permitted espionage. This might create incentives for States, mindful of their reputation as responsible and law-abiding entities, to adhere to these norms as interpreted and applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, enforcing them through collective attribution and responses would be more consistent and coherent, thus, more effective in shaping State practice and international law.\n. Id.

Sanctions as a Collective Response\nAnother dimension of the legality of the attributed violation lies in the appropriate response. As mentioned earlier, both the FVEY and the EU confine their responses to retorsions, such as travel bans and asset freezing, undertaken against the entities and persons engaged in conducting the malicious cyber attacks in question. The expectation that a collective attribution would prompt retorsions from a high number of participating States, forming an effective collective deterrent response, has not materialized as of yet. Nevertheless, such a response has become a common practice of the United States and to a lesser extent, the EU and the FVEY.\nAt the level of the United States, sanctions are imposed with greater frequency against individuals and entities based on findings and charges detailed in joint advisories or unsealed indictments and law enforcement investigations. Despite the considerable number of sanctioned individuals and entities, many are government personnel and entities associated with the CRINK, and a significant number have also been indicted. While the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish but to bring about a positive change in behavior, this change has not materialized as of yet. At the level of the FVEY partners, the United Kingdom has regulated its own independent cyber related sanctions regime and occasionally imposed sanctions in coordination with the United States. Australia legislated a cyber sanctions law in December 2021. In January 2024, it implemented it for the first time against a Russian cybercriminal found responsible for the Medibank\n.

Moreover, the EU's process of imposing sanctions in response to cyber attacks is too slow and less effective; it may extend even beyond a year, as the decision must be unanimous and rely on evidence that can withstand judicial scrutiny. Thus far, the EU has sanctioned, under its cyber-related sanctions framework, only eight individuals and four entities affiliated with the CRINK, encompassing both asset freezes and travel bans. These sanctions were instituted in two phases, in July and October of 2020. As of now, no additional sanctions have been imposed through this channel, and there have been no challenges to review any of these sanctions before the European Court of Justice. Therefore, it seems that the EU cyber-sanction regime may have “already run its course,” as anticipated by some critics. Furthermore, a German research team, which analyzed the EU's collective response in Cases 1–4, questioned the effectiveness of such responses, doubting whether they “really have a deterrent effect on aggressors or are ultimately just symbolic politics.”\nDespite the above, this article does not purport to reach an unequivocal conclusion, based on sufficient credible information, regarding the effectiveness of the collective attribution and sanctions policy in achieving its primary objectives. These goals include deterring, disrupting, and demonstrating readiness to defend international norms and inducing a change in\n165. Media Release, Austl.

Ultimately, sanctions are not designed to punish but rather to motivate positive changes in State behavior. Given that the main outlaw States in cyberspace—Russia, Iran, and North Korea—are already subject to extensive multinational sanctions regimes for reasons unrelated to “irresponsible” malicious cyber operations, the impact of sanctions imposed as a response to malicious cyber activities is difficult to evaluate decisively. Nevertheless, the increasing frequency and scale of politically motivated cyber operations suggest that the deterring effect of collective attributions, along with retorsions, is weak. Due to the lack of authorized information regarding the outcomes of these sanctions and in the face of persistent politically motivated cyber attacks originating from the same culpable States and orchestrated by their governmental entities, it would not be inaccurate to argue that the effectiveness of this policy has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Meanwhile, it still has a symbolic, declarative impact needed to emphasize the red lines that States should not cross.\nIn conclusion, at present, collective attribution is no more than the upshot of the national attribution process, mostly American and British, with the addition of evidence sharing with like-minded States, in a manner that imposes no burden on the U.S. or UK intelligence community. The United States and the United Kingdom are always the driving force, while a CRINK State almost always stands on the receiving end. States and alliances participating in collective attributions, particularly the EU and FVEY, do not determine whether to join the attribution through direct involvement in investigative and attribution processes, but rather are influenced by political affiliations and international commitments within international frameworks, such as the G7, G20, and U.S.-EU or UK-EU dialogues. As a result, the collectiveness as implemented in the attribution process does not bolster the credibility of the American or British attribution determinations. This could notably change if the number of States committed to joining the attributions significantly increases, not due to political pressure or other political considerations, but rather due to an enhanced, joint, impartial, transparent, professional, and multinational process as the International Cyber Ransomware Initiative has recently demonstrated within its limited\n.

See Goldman, supra note 144.\nInternational Law Studies\n\n# V. CONCLUSION\nMore than a decade has passed since Leon Panetta first used the metaphor of the Pearl Harbor attack to depict how serious and risky a cyber attack could be, warning “potential aggressors . . . that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.” $^{174}$ Even graver and more precise warnings have been issued recurringly by U.S. presidents and senior officials in administrations since 2012. $^{175}$ President Biden, who during his first weeks in office had to handle a series of serious ransomware cyber operations originating in Russia that dealt a blow to U.S. public interests, announced: “I made it clear to President Putin . . . that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions—interfering with our elections . . .—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia . . .” $^{176}$ In the same speech, the President emphasized that only nations “working together and in common” can solve “the accelerating global challenges.” He added, “we [the United States] cannot do it alone.” That is easier said than done in the international arena. Despite technological developments that have improved attribution capabilities, the international community has not yet established a binding legal framework for cyberspace. Instead, the United States, along with the United Kingdom, has chosen to build upon a national official attribution system by imposing collective attribution and responses to the wrongdoing, aiming to concurrently achieve two goals: (1) to reinforce State deterrence through public collective attribution and imposing costs; and (2) shaping and internalizing “rules of the road” for responsible State behavior in cyberspace. $^{177}$\n173.

The United States, as the major attributor, assigns responsibility to specific States without allowing transparency regarding the evidence, the criteria of selecting the cases, and maintaining ambiguity about the legal grounds on which their charges rely. Furthermore, since the attribution determination in any given case is not subject to external and objective scrutiny, it is hard to indicate impartiality, legality, coherency, and consistency in the process, which collapses into one measure—attribution, accusation, judging, and punishing by retorsions. This is a far cry from satisfying any \"right\" or \"fair process.\" Thus far, the overwhelming majority of collective attributions have been American-led. The participants are American governmental experts, in cooperation mostly with American tech platforms whose loyalty to American national security interests is not questioned. There is no effort to involve independent, reputable international experts in the process, which is not sufficiently transparent and, on the face of things, may be perceived as one-sided. At most, the American process may constitute an exchange of views and intelligence sharing with counterpart agencies in the FVEY.\nClose and clandestine cooperation—among the FVEY—and sharing information with the EU's relevant institutions, as well as with a few like-minded States, is not enough to replace a proper procedure that would lend credibility and legitimacy to the process and its outcomes. The absence of representative, impartial multinational experts in the process exacerbates the legitimacy gap. This is even more true when the State at the receiving end of the attribution process is always a rival State from the CRINK group. Such dynamics erode the process' legitimacy and may discourage States from embracing its findings and joining the collective attributions, let alone responses. Moreover, it can explain the ineffectiveness of international initiatives, such as the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, and the negligible effectiveness of the collective attributions. This article pointed to one initiative, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which, in my opinion, has the potential to become more effective in countering ransomware and cooperating in law enforcement once the ransomware is detected or when credible intelligence can anticipate the details of the upcom\nsignal to Russia without any reference to specific international rules about the cost Russia might pay if it continues with its destabilizing actions).\n\nThis article presents the considerable cumulative experience gained from destructive and disruptive State or State-sponsored cyber attacks and their accompanying attribution processes. This, coupled with the growing number of States expressing their perspectives in enduring public debates regarding the terms and boundaries for applying major international norms to cyberspace,[179] illustrate the image of a wide-open field that must be fenced in by further development and regulation. In my opinion, there is fertile ground for a justified reevaluation of the collective attribution process and the responses to cyber wrongdoing. This is critical to bolster the credibility, legitimacy, and subsequently the effectiveness of these collective attributions in shaping the rules of road and enhancing State accountability.\n178.

Germany supported this attribution and added the Bundestag hack as another cyber attack attributed to GRU operatives.\nOn October 4, 2018, the Dutch and UK Prime Ministers made a joint statement attributing to the GRU responsibility for attempting to access the secure computer systems of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague. The statement explicitly connected this GRU cyber operation to other reckless cyber operations revealed on the same day.\nAlso on this day, the EU published a joint statement by the presidents of the Council of Europe and the European Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The statement was limited to the attack on the OPCW, with a general reference to the British accusations about further unacceptable cyber activities.\nThe United States indicted and sanctioned officers of the GRU for being involved in those cyber attacks. In July 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against four GRU officers who attempted a cyber attack against the OPCW. In October 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against the GRU’s Unit 26165 and two GRU officers who participated in the Bundestag Hack in 2015.\n.

It is highly likely that the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) ran this campaign through a hacker group known as the APT10, which was almost certainly responsible for a campaign of activity against global Managed Service Providers (MSPs) since at least 2016, widely known as Cloud Hopper.\nOn December 20, 2018, the United Kingdom officially attributed responsibility for this campaign to China's MSS. The U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously indicted and imposed personal sanctions on two Chinese hackers allegedly part of APT10 and involved in this cyber campaign. The following day, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada published official attribution statements with similar content. Japan and Germany joined these attribution determinations.\nAfter a four-month delay, the EU published a declaration focusing on APT10 malicious cyber activities, including IP theft, while avoiding explicit attribution to the Chinese Government.\n.

While the United Kingdom officially announced its attribution determination,[201] the U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously unsealed an indictment charging Russians involved in the cyber attacks in 2018.[202] Although the aim was to call out Russia and pressure it to cancel its plans to disrupt the upcoming Olympic Games, the United Kingdom\n199.

The SolarWinds Cyber Espionage (exposed in November 2020)\nOn April 15, 2021, the United States, joined by the United Kingdom, accused Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) operatives of conducting the SolarWinds cyber espionage operation, gaining access to tens of thousands of entities, including governmental, in the United States and worldwide. The other three State parties of the FVEY joined the collective attribution, whereas the EU statement expressed solidarity with the United States concerning the impact of malicious cyber activities, notably the SolarWinds hack, which, “the United States assesses,” was conducted by Russia. Similarly, the North Atlantic Council’s statement also expressed solidarity with the United States based on its assessments regarding Russia’s responsibility for the SolarWinds hack and called on Russia to comply with its international obligations.\n203.

The EU statement did not assign direct responsibility to China but emphasized that the malicious cyber activities were undertaken from China's territory, urging it to prevent such activities. The North Atlantic Council's statement \"acknowledges\" the statements made by the FVEY member States and expresses \"solidarity\" with those who were affected, calling on all States, \"including China,\" to uphold their international commitments.\n10. Interference in European States' Democratic Processes (September 2021)\nOn September 24, 2021, shortly before the German elections, the EU High Representative denounced Russia for trying to interfere in European democratic processes by accessing computer systems and personal accounts in the EU member States and stealing data. The official statement relied on \"some EU member states\" that have observed malicious cyber activities, \"collectively designated as Ghostwriter and associated these with the Russian state.\" The statement asserts that such activities contradict the List of Non-Binding Norms, calling to immediately cease them and urging Russia to adhere to the List. It is the first and only case in which the EU independently initiated a statement that purported to express a collective attribution.\n209.

DDoS Attack Against Ukraine (February 15–16, 2022)\nA week prior to the Russian invasion, an unprecedented DDoS attack crashed Ukrainian banks and government websites. Although the head of the Cybersecurity Department of Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it was too early to identify specific perpetrators, Ukraine pointed the finger at Russia as the only country interested in destabilizing Ukraine.[213] Forty-eight hours later, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia collectively blamed Russia for conducting the operation through its GRU. This collective attribution is exceptional primarily for one reason: It is the fastest political decision made to date officially attributing State responsibility.\n# 12. Blocking the KA-SAT Network (February 16, 2022)\nOn May 10, 2022, the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre assessed that Russia's GRU was almost certainly responsible for the cyber attack against ViaSat, a multinational communications provider, one hour prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This cyber attack, which is believed to have targeted the KA-SAT network to disrupt or cut off Ukraine's military communication, spilled over to civilian customers in Ukraine and across Europe, making tens of thousands of terminals inoperable in a manner that was irreversible. Based on these findings and new intelligence, the United Kingdom[214] and the United States,[215] joined by their partners in the FVEY[216] and the EU,[217] collectively attributed responsibility\n213.

Cyber Attacks Targeting Albanian Governmental Websites (July 15, 2022)\nOn September 7, 2022, Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran. The reason for such a serious response was a major cyber-campaign conducted against it nearly two months earlier. This campaign targeted significant Albanian government websites, including websites for providing essential public services and websites of the Albanian Parliament and Prime Minister's office.[218] Consequently, essential websites were shut down, and governmental data, including sensitive emails, were leaked. Although Albania is a NATO member State, it has not applied to activate Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Albania is not a cyber-power State. Therefore, it appealed to the United States, United Kingdom, and other capable States to investigate these cyber attacks and assist in ensuring resiliency. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have attributed State responsibility to Iran, while the EU and NATO have not deviated from their cautious path, avoiding explicit attribution statements.[219]\nIn September 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security and its Minister of Intelligence as engaging in cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies.[220]\n14.

Such malicious Russian activity has been conducted in the United Kingdom and other like-minded States at least since 2015. Simultaneously and in coordination, the relevant ministries in each of the other four partners to the FVEY published statements of support. In addition, and also simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against two Russian operatives allegedly subordinate to the FSB Center 18 for targeting current and former U.S. federal employees from 2016 to 2022, and UK government officials, think tank researchers, and journalists in the United Kingdom.

These disparities, coupled with the policy of silence or ambiguity that major power States embrace and implement regarding disputed legal issues, have resulted in a normative ambiguity. This ambiguity provides major powers with enough leeway to strive for “cyberspace superiority”⁵ while ostensibly maintaining their reputation as law-abiding nations. On the other side of the fence, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea (CRINK) have exploited this ambiguity and the technical characteristics of cyberspace for advancing their interests. Under such circumstances, the List of Non-Binding Norms’s effectiveness in changing State behavior and the level of State compliance are low. Moreover, the norms’ effectiveness and State compliance are influenced by the extent to which the norms and the process of application are perceived as legitimate, as well as the degree to which the outcomes align with the expectations derived from these norms and processes.⁶ ⁴.

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 Against the backdrop of this normative ambiguity and inherent legal uncertainty, the process of attributing State responsibility stands as an essential and exclusive measure to hold specific States accountable for violating the norms of the List. To gauge the extent to which the United States has developed its attribution policy in the past decade, it is worth revisiting Secretary Panetta's 2012 remarks.⁷ In response to two consecutive destructive cyber attacks, he hinted at the improving technological capabilities to address the attribution problem by identifying cyber attackers and attributing responsibility.⁸ Therefore, “potential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions that may try to harm America.”⁹ However, it is important to note that neither the United States nor the direct victim States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, officially attributed responsibility for these cyber attacks to Iran, even though its responsibility has been widely accepted. In fact, my previous published research on State practice in cyberspace between 2012 and 2018, co-authored with Yuval Shany, revealed that explicit official attributions were the exception during that period.¹⁰ Nonetheless, the last two attribution determinations addressed in that study indicated a shift from national official attributions toward collective attributions.¹¹ Indeed, the collective activity of nations in attributing responsibility to States for irresponsible behavior in cyberspace and in responding to such behavior has become a vital component of the deterrence pillar within the U.S. National Cyber Strategy. The United Kingdom, the closest ally to the United States, has endorsed this strategy.¹²",

For the purposes of this article, “official attribution” refers to any public, verbal or non-verbal, statement made by a senior official of a State authorized to formally attribute responsibility for a given cyber attack to another State. Heads of State, ministries of foreign affairs, and other ministries whose mandate includes cybersecurity naturally hold such authority. As such, official attributions must be both public and political. Therefore, in this research, indictments filed or unsealed by the U.S. Department of Justice, personal sanctions imposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury, advisory alerts issued by the U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, and other reports from national law enforcement agencies, cannot on their own constitute an official attribution of responsibility to a State. However, they can certainly provide grounds for the United States and other States to attribute responsibility officially and explicitly to another State. Subsequently, the term “collective attribution” refers to a State’s official attribution joined by at least one other nation’s official attribution. Alternately, it shall apply if the State’s official attribution announcement is accompanied simultaneously and in coordination with another State officially announcing a response to the same cyber operation through indictments, sanctions, or joint advisories. This article evaluates whether the collective attribution process and its outcomes can be perceived as legitimate and credible by the international community, including impartial, nonaligned States. Furthermore, it evaluates whether this process has become a crucial component in effectively holding States accountable for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms and in deterring States from such violations. Analyzing these and related issues requires a sound understanding of the official attribution process in practice, focusing on identifying legitimacy and credibility disparities, and researching the collective attributions announced so far. The article is built exclusively upon open-source intelligence. The article continues as follows. Part II describes the official attribution process, differentiating between technological, legal, and political attributions and discussing the reluctance of States to officially attribute re es/deterrence-in-the-cyber-age-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary (presenting the United Kingdom’s deterrence strategy, mirroring the U.S. approach). 274 Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 sponsibility. Part III explores major aspects of the American attribution process, the most influential one, excluding the internal division of labor among the U.S. national security and law enforcement entities. It includes five sections that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could affect the extent to which the process's outcomes would be perceived as credible and legitimate. The first is the instrumental ambiguity the United States has embraced in the absence of a binding international convention, which has an adverse effect on transparency and source-based legitimacy. The subsequent three sections—intelligence-based attribution, attribution by indictment, and the private sector's role in ensuring cyber security—are important for mitigating the challenge of transparency but are still insufficient to ensure credibility and legitimacy. The fifth section explores collaboration between the private sector, particularly American corporations, including the most powerful tech platforms globally, and U.S. national security entities responsible for the American attribution process. This all-American collaboration may raise serious concerns among non-American constituencies about the credibility and legitimacy of the U.S. attribution process and its outcomes. Part IV delves into the specific collective attributions starting with three international initiatives. Two of these, initially planned to catalyze and empower collective attributions, have already faded, while the third initiative holds potential as part of a solution. Section IV(B) is a table that succinctly presents fourteen cases of collective attribution, spanning from the first collective attribution on December 19, 2017, until January 1, 2024. A detailed overview of these fourteen cases appears as an annex at the end of this article. Section IV(C) analyzes the findings. Part V concludes. ## II.

International Law Studies 2024 sidered this task almost unattainable, verging on a mission impossible.¹⁴ Cyber technical features that allow full anonymity and transboundary connectivity make it exceedingly difficult to promptly detect and identify with complete certainty who is responsible for disruptive or destructive cyber operations, as opposed to comparable operations in the physical domain. Any savvy hacker, let alone a government or State-sponsored one, is capable of manipulatively concealing their identity and astutely misdirecting would-be trackers. Nonetheless, today, the prevalent view has changed; while still challenging and occasionally time-consuming, it has become more feasible to uncover the true facts. Advanced cyber forensic investigative capabilities, which cyber power States and powerful cyber security firms possess, may enable them to unmask authentic technical features of a cyber attack, including the computers involved in the operation and their geographic locations. They may even identify the hacker or group of hackers according to their authentic technological fingerprints, precluding manipulative attempts to deceive and mislead the investigators. Such technical findings may lead to a technical attribution,¹⁵ which mostly lacks credible responses to the following questions: Who, in fact, stands behind the hackers who conducted the given cyber attack? What are the real motives? Was a State involved, and to what extent?¹⁶ Completing the missing pieces of the puzzle by gathering evidence from all-source intelligence may fill the probability gaps, enabling States to officially attribute responsibility to another State for unlawful cyber operations targeting other States. Nevertheless, this task remains easier said than done, particularly considering the challenges associated with legally attributing State responsibility, which I will address in a subsequent article.",

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 Every victim State thoroughly analyzes the information collected from all sources, including from cyber power State allies and cyber security and tech firms, to conclude whether the information is well-established and sufficient for a definite attribution. Even if the information includes enough evidence for attribution, the victim State's political leadership must weigh a wide range of strategic considerations and then determine whether to officially attribute responsibility; what level of transparency to implement; whether to retaliate, and if so, how, covertly or overtly; and which type of response would be perceived as lawful or legitimate in the given circumstances? A State might avoid an official attribution to preclude risks and actions that do not coincide with its national security interests, such as jeopardizing intelligence sources, disclosing intelligence gaps that the victim State may have pertaining to its rivals' cyber capabilities, exposing the victim State's confidential cyber capabilities, and averting the significant risk of misattribution, which could lead policymakers to wrongly engage in retribution and escalation. Furthermore, by refraining from public attribution, the victim State eliminates public pressure for retaliation and may lead the culprit State to believe it has not been detected. This strategy could allow the victim State to covertly monitor the operation and gather valuable intelligence about its rival's cyber capabilities. Additionally, it could facilitate the detection of additional covert operations employing the same cyber techniques while also considering disinformation or deception operations.[17] Moreover, powers that still obscure their political and legal approaches to pending cyber legal questions—such as the boundaries of legitimate \"cyber espionage,\" the clear threshold for constituting a prohibited \"use of force\" and a prohibited intervention, and how \"territorial sovereignty\" should be applied in cyberspace—might hesitate to officially attribute responsibility in specific circumstances. This is because such attribution could reduce the legal ambiguity these States have embraced to preserve their technological edge and maintain strategic leeway. Therefore, attribution is primarily a political decision relying on prudent and thorough discretion on whether to officially attribute responsibil-",

The attribution determination is not necessarily contingent on legal proceedings. $^{18}$ The reasonableness of such an ex ante attribution must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and under no binding requirements of transparency and standard of proof. $^{19}$ Thus, it is no more than a public political denunciation, especially when not accompanied by legal claims and countermeasures. Although the attribution may rely on technical findings and additional evidence from any other source of information, it does not necessarily have to withstand the legal scrutiny that a formal legal attribution of State responsibility might face. As noted above, the difficulties of legally attributing State responsibility will be addressed in a subsequent article. For the purposes of the present article, it is worth noting the following: pursuant to the rules of State responsibility, a State harmed by a malicious cyber operation that is willing to officially attribute responsibility to an attacking State and has a legal justification for a lawful response, must meet two cumulative requirements.[20] The first is to indicate a breach of an international rule that binds States under circumstances like those of the cyber incident in question. This might be controversial as long as international cyber law remains in its embryonic stage and the extent and conditions under which customary rules of international law would apply to cyberspace as binding law continue to be open-ended. The second requirement is to identify a perpetrator suspected of breaching the international rule and substantiate their connection—either as an official agent or as a proxy—to a specific State. Thus far, none of the attributing States have faced demands to legally prove their attribution statement within the framework of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Due to cyberspace's unique characteristics and legal ambiguity, the legal demands for substantiating State responsibility in cyberspace are uncertain, making it more difficult to legally attribute such responsibility.[21] While legally attributing State responsibility for international",

This is despite the fact that official attribution is a political act, ostensibly exempt from meeting legal requirements, such as transparent and admissible evidence. To date, this process has never been applied in court with respect to cyber incidents. # A. Reluctance of States to Officially Attribute Responsibility During recent decades, States have conducted hundreds or thousands of disruptive and destructive cyber attacks either through their official organs and agents or through proxies. Only in a tiny fraction of cases did States officially attribute responsibility to other States based on technical and all-source intelligence. At times, these official attributions also relied on private sector contributions through confidential or nonconfidential reports of relevant companies. At least until the second half of 2017, victim States would refrain from officially attributing responsibility to another State unless they were amid an armed conflict, during which they often blamed OF INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION (Cesare P.R.

In fact, until 2017 the United States was the only State that had officially attributed responsibility to another State for executing a specific cyber attack in peacetime. The United States did so only twice, both in rare circumstances: attribution to North Korea for executing the Sony Pictures hack (December 2014), and attribution to Russia for conducting the Democratic National Committee hack and additional cyber operations meddling in the American election campaign (2016).²⁶ Another well-known damaging cyber attack, the Ababil operation (distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against New York's financial sector in 2011–2013), was investigated and, three years later, resulted in indicting in absentia foreign operatives who were Iranian government agents.²⁷ The detailed indictment, on the face of things, could be sufficient for officially attributing responsibility to the Iranian regime. However, the U.S. Administration declined to follow this path, likely due to political and national security considerations.

One possible explanation might have been the relentless Russian attempts to meddle in the tense September 26, 2021, German elections and the urgent need to stop those attempts. The second, and so far, the last, exceptional official attribution reinforced this estimation. On September 5, 2021, Germany officially attributed to Russia responsibility for cyber attacks conducted by a cyber group dubbed Ghostwriter, even though the evidence was not “hard” but “reliable information” that established “suspicions” against the GRU.³⁶ This triggered an official diplomatic protest and an investigation, yet no one waited for its final findings due to the short time left (three weeks) until the elections. It is noteworthy that this was the first report of a State officially holding another State accountable for a cyber attack and responding with an official diplomatic protest, relying on information that merely met the level of “suspicions.” Apparently, this sort of cutting corners or lowering the bar of evidence stemmed from the urgent need to stop or deter Russia from interfering with the quickly approaching German elections race.

Unlike authoritarian regimes, these States have embraced the courses of action described in the following sections to contend with the demand for transparency while striving to achieve the best result for their own national security interests. # A. An Instrumental Ambiguity Cyberspace's unique technological attributes produce opportunities for cyber power States to surreptitiously generate significant strategic gains through covert cyber operations, thereby minimizing the risk of being held accountable for breaching the law and harming their reputation as law abiding States. On the one hand, States strive to evade legal responsibility by distancing themselves from any factual or legal linkage to the malicious cyber operations in question. On the other hand, national security interests dictate the non-disclosure of classified information for both victim and attacking States. However, such data could help them substantiate arguments to strengthen or dismiss relevant accusations. As mentioned above, States, particularly the leading powers involved in the Great Power Competition, have embraced instrumental ambiguity, including maintaining silence on questions related to the interpretation and application of recognized principles and rules of customary international law in cyberspace. The primary motive behind this policy is to retain a sufficient margin of maneuver to enable the protection and promotion of strategic national interests in the rapidly evolving cybersphere. This policy of ambiguity inherently leads to accountability gaps that the most influential cyber power States, like the United States, are reluctant to resolve. Nevertheless, it is crucial for these States to play a decisive role in shaping international cyber law in a manner and at a time that aligns best with their national security interests. Unsurprisingly, they seek to avoid situations requiring an independent, international, judicial forum, such as the International Court of Justice, to resolve legal ambiguities surrounding State conduct in cyberspace. Notwithstanding the growing number of States that have clarified, albeit partially and cautiously, their views about a limited number of legal questions, the policy of ambiguity still prevails. The policy influences policymakers when considering whether to officially attribute responsibility and Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 when considering how transparent to be regarding relevant evidence and legal arguments.³⁹ Official attribution regarding cyber incidents in itself does not eliminate the need for transparency. This requirement is inherent in the legal obligation to substantiate State responsibility in both non-cyber and cyber incidents.⁴⁰ Transparency is essential to legitimize the official attribution by reflecting its “right process” through its process-based and outcome-based legitimacy.⁴¹ In the absence of accessible international judicial or quasi-judicial forums, as well as an impartial international monitoring institution, conflicting States might seek to influence the final “judgment” of the “international court of legitimacy.” This type of influence often involves legitimizing one side while delegitimizing the other. To achieve this, States should enhance transparency regarding their findings and, more importantly, with respect to processes and procedures undertaken. This includes ensuring that they align with Thomas Franck’s concept of the “right process.”⁴² The degree to which this transparency is genuine and comprehensive serves to strengthen their arguments in attributing responsibility or denying it, respectively. Relying solely on the investigative role of the United States or the United Kingdom, coupled with limited transparency and unwillingness to disclose persuasive evidence, opens the door to plausible deniability. Excluding independent, objective, and multinational experts, as well as representatives from other States, from participating in the attribution process also provides grounds for criticizing the integrity of the process. The absence of these persons may raise concerns about the process being flawed, unfounded, politically biased, and non-transparent, thus, not credible or legit- ³⁹.

These concerns are particularly significant given the common reality of blanket denials by accused States. Should a State that officially attributes State responsibility for wrongful acts in cyberspace evade disclosure of the evidence and confidential information upon which the attribution and, if undertaken, retribution rely? The first to address this question, in November 2016, was Brian Egan, U.S. State Department Legal Advisor, who noted that States are not required to act with full transparency when attributing responsibility to another State.43 Since then, a growing number of States have embraced a legal stance that denies the obligation to reveal classified evidence prior to attribution or countermeasures, making the extent of disclosure a matter of policy that often involves complex considerations.44 Striking a balance between accountability, diplomatic relations, and, most importantly, national security, including the strategic interest of maintaining instrumental ambiguity, remains a significant challenge in the evolving landscape of cyberspace governance. Yet simply prioritizing national security interests to the extent of excluding transparency may erode trust in the attribution statement. Nevertheless, powers like the United States and the United Kingdom, which possess advanced cyber capabilities and robust intelligence, do not hesitate to base their attribution claims solely on their intelligence assessment system, thereby preserving confidentiality and national security interests. ## B. Intelligence-Based Attribution The term \"intelligence assessment\" usually does not imply absolute certainty nor admissibility in court but rather the degree of certainty and credibility with which a certain factual narrative should be perceived, using the qualifiers of the national intelligence community about high, moderate, or low likelihood/certainty of the narrative as described in the attribution statement.45 The degree of certainty obviously depends on the level of trust in the information collected and the extent to which it is considered reliable and credible. The more reliable and credible, the higher the degree of cer",

Up to this point, the United States and the United Kingdom have adhered to this official format of attribution, responding publicly with measures such as diplomatic démarche and sanctions when attributions were based on an intelligence assessment of high certainty and the interest of national security allowed a limited transparency to withstand an appropriate judicial or administrative review. By endorsing this practice, both States have averted compromising sensitive intelligence to justify their official attribution and retorsion, which is a response within the prerogative of any State. Even if the attribution of State responsibility proves to be mistaken, the response undertaken remains lawful, albeit unfriendly, and is often reciprocally retaliated. Nevertheless, covert cyber operations remain a viable response, either alongside or instead of retorsions. However, if exposed, their legality would inevitably be challenged. Critics of intelligence assessment as major grounds for attribution argue that it relies on criteria that \"may at best amount to circumstantial evidence,\" far below the evidentiary standards used in courts.[46] This allows States to manipulate cases to fit preconceived narratives and embody political agendas; it may lead to misleading results involving the misinterpretation of information influenced by what later turns out to be a false conception.[47] None of the official American attributions since 2014, nor any of the collective attributions that the United States and the United Kingdom have announced since 2017, have corroborated this criticism. Both States have officially attributed responsibility relying on their intelligence and a high degree of certainty (\"almost certainly\"). Some of these attributions have also referred to open-source investigative reports and technological findings of tech and cyber security companies, mostly American, as discussed below. Others were also followed, months or even years later, by detailed American indictments delivering the message that they rely on sufficient and admissible evidence. However, only a limited number of States have been sufficiently convinced or politically motivated to officially adopt and join these attribution statements. Even these States did not do so because they truly participated in the attribution process itself or obtained access to",

The “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance (“FVEY”)—United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—is exceptional. However, the United States shares its classified intelligence with its partners in this alliance and occasionally extends this practice to additional allied States such as France, Germany, and Japan. Nevertheless, the investigation team determining the attribution remains exclusively American. The limited number of participating States might also indicate that those States, which the United States and the United Kingdom interchangeably have not allowed to participate in the process or share classified information, are hesitant to blindly trust American or British intelligence assessments. Considering that the United States is the driving force behind these attributions and that its rivals, such as the CRINK States, are consistently on the receiving end underscores the importance of challenging the credibility of the process and its outcomes. Concurrently with intelligence-based attribution, the United States has endorsed, on its own, another method to mitigate the demand for transparency. This is attribution by indictment (\"naming and shaming\"). The next section will demonstrate that, despite its relative transparency, attribution by indictment has not proven a benchmark for credibility and trust. ## C. Attribution by Indictment Until now, the United States stands as the first and only State to “name and shame” by indicting, in absentia, foreign State-sponsored hackers, mostly citizens of the CRINK. They have been accused of breaching the U.S. Code by committing cybercrimes against Americans and U.S. entities. These indictments provide an opportunity to describe their worldwide malicious cyber activity. They include declassified information about unlawful cyber activities, shedding light on relevant State responsibility. This responsibility stems from the fact that, while committing the unlawful activities, the defendants were either State agents (such as soldiers, officers, or other government officials) or third parties under the State’s control, direction, instruction, or empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority.⁴⁸ However, indicting unlawful combatants, such as spies captured during peacetime or armed conflict while conducting their mission in the territory ⁴⁸. Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 20, arts. 4–5, 8. Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 of the accusing State, is unexceptional and reflects customary international law.⁴⁹ Nevertheless, indicting, in absentia, defendants identified as official agents of a foreign State for remotely hacking and damaging, during peacetime, targets located in the territory of the accusing State is both exceptional and unprecedented.⁵⁰ This could be acceptable if the hacks were criminally motivated and could not be attributed to a specific State, according to the Articles on State Responsibility. The U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, admitted that “traditional military and intelligence activity is a separate sphere of conduct that ought not be subject to domestic criminal law,” with the recognized exception noted above of charging intelligence officers operating undercover in the United States.⁵¹ Barr introduced new and unprecedented exceptions such as State-sponsored computer intrusions “for the purpose of intellectual property theft for the use of [the Chinese] private sector, bank robbery, and interfering with our democratic elections” and “deliberate, indiscriminate theft of vast amounts of sensitive personal data of civilians,”⁵² as occurred in the case of hacking Equifax. In Barr’s words, such cases “cannot be countenanced.”⁵³ In fact, such cases have led to the submission of indictments in deviation from the customary principles of international law and the recognized principle of criminal responsibility. One scholar labeled this a “judicialized attribution,” a new tool to convey more concrete and less political attribution focusing on the evidence and lawfulness of the behavior according to domestic law rather than international law.⁵⁴ This is despite the fact that both the superiors and subordinates who followed their orders purportedly committed the attributed crimes remotely from",

While both superiors and subordinates are official agents of rival States and out of reach for American law enforcement authorities, indicting only the subordinates in absentia is legally contested. Unsurprisingly, such a practice has not been adopted by other States. Furthermore, invoking this policy of indictments requires proceeding in front of a federal grand jury to investigate and decide whether and on what charges to indict. This process is expected to be unbiased, reinforcing the indictment's credibility. However, the jury operates behind closed doors, hearing the federal prosecutor and live testimonies of relevant witnesses, mostly federal investigators, and American cyber security and technology experts. In fact, the process is controlled and guided by the federal prosecutor of the case rather than a judge. Moreover, the indictments may also rely on evidence from American tech and cybersecurity companies, which, as explored below, closely collaborate with local governmental authorities. The national loyalty of these companies is often taken for granted.55 While this perception may not be entirely accurate, it is sufficient to undermine the trust in the impartiality and credibility of the American attribution process by significant portions of the international community, particularly populations and governments in the Global South. Moreover, Article 28(f) of the 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report approved by the UN General Assembly asserts that \"the accusation of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against states should be substantiated.\"56 The question of whether the American and British practice in this regard meets this requirement is still contested.

Thus, when indictments accompany official attributions, they are expected to bolster the attributions' \"overall credibility.\"60 The target audiences for the indictments are particularly like-minded and neutral governments that are expected to be aware of the credibility of the American criminal proceedings. Consequently, they are likely to perceive this implicit attribution of responsibility through such indictments as credible enough to draw lessons. Subsequently, they may consider whether and to what extent these lessons should affect their own policy, particularly regarding the \"irresponsible behavior\" of a State and its respective risks in cyberspace. Thus far, the United States has not succeeded in prompting even a single State, not even its closest ally, the United Kingdom, to follow it in implementing this \"naming and shaming\" strategy. Unsurprisingly, this American strategy has not deterred the CRINK States. As the FBI's Deputy Director put it when announcing another indictment: \"Time and again, Russia has made it clear: They will not abide by accepted norms, and instead, they intend to continue their destructive, destabilizing cyber behavior.\"61 Additionally, U.S. federal indictments, even when accompanied by collective attributions, have not significantly increased the number of States joining the collective attribution.62 This, coupled with the growing number of CRINK-sponsored cyber attacks, raises significant doubts about the extent to which this strategy is indeed effective. The responses to these doubts vary widely.

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 assist the U.S. efforts in constructing the desired international norms for cyberspace.⁶⁴ For the purposes of this article, it suffices to note that by unsealing indictments in absentia, the United States strives to have it all. On the one hand, it purportedly maintains credible evidence and a reasonable degree of transparency through detailed charges sufficient for imposing ex parte administrative personal sanctions against unreachable foreign defendants. On the other hand, none of these defendants are likely to extradite themselves to challenge the legal and administrative proceedings, including the credibility of the evidence. The U.S. Assistant Attorney General described the indictments as “just a piece of the puzzle,” representing a critical, credible step towards imposing meaningful consequences, adding that it is part of building consensus inside and outside the United States about responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace.⁶⁵ In conclusion, the benefit of attribution through indictment may be associated with three possible objectives: using the prestige of the American justice proceedings along with a degree of transparency to reinforce the attribution’s credibility through the lens of other impartial States; deterring States from launching similar attacks and damaging their reputation as law-abiding States; and building a broad international consensus to compel States to adhere to norms of responsible State behavior, such as the prohibition on conducting cyber attacks against critical infrastructure facilities. Nevertheless, the experience of recent years has not indicated any remarkable success in accomplishing all these objectives, at least not enhancing the credibility of the attributions through such indirect measures, nor significantly increasing the number of States joining the collective attributions ⁶⁴.

However, neither provides transparent evidence that could withstand external and impartial scrutiny, subsequently substantiating the attribution determinations and ensuring their credibility. The next section delves into the significant role played by the private sector, particularly in the United States, illustrating how private sector collaboration with the U.S. Government may enhance the level of transparency in determining and announcing official attributions. However, concurrently, it may raise concerns about the legitimacy and credibility of such attributions. ## D. The Role of the Private Sector The private sector, through its major tech and cyber security firms, plays a key role in the attribution process, as it possesses significant tech capabilities for detecting and investigating cyber incidents. Western companies, mostly American, such as Meta (Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram), Microsoft (Windows, Azure), Amazon (Amazon Web Services), Alphabet (Google, YouTube), X (previously Twitter), Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Verizon, dominate cyberspace in both software and hardware, encompassing global social media, big data, cloud services, artificial intelligence, computer operating systems, and search engines. Each of these realms is a playground where any vulnerability exposed by third parties could be exploited, posing serious threats to the company's reputation and business success. Thus, these companies invest vast resources to consistently lead in technology, developing cutting-edge capabilities to detect, investigate, and thwart any threat, regardless of its motives through in-house cyber threat intelligence teams. Moreover, global tech platforms, in particular, have achieved worldwide dominance and maintain a formidable presence in cyberspace, a level of control that State cyber powers, including a cyber superpower like the United States, struggle to maintain.⁶⁷ Additional- ⁶⁶.

Typically, such aid would involve collaboration with domestic or global cyber security and tech companies that have become major players in the field of cyber threat intelligence, holding capabilities that may even exceed those of government intelligence agencies.⁶⁹ These capabilities are crucial for gathering, processing, and analyzing technological findings to promptly establish situational awareness for the State's decision-makers.⁷⁰ Multiple firms have already engaged in such activities and provided their client States, and sometimes the public, with relatively prompt and detailed technical reports. These reports may include clear-cut technical evidence to detect and distinctly identify the perpetrators. However, technical attribution alone is not always sufficient for attributing responsibility with a full or high level of certainty. As these companies); see also Elena Chachko, National Security by Platform, 25 STANFORD TECHNOLOGY LAW REVIEW 55 (2021).

International Law Studies 2024 noted above, the decision whether to name the culprit State and officially attribute responsibility is purely political, and concerned vendor firms tend to comply with this.71 Experience thus far indicates that when tech and cyber security companies detect anomalies and even malicious cyber operations through their routine preventive and researching cyber security activities, rather than as a part of a service ordered by the victim State, they generally avoid involvement in what might be inter-State conflicts. Unless biased (as discussed in the following section), they tend to classify the hostile cyber operation as sophisticated, suggesting potential execution by either an anonymous cyber power State or hackers sponsored by such a State.72 Technical attributions are usually faster, more detailed, and more transparent than official attributions, which are, to a greater extent restricted by confidentiality and related considerations of national security. This course of action characterizes private sector companies and has a double motivation, rooted both in business interests (business-based) and adherence to norms (norms-based). Naturally, the firms that are driven by business motives are interested in branding themselves—domestically and internationally—as the leading and most reliable professional actors in their fields, ahead of any existing or potential competitor. Such branding should go hand in hand with positioning the firms as prioritizing and aligning with values of universal human rights and other major norms included in the List of Non-Binding Norms, which reflect responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. In this context, national and international responsibility to secure human life and well-being in an unregulated and risky cyberspace, at least by sharing relevant information with the public, has become a matter of utmost importance.

Vice versa, a U.S. firm like CrowdStrike reports on Russian cyber activities and avoids similar reports on its own national side.). Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 raise awareness about these threats among both governmental and nongovernmental users. More importantly, this helps enhance their cyber security capabilities and their preparedness to detect and thwart such threats. At the same time, such information may raise suspicions that a specific cyber attack is, in fact, an act of State or a State-sponsored operation. Occasionally, a private sector technological investigation may lead to complete attribution, including identification of the culprit State or its official organ.73 This occurs despite the general business orientation to avoid involvement in inter-State conflicts. Such attribution is a proper alternative to the official attribution that the victim State may avoid due to its strategic and national security considerations, as noted above. In such circumstances, the company's explicit technological attribution may influence international public opinion, delegitimizing the suspected State in the eyes of other States. Furthermore, any State could become a victim of similar unacceptable behavior at any time, and each may use such attributions to politically attribute responsibility to the suspected State. The following section addresses the collaboration U.S. national security agencies maintain with relevant American private sector companies, including in the context of the attribution process. Naturally, this partnership is not completely transparent, nor is it exclusive to the United States. It also encompasses attribution determinations, raising doubts about the extent to which these determinations should be perceived as credible and legitimate through the lens of neutral observers. ## E. Private Sector Collaboration with Governments A voluntary contribution by private sector companies to national efforts to defend the country from external threats is common, self-evident, and not limited to wartime. Thus, authorities of States cooperate and maintain close and confidential ties with leading domestic entities in the private sector in every relevant field, including health, transportation, tech-industry, telecommunications, and cybersecurity. Liberal democracies, as opposed to authoritarian regimes, maintain such cooperation within the boundaries of law.

International Law Studies 2024 force the perception that companies in established democracies assist their governments \"even above and beyond their legal obligations to do so.\"74 Conversely, authoritarian regimes are guided primarily by their self-interest in ensuring the regime's security and sustainability and would, therefore, do whatever it takes to secure their regime. As the end justifies the means, not even universal human rights would pose a barrier. As a corollary, the private sector companies, including foreign multinational platform companies operating under such regimes, must comply with their orders and restrictive regulations. Otherwise, the companies might pay excessive prices, which could include restricting, and even terminating, voluntarily or nonvoluntarily, their operations in the countries concerned.75 Due to the Great Power Competition and the intensifying tension, particularly in cyberspace, the U.S. Administration has preemptively imposed a Federal ban on procuring software and services from certain Chinese and Russian tech and software companies that may secretly serve as long arms for both competitor powers in the sensitive fields of cyberspace and telecommunications.

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 Scholars have already examined different facets of Private Sector-U.S. Government collaboration.⁸³ For the purposes of this article, it is important to focus on whether the collaboration of American multinational tech platforms with the American national security authorities undermines or, on the contrary, bolsters the credibility of the U.S. attribution process.⁸⁴ This is especially significant considering its key role in the collective attributions detailed in the following Part. Undoubtedly, such collaboration bolsters capabilities for revealing the truth behind any given cyber incident and establishing a solid attribution claim. However, in the absence of an independent international mechanism of accountability, the American attribution process, including the said collaboration, should withstand the scrutiny of its primary target constituency—the international community or international public opinion. Naturally, national security aspects of this collaboration remain confidential, though not always entirely so. Similarly, transparency may partially manifest itself in three dimensions: unexpected and undesired transparency—by leakers and whistleblowers; forced and balanced transparency—exclusively by virtue of judicial warrants that balance between conflicted interests, usually national security on one side and human rights on the other; and coordinated transparency—at the initiative of federal authorities in concert with the respective tech platforms. ⁸³.

Have such American corporations ever wittingly and publicly exposed an American clandestine illegitimate cyber operation and dismantled it?87 Furthermore, how plausible is it that American tech platforms such as Meta, Microsoft, or Google would maintain confidential professional ties with States and secretly provide them with services that could be used for defensive and offensive cyber operations while keeping the pertinent American authorities out of the loop and in the dark?

Conversely, if the companies are not willing to do something for any government, they will also not do it for the U.S.90 However, she finds that despite all their efforts to appear neutral, “the companies have not yet achieved—and quite likely will never succeed in achieving—perfect neutrality. They are still strongly associated with the U.S., where they remain domiciled and maintain their headquarters.”91 Additionally, they cannot ignore that the U.S. Government is their most significant customer, and just as importantly, the U.S. Government possesses the power to adversely affect their business operations through new domestic legislation that subsequently may also impact their global operations. Nonetheless, scholars have indicated a shift in the way the major U.S. global tech companies treat U.S. Government requests for collaboration.92 This shift stemmed from the urgent need to salvage the reputations of companies in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures, and it refers primarily to governmental requests that collide with constitutional rights like freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Accordingly, the companies have begun implementing a policy of publicly rejecting and litigating against such governmental demands. In this context, companies will not carry out governmental requests that may collide with human rights unless litigation fails and explicit court warrants are issued, as almost occurred in the San Bernardino case.93 Therefore, Ashley Deeks counts private sector tech compa blogs.microsoft.com/uploads/2017/03/Transcript-of-Brad-Smiths-Keynote-Address-at-the-RSA-Conference-2017.pdf.",

The next Part focuses on the collective attribution policy that the United States, along with its closest allies, has been implementing since 2017. Given the experience to date, should this policy be welcomed or re-evaluated? That is the question discussed below. ## IV. COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION In 2017, in the wake of two developments—the collapse of the fifth round of the UN–GGE and large-scale cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya—the United States and the United Kingdom extended the policy of official attribution to a new pattern of collective attribution aimed at deterring States from violating norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. As the table below shows, all the reviewed collective attributions, except one, relied on the national attribution processes of the United States and the United Kingdom regarding cyber attacks that targeted them or their allies. Prior to discussing the cumulative experience of the collective attribution concept per se, and to illustrate the complete picture in this context, the first section of this Part reviews three international initiatives that the United States introduced to deter States and advance responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace in conjunction with holding States accountable by relying on the concept of collective attribution. ## A. Collective Attribution Within International Initiatives Despite the legal obstacles and instrumental ambiguity noted above, the List of Non-Binding Norms remains the main international instrument to hold States accountable for wrongdoing that violates the voluntary norms of responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. This accountability is essential for establishing effective deterrence, while the attribution determination is a keystone for invoking accountability in any given incident. In its updated National Cyber Strategy, the Trump Administration announced the launch of the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative to re 2023), https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/huawei_china_claims/ (reporting on post of China’s Ministry of State Security on WeChat, in which the United States is accused of running cyber attacks and espionage for more than ten years against China, Russia, and forty-five other countries and regions, and of implanting backdoors in equipment and software and using American global technology brands to monitor and steal data). Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 inforce efforts to deter States from violating the List of Non-Binding Norms through “official attribution,” “collective attribution,” a “naming and shaming” strategy, and through a “collective response” by jointly imposing sanctions against States accused of violating the List.¹⁰⁹ Ultimately, no State has officially announced that it will join the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, not even the closest ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, although it promptly endorsed the pillars of the U.S. strategy.¹¹⁰ The International Cyber Deterrence Initiative has not evolved into an effective international initiative, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative¹¹¹ or the International Counter Ransomware Initiative discussed below. In fact, the United States never officially launched the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, and senior U.S. officials have rarely referred to it.¹¹² The literature includes only one study that references the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, focusing solely on the collective response rather than the credible collective attribution that is implicitly a prerequisite to any collective response.¹¹³ Within this study, the scholar examined the policy embraced by each State party in the FVEY in building offensive cyber capabilities. The findings reveal that the FVEY States, excluding New Zealand, align with the approach of responding firmly to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Additionally, those States have developed the offensive cyber capabilities needed, among others, to uphold such a policy. The scholar concludes by suggesting that the FVEY and other like-minded allies enhance the credibility of their deterrent collective response ¹⁰⁹. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12. ¹¹⁰.

International Law Studies 2024 by being transparent about how they use their offensive capabilities in response to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Nevertheless, for a collective response, the attribution must be credible, and this credibility cannot be taken for granted. Admittedly, the findings of this article bolster the conclusion that the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative never materialized as an active initiative for collectively imposing costs on States violating the List of Non-Binding Norms. In September 2019, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands co-sponsored a new international initiative and, together with twenty-five other States, issued a Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace.[114] This statement includes a commitment to hold States accountable, that is, to collectively attribute State responsibility for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms. It also calls on States to transparently impose costs under international law. The Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has only been invoked once since 2019. On February 21, 2020, fifteen out of the twenty-eight Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace partner States teamed up with Georgia and attributed responsibility to Russia for a disruptive cyber campaign conducted by the GRU. They politically denounced Russia and demanded it comply with the List of Non-Binding Norms.[115] Two months later, on April 16, 2020, the Czech Republic's National Cyber and Information Security Agency warned of a real threat of serious cyber attacks against its healthcare sector amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The day after, the U.S. Secretary of State released a statement in which he mentioned the Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace framework and warned against conducting such dangerous cyber attacks or knowingly allowing them: \"Anyone that engages in such an action should expect consequences.\"[116] Eventually, the threat was not real",

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 ized and Christopher Ford, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State, credited American deterrence for this.¹¹⁷ However, since the warning statements declined to identify the State allegedly behind the malicious plan, this cannot be labeled as a collective attribution. Moreover, neither the Czech nor the American authorities were transparent enough to convince observers that this was not a shot in the dark, but rather a successful preventive response to a credible and imminent threat. As indicated above, neither the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative nor the Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has gained political significance. Unsurprisingly, the anticipation that States beyond the closest allies of the United States would align with American or British attribution statements and impose various costs—political, economic, and otherwise—proved unfounded. It appears that the United States has relinquished both initiatives and, together with its partners in the FVEY, has remained focused on the collective attribution endeavor, as detailed in the following section. However, beyond the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, in October 2021 the United States established an international initiative to counter the threat of ransomware cyber operations, which the Biden Administration has recently defined as a threat to U.S. national security.¹¹⁸ Although this International Counter Ransomware Initiative¹¹⁹ deals exclusively with criminally motivated ransomware cyber operations, it remains relevant in the context of the present discussion of collective attribution by States. This is because its primary goal is to uphold multinational cooperation to counteract ransomware threats and bolster both resiliency and deterrence. To achieve this, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative strengthens cooperation by facilitating the sharing of information and professional expertise among the participating States and private sector companies. More crucially for the focus of this article is its collaborative effort to detect and identify hackers or hacker groups involved in ransomware attacks, whether independently ¹¹⁷.

In other words, the Initiative establishes and maintains multinational collaboration to detect, identify, and attribute responsibility for malicious cyber attacks. Since its establishment in 2021, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative has consistently increased its membership and actively devised strategies to confront the substantial threat.[120] Despite these efforts, the Initiative has not yet urged its members to collectively attribute responsibility to States involved in conducting ransomware cyber attacks, either through their official State organs or third parties. Similarly, the Initiative has not yet led to the attribution of responsibility to States that tolerate recurring cyber attacks initiated from their sovereign territories. Russia has already demonstrated that Russian ransomware gangs, such as REvil, may thrive or decline depending on the regime's willingness to cooperate.[121] Ultimately, increasing collaboration among the International Counter Ransomware Initiative States may encompass holding States accountable for ransomware cyber operations, even when initiated and directed from their sovereign territory, violating the due diligence principle. Apart from addressing the legal complexities associated with such accusations, the Initiative's parties may also seek to attribute responsibility and hold States accountable for what they have already defined as prohibited \"irresponsible behaviors.\" Nonetheless, when upheld by a common multinational investigative team, the resulting attribution is collective and certainly more legitimate and credible.

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 Cronos.¹²² An international law enforcement task force led by the UK's National Crime Agency and the FBI and consisting of eleven International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States (United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Netherlands, Finland, and Germany) successfully executed an international disruption campaign, taking control of the website and services (ransomware-as-a-service) of LockBit. This criminal hacking group is recognized as the world's most harmful cybercrime group. The outcomes of this operation included the seizure in three countries of LockBit's data exfiltration infrastructure by members of the task force. Two LockBit operatives were arrested in coordination with Europol. The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against two Russian citizens for conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks. The Department of Justice also announced that two defendants responsible for using LockBit to execute ransomware attacks were in custody and would face trial in the United States. The lessons learned from this experience could prove valuable for the United States and the United Kingdom in addressing the pitfalls of the current collective attribution process and response. This could serve as a test case demonstrating how successful cooperation between International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States can be in fighting criminally motivated, as well as politically motivated, cybercrime. Thus, the Initiative, in particular, may serve as an appropriate pilot for exploring optional solutions to better tackle the challenges associated with collective attributions and responses. More importantly, such solutions would enhance State accountability and the effectiveness of attributions in changing State behavior in cyberspace. ## B. Table of Collective Attributions as of January 1, 2024 The number of collective attributions has been steadily increasing at a slow pace since the first on December 19, 2017. Thus far, the number has reached fourteen collective attributions.¹²³ Each may refer to a single cyber attack or a campaign comprising a bulk of cyber activities that may even span over years.

First, this article relies only on open-source intelligence. Second, the International Law Studies 2024 selection of fourteen cases is the result of a meticulous search conducted in relevant FVEY State governmental websites where collective attributions are published, as well as the site of the EU High Representative's Office. In addition, information about cyber attacks was gathered from other sources, and a comparison was conducted against results from other sources.¹²⁵ Finally, the results, as reflected in the table above, do not purport to be exhaustive. Nevertheless, in a cautious estimate, analogous to the wording of the attributions' intelligence assessment, it can be stated that almost all the collective attributions, as defined at the outset of this article, are highly likely to be included in the table, and all the most prominent attributions are almost certainly included.¹²⁶ ## C. Analysis: Remarks and Insights ### 1. Remarks on the Process in Practice #### i. Five Eyes' Key Role Despite being an intelligence alliance, the FVEY partners are not obligated to full transparency between their intelligence agencies. However, they do share intelligence at a level of confidentiality not extended to other allies. This alliance is the core of the collective attribution strategy, while the United States and the United Kingdom are its driving forces. They cooperate in investigating wide-scale cyber attacks by exchanging confidential information and mobilizing, separately or in conjunction, to assist victim ¹²⁵.

One indication reinforcing this assessment is taken from the recent Canadian attribution statement. Press Release, Glob. Affairs Canada, Statement on Russia’s Malicious Cyber Activity Affecting Europe and Ukraine (May 10, 2022), https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2022/05/statement-on-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-affecting-europe-and-ukraine.html (recalling each of the seven previous malicious cyber operations attributed to Russia. All are included in the table.). Another indication can be taken from the Press Release, UK Att’y Gen’s Off., Attorney General to Set Out the UK’s Position on Cybersecurity and International Law (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-to-set-out-the-uks-position-on-cybersecurity-and-international-law (this report enumerated examples of cyber attacks where the United Kingdom “named and shamed” State actors. All are included in the table.). Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 States upon their request, especially when their capability to investigate cyber attacks independently is poor or limited.¹²⁷ Both the United States and the United Kingdom are responsible for all collective attributions listed in the table presented above, except one (Case 10), to be discussed below. The FVEY's attribution announcements are made concurrently and in coordination.¹²⁸ However, they rely on sharing classified information, not on the findings of an independent FVEY multinational investigative team or any other form of international investigative mechanism. Like the decision to officially attribute State responsibility itself, endorsing an official attribution made by another State is a political prerogative for each sovereign State, which may announce it as its own official attribution. Such attribution determinations rely on various cumulative considerations, including the accuracy and credibility of evidence shared with all partners. While Canada has, thus far, actively participated in all collective attributions initiated by the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia refrained in three instances (Cases 6, 7, 13) and New Zealand in four (Cases 6, 7, 11, 13). Neither New Zealand nor Australia publicly justified their decision to refrain in each of these instances. ## ii. EU and NATO Attributions or Partial Attribution Statements The EU, representing twenty-seven European States, has had a notable practice of declarations in support of collective attributions. Thus far, it participated in eleven out of fourteen collective attributions, while NATO participated in six out of these same eleven attributions. However, the attribution statements on behalf of the EU and NATO could hardly be considered fully attributive. Instead, they may be perceived as a partial attribution of responsibility, making a limited contribution to the collective attribution strategy. ¹²⁷. See, e.g., Cases 5, 13, supra Section IV(B) (providing examples in which the United Kingdom assisted the Georgian authorities in contending with and investigating the malicious cyber campaign); see Press Release, U.S. Embassy Tirana, Committed Partners in Cyberspace: U.S. Concludes First Defensive Hunt Operation in Albania (Mar. 23, 2023), https://al.usembassy.gov/committed-partners-in-cyberspace-u-s-concludes-first-defensive-hunt-operation-in-albania/. ¹²⁸. At times, the dates on statements from Australia and New Zealand may not match those of other FVEY partners. However, the announcements are most likely published simultaneously with those of the FVEY partners, and at times the incompatibility of dates may be due to the different time zones. International Law Studies 2024 The following are some probable causes driving this partial level of EU and NATO participation in collective attributions: (a) The EU and NATO do not possess independent cyber investigative capabilities. Both rely heavily on more capable allies, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, EU and NATO member States, like Sweden, the Netherlands, Estonia, Austria, France, and Germany, each of which possess independent investigative capabilities, allegedly provide the EU security authorities with “deficient and incomplete” evidence in order to preserve the confidentiality of their cyber capabilities.¹²⁹ To date, the EU has joined an official attribution initiated by one of its members only once (Case 10), and the attribution is highly questionable. NATO has never joined an attribution that was not initiated by the United States or the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that both States also face challenges in implementing a high degree of transparency with the EU security authorities due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of their intelligence sources. Nevertheless, the direct involvement of the United States and the United Kingdom in investigating cyber attacks appears to be a differentiating factor, possibly explaining why both, along with Canada and New Zealand, refrained from participating in the EU and Germany collective attribution (Case 10), while Australia settled for expressing solidarity.¹³⁰ (b) The EU and NATO have joined collective attributions through brief declarations or statements issued on behalf of both Councils. The wording of these official declarations or statements must be cautious and measured to achieve unanimity within a truly brief period. Typically, they condemn the cyber attack in question, express concerns about it, and show solidarity with the affected States. The EU and NATO choose to avoid any explicit attribution of responsibility to the CRINK States. At the same time, the United States and the United Kingdom explicitly attribute responsibility primarily to specific official agents or organs of any State within the ¹²⁹.

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 CRINK or to non-governmental entities and individuals working under their direction, instruction, or control as contracting hackers or hacker groups of the CRINK's official authorities. The EU and NATO refrain from attributing responsibility even to CRINK's official entities, such as intelligence agencies and national security institutions, which some of the U.S. or UK attribution determinations refer to in detail. In Case 9, for instance, the North Atlantic Council's statement acknowledges official statements made by its members—United States, United Kingdom, and Canada—attributing to China responsibility for compromising the Microsoft Exchange Server. The statement continues expressing solidarity with those who were affected, calling on \"all states, including China,\" to uphold their international commitments and \"act responsibly, including in cyberspace.\"131 Similarly, the EU's declaration refrains from explicitly attributing responsibility to China for malicious cyber activities, as opposed to the FVEY attribution statements.132 Instead, the EU \"strongly denounces\" these malicious cyber activities, urging China to comply with norms of responsible State behavior and prevent the use of its territory for such activities.133 The EU approach further differs from the FVEY by emphasizing adherence to the List of Non-Binding Norms, including due diligence, rather than strictly assigning State responsibility. However, challenges arise when applying due diligence to cyberspace, given uncertainties about its compatibility with the specific circumstances and the contested nature of its application in this",

International Law Studies 2024 domain. Thus, rather than assigning strict and explicit State responsibility, the EU declarations lean toward a partial attribution statement. $^{134}$ (c) Each of the EU member States may publish official attribution statements independently, like any sovereign State. Such statements may be more blatant and explicit than the EU's soft and general statements. An increased frequency of explicit independent statements, especially from cyber power States, aligning around the same conclusion in a specific cyber incident might impact the perceived legitimacy and credibility of the attribution determination in question. Nevertheless, such alignment is infrequent, contingent on the political cost-benefit calculation of each EU member State when deciding whether to act directly with full political responsibility through an official and independent statement.[135] # iii. Incoherency and Lack of Standardization The collective FVEY attributions reviewed indicated incoherency, a lack of standardization, and an absence of transparent criteria, primarily in selecting which cyber operations the United States or the United Kingdom would lead the FVEY to collectively attribute. Likewise, there is uncertainty about the criteria guiding the EU and NATO in determining which attributions to publicly support, all while navigating possible political storms.[136] Questions persist regarding the degree of certainty justifying an attribution in the first place and how to measure that degree.[137] Further considerations involve the timing and format of coordinated announcements, whether through verbal statements by senior government officials (such as heads of states, relevant ministers, and senior officials from the U.S. National Security Council and their counterparts in other States), or by written statements of an authorized governmental agency or ministry, or both in concert.",

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 The United States has been inconsistent in the way it has chosen to express its official attribution and synchronize it with its partners in the FVEY. At times, it settles for filing or unsealing indictments in absentia (e.g., Cases 4, 7) or for joining advisories (e.g., Case 6). Occasionally, the U.S. action of indicting and/or joining an advisory is in addition to an explicit official political announcement (e.g., Case 9). Conversely, the other \"Four Eyes\" always officially attribute responsibility through official announcements of senior officials, mostly by written statements of the relevant ministers. Furthermore, the inclusion of Case 10 as a collective attribution in the table is highly questionable. This marks the inaugural and sole instance where the EU independently initiated, on behalf of its member States, a statement, purported to collectively attribute responsibility.[138] It was primarily in response to Germany's official attribution and ostensibly at its request.[139] Ultimately, the declaration was more of an urgent general warning to Russia against interfering in European national democratic processes rather than a distinct attribution of responsibility for enduring wrongdoings.[140] However, to enable consensus among the twenty-seven EU member States, the statement's wording was softened and generalized, using \"some\" member States, instead of specifying the States, and \"associating\" the wrongdoing with them, instead of clearly \"attributing\" it to Russia.[141] Unsurprisingly, this declaration did not spur additional States to participate in this collective \"attribution,\" except Australia, which expressed its solidarity.[142] By stark contrast, the EU declaration in Case 14, which addresses the same threat of Russian interference in foreign States' democratic pro",

Doubtful Credibility There are only a small number of official attributions and an even smaller number of collective attributions that do not rely primarily on the American attribution process. The credibility and legitimacy deficiencies of the American attribution process, as highlighted in the previous Part—such as ambiguous normativity, limited transparency, and reliance on potentially biased American investigative teams instead of impartial multinational teams—persist unresolved in collective attributions. These issues may deter States from participating in explicit attributions as opposed to partial attributions. The cases reviewed indicate that States' willingness to participate in collective attributions based on the outcome of another State's national attribution process is limited, even if this system belongs to a cyber power State such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, the deterrence and effectiveness of such attributions also remain low.¹⁴⁴ Case 11 requires a closer look as it raises serious doubts about the credibility of both the American and British attribution processes, and whether their outcomes are credible and persuasive enough to encourage a growing number of States to participate in such collective attributions. In this case, the Ukrainian Government suspected Russia just because it was then the only State interested in destabilizing Ukraine.¹⁴⁵ Just forty-eight hours later, the United States and the United Kingdom provided the fastest attribution determination each of these allies had ever announced. It relied primarily on some technical information \"almost certainly\" linking the GRU to this cyber attack.¹⁴⁶ Anne Neuberger, the White House's Deputy National Secu ¹⁴³.

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 rity Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, justified the unusually prompt attribution by stating the “need to call out the behavior quickly as part of holding nations accountable when they conduct disruptive or destabilizing cyber activity.”¹⁴⁷ Similarly, the United Kingdom’s immediate official attribution statement asserted that “the United Kingdom and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity.”¹⁴⁸ However, the persuasiveness of this explanation is questionable, given that the number of collective attributions, let alone official national attributions, would have been considerably higher if this were the applicable standard.¹⁴⁹ Despite the United States sharing information with its allies for this swift attribution, only the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia joined this attribution while New Zealand and, more significantly, the EU, opted out. While the swift collective attribution may be linked to the looming possibility of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine set to commence in a few days, it does not necessarily justify what might be perceived by any impartial observer as taking shortcuts in the attribution process.

Shaping “Rules of the Road” Aiming to bolster deterrence, the United States and the United Kingdom initiated the collective attribution process as a response to attacking States in cyberspace.[150] However, in the absence of normative clarity, attribution announcements refer to unacceptable and irresponsible State behavior, rather than specifying international rules or norms allegedly breached by the given cyber attack. Thus, the policy implemented usually involves delegitimization (\"naming and shaming\") and retorsions, lawful measures that can be imposed without the need for detailed legal justification. The objective is to shape \"rules of the road\" by specifying instances of unacceptable cyber activity on case-by-case bases and to develop State practice accordingly. This involves instilling among the entire community of nations the perspectives of collective attributors regarding which cyber operations may constitute irresponsible State behavior.[151] Such activities would be deemed irresponsible State behavior when conducted by official State agents or entities, as well as by hacking groups affiliated with these entities, operating under their instruction, direction, or control.[152] Although the List of Non-Binding Norms does not refer to economic or national security espionage, bilateral agreements and multinational commitments prohibit the theft of intellectual property (IP), trade secrets, and business information to gain competitive commercial advantages.[153] Such multinational commitments may be an additional source for shaping \"rules of the road\" in the commitments' context.

For additional clarity, she also suggests defining types of disruptive State cyber activities in various vulnerable sectors, such as energy security, essential medical care, economic stability, and democratic processes. Identifying a type of such cyber activity and examining it in its relevant context would determine whether it disrupts or denies another State’s ability to exercise its sovereign power to freely decide and act. If so, it would constitute a clear violation of the non-intervention norm, rendering it an unlawful activity. Since the UK Attorney General proposed this approach, the United States and the United Kingdom have jointly undertaken only two additional collective attributions (Cases 13, 14). However, instead of attributing unlawful cyber activities to Iran and Russia, the UK Foreign Secretary characterized Iranian actions as “reckless” and “unacceptable”¹⁵⁹ and Russian actions as “completely unacceptable.”¹⁶⁰ This aligns with the established practice of the FVEY, as evidenced in the cases reviewed. Nevertheless, adopting and implementing the British Attorney General’s integrated legal and political approach within the collective attribution strategy could potentially confer a more binding aspect to norms, such as the prohibitions on intervention and use of force, sovereignty of States, due diligence, and the boundaries of permitted espionage. This might create incentives for States, mindful of their reputation as responsible and law-abiding entities, to adhere to these norms as interpreted and applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, enforcing them through collective attribution and responses would be more consistent and coherent, thus, more effective in shaping State practice and international law. ¹⁵⁸. Id.

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 ## 4. Sanctions as a Collective Response Another dimension of the legality of the attributed violation lies in the appropriate response. As mentioned earlier, both the FVEY and the EU confine their responses to retorsions, such as travel bans and asset freezing, undertaken against the entities and persons engaged in conducting the malicious cyber attacks in question. The expectation that a collective attribution would prompt retorsions from a high number of participating States, forming an effective collective deterrent response, has not materialized as of yet.¹⁶¹ Nevertheless, such a response has become a common practice of the United States and to a lesser extent, the EU and the FVEY. At the level of the United States, sanctions are imposed with greater frequency against individuals and entities based on findings and charges detailed in joint advisories or unsealed indictments and law enforcement investigations. Despite the considerable number of sanctioned individuals and entities, many are government personnel and entities associated with the CRINK, and a significant number have also been indicted.¹⁶² While the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish but to bring about a positive change in behavior,¹⁶³ this change has not materialized as of yet. At the level of the FVEY partners, the United Kingdom has regulated its own independent cyber related sanctions regime and occasionally imposed sanctions in coordination with the United States.¹⁶⁴ Australia legislated a cyber sanctions law in December 2021. In January 2024, it implemented it for the first time against a Russian cybercriminal found responsible for the Medibank ¹⁶¹.

On the other hand, the EU failed to bolster the deterrent impact of the collective attributions it opted to join (eleven out of fourteen cases) due to the cautious wording of its declarations, as described above—far from being an incisive attribution determination. Moreover, the EU's process of imposing sanctions in response to cyber attacks is too slow and less effective; it may extend even beyond a year, as the decision must be unanimous and rely on evidence that can withstand judicial scrutiny. Thus far, the EU has sanctioned, under its cyber-related sanctions framework, only eight individuals and four entities affiliated with the CRINK, encompassing both asset freezes and travel bans. These sanctions were instituted in two phases, in July and October of 2020. As of now, no additional sanctions have been imposed through this channel, and there have been no challenges to review any of these sanctions before the European Court of Justice.¹⁶⁶ Therefore, it seems that the EU cyber-sanction regime may have “already run its course,” as anticipated by some critics.¹⁶⁷ Furthermore, a German research team, which analyzed the EU's collective response in Cases 1–4, questioned the effectiveness of such responses, doubting whether they “really have a deterrent effect on aggressors or are ultimately just symbolic politics.”¹⁶⁸ Despite the above, this article does not purport to reach an unequivocal conclusion, based on sufficient credible information, regarding the effectiveness of the collective attribution and sanctions policy in achieving its primary objectives.

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 State behavior to align with norms of responsible State behavior. Ultimately, sanctions are not designed to punish but rather to motivate positive changes in State behavior.¹⁷⁰ Given that the main outlaw States in cyberspace—Russia, Iran, and North Korea—are already subject to extensive multinational sanctions regimes for reasons unrelated to “irresponsible” malicious cyber operations,¹⁷¹ the impact of sanctions imposed as a response to malicious cyber activities is difficult to evaluate decisively. Nevertheless, the increasing frequency and scale of politically motivated cyber operations suggest that the deterring effect of collective attributions, along with retorsions, is weak.¹⁷² Due to the lack of authorized information regarding the outcomes of these sanctions and in the face of persistent politically motivated cyber attacks originating from the same culpable States and orchestrated by their governmental entities, it would not be inaccurate to argue that the effectiveness of this policy has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Meanwhile, it still has a symbolic, declarative impact needed to emphasize the red lines that States should not cross. In conclusion, at present, collective attribution is no more than the upshot of the national attribution process, mostly American and British, with the addition of evidence sharing with like-minded States, in a manner that imposes no burden on the U.S. or UK intelligence community. The United States and the United Kingdom are always the driving force, while a CRINK State almost always stands on the receiving end. States and alliances participating in collective attributions, particularly the EU and FVEY, do not determine whether to join the attribution through direct involvement in investigative and attribution processes, but rather are influenced by political affiliations and international commitments within international frameworks, such as the G7, G20, and U.S.-EU or UK-EU dialogues. As a result, the collectiveness as implemented in the attribution process does not bolster the credibility of the American or British attribution determinations. This could notably change if the number of States committed to joining the attributions significantly increases, not due to political pressure or other political considerations, but rather due to an enhanced, joint, impartial, transparent, professional, and multinational process as the International Cyber Ransomware Initiative has recently demonstrated within its limited ¹⁷⁰.

CONCLUSION More than a decade has passed since Leon Panetta first used the metaphor of the Pearl Harbor attack to depict how serious and risky a cyber attack could be, warning “potential aggressors . . . that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.” $^{174}$ Even graver and more precise warnings have been issued recurringly by U.S. presidents and senior officials in administrations since 2012. $^{175}$ President Biden, who during his first weeks in office had to handle a series of serious ransomware cyber operations originating in Russia that dealt a blow to U.S. public interests, announced: “I made it clear to President Putin . . . that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions—interfering with our elections . . .—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia . . .” $^{176}$ In the same speech, the President emphasized that only nations “working together and in common” can solve “the accelerating global challenges.” He added, “we [the United States] cannot do it alone.” That is easier said than done in the international arena. Despite technological developments that have improved attribution capabilities, the international community has not yet established a binding legal framework for cyberspace. Instead, the United States, along with the United Kingdom, has chosen to build upon a national official attribution system by imposing collective attribution and responses to the wrongdoing, aiming to concurrently achieve two goals: (1) to reinforce State deterrence through public collective attribution and imposing costs; and (2) shaping and internalizing “rules of the road” for responsible State behavior in cyberspace. $^{177}$",

The United States, as the major attributor, assigns responsibility to specific States without allowing transparency regarding the evidence, the criteria of selecting the cases, and maintaining ambiguity about the legal grounds on which their charges rely. Furthermore, since the attribution determination in any given case is not subject to external and objective scrutiny, it is hard to indicate impartiality, legality, coherency, and consistency in the process, which collapses into one measure—attribution, accusation, judging, and punishing by retorsions. This is a far cry from satisfying any \"right\" or \"fair process.\" Thus far, the overwhelming majority of collective attributions have been American-led. The participants are American governmental experts, in cooperation mostly with American tech platforms whose loyalty to American national security interests is not questioned. There is no effort to involve independent, reputable international experts in the process, which is not sufficiently transparent and, on the face of things, may be perceived as one-sided. At most, the American process may constitute an exchange of views and intelligence sharing with counterpart agencies in the FVEY. Close and clandestine cooperation—among the FVEY—and sharing information with the EU's relevant institutions, as well as with a few like-minded States, is not enough to replace a proper procedure that would lend credibility and legitimacy to the process and its outcomes. The absence of representative, impartial multinational experts in the process exacerbates the legitimacy gap. This is even more true when the State at the receiving end of the attribution process is always a rival State from the CRINK group. Such dynamics erode the process' legitimacy and may discourage States from embracing its findings and joining the collective attributions, let alone responses. Moreover, it can explain the ineffectiveness of international initiatives, such as the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, and the negligible effectiveness of the collective attributions. This article pointed to one initiative, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which, in my opinion, has the potential to become more effective in countering ransomware and cooperating in law enforcement once the ransomware is detected or when credible intelligence can anticipate the details of the upcom signal to Russia without any reference to specific international rules about the cost Russia might pay if it continues with its destabilizing actions). 331 International Law Studies 2024 ing cyber attack. The motive, whether political or criminal, does not matter when ransomware cripples major governmental services, even more so when it prompts States to declare an emergency, as happened in Costa Rica. $^{178}$ If the International Counter Ransomware Initiative proves itself effective, it could be part of a mechanism to tackle politically motivated cyber attacks by expanding its designation. This article presents the considerable cumulative experience gained from destructive and disruptive State or State-sponsored cyber attacks and their accompanying attribution processes. This, coupled with the growing number of States expressing their perspectives in enduring public debates regarding the terms and boundaries for applying major international norms to cyberspace,[179] illustrate the image of a wide-open field that must be fenced in by further development and regulation. In my opinion, there is fertile ground for a justified reevaluation of the collective attribution process and the responses to cyber wrongdoing. This is critical to bolster the credibility, legitimacy, and subsequently the effectiveness of these collective attributions in shaping the rules of road and enhancing State accountability.",

DDoS Attack Against Ukraine (February 15–16, 2022) A week prior to the Russian invasion, an unprecedented DDoS attack crashed Ukrainian banks and government websites. Although the head of the Cybersecurity Department of Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it was too early to identify specific perpetrators, Ukraine pointed the finger at Russia as the only country interested in destabilizing Ukraine.[213] Forty-eight hours later, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia collectively blamed Russia for conducting the operation through its GRU.

Blocking the KA-SAT Network (February 16, 2022) On May 10, 2022, the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre assessed that Russia's GRU was almost certainly responsible for the cyber attack against ViaSat, a multinational communications provider, one hour prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This cyber attack, which is believed to have targeted the KA-SAT network to disrupt or cut off Ukraine's military communication, spilled over to civilian customers in Ukraine and across Europe, making tens of thousands of terminals inoperable in a manner that was irreversible.

The reason for such a serious response was a major cyber-campaign conducted against it nearly two months earlier. This campaign targeted significant Albanian government websites, including websites for providing essential public services and websites of the Albanian Parliament and Prime Minister's office.[218] Consequently, essential websites were shut down, and governmental data, including sensitive emails, were leaked. Although Albania is a NATO member State, it has not applied to activate Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Albania is not a cyber-power State. Therefore, it appealed to the United States, United Kingdom, and other capable States to investigate these cyber attacks and assist in ensuring resiliency. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have attributed State responsibility to Iran, while the EU and NATO have not deviated from their cautious path, avoiding explicit attribution statements.[219] In September 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security and its Minister of Intelligence as engaging in cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies.[220]",

The next Part focuses on the collective attribution policy that the United States, along with its closest allies, has been implementing since 2017. Given the experience to date, should this policy be welcomed or re-evaluated? That is the question discussed below. ## IV. COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION In 2017, in the wake of two developments—the collapse of the fifth round of the UN–GGE and large-scale cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya—the United States and the United Kingdom extended the policy of official attribution to a new pattern of collective attribution aimed at deterring States from violating norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. As the table below shows, all the reviewed collective attributions, except one, relied on the national attribution processes of the United States and the United Kingdom regarding cyber attacks that targeted them or their allies. Prior to discussing the cumulative experience of the collective attribution concept per se, and to illustrate the complete picture in this context, the first section of this Part reviews three international initiatives that the United States introduced to deter States and advance responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace in conjunction with holding States accountable by relying on the concept of collective attribution. ## A. Collective Attribution Within International Initiatives Despite the legal obstacles and instrumental ambiguity noted above, the List of Non-Binding Norms remains the main international instrument to hold States accountable for wrongdoing that violates the voluntary norms of responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. This accountability is essential for establishing effective deterrence, while the attribution determination is a keystone for invoking accountability in any given incident. In its updated National Cyber Strategy, the Trump Administration announced the launch of the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative to re 2023), https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/huawei_china_claims/ (reporting on post of China’s Ministry of State Security on WeChat, in which the United States is accused of running cyber attacks and espionage for more than ten years against China, Russia, and forty-five other countries and regions, and of implanting backdoors in equipment and software and using American global technology brands to monitor and steal data). Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 inforce efforts to deter States from violating the List of Non-Binding Norms through “official attribution,” “collective attribution,” a “naming and shaming” strategy, and through a “collective response” by jointly imposing sanctions against States accused of violating the List.¹⁰⁹ Ultimately, no State has officially announced that it will join the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, not even the closest ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, although it promptly endorsed the pillars of the U.S. strategy.¹¹⁰ The International Cyber Deterrence Initiative has not evolved into an effective international initiative, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative¹¹¹ or the International Counter Ransomware Initiative discussed below. In fact, the United States never officially launched the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, and senior U.S. officials have rarely referred to it.¹¹² The literature includes only one study that references the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, focusing solely on the collective response rather than the credible collective attribution that is implicitly a prerequisite to any collective response.¹¹³ Within this study, the scholar examined the policy embraced by each State party in the FVEY in building offensive cyber capabilities. The findings reveal that the FVEY States, excluding New Zealand, align with the approach of responding firmly to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Additionally, those States have developed the offensive cyber capabilities needed, among others, to uphold such a policy. The scholar concludes by suggesting that the FVEY and other like-minded allies enhance the credibility of their deterrent collective response ¹⁰⁹. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12. ¹¹⁰.

International Law Studies 2024 by being transparent about how they use their offensive capabilities in response to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Nevertheless, for a collective response, the attribution must be credible, and this credibility cannot be taken for granted. Admittedly, the findings of this article bolster the conclusion that the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative never materialized as an active initiative for collectively imposing costs on States violating the List of Non-Binding Norms. In September 2019, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands co-sponsored a new international initiative and, together with twenty-five other States, issued a Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace.[114] This statement includes a commitment to hold States accountable, that is, to collectively attribute State responsibility for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms. It also calls on States to transparently impose costs under international law. The Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has only been invoked once since 2019. On February 21, 2020, fifteen out of the twenty-eight Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace partner States teamed up with Georgia and attributed responsibility to Russia for a disruptive cyber campaign conducted by the GRU. They politically denounced Russia and demanded it comply with the List of Non-Binding Norms.[115] Two months later, on April 16, 2020, the Czech Republic's National Cyber and Information Security Agency warned of a real threat of serious cyber attacks against its healthcare sector amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The day after, the U.S. Secretary of State released a statement in which he mentioned the Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace framework and warned against conducting such dangerous cyber attacks or knowingly allowing them: \"Anyone that engages in such an action should expect consequences.\"[116] Eventually, the threat was not real"

First, this article relies only on open-source intelligence. Second, the International Law Studies 2024 selection of fourteen cases is the result of a meticulous search conducted in relevant FVEY State governmental websites where collective attributions are published, as well as the site of the EU High Representative's Office. In addition, information about cyber attacks was gathered from other sources, and a comparison was conducted against results from other sources.¹²⁵ Finally, the results, as reflected in the table above, do not purport to be exhaustive. Nevertheless, in a cautious estimate, analogous to the wording of the attributions' intelligence assessment, it can be stated that almost all the collective attributions, as defined at the outset of this article, are highly likely to be included in the table, and all the most prominent attributions are almost certainly included.¹²⁶ ## C. Analysis: Remarks and Insights ### 1. Remarks on the Process in Practice #### i. Five Eyes' Key Role Despite being an intelligence alliance, the FVEY partners are not obligated to full transparency between their intelligence agencies. However, they do share intelligence at a level of confidentiality not extended to other allies. This alliance is the core of the collective attribution strategy, while the United States and the United Kingdom are its driving forces. They cooperate in investigating wide-scale cyber attacks by exchanging confidential information and mobilizing, separately or in conjunction, to assist victim ¹²⁵. Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, *Significant Cyber Incidents*, https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents (last visited July 25, 2024) (timeline records significant cyber incidents since 2006); Congressional Research Service, *Cybersecurity: Selected Cyberattacks, 2012–2022* (updated Aug. 9, 2023), https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46974. ¹²⁶. One indication reinforcing this assessment is taken from the recent Canadian attribution statement. Press Release, Glob. Affairs Canada, Statement on Russia’s Malicious Cyber Activity Affecting Europe and Ukraine (May 10, 2022), https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2022/05/statement-on-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-affecting-europe-and-ukraine.html (recalling each of the seven previous malicious cyber operations attributed to Russia. All are included in the table.). Another indication can be taken from the Press Release, UK Att’y Gen’s Off., Attorney General to Set Out the UK’s Position on Cybersecurity and International Law (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-to-set-out-the-uks-position-on-cybersecurity-and-international-law (this report enumerated examples of cyber attacks where the United Kingdom “named and shamed” State actors. All are included in the table.). Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 States upon their request, especially when their capability to investigate cyber attacks independently is poor or limited.¹²⁷ Both the United States and the United Kingdom are responsible for all collective attributions listed in the table presented above, except one (Case 10), to be discussed below. The FVEY's attribution announcements are made concurrently and in coordination.¹²⁸ However, they rely on sharing classified information, not on the findings of an independent FVEY multinational investigative team or any other form of international investigative mechanism. Like the decision to officially attribute State responsibility itself, endorsing an official attribution made by another State is a political prerogative for each sovereign State, which may announce it as its own official attribution. Such attribution determinations rely on various cumulative considerations, including the accuracy and credibility of evidence shared with all partners. While Canada has, thus far, actively participated in all collective attributions initiated by the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia refrained in three instances (Cases 6, 7, 13) and New Zealand in four (Cases 6, 7, 11, 13). Neither New Zealand nor Australia publicly justified their decision to refrain in each of these instances. ## ii. EU and NATO Attributions or Partial Attribution Statements The EU, representing twenty-seven European States, has had a notable practice of declarations in support of collective attributions. Thus far, it participated in eleven out of fourteen collective attributions, while NATO participated in six out of these same eleven attributions. However, the attribution statements on behalf of the EU and NATO could hardly be considered fully attributive. Instead, they may be perceived as a partial attribution of responsibility, making a limited contribution to the collective attribution strategy. ¹²⁷. See, e.g., Cases 5, 13, supra Section IV(B) (providing examples in which the United Kingdom assisted the Georgian authorities in contending with and investigating the malicious cyber campaign); see Press Release, U.S. Embassy Tirana, Committed Partners in Cyberspace: U.S. Concludes First Defensive Hunt Operation in Albania (Mar. 23, 2023), https://al.usembassy.gov/committed-partners-in-cyberspace-u-s-concludes-first-defensive-hunt-operation-in-albania/. ¹²⁸. At times, the dates on statements from Australia and New Zealand may not match those of other FVEY partners. However, the announcements are most likely published simultaneously with those of the FVEY partners, and at times the incompatibility of dates may be due to the different time zones. International Law Studies 2024 The following are some probable causes driving this partial level of EU and NATO participation in collective attributions: (a) The EU and NATO do not possess independent cyber investigative capabilities. Both rely heavily on more capable allies, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, EU and NATO member States, like Sweden, the Netherlands, Estonia, Austria, France, and Germany, each of which possess independent investigative capabilities, allegedly provide the EU security authorities with “deficient and incomplete” evidence in order to preserve the confidentiality of their cyber capabilities.¹²⁹ To date, the EU has joined an official attribution initiated by one of its members only once (Case 10), and the attribution is highly questionable. NATO has never joined an attribution that was not initiated by the United States or the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that both States also face challenges in implementing a high degree of transparency with the EU security authorities due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of their intelligence sources. Nevertheless, the direct involvement of the United States and the United Kingdom in investigating cyber attacks appears to be a differentiating factor, possibly explaining why both, along with Canada and New Zealand, refrained from participating in the EU and Germany collective attribution (Case 10), while Australia settled for expressing solidarity.¹³⁰ (b) The EU and NATO have joined collective attributions through brief declarations or statements issued on behalf of both Councils. The wording of these official declarations or statements must be cautious and measured to achieve unanimity within a truly brief period. Typically, they condemn the cyber attack in question, express concerns about it, and show solidarity with the affected States. The EU and NATO choose to avoid any explicit attribution of responsibility to the CRINK States. At the same time, the United States and the United Kingdom explicitly attribute responsibility primarily to specific official agents or organs of any State within the ¹²⁹. Annegret Bendiek &amp; Matthias Schulze, *Attribution: A Major Challenge for EU Cyber Sanctions*, GERMAN INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL AND SECURITY AFFAIRS, at 7 (SWP Research Paper 11, Dec. 2021), https://www.swp-berlin.org/en/publication/attribution-a-major-challenge-for-eu-cyber-sanctions#fn-d48269e3630 (an analysis of WannaCry, NotPetya, Cloud Hopper (APT10), Bundestag Hack and the Attack on the OPCW). ¹³⁰.

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 CRINK or to non-governmental entities and individuals working under their direction, instruction, or control as contracting hackers or hacker groups of the CRINK's official authorities. The EU and NATO refrain from attributing responsibility even to CRINK's official entities, such as intelligence agencies and national security institutions, which some of the U.S. or UK attribution determinations refer to in detail. In Case 9, for instance, the North Atlantic Council's statement acknowledges official statements made by its members—United States, United Kingdom, and Canada—attributing to China responsibility for compromising the Microsoft Exchange Server. The statement continues expressing solidarity with those who were affected, calling on \"all states, including China,\" to uphold their international commitments and \"act responsibly, including in cyberspace.\"131 Similarly, the EU's declaration refrains from explicitly attributing responsibility to China for malicious cyber activities, as opposed to the FVEY attribution statements.132 Instead, the EU \"strongly denounces\" these malicious cyber activities, urging China to comply with norms of responsible State behavior and prevent the use of its territory for such activities.133 The EU approach further differs from the FVEY by emphasizing adherence to the List of Non-Binding Norms, including due diligence, rather than strictly assigning State responsibility. However, challenges arise when applying due diligence to cyberspace, given uncertainties about its compatibility with the specific circumstances and the contested nature of its application in this"

For additional clarity, she also suggests defining types of disruptive State cyber activities in various vulnerable sectors, such as energy security, essential medical care, economic stability, and democratic processes. Identifying a type of such cyber activity and examining it in its relevant context would determine whether it disrupts or denies another State’s ability to exercise its sovereign power to freely decide and act. If so, it would constitute a clear violation of the non-intervention norm, rendering it an unlawful activity. Since the UK Attorney General proposed this approach, the United States and the United Kingdom have jointly undertaken only two additional collective attributions (Cases 13, 14). However, instead of attributing unlawful cyber activities to Iran and Russia, the UK Foreign Secretary characterized Iranian actions as “reckless” and “unacceptable”¹⁵⁹ and Russian actions as “completely unacceptable.”¹⁶⁰ This aligns with the established practice of the FVEY, as evidenced in the cases reviewed. Nevertheless, adopting and implementing the British Attorney General’s integrated legal and political approach within the collective attribution strategy could potentially confer a more binding aspect to norms, such as the prohibitions on intervention and use of force, sovereignty of States, due diligence, and the boundaries of permitted espionage. This might create incentives for States, mindful of their reputation as responsible and law-abiding entities, to adhere to these norms as interpreted and applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, enforcing them through collective attribution and responses would be more consistent and coherent, thus, more effective in shaping State practice and international law. ¹⁵⁸. Id.

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 ## 4. Sanctions as a Collective Response Another dimension of the legality of the attributed violation lies in the appropriate response. As mentioned earlier, both the FVEY and the EU confine their responses to retorsions, such as travel bans and asset freezing, undertaken against the entities and persons engaged in conducting the malicious cyber attacks in question. The expectation that a collective attribution would prompt retorsions from a high number of participating States, forming an effective collective deterrent response, has not materialized as of yet.¹⁶¹ Nevertheless, such a response has become a common practice of the United States and to a lesser extent, the EU and the FVEY. At the level of the United States, sanctions are imposed with greater frequency against individuals and entities based on findings and charges detailed in joint advisories or unsealed indictments and law enforcement investigations. Despite the considerable number of sanctioned individuals and entities, many are government personnel and entities associated with the CRINK, and a significant number have also been indicted.¹⁶² While the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish but to bring about a positive change in behavior,¹⁶³ this change has not materialized as of yet. At the level of the FVEY partners, the United Kingdom has regulated its own independent cyber related sanctions regime and occasionally imposed sanctions in coordination with the United States.¹⁶⁴ Australia legislated a cyber sanctions law in December 2021. In January 2024, it implemented it for the first time against a Russian cybercriminal found responsible for the Medibank ¹⁶¹. See discussion supra Section IV(A) (International Cyber Deterrence Initiative). ¹⁶².

On the other hand, the EU failed to bolster the deterrent impact of the collective attributions it opted to join (eleven out of fourteen cases) due to the cautious wording of its declarations, as described above—far from being an incisive attribution determination. Moreover, the EU's process of imposing sanctions in response to cyber attacks is too slow and less effective; it may extend even beyond a year, as the decision must be unanimous and rely on evidence that can withstand judicial scrutiny. Thus far, the EU has sanctioned, under its cyber-related sanctions framework, only eight individuals and four entities affiliated with the CRINK, encompassing both asset freezes and travel bans. These sanctions were instituted in two phases, in July and October of 2020. As of now, no additional sanctions have been imposed through this channel, and there have been no challenges to review any of these sanctions before the European Court of Justice.¹⁶⁶ Therefore, it seems that the EU cyber-sanction regime may have “already run its course,” as anticipated by some critics.¹⁶⁷ Furthermore, a German research team, which analyzed the EU's collective response in Cases 1–4, questioned the effectiveness of such responses, doubting whether they “really have a deterrent effect on aggressors or are ultimately just symbolic politics.”¹⁶⁸ Despite the above, this article does not purport to reach an unequivocal conclusion, based on sufficient credible information, regarding the effectiveness of the collective attribution and sanctions policy in achieving its primary objectives. These goals include deterring, disrupting, and demonstrating readiness to defend international norms¹⁶⁹ and inducing a change in"

The United States, as the major attributor, assigns responsibility to specific States without allowing transparency regarding the evidence, the criteria of selecting the cases, and maintaining ambiguity about the legal grounds on which their charges rely. Furthermore, since the attribution determination in any given case is not subject to external and objective scrutiny, it is hard to indicate impartiality, legality, coherency, and consistency in the process, which collapses into one measure—attribution, accusation, judging, and punishing by retorsions. This is a far cry from satisfying any \"right\" or \"fair process.\" Thus far, the overwhelming majority of collective attributions have been American-led. The participants are American governmental experts, in cooperation mostly with American tech platforms whose loyalty to American national security interests is not questioned. There is no effort to involve independent, reputable international experts in the process, which is not sufficiently transparent and, on the face of things, may be perceived as one-sided. At most, the American process may constitute an exchange of views and intelligence sharing with counterpart agencies in the FVEY. Close and clandestine cooperation—among the FVEY—and sharing information with the EU's relevant institutions, as well as with a few like-minded States, is not enough to replace a proper procedure that would lend credibility and legitimacy to the process and its outcomes. The absence of representative, impartial multinational experts in the process exacerbates the legitimacy gap. This is even more true when the State at the receiving end of the attribution process is always a rival State from the CRINK group. Such dynamics erode the process' legitimacy and may discourage States from embracing its findings and joining the collective attributions, let alone responses. Moreover, it can explain the ineffectiveness of international initiatives, such as the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, and the negligible effectiveness of the collective attributions. This article pointed to one initiative, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which, in my opinion, has the potential to become more effective in countering ransomware and cooperating in law enforcement once the ransomware is detected or when credible intelligence can anticipate the details of the upcom signal to Russia without any reference to specific international rules about the cost Russia might pay if it continues with its destabilizing actions). 331 International Law Studies 2024 ing cyber attack. The motive, whether political or criminal, does not matter when ransomware cripples major governmental services, even more so when it prompts States to declare an emergency, as happened in Costa Rica. $^{178}$ If the International Counter Ransomware Initiative proves itself effective, it could be part of a mechanism to tackle politically motivated cyber attacks by expanding its designation. This article presents the considerable cumulative experience gained from destructive and disruptive State or State-sponsored cyber attacks and their accompanying attribution processes. This, coupled with the growing number of States expressing their perspectives in enduring public debates regarding the terms and boundaries for applying major international norms to cyberspace,[179] illustrate the image of a wide-open field that must be fenced in by further development and regulation. In my opinion, there is fertile ground for a justified reevaluation of the collective attribution process and the responses to cyber wrongdoing. This is critical to bolster the credibility, legitimacy, and subsequently the effectiveness of these collective attributions in shaping the rules of road and enhancing State accountability."

INTRODUCTION\nTwelve years ago, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was the first to warn of the threat of a cyber \"Pearl Harbor\" or a cyber \"9/11\" terrorist attack, as well as of cyber threats that \"could virtually paralyze the nation.\" Ten years later, Costa Rica was the victim of an unprecedented assault when ransomware cyber attacks virtually paralyzed it to the extent that its president had to officially declare a state of emergency. Albania, a NATO member State, severed diplomatic ties with Iran following Iranian cyber attacks that aimed to cripple Albania's online government services and leak sensitive emails and government data. In an era of global interconnectedness, the risks are borderless, severe global effects are at stake, and even sensitive national security computer control systems can be targeted. Unsurprisingly, these threatening cyber capabilities carry strategic implications for geopolitics, including the \"Great Power Competition.\" This rivalry between powers, coupled with deep ideological disparities (democratic versus authoritarian values), has become a major obstacle in ensuring global safety and stability in and through cyberspace. Rather than reaching a universal consensus on binding comprehensive international regulation, the international community, influenced by the conflicting views of competing powers, has made little headway. Consensus has been limited to agreeing in principle that international law, particularly the UN Charter, is applicable to cyberspace and concluding eleven voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace (the \"List of Non-Binding\n1.

This ambiguity provides major powers with enough leeway to strive for “cyberspace superiority” while ostensibly maintaining their reputation as law-abiding nations. On the other side of the fence, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea (CRINK) have exploited this ambiguity and the technical characteristics of cyberspace for advancing their interests. Under such circumstances, the List of Non-Binding Norms’s effectiveness in changing State behavior and the level of State compliance are low. Moreover, the norms’ effectiveness and State compliance are influenced by the extent to which the norms and the process of application are perceived as legitimate, as well as the degree to which the outcomes align with the expectations derived from these norms and processes.\n. Rep. of Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, transmitted by Letter dated June 26, 2015 from the Chair of the Group to Secretary-General, Established Pursuant to Resolution 68/243, ¶ 13, 28, U.N. Doc. A/70/174 (July 22, 2015) (paragraph 13 includes the List of Non-Binding Norms and paragraph 28 offers “non-exhaustive views” on principles of international law such as sovereign equality, due diligence, non-intervention, and the prohibition on the use of force that should apply to cyberspace. Hereinafter the List refers to both paragraphs 13 and 28.).\n.

For a broader discussion on legitimacy, how it is reflected in the weakened normative layer and affects its effectiveness, State compliance, and related processes and outcomes in underregulated cyberspace, see Dan Efrony, *Enhancing Accountability in Cyberspace Through a Three-Tiered International Governance Regime*, 103 INTERNATIONAL LAW STUDIES (forthcoming 2024) (Part II); THOMAS M.

Dunoff &amp; Mark A. Pollack eds., 2013); Timothy Meyer, *How Compliance Understates Effectiveness*, 108 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW UNBOUND 93 (2014).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nAgainst the backdrop of this normative ambiguity and inherent legal uncertainty, the process of attributing State responsibility stands as an essential and exclusive measure to hold specific States accountable for violating the norms of the List. To gauge the extent to which the United States has developed its attribution policy in the past decade, it is worth revisiting Secretary Panetta's 2012 remarks. In response to two consecutive destructive cyber attacks, he hinted at the improving technological capabilities to address the attribution problem by identifying cyber attackers and attributing responsibility. Therefore, “potential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions that may try to harm America.” However, it is important to note that neither the United States nor the direct victim States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, officially attributed responsibility for these cyber attacks to Iran, even though its responsibility has been widely accepted.\nIn fact, my previous published research on State practice in cyberspace between 2012 and 2018, co-authored with Yuval Shany, revealed that explicit official attributions were the exception during that period. Nonetheless, the last two attribution determinations addressed in that study indicated a shift from national official attributions toward collective attributions.\nIndeed, the collective activity of nations in attributing responsibility to States for irresponsible behavior in cyberspace and in responding to such behavior has become a vital component of the deterrence pillar within the U.S. National Cyber Strategy. The United Kingdom, the closest ally to the United States, has endorsed this strategy.\n7. Panetta, supra note 1. The backdrop of Panetta’s remarks—two destructive cyber attacks in August 2012 targeting and paralyzing Aramco, the largest oil company in the world, located in Saudi Arabia, and RasGas, the second-biggest liquefied natural gas company in Qatar.\n8. In this article “cyber attacks,” “cyber operations,” and “cyber activities” are used interchangeably, but the article focuses on politically motivated incidents, that is, cyber attacks conducted by States through their official organs and agents or through third parties as proxies.\n9.

Furthermore, it evaluates whether this process has become a crucial component in effectively holding States accountable for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms and in deterring States from such violations. Analyzing these and related issues requires a sound understanding of the official attribution process in practice, focusing on identifying legitimacy and credibility disparities, and researching the collective attributions announced so far. The article is built exclusively upon open-source intelligence.\nThe article continues as follows. Part II describes the official attribution process, differentiating between technological, legal, and political attributions and discussing the reluctance of States to officially attribute re\nes/deterrence-in-the-cyber-age-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary (presenting the United Kingdom’s deterrence strategy, mirroring the U.S. approach).\n\nVol. 103\nsponsibility. Part III explores major aspects of the American attribution process, the most influential one, excluding the internal division of labor among the U.S. national security and law enforcement entities. It includes five sections that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could affect the extent to which the process's outcomes would be perceived as credible and legitimate. The first is the instrumental ambiguity the United States has embraced in the absence of a binding international convention, which has an adverse effect on transparency and source-based legitimacy. The subsequent three sections—intelligence-based attribution, attribution by indictment, and the private sector's role in ensuring cyber security—are important for mitigating the challenge of transparency but are still insufficient to ensure credibility and legitimacy. The fifth section explores collaboration between the private sector, particularly American corporations, including the most powerful tech platforms globally, and U.S. national security entities responsible for the American attribution process. This all-American collaboration may raise serious concerns among non-American constituencies about the credibility and legitimacy of the U.S. attribution process and its outcomes. Part IV delves into the specific collective attributions starting with three international initiatives. Two of these, initially planned to catalyze and empower collective attributions, have already faded, while the third initiative holds potential as part of a solution. Section IV(B) is a table that succinctly presents fourteen cases of collective attribution, spanning from the first collective attribution on December 19, 2017, until January 1, 2024. A detailed overview of these fourteen cases appears as an annex at the end of this article. Section IV(C) analyzes the findings. Part V concludes.\n## II. OFFICIAL ATTRIBUTION\nMuch has been written in the literature about detecting, identifying, and attributing responsibility for cyber attacks to a culprit State by the official authorities of the victim State. Only a decade ago, the prevalent view con\n.

Nevertheless, this task remains easier said than done, particularly considering the challenges associated with legally attributing State responsibility, which I will address in a subsequent article.\n14. Compare Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyberattacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND SECURITY LAW 229 (2012), with Panetta, supra note 1.\n15. The term “technical attribution” is somehow misleading since technical attribution mostly does not result in clear attribution of responsibility to a State. At most, it is an estimated attribution of responsibility to a group of hackers based on the findings of tactics, techniques, and procedures. Reviewing the methods and techniques used in the discourse of technical investigations is beyond the scope of this article. For more information on this topic, see D.D. Clark &amp; S. Landau, Untangling Attribution, in PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY 25, 25–40 (2010); see also sources cited in supra note 13.\n16. Kristen Eichensehr, The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution, 67 UCLA LAW REVIEW 520 (2020); see also Lin, supra note 13, at 8–19 (emphasizing the need for all-source intelligence); GUITTON, supra note 13, at 36.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nEvery victim State thoroughly analyzes the information collected from all sources, including from cyber power State allies and cyber security and tech firms, to conclude whether the information is well-established and sufficient for a definite attribution. Even if the information includes enough evidence for attribution, the victim State's political leadership must weigh a wide range of strategic considerations and then determine whether to officially attribute responsibility; what level of transparency to implement; whether to retaliate, and if so, how, covertly or overtly; and which type of response would be perceived as lawful or legitimate in the given circumstances?\nA State might avoid an official attribution to preclude risks and actions that do not coincide with its national security interests, such as jeopardizing intelligence sources, disclosing intelligence gaps that the victim State may have pertaining to its rivals' cyber capabilities, exposing the victim State's confidential cyber capabilities, and averting the significant risk of misattribution, which could lead policymakers to wrongly engage in retribution and escalation.\nFurthermore, by refraining from public attribution, the victim State eliminates public pressure for retaliation and may lead the culprit State to believe it has not been detected. This strategy could allow the victim State to covertly monitor the operation and gather valuable intelligence about its rival's cyber capabilities. Additionally, it could facilitate the detection of additional covert operations employing the same cyber techniques while also considering disinformation or deception operations.[17] Moreover, powers that still obscure their political and legal approaches to pending cyber legal questions—such as the boundaries of legitimate \"cyber espionage,\" the clear threshold for constituting a prohibited \"use of force\" and a prohibited intervention, and how \"territorial sovereignty\" should be applied in cyberspace—might hesitate to officially attribute responsibility in specific circumstances. This is because such attribution could reduce the legal ambiguity these States have embraced to preserve their technological edge and maintain strategic leeway.\nTherefore, attribution is primarily a political decision relying on prudent and thorough discretion on whether to officially attribute responsibil-\n17. Gil Baram &amp; Udi Sommer, Covert or Not Covert: National Strategies During Cyber Conflict, 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER CONFLICT 3 (2019), https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2019/06/Art_11_Covert-or-Not-Covert.pdf (noting that victim States have at least four options to consider: full or partial concealment of the attack and publicizing the attack with or without public attribution).\nInternational Law Studies\n\nAs noted above, the difficulties of legally attributing State responsibility will be addressed in a subsequent article. For the purposes of the present article, it is worth noting the following: pursuant to the rules of State responsibility, a State harmed by a malicious cyber operation that is willing to officially attribute responsibility to an attacking State and has a legal justification for a lawful response, must meet two cumulative requirements.[20] The first is to indicate a breach of an international rule that binds States under circumstances like those of the cyber incident in question. This might be controversial as long as international cyber law remains in its embryonic stage and the extent and conditions under which customary rules of international law would apply to cyberspace as binding law continue to be open-ended. The second requirement is to identify a perpetrator suspected of breaching the international rule and substantiate their connection—either as an official agent or as a proxy—to a specific State.\nThus far, none of the attributing States have faced demands to legally prove their attribution statement within the framework of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Due to cyberspace's unique characteristics and legal ambiguity, the legal demands for substantiating State responsibility in cyberspace are uncertain, making it more difficult to legally attribute such responsibility.[21] While legally attributing State responsibility for international\n18.

In this context, Delbert Tran defined the \"attribution problem\" as a complete \"red herring.\"22 In circumstances where a sufficient degree of certainty (rather than absolute certainty) is enough to impose responsibility, and computer scientists have developed a range of tools to trace the culprits, the problem can be solved by \"configuring the law.\"23 Clement Guitton finds the attribution of State responsibility \"a lot more complex and nuanced,\" adding that the lack of binding standards of proof provides the States involved with great flexibility to manipulatively achieve their political aims.24\nNevertheless, the following section shows that leading cyber power States are not enthusiastic, to put it mildly, about officially attributing responsibility to other States for violating norms of responsible State behavior. This is despite the fact that official attribution is a political act, ostensibly exempt from meeting legal requirements, such as transparent and admissible evidence. To date, this process has never been applied in court with respect to cyber incidents.\n# A. Reluctance of States to Officially Attribute Responsibility\nDuring recent decades, States have conducted hundreds or thousands of disruptive and destructive cyber attacks either through their official organs and agents or through proxies. Only in a tiny fraction of cases did States officially attribute responsibility to other States based on technical and all-source intelligence. At times, these official attributions also relied on private sector contributions through confidential or nonconfidential reports of relevant companies. At least until the second half of 2017, victim States would refrain from officially attributing responsibility to another State unless they were amid an armed conflict, during which they often blamed\nOF INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION (Cesare P.R. Romano, Karen Alter &amp; Yuval Shany eds., 2013).\n22.

GUITTON, supra note 13, at 91.\nInternational Law Studies\n\nIn fact, until 2017 the United States was the only State that had officially attributed responsibility to another State for executing a specific cyber attack in peacetime. The United States did so only twice, both in rare circumstances: attribution to North Korea for executing the Sony Pictures hack (December 2014), and attribution to Russia for conducting the Democratic National Committee hack and additional cyber operations meddling in the American election campaign (2016). Another well-known damaging cyber attack, the Ababil operation (distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against New York's financial sector in 2011–2013), was investigated and, three years later, resulted in indicting in absentia foreign operatives who were Iranian government agents. The detailed indictment, on the face of things, could be sufficient for officially attributing responsibility to the Iranian regime. However, the U.S. Administration declined to follow this path, likely due to political and national security considerations. The United States implemented the same approach and refrained from official attributions on additional occasions when the Department of Justice also indicted Chinese, Russian, and North Korean governmental operatives for breaching U.S. law.\nThe United Kingdom also avoided officially attributing State responsibility until October 2017, when it did so for the first time with respect to the WannaCry cyber attack. Interestingly, France continues to embrace a\n25.

Efrony &amp; Shany, supra note 10, at 607, 611–12. Both incidents were investigated and promptly resolved by firms from the private sector concurrently with authorized U.S. agencies. The Sony Pictures hack was the first destructive State cyber attack conducted against targets located on U.S. soil. The Democratic National Committee hack was the first U.S. official attribution to Russia for interfering in the U.S. presidential election despite explicit warnings by the U.S. Administration.\n27.

Consequently, to date, France has never officially, and on its own—as opposed to under the EU's collective attributions detailed below—attributed to another State responsibility for a cyber attack targeted at French national interests. Strangely, France even declined to attribute responsibility for the 2017 Macron Leaks, even when the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging six officers of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) for responsibility for this malicious Russian cyber operation.\nGermany has embraced a similar policy, with two exceptions related solely to Russian intervention in German election campaigns.

The attribution determination does not rely on full transparency or even a significant degree of transparency, let alone the ability to withstand any external, independent, and impartial scrutiny. This provides room for questioning the credibility and legitimacy of the official attribution. Part III addresses several segments of the U.S. national attribution process, examining how they may have potential positive or negative impacts on the legitimacy and credibility of the collective process and its outcomes.\n## III. EVALUATING ASPECTS OF LEGITIMACY AND CREDIBILITY IN THE ATTRIBUTION PROCESS\nNational security interests dictate confidentiality regarding classified intelligence, including information about sensitive cyber tools, detection capabilities, and military cyber capabilities. However, in the absence of multinational, impartial, legal, and professional scrutiny regarding the accuracy and lawfulness of the official attribution in any given situation, attributing States must be mindful of how various constituencies could perceive their attribution statements. Without accepted clear and binding rules, these statements may not be viewed as lawful. Nevertheless, there is a concerted effort to influence public opinion through enhancing the legitimacy of the attribution process. If successful, this could bolster the effectiveness of its attribution determinations.\nThe following sections address five segments that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could positively or negatively influence how the outcomes of the process are perceived for credibility and\n37.

An Instrumental Ambiguity\nCyberspace's unique technological attributes produce opportunities for cyber power States to surreptitiously generate significant strategic gains through covert cyber operations, thereby minimizing the risk of being held accountable for breaching the law and harming their reputation as law abiding States. On the one hand, States strive to evade legal responsibility by distancing themselves from any factual or legal linkage to the malicious cyber operations in question. On the other hand, national security interests dictate the non-disclosure of classified information for both victim and attacking States. However, such data could help them substantiate arguments to strengthen or dismiss relevant accusations.\nAs mentioned above, States, particularly the leading powers involved in the Great Power Competition, have embraced instrumental ambiguity, including maintaining silence on questions related to the interpretation and application of recognized principles and rules of customary international law in cyberspace. The primary motive behind this policy is to retain a sufficient margin of maneuver to enable the protection and promotion of strategic national interests in the rapidly evolving cybersphere. This policy of ambiguity inherently leads to accountability gaps that the most influential cyber power States, like the United States, are reluctant to resolve. Nevertheless, it is crucial for these States to play a decisive role in shaping international cyber law in a manner and at a time that aligns best with their national security interests. Unsurprisingly, they seek to avoid situations requiring an independent, international, judicial forum, such as the International Court of Justice, to resolve legal ambiguities surrounding State conduct in cyberspace.\nNotwithstanding the growing number of States that have clarified, albeit partially and cautiously, their views about a limited number of legal questions, the policy of ambiguity still prevails. The policy influences policymakers when considering whether to officially attribute responsibility and\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nwhen considering how transparent to be regarding relevant evidence and legal arguments.\nOfficial attribution regarding cyber incidents in itself does not eliminate the need for transparency. This requirement is inherent in the legal obligation to substantiate State responsibility in both non-cyber and cyber incidents. Transparency is essential to legitimize the official attribution by reflecting its “right process” through its process-based and outcome-based legitimacy. In the absence of accessible international judicial or quasi-judicial forums, as well as an impartial international monitoring institution, conflicting States might seek to influence the final “judgment” of the “international court of legitimacy.” This type of influence often involves legitimizing one side while delegitimizing the other. To achieve this, States should enhance transparency regarding their findings and, more importantly, with respect to processes and procedures undertaken. This includes ensuring that they align with Thomas Franck’s concept of the “right process.” The degree to which this transparency is genuine and comprehensive serves to strengthen their arguments in attributing responsibility or denying it, respectively.\nRelying solely on the investigative role of the United States or the United Kingdom, coupled with limited transparency and unwillingness to disclose persuasive evidence, opens the door to plausible deniability. Excluding independent, objective, and multinational experts, as well as representatives from other States, from participating in the attribution process also provides grounds for criticizing the integrity of the process. The absence of these persons may raise concerns about the process being flawed, unfounded, politically biased, and non-transparent, thus, not credible or legit-\n.

Yet simply prioritizing national security interests to the extent of excluding transparency may erode trust in the attribution statement. Nevertheless, powers like the United States and the United Kingdom, which possess advanced cyber capabilities and robust intelligence, do not hesitate to base their attribution claims solely on their intelligence assessment system, thereby preserving confidentiality and national security interests.\n## B. Intelligence-Based Attribution\nThe term \"intelligence assessment\" usually does not imply absolute certainty nor admissibility in court but rather the degree of certainty and credibility with which a certain factual narrative should be perceived, using the qualifiers of the national intelligence community about high, moderate, or low likelihood/certainty of the narrative as described in the attribution statement.45 The degree of certainty obviously depends on the level of trust in the information collected and the extent to which it is considered reliable and credible. The more reliable and credible, the higher the degree of cer\n43.

Cyber Law Toolkit, supra note 39.\n45. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, supra note 13.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ntainty, and the more that information may whet the policymakers' appetites to officially attribute responsibility to the culprit State if additional political considerations justify such an attribution.\nUp to this point, the United States and the United Kingdom have adhered to this official format of attribution, responding publicly with measures such as diplomatic démarche and sanctions when attributions were based on an intelligence assessment of high certainty and the interest of national security allowed a limited transparency to withstand an appropriate judicial or administrative review. By endorsing this practice, both States have averted compromising sensitive intelligence to justify their official attribution and retorsion, which is a response within the prerogative of any State. Even if the attribution of State responsibility proves to be mistaken, the response undertaken remains lawful, albeit unfriendly, and is often reciprocally retaliated. Nevertheless, covert cyber operations remain a viable response, either alongside or instead of retorsions. However, if exposed, their legality would inevitably be challenged.\nCritics of intelligence assessment as major grounds for attribution argue that it relies on criteria that \"may at best amount to circumstantial evidence,\" far below the evidentiary standards used in courts.[46] This allows States to manipulate cases to fit preconceived narratives and embody political agendas; it may lead to misleading results involving the misinterpretation of information influenced by what later turns out to be a false conception.[47]\nNone of the official American attributions since 2014, nor any of the collective attributions that the United States and the United Kingdom have announced since 2017, have corroborated this criticism. Both States have officially attributed responsibility relying on their intelligence and a high degree of certainty (\"almost certainly\"). Some of these attributions have also referred to open-source investigative reports and technological findings of tech and cyber security companies, mostly American, as discussed below. Others were also followed, months or even years later, by detailed American indictments delivering the message that they rely on sufficient and admissible evidence. However, only a limited number of States have been sufficiently convinced or politically motivated to officially adopt and join these attribution statements. Even these States did not do so because they truly participated in the attribution process itself or obtained access to\n46. GUITTON, supra note 13, at 98–99.\n47. Id.\n\nNevertheless, the investigation team determining the attribution remains exclusively American. The limited number of participating States might also indicate that those States, which the United States and the United Kingdom interchangeably have not allowed to participate in the process or share classified information, are hesitant to blindly trust American or British intelligence assessments. Considering that the United States is the driving force behind these attributions and that its rivals, such as the CRINK States, are consistently on the receiving end underscores the importance of challenging the credibility of the process and its outcomes.\nConcurrently with intelligence-based attribution, the United States has endorsed, on its own, another method to mitigate the demand for transparency. This is attribution by indictment (\"naming and shaming\"). The next section will demonstrate that, despite its relative transparency, attribution by indictment has not proven a benchmark for credibility and trust.\n## C. Attribution by Indictment\nUntil now, the United States stands as the first and only State to “name and shame” by indicting, in absentia, foreign State-sponsored hackers, mostly citizens of the CRINK. They have been accused of breaching the U.S. Code by committing cybercrimes against Americans and U.S. entities. These indictments provide an opportunity to describe their worldwide malicious cyber activity. They include declassified information about unlawful cyber activities, shedding light on relevant State responsibility. This responsibility stems from the fact that, while committing the unlawful activities, the defendants were either State agents (such as soldiers, officers, or other government officials) or third parties under the State’s control, direction, instruction, or empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority.\nHowever, indicting unlawful combatants, such as spies captured during peacetime or armed conflict while conducting their mission in the territory\n. Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 20, arts. 4–5, 8.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nof the accusing State, is unexceptional and reflects customary international law. Nevertheless, indicting, in absentia, defendants identified as official agents of a foreign State for remotely hacking and damaging, during peacetime, targets located in the territory of the accusing State is both exceptional and unprecedented. This could be acceptable if the hacks were criminally motivated and could not be attributed to a specific State, according to the Articles on State Responsibility.\nThe U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, admitted that “traditional military and intelligence activity is a separate sphere of conduct that ought not be subject to domestic criminal law,” with the recognized exception noted above of charging intelligence officers operating undercover in the United States. Barr introduced new and unprecedented exceptions such as State-sponsored computer intrusions “for the purpose of intellectual property theft for the use of [the Chinese] private sector, bank robbery, and interfering with our democratic elections” and “deliberate, indiscriminate theft of vast amounts of sensitive personal data of civilians,” as occurred in the case of hacking Equifax. In Barr’s words, such cases “cannot be countenanced.” In fact, such cases have led to the submission of indictments in deviation from the customary principles of international law and the recognized principle of criminal responsibility. One scholar labeled this a “judicialized attribution,” a new tool to convey more concrete and less political attribution focusing on the evidence and lawfulness of the behavior according to domestic law rather than international law. This is despite the fact that both the superiors and subordinates who followed their orders purportedly committed the attributed crimes remotely from\n49.

FRANÇOIS DELERUE, CYBER OPERATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW 183–84 (2020).\nInternational Law Studies\n\nFurthermore, invoking this policy of indictments requires proceeding in front of a federal grand jury to investigate and decide whether and on what charges to indict. This process is expected to be unbiased, reinforcing the indictment's credibility. However, the jury operates behind closed doors, hearing the federal prosecutor and live testimonies of relevant witnesses, mostly federal investigators, and American cyber security and technology experts. In fact, the process is controlled and guided by the federal prosecutor of the case rather than a judge. Moreover, the indictments may also rely on evidence from American tech and cybersecurity companies, which, as explored below, closely collaborate with local governmental authorities. The national loyalty of these companies is often taken for granted.55 While this perception may not be entirely accurate, it is sufficient to undermine the trust in the impartiality and credibility of the American attribution process by significant portions of the international community, particularly populations and governments in the Global South.\nMoreover, Article 28(f) of the 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report approved by the UN General Assembly asserts that \"the accusation of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against states should be substantiated.\"56 The question of whether the American and British practice in this regard meets this requirement is still contested. As mentioned above, a growing number of States have publicly endorsed the view that States attributing responsibility do not need to disclose classified evidence. States like the United States and the United Kingdom maintain that their findings are substantiated by the professional work of criminal investigators, tech experts, and intelligence professionals who\n55.

U.N. Doc. A/70/174, supra note 4.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ndo not violate Article 28, which is silent about the ways in which accusations should be substantiated.\nIn contrast, the CRINK States, the exclusive subjects of such attribution processes, often disregard or automatically reject the accusations against them. Russia consistently demands that attributing States substantiate their accusations by revealing evidence, particularly forensic or technical evidence.57 China, which always criticizes the U.S. tendency to function as the \"global sheriff,\" has recently responded by employing the same attribution approach, directing accusations toward the United States for cyber attacks allegedly conducted against Chinese entities.58\nInterestingly, the Obama Administration, striving to avoid escalation and miscalculation, refrained from officially attributing explicit responsibility to States for specific cyber attacks and preferred to do so indirectly by unsealing an indictment against Iranians three years later.59 A shift has been noted since 2018 when indictments started to complement the administration's official attribution statements. However, the policy in this regard remains inconsistent. Not every official attribution is accompanied by indictment, and conversely, not every indictment is accompanied by an official attribution.\n57.

Unsurprisingly, this American strategy has not deterred the CRINK States. As the FBI's Deputy Director put it when announcing another indictment: \"Time and again, Russia has made it clear: They will not abide by accepted norms, and instead, they intend to continue their destructive, destabilizing cyber behavior.\"61 Additionally, U.S. federal indictments, even when accompanied by collective attributions, have not significantly increased the number of States joining the collective attribution.62 This, coupled with the growing number of CRINK-sponsored cyber attacks, raises significant doubts about the extent to which this strategy is indeed effective. The responses to these doubts vary widely. Some scholars opine that this strategy appears to be a failure and \"even might be self-defeating.\"63 In contrast, others argue that it serves more than just deterrence, notably enabling other actions like sanctions to\n60.

For the purposes of this article, it suffices to note that by unsealing indictments in absentia, the United States strives to have it all. On the one hand, it purportedly maintains credible evidence and a reasonable degree of transparency through detailed charges sufficient for imposing ex parte administrative personal sanctions against unreachable foreign defendants. On the other hand, none of these defendants are likely to extradite themselves to challenge the legal and administrative proceedings, including the credibility of the evidence. The U.S. Assistant Attorney General described the indictments as “just a piece of the puzzle,” representing a critical, credible step towards imposing meaningful consequences, adding that it is part of building consensus inside and outside the United States about responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace.\nIn conclusion, the benefit of attribution through indictment may be associated with three possible objectives: using the prestige of the American justice proceedings along with a degree of transparency to reinforce the attribution’s credibility through the lens of other impartial States; deterring States from launching similar attacks and damaging their reputation as law-abiding States; and building a broad international consensus to compel States to adhere to norms of responsible State behavior, such as the prohibition on conducting cyber attacks against critical infrastructure facilities. Nevertheless, the experience of recent years has not indicated any remarkable success in accomplishing all these objectives, at least not enhancing the credibility of the attributions through such indirect measures, nor significantly increasing the number of States joining the collective attributions\n.

However, neither provides transparent evidence that could withstand external and impartial scrutiny, subsequently substantiating the attribution determinations and ensuring their credibility.\nThe next section delves into the significant role played by the private sector, particularly in the United States, illustrating how private sector collaboration with the U.S. Government may enhance the level of transparency in determining and announcing official attributions. However, concurrently, it may raise concerns about the legitimacy and credibility of such attributions.\n## D. The Role of the Private Sector\nThe private sector, through its major tech and cyber security firms, plays a key role in the attribution process, as it possesses significant tech capabilities for detecting and investigating cyber incidents. Western companies, mostly American, such as Meta (Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram), Microsoft (Windows, Azure), Amazon (Amazon Web Services), Alphabet (Google, YouTube), X (previously Twitter), Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Verizon, dominate cyberspace in both software and hardware, encompassing global social media, big data, cloud services, artificial intelligence, computer operating systems, and search engines. Each of these realms is a playground where any vulnerability exposed by third parties could be exploited, posing serious threats to the company's reputation and business success. Thus, these companies invest vast resources to consistently lead in technology, developing cutting-edge capabilities to detect, investigate, and thwart any threat, regardless of its motives through in-house cyber threat intelligence teams. Moreover, global tech platforms, in particular, have achieved worldwide dominance and maintain a formidable presence in cyberspace, a level of control that State cyber powers, including a cyber superpower like the United States, struggle to maintain.

Typically, such aid would involve collaboration with domestic or global cyber security and tech companies that have become major players in the field of cyber threat intelligence, holding capabilities that may even exceed those of government intelligence agencies. These capabilities are crucial for gathering, processing, and analyzing technological findings to promptly establish situational awareness for the State's decision-makers.

More importantly, this helps enhance their cyber security capabilities and their preparedness to detect and thwart such threats. At the same time, such information may raise suspicions that a specific cyber attack is, in fact, an act of State or a State-sponsored operation. Occasionally, a private sector technological investigation may lead to complete attribution, including identification of the culprit State or its official organ.73 This occurs despite the general business orientation to avoid involvement in inter-State conflicts. Such attribution is a proper alternative to the official attribution that the victim State may avoid due to its strategic and national security considerations, as noted above. In such circumstances, the company's explicit technological attribution may influence international public opinion, delegitimizing the suspected State in the eyes of other States. Furthermore, any State could become a victim of similar unacceptable behavior at any time, and each may use such attributions to politically attribute responsibility to the suspected State.\nThe following section addresses the collaboration U.S. national security agencies maintain with relevant American private sector companies, including in the context of the attribution process. Naturally, this partnership is not completely transparent, nor is it exclusive to the United States. It also encompasses attribution determinations, raising doubts about the extent to which these determinations should be perceived as credible and legitimate through the lens of neutral observers.\n## E. Private Sector Collaboration with Governments\nA voluntary contribution by private sector companies to national efforts to defend the country from external threats is common, self-evident, and not limited to wartime. Thus, authorities of States cooperate and maintain close and confidential ties with leading domestic entities in the private sector in every relevant field, including health, transportation, tech-industry, telecommunications, and cybersecurity. Liberal democracies, as opposed to authoritarian regimes, maintain such cooperation within the boundaries of law.

Mandiant, for instance, was the first to attribute APT1 to China in a detailed attribution report based on technical findings and other, not necessarily technical, information gathered by the firm.

Eichensehr, supra notes 67, at 68.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nScholars have already examined different facets of Private Sector-U.S. Government collaboration. For the purposes of this article, it is important to focus on whether the collaboration of American multinational tech platforms with the American national security authorities undermines or, on the contrary, bolsters the credibility of the U.S. attribution process. This is especially significant considering its key role in the collective attributions detailed in the following Part.\nUndoubtedly, such collaboration bolsters capabilities for revealing the truth behind any given cyber incident and establishing a solid attribution claim. However, in the absence of an independent international mechanism of accountability, the American attribution process, including the said collaboration, should withstand the scrutiny of its primary target constituency—the international community or international public opinion. Naturally, national security aspects of this collaboration remain confidential, though not always entirely so. Similarly, transparency may partially manifest itself in three dimensions: unexpected and undesired transparency—by leakers and whistleblowers; forced and balanced transparency—exclusively by virtue of judicial warrants that balance between conflicted interests, usually national security on one side and human rights on the other; and coordinated transparency—at the initiative of federal authorities in concert with the respective tech platforms.\n.

Conversely, if the companies are not willing to do something for any government, they will also not do it for the U.S.90\nHowever, she finds that despite all their efforts to appear neutral, “the companies have not yet achieved—and quite likely will never succeed in achieving—perfect neutrality. They are still strongly associated with the U.S., where they remain domiciled and maintain their headquarters.”91 Additionally, they cannot ignore that the U.S. Government is their most significant customer, and just as importantly, the U.S. Government possesses the power to adversely affect their business operations through new domestic legislation that subsequently may also impact their global operations.\nNonetheless, scholars have indicated a shift in the way the major U.S. global tech companies treat U.S. Government requests for collaboration.92 This shift stemmed from the urgent need to salvage the reputations of companies in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures, and it refers primarily to governmental requests that collide with constitutional rights like freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Accordingly, the companies have begun implementing a policy of publicly rejecting and litigating against such governmental demands. In this context, companies will not carry out governmental requests that may collide with human rights unless litigation fails and explicit court warrants are issued, as almost occurred in the San Bernardino case.93 Therefore, Ashley Deeks counts private sector tech compa\nblogs.microsoft.com/uploads/2017/03/Transcript-of-Brad-Smiths-Keynote-Address-at-the-RSA-Conference-2017.pdf.\n89.

Given the experience to date, should this policy be welcomed or re-evaluated? That is the question discussed below.\n## IV. COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION\nIn 2017, in the wake of two developments—the collapse of the fifth round of the UN–GGE and large-scale cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya—the United States and the United Kingdom extended the policy of official attribution to a new pattern of collective attribution aimed at deterring States from violating norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. As the table below shows, all the reviewed collective attributions, except one, relied on the national attribution processes of the United States and the United Kingdom regarding cyber attacks that targeted them or their allies. Prior to discussing the cumulative experience of the collective attribution concept per se, and to illustrate the complete picture in this context, the first section of this Part reviews three international initiatives that the United States introduced to deter States and advance responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace in conjunction with holding States accountable by relying on the concept of collective attribution.\n## A. Collective Attribution Within International Initiatives\nDespite the legal obstacles and instrumental ambiguity noted above, the List of Non-Binding Norms remains the main international instrument to hold States accountable for wrongdoing that violates the voluntary norms of responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. This accountability is essential for establishing effective deterrence, while the attribution determination is a keystone for invoking accountability in any given incident.\nIn its updated National Cyber Strategy, the Trump Administration announced the launch of the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative to re\n2023), https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/huawei_china_claims/ (reporting on post of China’s Ministry of State Security on WeChat, in which the United States is accused of running cyber attacks and espionage for more than ten years against China, Russia, and forty-five other countries and regions, and of implanting backdoors in equipment and software and using American global technology brands to monitor and steal data).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ninforce efforts to deter States from violating the List of Non-Binding Norms through “official attribution,” “collective attribution,” a “naming and shaming” strategy, and through a “collective response” by jointly imposing sanctions against States accused of violating the List. Ultimately, no State has officially announced that it will join the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, not even the closest ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, although it promptly endorsed the pillars of the U.S. strategy. The International Cyber Deterrence Initiative has not evolved into an effective international initiative, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative or the International Counter Ransomware Initiative discussed below. In fact, the United States never officially launched the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, and senior U.S. officials have rarely referred to it.\nThe literature includes only one study that references the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, focusing solely on the collective response rather than the credible collective attribution that is implicitly a prerequisite to any collective response. Within this study, the scholar examined the policy embraced by each State party in the FVEY in building offensive cyber capabilities. The findings reveal that the FVEY States, excluding New Zealand, align with the approach of responding firmly to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Additionally, those States have developed the offensive cyber capabilities needed, among others, to uphold such a policy. The scholar concludes by suggesting that the FVEY and other like-minded allies enhance the credibility of their deterrent collective response\n. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12.\n.

It also calls on States to transparently impose costs under international law. The Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has only been invoked once since 2019. On February 21, 2020, fifteen out of the twenty-eight Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace partner States teamed up with Georgia and attributed responsibility to Russia for a disruptive cyber campaign conducted by the GRU. They politically denounced Russia and demanded it comply with the List of Non-Binding Norms.[115]\nTwo months later, on April 16, 2020, the Czech Republic's National Cyber and Information Security Agency warned of a real threat of serious cyber attacks against its healthcare sector amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The day after, the U.S. Secretary of State released a statement in which he mentioned the Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace framework and warned against conducting such dangerous cyber attacks or knowingly allowing them: \"Anyone that engages in such an action should expect consequences.\"[116] Eventually, the threat was not real\n114.

However, since the warning statements declined to identify the State allegedly behind the malicious plan, this cannot be labeled as a collective attribution. Moreover, neither the Czech nor the American authorities were transparent enough to convince observers that this was not a shot in the dark, but rather a successful preventive response to a credible and imminent threat.\nAs indicated above, neither the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative nor the Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has gained political significance. Unsurprisingly, the anticipation that States beyond the closest allies of the United States would align with American or British attribution statements and impose various costs—political, economic, and otherwise—proved unfounded. It appears that the United States has relinquished both initiatives and, together with its partners in the FVEY, has remained focused on the collective attribution endeavor, as detailed in the following section.\nHowever, beyond the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, in October 2021 the United States established an international initiative to counter the threat of ransomware cyber operations, which the Biden Administration has recently defined as a threat to U.S. national security. Although this International Counter Ransomware Initiative deals exclusively with criminally motivated ransomware cyber operations, it remains relevant in the context of the present discussion of collective attribution by States. This is because its primary goal is to uphold multinational cooperation to counteract ransomware threats and bolster both resiliency and deterrence. To achieve this, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative strengthens cooperation by facilitating the sharing of information and professional expertise among the participating States and private sector companies. More crucially for the focus of this article is its collaborative effort to detect and identify hackers or hacker groups involved in ransomware attacks, whether independently\n.

Similarly, the Initiative has not yet led to the attribution of responsibility to States that tolerate recurring cyber attacks initiated from their sovereign territories.\nRussia has already demonstrated that Russian ransomware gangs, such as REvil, may thrive or decline depending on the regime's willingness to cooperate.[121] Ultimately, increasing collaboration among the International Counter Ransomware Initiative States may encompass holding States accountable for ransomware cyber operations, even when initiated and directed from their sovereign territory, violating the due diligence principle. Apart from addressing the legal complexities associated with such accusations, the Initiative's parties may also seek to attribute responsibility and hold States accountable for what they have already defined as prohibited \"irresponsible behaviors.\"\nNonetheless, when upheld by a common multinational investigative team, the resulting attribution is collective and certainly more legitimate and credible.

An international law enforcement task force led by the UK's National Crime Agency and the FBI and consisting of eleven International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States (United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Netherlands, Finland, and Germany) successfully executed an international disruption campaign, taking control of the website and services (ransomware-as-a-service) of LockBit. This criminal hacking group is recognized as the world's most harmful cybercrime group. The outcomes of this operation included the seizure in three countries of LockBit's data exfiltration infrastructure by members of the task force. Two LockBit operatives were arrested in coordination with Europol. The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against two Russian citizens for conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks. The Department of Justice also announced that two defendants responsible for using LockBit to execute ransomware attacks were in custody and would face trial in the United States. The lessons learned from this experience could prove valuable for the United States and the United Kingdom in addressing the pitfalls of the current collective attribution process and response. This could serve as a test case demonstrating how successful cooperation between International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States can be in fighting criminally motivated, as well as politically motivated, cybercrime. Thus, the Initiative, in particular, may serve as an appropriate pilot for exploring optional solutions to better tackle the challenges associated with collective attributions and responses. More importantly, such solutions would enhance State accountability and the effectiveness of attributions in changing State behavior in cyberspace.\n## B. Table of Collective Attributions as of January 1, 2024\nThe number of collective attributions has been steadily increasing at a slow pace since the first on December 19, 2017. Thus far, the number has reached fourteen collective attributions. Each may refer to a single cyber attack or a campaign comprising a bulk of cyber activities that may even span over years.

Five Eyes' Key Role\nDespite being an intelligence alliance, the FVEY partners are not obligated to full transparency between their intelligence agencies. However, they do share intelligence at a level of confidentiality not extended to other allies. This alliance is the core of the collective attribution strategy, while the United States and the United Kingdom are its driving forces. They cooperate in investigating wide-scale cyber attacks by exchanging confidential information and mobilizing, separately or in conjunction, to assist victim\n. Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, *Significant Cyber Incidents*, https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents (last visited July 25, 2024) (timeline records significant cyber incidents since 2006); Congressional Research Service, *Cybersecurity: Selected Cyberattacks, 2012–2022* (updated Aug. 9, 2023), https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46974.\n. One indication reinforcing this assessment is taken from the recent Canadian attribution statement. Press Release, Glob. Affairs Canada, Statement on Russia’s Malicious Cyber Activity Affecting Europe and Ukraine (May 10, 2022), https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2022/05/statement-on-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-affecting-europe-and-ukraine.html (recalling each of the seven previous malicious cyber operations attributed to Russia. All are included in the table.). Another indication can be taken from the Press Release, UK Att’y Gen’s Off., Attorney General to Set Out the UK’s Position on Cybersecurity and International Law (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-to-set-out-the-uks-position-on-cybersecurity-and-international-law (this report enumerated examples of cyber attacks where the United Kingdom “named and shamed” State actors. All are included in the table.).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nStates upon their request, especially when their capability to investigate cyber attacks independently is poor or limited. Both the United States and the United Kingdom are responsible for all collective attributions listed in the table presented above, except one (Case 10), to be discussed below. The FVEY's attribution announcements are made concurrently and in coordination. However, they rely on sharing classified information, not on the findings of an independent FVEY multinational investigative team or any other form of international investigative mechanism. Like the decision to officially attribute State responsibility itself, endorsing an official attribution made by another State is a political prerogative for each sovereign State, which may announce it as its own official attribution. Such attribution determinations rely on various cumulative considerations, including the accuracy and credibility of evidence shared with all partners. While Canada has, thus far, actively participated in all collective attributions initiated by the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia refrained in three instances (Cases 6, 7, 13) and New Zealand in four (Cases 6, 7, 11, 13). Neither New Zealand nor Australia publicly justified their decision to refrain in each of these instances.\n## ii. EU and NATO Attributions or Partial Attribution Statements\nThe EU, representing twenty-seven European States, has had a notable practice of declarations in support of collective attributions. Thus far, it participated in eleven out of fourteen collective attributions, while NATO participated in six out of these same eleven attributions. However, the attribution statements on behalf of the EU and NATO could hardly be considered fully attributive. Instead, they may be perceived as a partial attribution of responsibility, making a limited contribution to the collective attribution strategy.\n. See, e.g., Cases 5, 13, supra Section IV(B) (providing examples in which the United Kingdom assisted the Georgian authorities in contending with and investigating the malicious cyber campaign); see Press Release, U.S. Embassy Tirana, Committed Partners in Cyberspace: U.S. Concludes First Defensive Hunt Operation in Albania (Mar. 23, 2023), https://al.usembassy.gov/committed-partners-in-cyberspace-u-s-concludes-first-defensive-hunt-operation-in-albania/.\n. At times, the dates on statements from Australia and New Zealand may not match those of other FVEY partners. However, the announcements are most likely published simultaneously with those of the FVEY partners, and at times the incompatibility of dates may be due to the different time zones.\nInternational Law Studies\n\n(a) The EU and NATO do not possess independent cyber investigative capabilities. Both rely heavily on more capable allies, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, EU and NATO member States, like Sweden, the Netherlands, Estonia, Austria, France, and Germany, each of which possess independent investigative capabilities, allegedly provide the EU security authorities with “deficient and incomplete” evidence in order to preserve the confidentiality of their cyber capabilities. To date, the EU has joined an official attribution initiated by one of its members only once (Case 10), and the attribution is highly questionable. NATO has never joined an attribution that was not initiated by the United States or the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that both States also face challenges in implementing a high degree of transparency with the EU security authorities due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of their intelligence sources. Nevertheless, the direct involvement of the United States and the United Kingdom in investigating cyber attacks appears to be a differentiating factor, possibly explaining why both, along with Canada and New Zealand, refrained from participating in the EU and Germany collective attribution (Case 10), while Australia settled for expressing solidarity.\n(b) The EU and NATO have joined collective attributions through brief declarations or statements issued on behalf of both Councils. The wording of these official declarations or statements must be cautious and measured to achieve unanimity within a truly brief period. Typically, they condemn the cyber attack in question, express concerns about it, and show solidarity with the affected States. The EU and NATO choose to avoid any explicit attribution of responsibility to the CRINK States. At the same time, the United States and the United Kingdom explicitly attribute responsibility primarily to specific official agents or organs of any State within the\n.

The EU and NATO refrain from attributing responsibility even to CRINK's official entities, such as intelligence agencies and national security institutions, which some of the U.S. or UK attribution determinations refer to in detail. In Case 9, for instance, the North Atlantic Council's statement acknowledges official statements made by its members—United States, United Kingdom, and Canada—attributing to China responsibility for compromising the Microsoft Exchange Server. The statement continues expressing solidarity with those who were affected, calling on \"all states, including China,\" to uphold their international commitments and \"act responsibly, including in cyberspace.\"131 Similarly, the EU's declaration refrains from explicitly attributing responsibility to China for malicious cyber activities, as opposed to the FVEY attribution statements.132 Instead, the EU \"strongly denounces\" these malicious cyber activities, urging China to comply with norms of responsible State behavior and prevent the use of its territory for such activities.133 The EU approach further differs from the FVEY by emphasizing adherence to the List of Non-Binding Norms, including due diligence, rather than strictly assigning State responsibility. However, challenges arise when applying due diligence to cyberspace, given uncertainties about its compatibility with the specific circumstances and the contested nature of its application in this\n131.

But see United States Joins with Allies, Including NATO, to Attribute Malicious Cyber Activities to China, 115 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 714, 715-21 (2021) (emphasizing coordination among the United States, NATO, and the EU, but overlooking the substantial discrepancies between the United States explicit attribution statement and the mitigated messages of the EU and North Atlantic Council statements).\n133.

Such statements may be more blatant and explicit than the EU's soft and general statements. An increased frequency of explicit independent statements, especially from cyber power States, aligning around the same conclusion in a specific cyber incident might impact the perceived legitimacy and credibility of the attribution determination in question. Nevertheless, such alignment is infrequent, contingent on the political cost-benefit calculation of each EU member State when deciding whether to act directly with full political responsibility through an official and independent statement.[135]\n# iii. Incoherency and Lack of Standardization\nThe collective FVEY attributions reviewed indicated incoherency, a lack of standardization, and an absence of transparent criteria, primarily in selecting which cyber operations the United States or the United Kingdom would lead the FVEY to collectively attribute. Likewise, there is uncertainty about the criteria guiding the EU and NATO in determining which attributions to publicly support, all while navigating possible political storms.[136] Questions persist regarding the degree of certainty justifying an attribution in the first place and how to measure that degree.[137] Further considerations involve the timing and format of coordinated announcements, whether through verbal statements by senior government officials (such as heads of states, relevant ministers, and senior officials from the U.S. National Security Council and their counterparts in other States), or by written statements of an authorized governmental agency or ministry, or both in concert.\n134.

See Cases 10, 11, supra Section IV(B).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nThe United States has been inconsistent in the way it has chosen to express its official attribution and synchronize it with its partners in the FVEY. At times, it settles for filing or unsealing indictments in absentia (e.g., Cases 4, 7) or for joining advisories (e.g., Case 6). Occasionally, the U.S. action of indicting and/or joining an advisory is in addition to an explicit official political announcement (e.g., Case 9). Conversely, the other \"Four Eyes\" always officially attribute responsibility through official announcements of senior officials, mostly by written statements of the relevant ministers.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of Case 10 as a collective attribution in the table is highly questionable. This marks the inaugural and sole instance where the EU independently initiated, on behalf of its member States, a statement, purported to collectively attribute responsibility.[138] It was primarily in response to Germany's official attribution and ostensibly at its request.[139] Ultimately, the declaration was more of an urgent general warning to Russia against interfering in European national democratic processes rather than a distinct attribution of responsibility for enduring wrongdoings.[140] However, to enable consensus among the twenty-seven EU member States, the statement's wording was softened and generalized, using \"some\" member States, instead of specifying the States, and \"associating\" the wrongdoing with them, instead of clearly \"attributing\" it to Russia.[141] Unsurprisingly, this declaration did not spur additional States to participate in this collective \"attribution,\" except Australia, which expressed its solidarity.[142] By stark contrast, the EU declaration in Case 14, which addresses the same threat of Russian interference in foreign States' democratic pro\n138.

Doubtful Credibility\nThere are only a small number of official attributions and an even smaller number of collective attributions that do not rely primarily on the American attribution process. The credibility and legitimacy deficiencies of the American attribution process, as highlighted in the previous Part—such as ambiguous normativity, limited transparency, and reliance on potentially biased American investigative teams instead of impartial multinational teams—persist unresolved in collective attributions. These issues may deter States from participating in explicit attributions as opposed to partial attributions. The cases reviewed indicate that States' willingness to participate in collective attributions based on the outcome of another State's national attribution process is limited, even if this system belongs to a cyber power State such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, the deterrence and effectiveness of such attributions also remain low.\nCase 11 requires a closer look as it raises serious doubts about the credibility of both the American and British attribution processes, and whether their outcomes are credible and persuasive enough to encourage a growing number of States to participate in such collective attributions. In this case, the Ukrainian Government suspected Russia just because it was then the only State interested in destabilizing Ukraine. Just forty-eight hours later, the United States and the United Kingdom provided the fastest attribution determination each of these allies had ever announced. It relied primarily on some technical information \"almost certainly\" linking the GRU to this cyber attack. Anne Neuberger, the White House's Deputy National Secu\n. Soesanto, supra note 141.\n.

Despite the United States sharing information with its allies for this swift attribution, only the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia joined this attribution while New Zealand and, more significantly, the EU, opted out. While the swift collective attribution may be linked to the looming possibility of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine set to commence in a few days, it does not necessarily justify what might be perceived by any impartial observer as taking shortcuts in the attribution process. This certainly does not enhance trust in the process; on the contrary, it raises concerns.\nThe absence of transparent standardization and criteria is crucial to maintain flexibility in reconciling two conflicting characteristics. On one hand, the List of Non-Binding Norms is non-enforceable due to legal ambiguities and difficulties that are not easily resolved in the contemporary geopolitical situation, as described above. On the other hand, there is the challenge of enhancing State compliance with the List to reduce global risks and instability. However, this flexibility is not necessarily an ad-\n147.

Shaping “Rules of the Road”\nAiming to bolster deterrence, the United States and the United Kingdom initiated the collective attribution process as a response to attacking States in cyberspace.[150] However, in the absence of normative clarity, attribution announcements refer to unacceptable and irresponsible State behavior, rather than specifying international rules or norms allegedly breached by the given cyber attack. Thus, the policy implemented usually involves delegitimization (\"naming and shaming\") and retorsions, lawful measures that can be imposed without the need for detailed legal justification. The objective is to shape \"rules of the road\" by specifying instances of unacceptable cyber activity on case-by-case bases and to develop State practice accordingly. This involves instilling among the entire community of nations the perspectives of collective attributors regarding which cyber operations may constitute irresponsible State behavior.[151] Such activities would be deemed irresponsible State behavior when conducted by official State agents or entities, as well as by hacking groups affiliated with these entities, operating under their instruction, direction, or control.[152] Although the List of Non-Binding Norms does not refer to economic or national security espionage, bilateral agreements and multinational commitments prohibit the theft of intellectual property (IP), trade secrets, and business information to gain competitive commercial advantages.[153] Such multinational commitments may be an additional source for shaping \"rules of the road\" in the commitments' context.\nThe cases reviewed can be categorized into subcategories representing types of irresponsible State behavior. Each subcategory has the potential to form specific prohibitions on certain types of conduct, akin to rules of the road. Below is a classification of the cases reviewed into four subcategories,\n150.

This is not a one-size-fits-all classification. Some cases can be classified under more than one subcategory (as exemplified below by Case 3).\n(a) Interfering with State democratic processes, primarily elections (Cases 3, 10, 14).\n(b) Endangerment of critical infrastructure and supply chain (Cases 3, 11, 12).\n(c) Interference in inherently governmental functions $^{154}$ (Cases 1, 2, 5, 7, 13).\n(d) Theft of IP and commercial secrets (economic espionage) $^{155}$ (Cases 4, 6, 8, 9).\nShaping rules of the road, case by case, could be more effective if the collective attributing States use each case as an opportunity to shape the applicable international rules in the given context. However, the United States and the United Kingdom have not yet taken any significant action in this direction. $^{156}$\nIn May 2022, the UK Attorney General addressed collective attribution and the ensuing response to the wrongdoing as important measures in shaping the international order in cyberspace. $^{157}$ She emphasized that\nThe law needs to be clear and well understood if it is to be part of a framework for governing international relations and to rein in irresponsible cyber behaviour.

Suella Braverman, UK Att'y Gen., International Law in Future Frontiers, Speech at Chatham House (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/international-law-in-future-frontiers.\n\nIn articulating this perspective using the norm of non-intervention, she recommends applying it to any State’s cyber activity that undermines another State’s ability to exercise control over matters that it is entitled to decide autonomously through the principle of State sovereignty. For additional clarity, she also suggests defining types of disruptive State cyber activities in various vulnerable sectors, such as energy security, essential medical care, economic stability, and democratic processes. Identifying a type of such cyber activity and examining it in its relevant context would determine whether it disrupts or denies another State’s ability to exercise its sovereign power to freely decide and act. If so, it would constitute a clear violation of the non-intervention norm, rendering it an unlawful activity. Since the UK Attorney General proposed this approach, the United States and the United Kingdom have jointly undertaken only two additional collective attributions (Cases 13, 14). However, instead of attributing unlawful cyber activities to Iran and Russia, the UK Foreign Secretary characterized Iranian actions as “reckless” and “unacceptable” and Russian actions as “completely unacceptable.” This aligns with the established practice of the FVEY, as evidenced in the cases reviewed. Nevertheless, adopting and implementing the British Attorney General’s integrated legal and political approach within the collective attribution strategy could potentially confer a more binding aspect to norms, such as the prohibitions on intervention and use of force, sovereignty of States, due diligence, and the boundaries of permitted espionage. This might create incentives for States, mindful of their reputation as responsible and law-abiding entities, to adhere to these norms as interpreted and applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, enforcing them through collective attribution and responses would be more consistent and coherent, thus, more effective in shaping State practice and international law.\n. Id.

Sanctions as a Collective Response\nAnother dimension of the legality of the attributed violation lies in the appropriate response. As mentioned earlier, both the FVEY and the EU confine their responses to retorsions, such as travel bans and asset freezing, undertaken against the entities and persons engaged in conducting the malicious cyber attacks in question. The expectation that a collective attribution would prompt retorsions from a high number of participating States, forming an effective collective deterrent response, has not materialized as of yet. Nevertheless, such a response has become a common practice of the United States and to a lesser extent, the EU and the FVEY.\nAt the level of the United States, sanctions are imposed with greater frequency against individuals and entities based on findings and charges detailed in joint advisories or unsealed indictments and law enforcement investigations. Despite the considerable number of sanctioned individuals and entities, many are government personnel and entities associated with the CRINK, and a significant number have also been indicted. While the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish but to bring about a positive change in behavior, this change has not materialized as of yet. At the level of the FVEY partners, the United Kingdom has regulated its own independent cyber related sanctions regime and occasionally imposed sanctions in coordination with the United States. Australia legislated a cyber sanctions law in December 2021. In January 2024, it implemented it for the first time against a Russian cybercriminal found responsible for the Medibank\n.

Moreover, the EU's process of imposing sanctions in response to cyber attacks is too slow and less effective; it may extend even beyond a year, as the decision must be unanimous and rely on evidence that can withstand judicial scrutiny. Thus far, the EU has sanctioned, under its cyber-related sanctions framework, only eight individuals and four entities affiliated with the CRINK, encompassing both asset freezes and travel bans. These sanctions were instituted in two phases, in July and October of 2020. As of now, no additional sanctions have been imposed through this channel, and there have been no challenges to review any of these sanctions before the European Court of Justice. Therefore, it seems that the EU cyber-sanction regime may have “already run its course,” as anticipated by some critics. Furthermore, a German research team, which analyzed the EU's collective response in Cases 1–4, questioned the effectiveness of such responses, doubting whether they “really have a deterrent effect on aggressors or are ultimately just symbolic politics.”\nDespite the above, this article does not purport to reach an unequivocal conclusion, based on sufficient credible information, regarding the effectiveness of the collective attribution and sanctions policy in achieving its primary objectives. These goals include deterring, disrupting, and demonstrating readiness to defend international norms and inducing a change in\n165. Media Release, Austl.

Ultimately, sanctions are not designed to punish but rather to motivate positive changes in State behavior. Given that the main outlaw States in cyberspace—Russia, Iran, and North Korea—are already subject to extensive multinational sanctions regimes for reasons unrelated to “irresponsible” malicious cyber operations, the impact of sanctions imposed as a response to malicious cyber activities is difficult to evaluate decisively. Nevertheless, the increasing frequency and scale of politically motivated cyber operations suggest that the deterring effect of collective attributions, along with retorsions, is weak. Due to the lack of authorized information regarding the outcomes of these sanctions and in the face of persistent politically motivated cyber attacks originating from the same culpable States and orchestrated by their governmental entities, it would not be inaccurate to argue that the effectiveness of this policy has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Meanwhile, it still has a symbolic, declarative impact needed to emphasize the red lines that States should not cross.\nIn conclusion, at present, collective attribution is no more than the upshot of the national attribution process, mostly American and British, with the addition of evidence sharing with like-minded States, in a manner that imposes no burden on the U.S. or UK intelligence community. The United States and the United Kingdom are always the driving force, while a CRINK State almost always stands on the receiving end. States and alliances participating in collective attributions, particularly the EU and FVEY, do not determine whether to join the attribution through direct involvement in investigative and attribution processes, but rather are influenced by political affiliations and international commitments within international frameworks, such as the G7, G20, and U.S.-EU or UK-EU dialogues. As a result, the collectiveness as implemented in the attribution process does not bolster the credibility of the American or British attribution determinations. This could notably change if the number of States committed to joining the attributions significantly increases, not due to political pressure or other political considerations, but rather due to an enhanced, joint, impartial, transparent, professional, and multinational process as the International Cyber Ransomware Initiative has recently demonstrated within its limited\n.

See Goldman, supra note 144.\nInternational Law Studies\n\n# V. CONCLUSION\nMore than a decade has passed since Leon Panetta first used the metaphor of the Pearl Harbor attack to depict how serious and risky a cyber attack could be, warning “potential aggressors . . . that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.” $^{174}$ Even graver and more precise warnings have been issued recurringly by U.S. presidents and senior officials in administrations since 2012. $^{175}$ President Biden, who during his first weeks in office had to handle a series of serious ransomware cyber operations originating in Russia that dealt a blow to U.S. public interests, announced: “I made it clear to President Putin . . . that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions—interfering with our elections . . .—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia . . .” $^{176}$ In the same speech, the President emphasized that only nations “working together and in common” can solve “the accelerating global challenges.” He added, “we [the United States] cannot do it alone.” That is easier said than done in the international arena. Despite technological developments that have improved attribution capabilities, the international community has not yet established a binding legal framework for cyberspace. Instead, the United States, along with the United Kingdom, has chosen to build upon a national official attribution system by imposing collective attribution and responses to the wrongdoing, aiming to concurrently achieve two goals: (1) to reinforce State deterrence through public collective attribution and imposing costs; and (2) shaping and internalizing “rules of the road” for responsible State behavior in cyberspace. $^{177}$\n173.

The United States, as the major attributor, assigns responsibility to specific States without allowing transparency regarding the evidence, the criteria of selecting the cases, and maintaining ambiguity about the legal grounds on which their charges rely. Furthermore, since the attribution determination in any given case is not subject to external and objective scrutiny, it is hard to indicate impartiality, legality, coherency, and consistency in the process, which collapses into one measure—attribution, accusation, judging, and punishing by retorsions. This is a far cry from satisfying any \"right\" or \"fair process.\" Thus far, the overwhelming majority of collective attributions have been American-led. The participants are American governmental experts, in cooperation mostly with American tech platforms whose loyalty to American national security interests is not questioned. There is no effort to involve independent, reputable international experts in the process, which is not sufficiently transparent and, on the face of things, may be perceived as one-sided. At most, the American process may constitute an exchange of views and intelligence sharing with counterpart agencies in the FVEY.\nClose and clandestine cooperation—among the FVEY—and sharing information with the EU's relevant institutions, as well as with a few like-minded States, is not enough to replace a proper procedure that would lend credibility and legitimacy to the process and its outcomes. The absence of representative, impartial multinational experts in the process exacerbates the legitimacy gap. This is even more true when the State at the receiving end of the attribution process is always a rival State from the CRINK group. Such dynamics erode the process' legitimacy and may discourage States from embracing its findings and joining the collective attributions, let alone responses. Moreover, it can explain the ineffectiveness of international initiatives, such as the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, and the negligible effectiveness of the collective attributions. This article pointed to one initiative, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which, in my opinion, has the potential to become more effective in countering ransomware and cooperating in law enforcement once the ransomware is detected or when credible intelligence can anticipate the details of the upcom\nsignal to Russia without any reference to specific international rules about the cost Russia might pay if it continues with its destabilizing actions).\n\nThis article presents the considerable cumulative experience gained from destructive and disruptive State or State-sponsored cyber attacks and their accompanying attribution processes. This, coupled with the growing number of States expressing their perspectives in enduring public debates regarding the terms and boundaries for applying major international norms to cyberspace,[179] illustrate the image of a wide-open field that must be fenced in by further development and regulation. In my opinion, there is fertile ground for a justified reevaluation of the collective attribution process and the responses to cyber wrongdoing. This is critical to bolster the credibility, legitimacy, and subsequently the effectiveness of these collective attributions in shaping the rules of road and enhancing State accountability.\n178.

Germany supported this attribution and added the Bundestag hack as another cyber attack attributed to GRU operatives.\nOn October 4, 2018, the Dutch and UK Prime Ministers made a joint statement attributing to the GRU responsibility for attempting to access the secure computer systems of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague. The statement explicitly connected this GRU cyber operation to other reckless cyber operations revealed on the same day.\nAlso on this day, the EU published a joint statement by the presidents of the Council of Europe and the European Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The statement was limited to the attack on the OPCW, with a general reference to the British accusations about further unacceptable cyber activities.\nThe United States indicted and sanctioned officers of the GRU for being involved in those cyber attacks. In July 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against four GRU officers who attempted a cyber attack against the OPCW. In October 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against the GRU’s Unit 26165 and two GRU officers who participated in the Bundestag Hack in 2015.\n.

It is highly likely that the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) ran this campaign through a hacker group known as the APT10, which was almost certainly responsible for a campaign of activity against global Managed Service Providers (MSPs) since at least 2016, widely known as Cloud Hopper.\nOn December 20, 2018, the United Kingdom officially attributed responsibility for this campaign to China's MSS. The U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously indicted and imposed personal sanctions on two Chinese hackers allegedly part of APT10 and involved in this cyber campaign. The following day, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada published official attribution statements with similar content. Japan and Germany joined these attribution determinations.\nAfter a four-month delay, the EU published a declaration focusing on APT10 malicious cyber activities, including IP theft, while avoiding explicit attribution to the Chinese Government.\n.

The SolarWinds Cyber Espionage (exposed in November 2020)\nOn April 15, 2021, the United States, joined by the United Kingdom, accused Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) operatives of conducting the SolarWinds cyber espionage operation, gaining access to tens of thousands of entities, including governmental, in the United States and worldwide. The other three State parties of the FVEY joined the collective attribution, whereas the EU statement expressed solidarity with the United States concerning the impact of malicious cyber activities, notably the SolarWinds hack, which, “the United States assesses,” was conducted by Russia. Similarly, the North Atlantic Council’s statement also expressed solidarity with the United States based on its assessments regarding Russia’s responsibility for the SolarWinds hack and called on Russia to comply with its international obligations.\n203.

The EU statement did not assign direct responsibility to China but emphasized that the malicious cyber activities were undertaken from China's territory, urging it to prevent such activities. The North Atlantic Council's statement \"acknowledges\" the statements made by the FVEY member States and expresses \"solidarity\" with those who were affected, calling on all States, \"including China,\" to uphold their international commitments.\n10. Interference in European States' Democratic Processes (September 2021)\nOn September 24, 2021, shortly before the German elections, the EU High Representative denounced Russia for trying to interfere in European democratic processes by accessing computer systems and personal accounts in the EU member States and stealing data. The official statement relied on \"some EU member states\" that have observed malicious cyber activities, \"collectively designated as Ghostwriter and associated these with the Russian state.\" The statement asserts that such activities contradict the List of Non-Binding Norms, calling to immediately cease them and urging Russia to adhere to the List. It is the first and only case in which the EU independently initiated a statement that purported to express a collective attribution.\n209.

DDoS Attack Against Ukraine (February 15–16, 2022)\nA week prior to the Russian invasion, an unprecedented DDoS attack crashed Ukrainian banks and government websites. Although the head of the Cybersecurity Department of Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it was too early to identify specific perpetrators, Ukraine pointed the finger at Russia as the only country interested in destabilizing Ukraine.[213] Forty-eight hours later, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia collectively blamed Russia for conducting the operation through its GRU. This collective attribution is exceptional primarily for one reason: It is the fastest political decision made to date officially attributing State responsibility.\n# 12. Blocking the KA-SAT Network (February 16, 2022)\nOn May 10, 2022, the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre assessed that Russia's GRU was almost certainly responsible for the cyber attack against ViaSat, a multinational communications provider, one hour prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This cyber attack, which is believed to have targeted the KA-SAT network to disrupt or cut off Ukraine's military communication, spilled over to civilian customers in Ukraine and across Europe, making tens of thousands of terminals inoperable in a manner that was irreversible. Based on these findings and new intelligence, the United Kingdom[214] and the United States,[215] joined by their partners in the FVEY[216] and the EU,[217] collectively attributed responsibility\n213.

Cyber Attacks Targeting Albanian Governmental Websites (July 15, 2022)\nOn September 7, 2022, Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran. The reason for such a serious response was a major cyber-campaign conducted against it nearly two months earlier. This campaign targeted significant Albanian government websites, including websites for providing essential public services and websites of the Albanian Parliament and Prime Minister's office.[218] Consequently, essential websites were shut down, and governmental data, including sensitive emails, were leaked. Although Albania is a NATO member State, it has not applied to activate Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Albania is not a cyber-power State. Therefore, it appealed to the United States, United Kingdom, and other capable States to investigate these cyber attacks and assist in ensuring resiliency. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have attributed State responsibility to Iran, while the EU and NATO have not deviated from their cautious path, avoiding explicit attribution statements.[219]\nIn September 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security and its Minister of Intelligence as engaging in cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies.[220]\n14.

The attribution determination is not necessarily contingent on legal proceedings. $^{18}$ The reasonableness of such an ex ante attribution must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and under no binding requirements of transparency and standard of proof. $^{19}$ Thus, it is no more than a public political denunciation, especially when not accompanied by legal claims and countermeasures. Although the attribution may rely on technical findings and additional evidence from any other source of information, it does not necessarily have to withstand the legal scrutiny that a formal legal attribution of State responsibility might face. As noted above, the difficulties of legally attributing State responsibility will be addressed in a subsequent article. For the purposes of the present article, it is worth noting the following: pursuant to the rules of State responsibility, a State harmed by a malicious cyber operation that is willing to officially attribute responsibility to an attacking State and has a legal justification for a lawful response, must meet two cumulative requirements.[20] The first is to indicate a breach of an international rule that binds States under circumstances like those of the cyber incident in question. This might be controversial as long as international cyber law remains in its embryonic stage and the extent and conditions under which customary rules of international law would apply to cyberspace as binding law continue to be open-ended. The second requirement is to identify a perpetrator suspected of breaching the international rule and substantiate their connection—either as an official agent or as a proxy—to a specific State. Thus far, none of the attributing States have faced demands to legally prove their attribution statement within the framework of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Due to cyberspace's unique characteristics and legal ambiguity, the legal demands for substantiating State responsibility in cyberspace are uncertain, making it more difficult to legally attribute such responsibility.[21] While legally attributing State responsibility for international"

In this context, Delbert Tran defined the \"attribution problem\" as a complete \"red herring.\"22 In circumstances where a sufficient degree of certainty (rather than absolute certainty) is enough to impose responsibility, and computer scientists have developed a range of tools to trace the culprits, the problem can be solved by \"configuring the law.\"23 Clement Guitton finds the attribution of State responsibility \"a lot more complex and nuanced,\" adding that the lack of binding standards of proof provides the States involved with great flexibility to manipulatively achieve their political aims.24 Nevertheless, the following section shows that leading cyber power States are not enthusiastic, to put it mildly, about officially attributing responsibility to other States for violating norms of responsible State behavior. This is despite the fact that official attribution is a political act, ostensibly exempt from meeting legal requirements, such as transparent and admissible evidence. To date, this process has never been applied in court with respect to cyber incidents. # A. Reluctance of States to Officially Attribute Responsibility During recent decades, States have conducted hundreds or thousands of disruptive and destructive cyber attacks either through their official organs and agents or through proxies. Only in a tiny fraction of cases did States officially attribute responsibility to other States based on technical and all-source intelligence. At times, these official attributions also relied on private sector contributions through confidential or nonconfidential reports of relevant companies. At least until the second half of 2017, victim States would refrain from officially attributing responsibility to another State unless they were amid an armed conflict, during which they often blamed OF INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION (Cesare P.R.

The “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance (“FVEY”)—United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—is exceptional. However, the United States shares its classified intelligence with its partners in this alliance and occasionally extends this practice to additional allied States such as France, Germany, and Japan. Nevertheless, the investigation team determining the attribution remains exclusively American. The limited number of participating States might also indicate that those States, which the United States and the United Kingdom interchangeably have not allowed to participate in the process or share classified information, are hesitant to blindly trust American or British intelligence assessments. Considering that the United States is the driving force behind these attributions and that its rivals, such as the CRINK States, are consistently on the receiving end underscores the importance of challenging the credibility of the process and its outcomes. Concurrently with intelligence-based attribution, the United States has endorsed, on its own, another method to mitigate the demand for transparency. This is attribution by indictment (\"naming and shaming\"). The next section will demonstrate that, despite its relative transparency, attribution by indictment has not proven a benchmark for credibility and trust. ## C. Attribution by Indictment Until now, the United States stands as the first and only State to “name and shame” by indicting, in absentia, foreign State-sponsored hackers, mostly citizens of the CRINK. They have been accused of breaching the U.S. Code by committing cybercrimes against Americans and U.S. entities. These indictments provide an opportunity to describe their worldwide malicious cyber activity. They include declassified information about unlawful cyber activities, shedding light on relevant State responsibility. This responsibility stems from the fact that, while committing the unlawful activities, the defendants were either State agents (such as soldiers, officers, or other government officials) or third parties under the State’s control, direction, instruction, or empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority.⁴⁸ However, indicting unlawful combatants, such as spies captured during peacetime or armed conflict while conducting their mission in the territory ⁴⁸. Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 20, arts. 4–5, 8. Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 of the accusing State, is unexceptional and reflects customary international law.⁴⁹ Nevertheless, indicting, in absentia, defendants identified as official agents of a foreign State for remotely hacking and damaging, during peacetime, targets located in the territory of the accusing State is both exceptional and unprecedented.⁵⁰ This could be acceptable if the hacks were criminally motivated and could not be attributed to a specific State, according to the Articles on State Responsibility. The U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, admitted that “traditional military and intelligence activity is a separate sphere of conduct that ought not be subject to domestic criminal law,” with the recognized exception noted above of charging intelligence officers operating undercover in the United States.⁵¹ Barr introduced new and unprecedented exceptions such as State-sponsored computer intrusions “for the purpose of intellectual property theft for the use of [the Chinese] private sector, bank robbery, and interfering with our democratic elections” and “deliberate, indiscriminate theft of vast amounts of sensitive personal data of civilians,”⁵² as occurred in the case of hacking Equifax. In Barr’s words, such cases “cannot be countenanced.”⁵³ In fact, such cases have led to the submission of indictments in deviation from the customary principles of international law and the recognized principle of criminal responsibility. One scholar labeled this a “judicialized attribution,” a new tool to convey more concrete and less political attribution focusing on the evidence and lawfulness of the behavior according to domestic law rather than international law.⁵⁴ This is despite the fact that both the superiors and subordinates who followed their orders purportedly committed the attributed crimes remotely from"

Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 ized and Christopher Ford, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State, credited American deterrence for this.¹¹⁷ However, since the warning statements declined to identify the State allegedly behind the malicious plan, this cannot be labeled as a collective attribution. Moreover, neither the Czech nor the American authorities were transparent enough to convince observers that this was not a shot in the dark, but rather a successful preventive response to a credible and imminent threat. As indicated above, neither the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative nor the Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has gained political significance. Unsurprisingly, the anticipation that States beyond the closest allies of the United States would align with American or British attribution statements and impose various costs—political, economic, and otherwise—proved unfounded. It appears that the United States has relinquished both initiatives and, together with its partners in the FVEY, has remained focused on the collective attribution endeavor, as detailed in the following section. However, beyond the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, in October 2021 the United States established an international initiative to counter the threat of ransomware cyber operations, which the Biden Administration has recently defined as a threat to U.S. national security.¹¹⁸ Although this International Counter Ransomware Initiative¹¹⁹ deals exclusively with criminally motivated ransomware cyber operations, it remains relevant in the context of the present discussion of collective attribution by States. This is because its primary goal is to uphold multinational cooperation to counteract ransomware threats and bolster both resiliency and deterrence. To achieve this, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative strengthens cooperation by facilitating the sharing of information and professional expertise among the participating States and private sector companies. More crucially for the focus of this article is its collaborative effort to detect and identify hackers or hacker groups involved in ransomware attacks, whether independently ¹¹⁷.

In other words, the Initiative establishes and maintains multinational collaboration to detect, identify, and attribute responsibility for malicious cyber attacks. Since its establishment in 2021, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative has consistently increased its membership and actively devised strategies to confront the substantial threat.[120] Despite these efforts, the Initiative has not yet urged its members to collectively attribute responsibility to States involved in conducting ransomware cyber attacks, either through their official State organs or third parties. Similarly, the Initiative has not yet led to the attribution of responsibility to States that tolerate recurring cyber attacks initiated from their sovereign territories. Russia has already demonstrated that Russian ransomware gangs, such as REvil, may thrive or decline depending on the regime's willingness to cooperate.[121] Ultimately, increasing collaboration among the International Counter Ransomware Initiative States may encompass holding States accountable for ransomware cyber operations, even when initiated and directed from their sovereign territory, violating the due diligence principle. Apart from addressing the legal complexities associated with such accusations, the Initiative's parties may also seek to attribute responsibility and hold States accountable for what they have already defined as prohibited \"irresponsible behaviors.\" Nonetheless, when upheld by a common multinational investigative team, the resulting attribution is collective and certainly more legitimate and credible.

This criminal hacking group is recognized as the world's most harmful cybercrime group. The outcomes of this operation included the seizure in three countries of LockBit's data exfiltration infrastructure by members of the task force. Two LockBit operatives were arrested in coordination with Europol. The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against two Russian citizens for conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks. The Department of Justice also announced that two defendants responsible for using LockBit to execute ransomware attacks were in custody and would face trial in the United States. The lessons learned from this experience could prove valuable for the United States and the United Kingdom in addressing the pitfalls of the current collective attribution process and response. This could serve as a test case demonstrating how successful cooperation between International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States can be in fighting criminally motivated, as well as politically motivated, cybercrime. Thus, the Initiative, in particular, may serve as an appropriate pilot for exploring optional solutions to better tackle the challenges associated with collective attributions and responses. More importantly, such solutions would enhance State accountability and the effectiveness of attributions in changing State behavior in cyberspace. ## B. Table of Collective Attributions as of January 1, 2024 The number of collective attributions has been steadily increasing at a slow pace since the first on December 19, 2017.

At times, it settles for filing or unsealing indictments in absentia (e.g., Cases 4, 7) or for joining advisories (e.g., Case 6). Occasionally, the U.S. action of indicting and/or joining an advisory is in addition to an explicit official political announcement (e.g., Case 9). Conversely, the other \"Four Eyes\" always officially attribute responsibility through official announcements of senior officials, mostly by written statements of the relevant ministers.

Doubtful Credibility There are only a small number of official attributions and an even smaller number of collective attributions that do not rely primarily on the American attribution process. The credibility and legitimacy deficiencies of the American attribution process, as highlighted in the previous Part—such as ambiguous normativity, limited transparency, and reliance on potentially biased American investigative teams instead of impartial multinational teams—persist unresolved in collective attributions. These issues may deter States from participating in explicit attributions as opposed to partial attributions. The cases reviewed indicate that States' willingness to participate in collective attributions based on the outcome of another State's national attribution process is limited, even if this system belongs to a cyber power State such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, the deterrence and effectiveness of such attributions also remain low.¹⁴⁴ Case 11 requires a closer look as it raises serious doubts about the credibility of both the American and British attribution processes, and whether their outcomes are credible and persuasive enough to encourage a growing number of States to participate in such collective attributions. In this case, the Ukrainian Government suspected Russia just because it was then the only State interested in destabilizing Ukraine.¹⁴⁵ Just forty-eight hours later, the United States and the United Kingdom provided the fastest attribution determination each of these allies had ever announced. It relied primarily on some technical information \"almost certainly\" linking the GRU to this cyber attack.¹⁴⁶ Anne Neuberger, the White House's Deputy National Secu ¹⁴³.

While the swift collective attribution may be linked to the looming possibility of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine set to commence in a few days, it does not necessarily justify what might be perceived by any impartial observer as taking shortcuts in the attribution process. This certainly does not enhance trust in the process; on the contrary, it raises concerns. The absence of transparent standardization and criteria is crucial to maintain flexibility in reconciling two conflicting characteristics. On one hand, the List of Non-Binding Norms is non-enforceable due to legal ambiguities and difficulties that are not easily resolved in the contemporary geopolitical situation, as described above. On the other hand, there is the challenge of enhancing State compliance with the List to reduce global risks and instability. However, this flexibility is not necessarily an ad-"

INTRODUCTION\nTwelve years ago, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was the first to warn of the threat of a cyber \"Pearl Harbor\" or a cyber \"9/11\" terrorist attack, as well as of cyber threats that \"could virtually paralyze the nation.\"¹ Ten years later, Costa Rica was the victim of an unprecedented assault when ransomware cyber attacks virtually paralyzed it to the extent that its president had to officially declare a state of emergency. Albania, a NATO member State, severed diplomatic ties with Iran following Iranian cyber attacks that aimed to cripple Albania's online government services and leak sensitive emails and government data.² In an era of global interconnectedness, the risks are borderless, severe global effects are at stake, and even sensitive national security computer control systems can be targeted. Unsurprisingly, these threatening cyber capabilities carry strategic implications for geopolitics, including the \"Great Power Competition.\"³ This rivalry between powers, coupled with deep ideological disparities (democratic versus authoritarian values), has become a major obstacle in ensuring global safety and stability in and through cyberspace. Rather than reaching a universal consensus on binding comprehensive international regulation, the international community, influenced by the conflicting views of competing powers, has made little headway.

This ambiguity provides major powers with enough leeway to strive for “cyberspace superiority”⁵ while ostensibly maintaining their reputation as law-abiding nations. On the other side of the fence, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea (CRINK) have exploited this ambiguity and the technical characteristics of cyberspace for advancing their interests. Under such circumstances, the List of Non-Binding Norms’s effectiveness in changing State behavior and the level of State compliance are low. Moreover, the norms’ effectiveness and State compliance are influenced by the extent to which the norms and the process of application are perceived as legitimate, as well as the degree to which the outcomes align with the expectations derived from these norms and processes.⁶\n⁴.

To gauge the extent to which the United States has developed its attribution policy in the past decade, it is worth revisiting Secretary Panetta's 2012 remarks.⁷ In response to two consecutive destructive cyber attacks, he hinted at the improving technological capabilities to address the attribution problem by identifying cyber attackers and attributing responsibility.⁸ Therefore, “potential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions that may try to harm America.”⁹ However, it is important to note that neither the United States nor the direct victim States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, officially attributed responsibility for these cyber attacks to Iran, even though its responsibility has been widely accepted.\nIn fact, my previous published research on State practice in cyberspace between 2012 and 2018, co-authored with Yuval Shany, revealed that explicit official attributions were the exception during that period.¹⁰ Nonetheless, the last two attribution determinations addressed in that study indicated a shift from national official attributions toward collective attributions.¹¹\nIndeed, the collective activity of nations in attributing responsibility to States for irresponsible behavior in cyberspace and in responding to such behavior has become a vital component of the deterrence pillar within the U.S. National Cyber Strategy. The United Kingdom, the closest ally to the United States, has endorsed this strategy.¹²\n7. Panetta, supra note 1.

In this article “cyber attacks,” “cyber operations,” and “cyber activities” are used interchangeably, but the article focuses on politically motivated incidents, that is, cyber attacks conducted by States through their official organs and agents or through third parties as proxies.\n9.

For the purposes of this article, “official attribution” refers to any public, verbal or non-verbal, statement made by a senior official of a State authorized to formally attribute responsibility for a given cyber attack to another State. Heads of State, ministries of foreign affairs, and other ministries whose mandate includes cybersecurity naturally hold such authority. As such, official attributions must be both public and political. Therefore, in this research, indictments filed or unsealed by the U.S. Department of Justice, personal sanctions imposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury, advisory alerts issued by the U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, and other reports from national law enforcement agencies, cannot on their own constitute an official attribution of responsibility to a State. However, they can certainly provide grounds for the United States and other States to attribute responsibility officially and explicitly to another State. Subsequently, the term “collective attribution” refers to a State’s official attribution joined by at least one other nation’s official attribution. Alternately, it shall apply if the State’s official attribution announcement is accompanied simultaneously and in coordination with another State officially announcing a response to the same cyber operation through indictments, sanctions, or joint advisories.\nThis article evaluates whether the collective attribution process and its outcomes can be perceived as legitimate and credible by the international community, including impartial, nonaligned States. Furthermore, it evaluates whether this process has become a crucial component in effectively holding States accountable for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms and in deterring States from such violations. Analyzing these and related issues requires a sound understanding of the official attribution process in practice, focusing on identifying legitimacy and credibility disparities, and researching the collective attributions announced so far. The article is built exclusively upon open-source intelligence.\nThe article continues as follows. Part II describes the official attribution process, differentiating between technological, legal, and political attributions and discussing the reluctance of States to officially attribute re\nes/deterrence-in-the-cyber-age-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary (presenting the United Kingdom’s deterrence strategy, mirroring the U.S. approach).\n274\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nsponsibility. Part III explores major aspects of the American attribution process, the most influential one, excluding the internal division of labor among the U.S. national security and law enforcement entities. It includes five sections that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could affect the extent to which the process's outcomes would be perceived as credible and legitimate. The first is the instrumental ambiguity the United States has embraced in the absence of a binding international convention, which has an adverse effect on transparency and source-based legitimacy. The subsequent three sections—intelligence-based attribution, attribution by indictment, and the private sector's role in ensuring cyber security—are important for mitigating the challenge of transparency but are still insufficient to ensure credibility and legitimacy. The fifth section explores collaboration between the private sector, particularly American corporations, including the most powerful tech platforms globally, and U.S. national security entities responsible for the American attribution process. This all-American collaboration may raise serious concerns among non-American constituencies about the credibility and legitimacy of the U.S. attribution process and its outcomes. Part IV delves into the specific collective attributions starting with three international initiatives. Two of these, initially planned to catalyze and empower collective attributions, have already faded, while the third initiative holds potential as part of a solution. Section IV(B) is a table that succinctly presents fourteen cases of collective attribution, spanning from the first collective attribution on December 19, 2017, until January 1, 2024. A detailed overview of these fourteen cases appears as an annex at the end of this article. Section IV(C) analyzes the findings. Part V concludes.\n## II.

Any savvy hacker, let alone a government or State-sponsored one, is capable of manipulatively concealing their identity and astutely misdirecting would-be trackers. Nonetheless, today, the prevalent view has changed; while still challenging and occasionally time-consuming, it has become more feasible to uncover the true facts. Advanced cyber forensic investigative capabilities, which cyber power States and powerful cyber security firms possess, may enable them to unmask authentic technical features of a cyber attack, including the computers involved in the operation and their geographic locations. They may even identify the hacker or group of hackers according to their authentic technological fingerprints, precluding manipulative attempts to deceive and mislead the investigators. Such technical findings may lead to a technical attribution,¹⁵ which mostly lacks credible responses to the following questions: Who, in fact, stands behind the hackers who conducted the given cyber attack? What are the real motives? Was a State involved, and to what extent?¹⁶\nCompleting the missing pieces of the puzzle by gathering evidence from all-source intelligence may fill the probability gaps, enabling States to officially attribute responsibility to another State for unlawful cyber operations targeting other States. Nevertheless, this task remains easier said than done, particularly considering the challenges associated with legally attributing State responsibility, which I will address in a subsequent article.\n14. Compare Nicholas Tsagourias, Cyberattacks, Self-Defence and the Problem of Attribution, 17 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT AND SECURITY LAW 229 (2012), with Panetta, supra note 1.\n15. The term “technical attribution” is somehow misleading since technical attribution mostly does not result in clear attribution of responsibility to a State. At most, it is an estimated attribution of responsibility to a group of hackers based on the findings of tactics, techniques, and procedures. Reviewing the methods and techniques used in the discourse of technical investigations is beyond the scope of this article. For more information on this topic, see D.D. Clark &amp; S. Landau, Untangling Attribution, in PROCEEDINGS OF A WORKSHOP ON DETERING CYBERATTACKS: INFORMING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING OPTIONS FOR U.S. POLICY 25, 25–40 (2010); see also sources cited in supra note 13.\n16.

Even if the information includes enough evidence for attribution, the victim State's political leadership must weigh a wide range of strategic considerations and then determine whether to officially attribute responsibility; what level of transparency to implement; whether to retaliate, and if so, how, covertly or overtly; and which type of response would be perceived as lawful or legitimate in the given circumstances?\nA State might avoid an official attribution to preclude risks and actions that do not coincide with its national security interests, such as jeopardizing intelligence sources, disclosing intelligence gaps that the victim State may have pertaining to its rivals' cyber capabilities, exposing the victim State's confidential cyber capabilities, and averting the significant risk of misattribution, which could lead policymakers to wrongly engage in retribution and escalation.\nFurthermore, by refraining from public attribution, the victim State eliminates public pressure for retaliation and may lead the culprit State to believe it has not been detected. This strategy could allow the victim State to covertly monitor the operation and gather valuable intelligence about its rival's cyber capabilities. Additionally, it could facilitate the detection of additional covert operations employing the same cyber techniques while also considering disinformation or deception operations. Moreover, powers that still obscure their political and legal approaches to pending cyber legal questions—such as the boundaries of legitimate \"cyber espionage,\" the clear threshold for constituting a prohibited \"use of force\" and a prohibited intervention, and how \"territorial sovereignty\" should be applied in cyberspace—might hesitate to officially attribute responsibility in specific circumstances. This is because such attribution could reduce the legal ambiguity these States have embraced to preserve their technological edge and maintain strategic leeway.\nTherefore, attribution is primarily a political decision relying on prudent and thorough discretion on whether to officially attribute responsibil-\n17.

The attribution determination is not necessarily contingent on legal proceedings. $^{18}$  The reasonableness of such an ex ante attribution must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and under no binding requirements of transparency and standard of proof. $^{19}$  Thus, it is no more than a public political denunciation, especially when not accompanied by legal claims and countermeasures. Although the attribution may rely on technical findings and additional evidence from any other source of information, it does not necessarily have to withstand the legal scrutiny that a formal legal attribution of State responsibility might face.\nAs noted above, the difficulties of legally attributing State responsibility will be addressed in a subsequent article. For the purposes of the present article, it is worth noting the following: pursuant to the rules of State responsibility, a State harmed by a malicious cyber operation that is willing to officially attribute responsibility to an attacking State and has a legal justification for a lawful response, must meet two cumulative requirements. The first is to indicate a breach of an international rule that binds States under circumstances like those of the cyber incident in question. This might be controversial as long as international cyber law remains in its embryonic stage and the extent and conditions under which customary rules of international law would apply to cyberspace as binding law continue to be open-ended. The second requirement is to identify a perpetrator suspected of breaching the international rule and substantiate their connection—either as an official agent or as a proxy—to a specific State.\nThus far, none of the attributing States have faced demands to legally prove their attribution statement within the framework of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Due to cyberspace's unique characteristics and legal ambiguity, the legal demands for substantiating State responsibility in cyberspace are uncertain, making it more difficult to legally attribute such responsibility. While legally attributing State responsibility for international\n18. GUITTON, supra note 13, at 86.\n19. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0 ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER OPERATIONS 82-83 (Michael N.

In this context, Delbert Tran defined the \"attribution problem\" as a complete \"red herring.\"22 In circumstances where a sufficient degree of certainty (rather than absolute certainty) is enough to impose responsibility, and computer scientists have developed a range of tools to trace the culprits, the problem can be solved by \"configuring the law.\"23 Clement Guitton finds the attribution of State responsibility \"a lot more complex and nuanced,\" adding that the lack of binding standards of proof provides the States involved with great flexibility to manipulatively achieve their political aims.24\nNevertheless, the following section shows that leading cyber power States are not enthusiastic, to put it mildly, about officially attributing responsibility to other States for violating norms of responsible State behavior. This is despite the fact that official attribution is a political act, ostensibly exempt from meeting legal requirements, such as transparent and admissible evidence. To date, this process has never been applied in court with respect to cyber incidents.\n# A. Reluctance of States to Officially Attribute Responsibility\nDuring recent decades, States have conducted hundreds or thousands of disruptive and destructive cyber attacks either through their official organs and agents or through proxies. Only in a tiny fraction of cases did States officially attribute responsibility to other States based on technical and all-source intelligence. At times, these official attributions also relied on private sector contributions through confidential or nonconfidential reports of relevant companies. At least until the second half of 2017, victim States would refrain from officially attributing responsibility to another State unless they were amid an armed conflict, during which they often blamed\nOF INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION (Cesare P.R.

The United States did so only twice, both in rare circumstances: attribution to North Korea for executing the Sony Pictures hack (December 2014), and attribution to Russia for conducting the Democratic National Committee hack and additional cyber operations meddling in the American election campaign (2016).²⁶ Another well-known damaging cyber attack, the Ababil operation (distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against New York's financial sector in 2011–2013), was investigated and, three years later, resulted in indicting in absentia foreign operatives who were Iranian government agents.²⁷ The detailed indictment, on the face of things, could be sufficient for officially attributing responsibility to the Iranian regime. However, the U.S. Administration declined to follow this path, likely due to political and national security considerations. The United States implemented the same approach and refrained from official attributions on additional occasions when the Department of Justice also indicted Chinese, Russian, and North Korean governmental operatives for breaching U.S. law.²⁸\nThe United Kingdom also avoided officially attributing State responsibility until October 2017, when it did so for the first time with respect to the WannaCry cyber attack.²⁹ Interestingly, France continues to embrace a\n25.

One possible explanation might have been the relentless Russian attempts to meddle in the tense September 26, 2021, German elections and the urgent need to stop those attempts. The second, and so far, the last, exceptional official attribution reinforced this estimation. On September 5, 2021, Germany officially attributed to Russia responsibility for cyber attacks conducted by a cyber group dubbed Ghostwriter, even though the evidence was not “hard” but “reliable information” that established “suspicions” against the GRU.³⁶ This triggered an official diplomatic protest and an investigation, yet no one waited for its final findings due to the short time left (three weeks) until the elections.\nIt is noteworthy that this was the first report of a State officially holding another State accountable for a cyber attack and responding with an official diplomatic protest, relying on information that merely met the level of “suspicions.” Apparently, this sort of cutting corners or lowering the bar of evidence stemmed from the urgent need to stop or deter Russia from interfering with the quickly approaching German elections race. This coincides with the principle, according to which an official attribution is a purely political decision, not necessarily a legal attribution that should meet specific legal requirements.

However, in the absence of multinational, impartial, legal, and professional scrutiny regarding the accuracy and lawfulness of the official attribution in any given situation, attributing States must be mindful of how various constituencies could perceive their attribution statements. Without accepted clear and binding rules, these statements may not be viewed as lawful. Nevertheless, there is a concerted effort to influence public opinion through enhancing the legitimacy of the attribution process.

Except for attribution by indictment, these segments are relevant to the UK attribution process, as well as those of other like-minded cyber power States. Unlike authoritarian regimes, these States have embraced the courses of action described in the following sections to contend with the demand for transparency while striving to achieve the best result for their own national security interests.\n# A. An Instrumental Ambiguity\nCyberspace's unique technological attributes produce opportunities for cyber power States to surreptitiously generate significant strategic gains through covert cyber operations, thereby minimizing the risk of being held accountable for breaching the law and harming their reputation as law abiding States. On the one hand, States strive to evade legal responsibility by distancing themselves from any factual or legal linkage to the malicious cyber operations in question. On the other hand, national security interests dictate the non-disclosure of classified information for both victim and attacking States. However, such data could help them substantiate arguments to strengthen or dismiss relevant accusations.\nAs mentioned above, States, particularly the leading powers involved in the Great Power Competition, have embraced instrumental ambiguity, including maintaining silence on questions related to the interpretation and application of recognized principles and rules of customary international law in cyberspace. The primary motive behind this policy is to retain a sufficient margin of maneuver to enable the protection and promotion of strategic national interests in the rapidly evolving cybersphere. This policy of ambiguity inherently leads to accountability gaps that the most influential cyber power States, like the United States, are reluctant to resolve. Nevertheless, it is crucial for these States to play a decisive role in shaping international cyber law in a manner and at a time that aligns best with their national security interests. Unsurprisingly, they seek to avoid situations requiring an independent, international, judicial forum, such as the International Court of Justice, to resolve legal ambiguities surrounding State conduct in cyberspace.\nNotwithstanding the growing number of States that have clarified, albeit partially and cautiously, their views about a limited number of legal questions, the policy of ambiguity still prevails. The policy influences policymakers when considering whether to officially attribute responsibility and\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nwhen considering how transparent to be regarding relevant evidence and legal arguments.³⁹\nOfficial attribution regarding cyber incidents in itself does not eliminate the need for transparency. This requirement is inherent in the legal obligation to substantiate State responsibility in both non-cyber and cyber incidents.⁴⁰ Transparency is essential to legitimize the official attribution by reflecting its “right process” through its process-based and outcome-based legitimacy.⁴¹ In the absence of accessible international judicial or quasi-judicial forums, as well as an impartial international monitoring institution, conflicting States might seek to influence the final “judgment” of the “international court of legitimacy.” This type of influence often involves legitimizing one side while delegitimizing the other. To achieve this, States should enhance transparency regarding their findings and, more importantly, with respect to processes and procedures undertaken. This includes ensuring that they align with Thomas Franck’s concept of the “right process.”⁴² The degree to which this transparency is genuine and comprehensive serves to strengthen their arguments in attributing responsibility or denying it, respectively.\nRelying solely on the investigative role of the United States or the United Kingdom, coupled with limited transparency and unwillingness to disclose persuasive evidence, opens the door to plausible deniability. Excluding independent, objective, and multinational experts, as well as representatives from other States, from participating in the attribution process also provides grounds for criticizing the integrity of the process. The absence of these persons may raise concerns about the process being flawed, unfounded, politically biased, and non-transparent, thus, not credible or legit-\n³⁹.

These concerns are particularly significant given the common reality of blanket denials by accused States.\nShould a State that officially attributes State responsibility for wrongful acts in cyberspace evade disclosure of the evidence and confidential information upon which the attribution and, if undertaken, retribution rely?\nThe first to address this question, in November 2016, was Brian Egan, U.S. State Department Legal Advisor, who noted that States are not required to act with full transparency when attributing responsibility to another State.43 Since then, a growing number of States have embraced a legal stance that denies the obligation to reveal classified evidence prior to attribution or countermeasures, making the extent of disclosure a matter of policy that often involves complex considerations.44 Striking a balance between accountability, diplomatic relations, and, most importantly, national security, including the strategic interest of maintaining instrumental ambiguity, remains a significant challenge in the evolving landscape of cyberspace governance. Yet simply prioritizing national security interests to the extent of excluding transparency may erode trust in the attribution statement. Nevertheless, powers like the United States and the United Kingdom, which possess advanced cyber capabilities and robust intelligence, do not hesitate to base their attribution claims solely on their intelligence assessment system, thereby preserving confidentiality and national security interests.\n## B. Intelligence-Based Attribution\nThe term \"intelligence assessment\" usually does not imply absolute certainty nor admissibility in court but rather the degree of certainty and credibility with which a certain factual narrative should be perceived, using the qualifiers of the national intelligence community about high, moderate, or low likelihood/certainty of the narrative as described in the attribution statement.45 The degree of certainty obviously depends on the level of trust in the information collected and the extent to which it is considered reliable and credible. The more reliable and credible, the higher the degree of cer\n43.

Cyber Law Toolkit, supra note 39.\n45. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, supra note 13.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ntainty, and the more that information may whet the policymakers' appetites to officially attribute responsibility to the culprit State if additional political considerations justify such an attribution.\nUp to this point, the United States and the United Kingdom have adhered to this official format of attribution, responding publicly with measures such as diplomatic démarche and sanctions when attributions were based on an intelligence assessment of high certainty and the interest of national security allowed a limited transparency to withstand an appropriate judicial or administrative review. By endorsing this practice, both States have averted compromising sensitive intelligence to justify their official attribution and retorsion, which is a response within the prerogative of any State. Even if the attribution of State responsibility proves to be mistaken, the response undertaken remains lawful, albeit unfriendly, and is often reciprocally retaliated. Nevertheless, covert cyber operations remain a viable response, either alongside or instead of retorsions. However, if exposed, their legality would inevitably be challenged.\nCritics of intelligence assessment as major grounds for attribution argue that it relies on criteria that \"may at best amount to circumstantial evidence,\" far below the evidentiary standards used in courts. This allows States to manipulate cases to fit preconceived narratives and embody political agendas; it may lead to misleading results involving the misinterpretation of information influenced by what later turns out to be a false conception.\nNone of the official American attributions since 2014, nor any of the collective attributions that the United States and the United Kingdom have announced since 2017, have corroborated this criticism. Both States have officially attributed responsibility relying on their intelligence and a high degree of certainty (\"almost certainly\"). Some of these attributions have also referred to open-source investigative reports and technological findings of tech and cyber security companies, mostly American, as discussed below. Others were also followed, months or even years later, by detailed American indictments delivering the message that they rely on sufficient and admissible evidence. However, only a limited number of States have been sufficiently convinced or politically motivated to officially adopt and join these attribution statements. Even these States did not do so because they truly participated in the attribution process itself or obtained access to\n46. GUITTON, supra note 13, at 98–99.\n47. Id.\n287\nInternational Law Studies\n2024\nhighly classified and credible intelligence materials supporting the intelligence assessment. The “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance (“FVEY”)—United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—is exceptional. However, the United States shares its classified intelligence with its partners in this alliance and occasionally extends this practice to additional allied States such as France, Germany, and Japan.\nNevertheless, the investigation team determining the attribution remains exclusively American. The limited number of participating States might also indicate that those States, which the United States and the United Kingdom interchangeably have not allowed to participate in the process or share classified information, are hesitant to blindly trust American or British intelligence assessments. Considering that the United States is the driving force behind these attributions and that its rivals, such as the CRINK States, are consistently on the receiving end underscores the importance of challenging the credibility of the process and its outcomes.\nConcurrently with intelligence-based attribution, the United States has endorsed, on its own, another method to mitigate the demand for transparency. This is attribution by indictment (\"naming and shaming\"). The next section will demonstrate that, despite its relative transparency, attribution by indictment has not proven a benchmark for credibility and trust.\n## C. Attribution by Indictment\nUntil now, the United States stands as the first and only State to “name and shame” by indicting, in absentia, foreign State-sponsored hackers, mostly citizens of the CRINK. They have been accused of breaching the U.S. Code by committing cybercrimes against Americans and U.S. entities. These indictments provide an opportunity to describe their worldwide malicious cyber activity. They include declassified information about unlawful cyber activities, shedding light on relevant State responsibility. This responsibility stems from the fact that, while committing the unlawful activities, the defendants were either State agents (such as soldiers, officers, or other government officials) or third parties under the State’s control, direction, instruction, or empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority.⁴⁸\nHowever, indicting unlawful combatants, such as spies captured during peacetime or armed conflict while conducting their mission in the territory\n⁴⁸. Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 20, arts. 4–5, 8.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nof the accusing State, is unexceptional and reflects customary international law.⁴⁹ Nevertheless, indicting, in absentia, defendants identified as official agents of a foreign State for remotely hacking and damaging, during peacetime, targets located in the territory of the accusing State is both exceptional and unprecedented.⁵⁰ This could be acceptable if the hacks were criminally motivated and could not be attributed to a specific State, according to the Articles on State Responsibility.\nThe U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, admitted that “traditional military and intelligence activity is a separate sphere of conduct that ought not be subject to domestic criminal law,” with the recognized exception noted above of charging intelligence officers operating undercover in the United States.⁵¹ Barr introduced new and unprecedented exceptions such as State-sponsored computer intrusions “for the purpose of intellectual property theft for the use of [the Chinese] private sector, bank robbery, and interfering with our democratic elections” and “deliberate, indiscriminate theft of vast amounts of sensitive personal data of civilians,”⁵² as occurred in the case of hacking Equifax. In Barr’s words, such cases “cannot be countenanced.”⁵³ In fact, such cases have led to the submission of indictments in deviation from the customary principles of international law and the recognized principle of criminal responsibility. One scholar labeled this a “judicialized attribution,” a new tool to convey more concrete and less political attribution focusing on the evidence and lawfulness of the behavior according to domestic law rather than international law.⁵⁴ This is despite the fact that both the superiors and subordinates who followed their orders purportedly committed the attributed crimes remotely from\n49.

While both superiors and subordinates are official agents of rival States and out of reach for American law enforcement authorities, indicting only the subordinates in absentia is legally contested. Unsurprisingly, such a practice has not been adopted by other States.\nFurthermore, invoking this policy of indictments requires proceeding in front of a federal grand jury to investigate and decide whether and on what charges to indict. This process is expected to be unbiased, reinforcing the indictment's credibility. However, the jury operates behind closed doors, hearing the federal prosecutor and live testimonies of relevant witnesses, mostly federal investigators, and American cyber security and technology experts. In fact, the process is controlled and guided by the federal prosecutor of the case rather than a judge. Moreover, the indictments may also rely on evidence from American tech and cybersecurity companies, which, as explored below, closely collaborate with local governmental authorities. The national loyalty of these companies is often taken for granted.55 While this perception may not be entirely accurate, it is sufficient to undermine the trust in the impartiality and credibility of the American attribution process by significant portions of the international community, particularly populations and governments in the Global South.\nMoreover, Article 28(f) of the 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report approved by the UN General Assembly asserts that \"the accusation of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against states should be substantiated.\"56 The question of whether the American and British practice in this regard meets this requirement is still contested. As mentioned above, a growing number of States have publicly endorsed the view that States attributing responsibility do not need to disclose classified evidence. States like the United States and the United Kingdom maintain that their findings are substantiated by the professional work of criminal investigators, tech experts, and intelligence professionals who\n55.

U.N. Doc. A/70/174, supra note 4.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ndo not violate Article 28, which is silent about the ways in which accusations should be substantiated.\nIn contrast, the CRINK States, the exclusive subjects of such attribution processes, often disregard or automatically reject the accusations against them. Russia consistently demands that attributing States substantiate their accusations by revealing evidence, particularly forensic or technical evidence.57 China, which always criticizes the U.S. tendency to function as the \"global sheriff,\" has recently responded by employing the same attribution approach, directing accusations toward the United States for cyber attacks allegedly conducted against Chinese entities.58\nInterestingly, the Obama Administration, striving to avoid escalation and miscalculation, refrained from officially attributing explicit responsibility to States for specific cyber attacks and preferred to do so indirectly by unsealing an indictment against Iranians three years later.59 A shift has been noted since 2018 when indictments started to complement the administration's official attribution statements. However, the policy in this regard remains inconsistent. Not every official attribution is accompanied by indictment, and conversely, not every indictment is accompanied by an official attribution.\n57.

Thus, when indictments accompany official attributions, they are expected to bolster the attributions' \"overall credibility.\"60 The target audiences for the indictments are particularly like-minded and neutral governments that are expected to be aware of the credibility of the American criminal proceedings. Consequently, they are likely to perceive this implicit attribution of responsibility through such indictments as credible enough to draw lessons. Subsequently, they may consider whether and to what extent these lessons should affect their own policy, particularly regarding the \"irresponsible behavior\" of a State and its respective risks in cyberspace.\nThus far, the United States has not succeeded in prompting even a single State, not even its closest ally, the United Kingdom, to follow it in implementing this \"naming and shaming\" strategy. Unsurprisingly, this American strategy has not deterred the CRINK States. As the FBI's Deputy Director put it when announcing another indictment: \"Time and again, Russia has made it clear: They will not abide by accepted norms, and instead, they intend to continue their destructive, destabilizing cyber behavior.\"61 Additionally, U.S. federal indictments, even when accompanied by collective attributions, have not significantly increased the number of States joining the collective attribution.62 This, coupled with the growing number of CRINK-sponsored cyber attacks, raises significant doubts about the extent to which this strategy is indeed effective. The responses to these doubts vary widely. Some scholars opine that this strategy appears to be a failure and \"even might be self-defeating.\"63 In contrast, others argue that it serves more than just deterrence, notably enabling other actions like sanctions to\n60.

On the one hand, it purportedly maintains credible evidence and a reasonable degree of transparency through detailed charges sufficient for imposing ex parte administrative personal sanctions against unreachable foreign defendants. On the other hand, none of these defendants are likely to extradite themselves to challenge the legal and administrative proceedings, including the credibility of the evidence. The U.S. Assistant Attorney General described the indictments as “just a piece of the puzzle,” representing a critical, credible step towards imposing meaningful consequences, adding that it is part of building consensus inside and outside the United States about responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace.⁶⁵\nIn conclusion, the benefit of attribution through indictment may be associated with three possible objectives: using the prestige of the American justice proceedings along with a degree of transparency to reinforce the attribution’s credibility through the lens of other impartial States; deterring States from launching similar attacks and damaging their reputation as law-abiding States; and building a broad international consensus to compel States to adhere to norms of responsible State behavior, such as the prohibition on conducting cyber attacks against critical infrastructure facilities. Nevertheless, the experience of recent years has not indicated any remarkable success in accomplishing all these objectives, at least not enhancing the credibility of the attributions through such indirect measures, nor significantly increasing the number of States joining the collective attributions\n⁶⁴.

However, neither provides transparent evidence that could withstand external and impartial scrutiny, subsequently substantiating the attribution determinations and ensuring their credibility.\nThe next section delves into the significant role played by the private sector, particularly in the United States, illustrating how private sector collaboration with the U.S. Government may enhance the level of transparency in determining and announcing official attributions. However, concurrently, it may raise concerns about the legitimacy and credibility of such attributions.\n## D. The Role of the Private Sector\nThe private sector, through its major tech and cyber security firms, plays a key role in the attribution process, as it possesses significant tech capabilities for detecting and investigating cyber incidents. Western companies, mostly American, such as Meta (Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram), Microsoft (Windows, Azure), Amazon (Amazon Web Services), Alphabet (Google, YouTube), X (previously Twitter), Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Verizon, dominate cyberspace in both software and hardware, encompassing global social media, big data, cloud services, artificial intelligence, computer operating systems, and search engines. Each of these realms is a playground where any vulnerability exposed by third parties could be exploited, posing serious threats to the company's reputation and business success. Thus, these companies invest vast resources to consistently lead in technology, developing cutting-edge capabilities to detect, investigate, and thwart any threat, regardless of its motives through in-house cyber threat intelligence teams. Moreover, global tech platforms, in particular, have achieved worldwide dominance and maintain a formidable presence in cyberspace, a level of control that State cyber powers, including a cyber superpower like the United States, struggle to maintain.⁶⁷ Additional-\n⁶⁶.

Unless biased (as discussed in the following section), they tend to classify the hostile cyber operation as sophisticated, suggesting potential execution by either an anonymous cyber power State or hackers sponsored by such a State.72 Technical attributions are usually faster, more detailed, and more transparent than official attributions, which are, to a greater extent restricted by confidentiality and related considerations of national security. This course of action characterizes private sector companies and has a double motivation, rooted both in business interests (business-based) and adherence to norms (norms-based). Naturally, the firms that are driven by business motives are interested in branding themselves—domestically and internationally—as the leading and most reliable professional actors in their fields, ahead of any existing or potential competitor. Such branding should go hand in hand with positioning the firms as prioritizing and aligning with values of universal human rights and other major norms included in the List of Non-Binding Norms, which reflect responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. In this context, national and international responsibility to secure human life and well-being in an unregulated and risky cyberspace, at least by sharing relevant information with the public, has become a matter of utmost importance.\nPrivate sector firms that investigate and expose malicious cyber tools and methodologies used in specific cyber attacks publish their findings to\n71.

Johnson, The Shameon Attacks, BROADCOM (Aug. 16, 2012), https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=281521ea-2d18-4bf9-9e88-8b1dc41cfdb6&amp;CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&amp;tab=librarydocuments (identifying the destructive malware, Shameon, as \"W32.Disttrack\" and refraining from explicitly attributing it to Iran at any level of probability.

More importantly, this helps enhance their cyber security capabilities and their preparedness to detect and thwart such threats. At the same time, such information may raise suspicions that a specific cyber attack is, in fact, an act of State or a State-sponsored operation. Occasionally, a private sector technological investigation may lead to complete attribution, including identification of the culprit State or its official organ.73 This occurs despite the general business orientation to avoid involvement in inter-State conflicts. Such attribution is a proper alternative to the official attribution that the victim State may avoid due to its strategic and national security considerations, as noted above. In such circumstances, the company's explicit technological attribution may influence international public opinion, delegitimizing the suspected State in the eyes of other States. Furthermore, any State could become a victim of similar unacceptable behavior at any time, and each may use such attributions to politically attribute responsibility to the suspected State.\nThe following section addresses the collaboration U.S. national security agencies maintain with relevant American private sector companies, including in the context of the attribution process. Naturally, this partnership is not completely transparent, nor is it exclusive to the United States. It also encompasses attribution determinations, raising doubts about the extent to which these determinations should be perceived as credible and legitimate through the lens of neutral observers.\n## E. Private Sector Collaboration with Governments\nA voluntary contribution by private sector companies to national efforts to defend the country from external threats is common, self-evident, and not limited to wartime. Thus, authorities of States cooperate and maintain close and confidential ties with leading domestic entities in the private sector in every relevant field, including health, transportation, tech-industry, telecommunications, and cybersecurity. Liberal democracies, as opposed to authoritarian regimes, maintain such cooperation within the boundaries of law. The Snowden disclosures of June 2013 about secret National Security Agency (NSA) operations involving American telecom companies rein\n73. Mandiant, for instance, was the first to attribute APT1 to China in a detailed attribution report based on technical findings and other, not necessarily technical, information gathered by the firm. CrowdStrike was the first to attribute responsibility to Russia for the Democratic National Committee hack during the 2016 U.S. elections.\nInternational Law Studies\n2024\nforce the perception that companies in established democracies assist their governments \"even above and beyond their legal obligations to do so.\"74 Conversely, authoritarian regimes are guided primarily by their self-interest in ensuring the regime's security and sustainability and would, therefore, do whatever it takes to secure their regime. As the end justifies the means, not even universal human rights would pose a barrier. As a corollary, the private sector companies, including foreign multinational platform companies operating under such regimes, must comply with their orders and restrictive regulations. Otherwise, the companies might pay excessive prices, which could include restricting, and even terminating, voluntarily or nonvoluntarily, their operations in the countries concerned.75\nDue to the Great Power Competition and the intensifying tension, particularly in cyberspace, the U.S. Administration has preemptively imposed a Federal ban on procuring software and services from certain Chinese and Russian tech and software companies that may secretly serve as long arms for both competitor powers in the sensitive fields of cyberspace and telecommunications. Moreover, the U.S. Administration has also urged its allies and relevant companies to follow suit.76 Recently, the U.S. Bureau of\n74.

Eichensehr, supra notes 67, at 68.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nScholars have already examined different facets of Private Sector-U.S. Government collaboration.⁸³ For the purposes of this article, it is important to focus on whether the collaboration of American multinational tech platforms with the American national security authorities undermines or, on the contrary, bolsters the credibility of the U.S. attribution process.⁸⁴ This is especially significant considering its key role in the collective attributions detailed in the following Part.\nUndoubtedly, such collaboration bolsters capabilities for revealing the truth behind any given cyber incident and establishing a solid attribution claim. However, in the absence of an independent international mechanism of accountability, the American attribution process, including the said collaboration, should withstand the scrutiny of its primary target constituency—the international community or international public opinion. Naturally, national security aspects of this collaboration remain confidential, though not always entirely so. Similarly, transparency may partially manifest itself in three dimensions: unexpected and undesired transparency—by leakers and whistleblowers; forced and balanced transparency—exclusively by virtue of judicial warrants that balance between conflicted interests, usually national security on one side and human rights on the other; and coordinated transparency—at the initiative of federal authorities in concert with the respective tech platforms.\n⁸³.

Have such American corporations ever wittingly and publicly exposed an American clandestine illegitimate cyber operation and dismantled it?87 Furthermore, how plausible is it that American tech platforms such as Meta, Microsoft, or Google would maintain confidential professional ties with States and secretly provide them with services that could be used for defensive and offensive cyber operations while keeping the pertinent American authorities out of the loop and in the dark?\nBrad Smith opines that the global tech and cyber security sector \"need[s] to become a trusted and neutral Digital Switzerland,\"88 and the\n85.

Conversely, if the companies are not willing to do something for any government, they will also not do it for the U.S.90\nHowever, she finds that despite all their efforts to appear neutral, “the companies have not yet achieved—and quite likely will never succeed in achieving—perfect neutrality. They are still strongly associated with the U.S., where they remain domiciled and maintain their headquarters.”91 Additionally, they cannot ignore that the U.S. Government is their most significant customer, and just as importantly, the U.S. Government possesses the power to adversely affect their business operations through new domestic legislation that subsequently may also impact their global operations.\nNonetheless, scholars have indicated a shift in the way the major U.S. global tech companies treat U.S. Government requests for collaboration.92 This shift stemmed from the urgent need to salvage the reputations of companies in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures, and it refers primarily to governmental requests that collide with constitutional rights like freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Accordingly, the companies have begun implementing a policy of publicly rejecting and litigating against such governmental demands. In this context, companies will not carry out governmental requests that may collide with human rights unless litigation fails and explicit court warrants are issued, as almost occurred in the San Bernardino case.93 Therefore, Ashley Deeks counts private sector tech compa\nblogs.microsoft.com/uploads/2017/03/Transcript-of-Brad-Smiths-Keynote-Address-at-the-RSA-Conference-2017.pdf.\n89.

Given the experience to date, should this policy be welcomed or re-evaluated? That is the question discussed below.\n## IV. COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION\nIn 2017, in the wake of two developments—the collapse of the fifth round of the UN–GGE and large-scale cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya—the United States and the United Kingdom extended the policy of official attribution to a new pattern of collective attribution aimed at deterring States from violating norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. As the table below shows, all the reviewed collective attributions, except one, relied on the national attribution processes of the United States and the United Kingdom regarding cyber attacks that targeted them or their allies. Prior to discussing the cumulative experience of the collective attribution concept per se, and to illustrate the complete picture in this context, the first section of this Part reviews three international initiatives that the United States introduced to deter States and advance responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace in conjunction with holding States accountable by relying on the concept of collective attribution.\n## A. Collective Attribution Within International Initiatives\nDespite the legal obstacles and instrumental ambiguity noted above, the List of Non-Binding Norms remains the main international instrument to hold States accountable for wrongdoing that violates the voluntary norms of responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. This accountability is essential for establishing effective deterrence, while the attribution determination is a keystone for invoking accountability in any given incident.\nIn its updated National Cyber Strategy, the Trump Administration announced the launch of the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative to re\n2023), https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/huawei_china_claims/ (reporting on post of China’s Ministry of State Security on WeChat, in which the United States is accused of running cyber attacks and espionage for more than ten years against China, Russia, and forty-five other countries and regions, and of implanting backdoors in equipment and software and using American global technology brands to monitor and steal data).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\ninforce efforts to deter States from violating the List of Non-Binding Norms through “official attribution,” “collective attribution,” a “naming and shaming” strategy, and through a “collective response” by jointly imposing sanctions against States accused of violating the List.¹⁰⁹ Ultimately, no State has officially announced that it will join the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, not even the closest ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, although it promptly endorsed the pillars of the U.S. strategy.¹¹⁰ The International Cyber Deterrence Initiative has not evolved into an effective international initiative, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative¹¹¹ or the International Counter Ransomware Initiative discussed below. In fact, the United States never officially launched the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, and senior U.S. officials have rarely referred to it.¹¹²\nThe literature includes only one study that references the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, focusing solely on the collective response rather than the credible collective attribution that is implicitly a prerequisite to any collective response.¹¹³ Within this study, the scholar examined the policy embraced by each State party in the FVEY in building offensive cyber capabilities. The findings reveal that the FVEY States, excluding New Zealand, align with the approach of responding firmly to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Additionally, those States have developed the offensive cyber capabilities needed, among others, to uphold such a policy. The scholar concludes by suggesting that the FVEY and other like-minded allies enhance the credibility of their deterrent collective response\n¹⁰⁹. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12.\n¹¹⁰.

Nevertheless, for a collective response, the attribution must be credible, and this credibility cannot be taken for granted. Admittedly, the findings of this article bolster the conclusion that the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative never materialized as an active initiative for collectively imposing costs on States violating the List of Non-Binding Norms.\nIn September 2019, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands co-sponsored a new international initiative and, together with twenty-five other States, issued a Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace. This statement includes a commitment to hold States accountable, that is, to collectively attribute State responsibility for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms. It also calls on States to transparently impose costs under international law. The Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has only been invoked once since 2019. On February 21, 2020, fifteen out of the twenty-eight Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace partner States teamed up with Georgia and attributed responsibility to Russia for a disruptive cyber campaign conducted by the GRU. They politically denounced Russia and demanded it comply with the List of Non-Binding Norms.\nTwo months later, on April 16, 2020, the Czech Republic's National Cyber and Information Security Agency warned of a real threat of serious cyber attacks against its healthcare sector amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The day after, the U.S. Secretary of State released a statement in which he mentioned the Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace framework and warned against conducting such dangerous cyber attacks or knowingly allowing them: \"Anyone that engages in such an action should expect consequences.\" Eventually, the threat was not real\n114.

Moreover, neither the Czech nor the American authorities were transparent enough to convince observers that this was not a shot in the dark, but rather a successful preventive response to a credible and imminent threat.\nAs indicated above, neither the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative nor the Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has gained political significance. Unsurprisingly, the anticipation that States beyond the closest allies of the United States would align with American or British attribution statements and impose various costs—political, economic, and otherwise—proved unfounded. It appears that the United States has relinquished both initiatives and, together with its partners in the FVEY, has remained focused on the collective attribution endeavor, as detailed in the following section.\nHowever, beyond the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, in October 2021 the United States established an international initiative to counter the threat of ransomware cyber operations, which the Biden Administration has recently defined as a threat to U.S. national security.¹¹⁸ Although this International Counter Ransomware Initiative¹¹⁹ deals exclusively with criminally motivated ransomware cyber operations, it remains relevant in the context of the present discussion of collective attribution by States. This is because its primary goal is to uphold multinational cooperation to counteract ransomware threats and bolster both resiliency and deterrence. To achieve this, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative strengthens cooperation by facilitating the sharing of information and professional expertise among the participating States and private sector companies. More crucially for the focus of this article is its collaborative effort to detect and identify hackers or hacker groups involved in ransomware attacks, whether independently\n¹¹⁷.

In other words, the Initiative establishes and maintains multinational collaboration to detect, identify, and attribute responsibility for malicious cyber attacks.\nSince its establishment in 2021, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative has consistently increased its membership and actively devised strategies to confront the substantial threat. Despite these efforts, the Initiative has not yet urged its members to collectively attribute responsibility to States involved in conducting ransomware cyber attacks, either through their official State organs or third parties. Similarly, the Initiative has not yet led to the attribution of responsibility to States that tolerate recurring cyber attacks initiated from their sovereign territories.\nRussia has already demonstrated that Russian ransomware gangs, such as REvil, may thrive or decline depending on the regime's willingness to cooperate. Ultimately, increasing collaboration among the International Counter Ransomware Initiative States may encompass holding States accountable for ransomware cyber operations, even when initiated and directed from their sovereign territory, violating the due diligence principle. Apart from addressing the legal complexities associated with such accusations, the Initiative's parties may also seek to attribute responsibility and hold States accountable for what they have already defined as prohibited \"irresponsible behaviors.\"\nNonetheless, when upheld by a common multinational investigative team, the resulting attribution is collective and certainly more legitimate and credible. During the concluding stages of this article's preparation, the United Kingdom's National Crime Agency publicly exposed Operation\n120.

(reporting about indications of REvil's revival a month after the United States unilaterally stopped the Russian American communication channel on cybersecurity in the wake of the Russian war on Ukraine).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nCronos.¹²² An international law enforcement task force led by the UK's National Crime Agency and the FBI and consisting of eleven International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States (United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Netherlands, Finland, and Germany) successfully executed an international disruption campaign, taking control of the website and services (ransomware-as-a-service) of LockBit. This criminal hacking group is recognized as the world's most harmful cybercrime group. The outcomes of this operation included the seizure in three countries of LockBit's data exfiltration infrastructure by members of the task force. Two LockBit operatives were arrested in coordination with Europol. The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against two Russian citizens for conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks. The Department of Justice also announced that two defendants responsible for using LockBit to execute ransomware attacks were in custody and would face trial in the United States. The lessons learned from this experience could prove valuable for the United States and the United Kingdom in addressing the pitfalls of the current collective attribution process and response. This could serve as a test case demonstrating how successful cooperation between International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States can be in fighting criminally motivated, as well as politically motivated, cybercrime. Thus, the Initiative, in particular, may serve as an appropriate pilot for exploring optional solutions to better tackle the challenges associated with collective attributions and responses. More importantly, such solutions would enhance State accountability and the effectiveness of attributions in changing State behavior in cyberspace.\n## B. Table of Collective Attributions as of January 1, 2024\nThe number of collective attributions has been steadily increasing at a slow pace since the first on December 19, 2017. Thus far, the number has reached fourteen collective attributions.¹²³ Each may refer to a single cyber attack or a campaign comprising a bulk of cyber activities that may even span over years. The fourteen cases are described in an expanded list at-\n¹²².

First, this article relies only on open-source intelligence. Second, the\nInternational Law Studies\n2024\nselection of fourteen cases is the result of a meticulous search conducted in relevant FVEY State governmental websites where collective attributions are published, as well as the site of the EU High Representative's Office. In addition, information about cyber attacks was gathered from other sources, and a comparison was conducted against results from other sources.¹²⁵ Finally, the results, as reflected in the table above, do not purport to be exhaustive. Nevertheless, in a cautious estimate, analogous to the wording of the attributions' intelligence assessment, it can be stated that almost all the collective attributions, as defined at the outset of this article, are highly likely to be included in the table, and all the most prominent attributions are almost certainly included.¹²⁶\n## C. Analysis: Remarks and Insights\n### 1. Remarks on the Process in Practice\n#### i. Five Eyes' Key Role\nDespite being an intelligence alliance, the FVEY partners are not obligated to full transparency between their intelligence agencies. However, they do share intelligence at a level of confidentiality not extended to other allies. This alliance is the core of the collective attribution strategy, while the United States and the United Kingdom are its driving forces. They cooperate in investigating wide-scale cyber attacks by exchanging confidential information and mobilizing, separately or in conjunction, to assist victim\n¹²⁵.

One indication reinforcing this assessment is taken from the recent Canadian attribution statement. Press Release, Glob. Affairs Canada, Statement on Russia’s Malicious Cyber Activity Affecting Europe and Ukraine (May 10, 2022), https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2022/05/statement-on-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-affecting-europe-and-ukraine.html (recalling each of the seven previous malicious cyber operations attributed to Russia. All are included in the table.). Another indication can be taken from the Press Release, UK Att’y Gen’s Off., Attorney General to Set Out the UK’s Position on Cybersecurity and International Law (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-to-set-out-the-uks-position-on-cybersecurity-and-international-law (this report enumerated examples of cyber attacks where the United Kingdom “named and shamed” State actors. All are included in the table.).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nStates upon their request, especially when their capability to investigate cyber attacks independently is poor or limited.¹²⁷ Both the United States and the United Kingdom are responsible for all collective attributions listed in the table presented above, except one (Case 10), to be discussed below. The FVEY's attribution announcements are made concurrently and in coordination.¹²⁸ However, they rely on sharing classified information, not on the findings of an independent FVEY multinational investigative team or any other form of international investigative mechanism. Like the decision to officially attribute State responsibility itself, endorsing an official attribution made by another State is a political prerogative for each sovereign State, which may announce it as its own official attribution. Such attribution determinations rely on various cumulative considerations, including the accuracy and credibility of evidence shared with all partners. While Canada has, thus far, actively participated in all collective attributions initiated by the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia refrained in three instances (Cases 6, 7, 13) and New Zealand in four (Cases 6, 7, 11, 13). Neither New Zealand nor Australia publicly justified their decision to refrain in each of these instances.\n## ii. EU and NATO Attributions or Partial Attribution Statements\nThe EU, representing twenty-seven European States, has had a notable practice of declarations in support of collective attributions. Thus far, it participated in eleven out of fourteen collective attributions, while NATO participated in six out of these same eleven attributions. However, the attribution statements on behalf of the EU and NATO could hardly be considered fully attributive. Instead, they may be perceived as a partial attribution of responsibility, making a limited contribution to the collective attribution strategy.\n¹²⁷. See, e.g., Cases 5, 13, supra Section IV(B) (providing examples in which the United Kingdom assisted the Georgian authorities in contending with and investigating the malicious cyber campaign); see Press Release, U.S. Embassy Tirana, Committed Partners in Cyberspace: U.S. Concludes First Defensive Hunt Operation in Albania (Mar. 23, 2023), https://al.usembassy.gov/committed-partners-in-cyberspace-u-s-concludes-first-defensive-hunt-operation-in-albania/.\n¹²⁸. At times, the dates on statements from Australia and New Zealand may not match those of other FVEY partners. However, the announcements are most likely published simultaneously with those of the FVEY partners, and at times the incompatibility of dates may be due to the different time zones.\nInternational Law Studies\n2024\nThe following are some probable causes driving this partial level of EU and NATO participation in collective attributions:\n(a) The EU and NATO do not possess independent cyber investigative capabilities. Both rely heavily on more capable allies, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, EU and NATO member States, like Sweden, the Netherlands, Estonia, Austria, France, and Germany, each of which possess independent investigative capabilities, allegedly provide the EU security authorities with “deficient and incomplete” evidence in order to preserve the confidentiality of their cyber capabilities.¹²⁹ To date, the EU has joined an official attribution initiated by one of its members only once (Case 10), and the attribution is highly questionable. NATO has never joined an attribution that was not initiated by the United States or the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that both States also face challenges in implementing a high degree of transparency with the EU security authorities due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of their intelligence sources. Nevertheless, the direct involvement of the United States and the United Kingdom in investigating cyber attacks appears to be a differentiating factor, possibly explaining why both, along with Canada and New Zealand, refrained from participating in the EU and Germany collective attribution (Case 10), while Australia settled for expressing solidarity.¹³⁰\n(b) The EU and NATO have joined collective attributions through brief declarations or statements issued on behalf of both Councils. The wording of these official declarations or statements must be cautious and measured to achieve unanimity within a truly brief period. Typically, they condemn the cyber attack in question, express concerns about it, and show solidarity with the affected States. The EU and NATO choose to avoid any explicit attribution of responsibility to the CRINK States. At the same time, the United States and the United Kingdom explicitly attribute responsibility primarily to specific official agents or organs of any State within the\n¹²⁹.

The EU and NATO refrain from attributing responsibility even to CRINK's official entities, such as intelligence agencies and national security institutions, which some of the U.S. or UK attribution determinations refer to in detail. In Case 9, for instance, the North Atlantic Council's statement acknowledges official statements made by its members—United States, United Kingdom, and Canada—attributing to China responsibility for compromising the Microsoft Exchange Server. The statement continues expressing solidarity with those who were affected, calling on \"all states, including China,\" to uphold their international commitments and \"act responsibly, including in cyberspace.\"131 Similarly, the EU's declaration refrains from explicitly attributing responsibility to China for malicious cyber activities, as opposed to the FVEY attribution statements.132 Instead, the EU \"strongly denounces\" these malicious cyber activities, urging China to comply with norms of responsible State behavior and prevent the use of its territory for such activities.133 The EU approach further differs from the FVEY by emphasizing adherence to the List of Non-Binding Norms, including due diligence, rather than strictly assigning State responsibility. However, challenges arise when applying due diligence to cyberspace, given uncertainties about its compatibility with the specific circumstances and the contested nature of its application in this\n131.

Thus, rather than assigning strict and explicit State responsibility, the EU declarations lean toward a partial attribution statement. $^{134}$\n(c) Each of the EU member States may publish official attribution statements independently, like any sovereign State. Such statements may be more blatant and explicit than the EU's soft and general statements. An increased frequency of explicit independent statements, especially from cyber power States, aligning around the same conclusion in a specific cyber incident might impact the perceived legitimacy and credibility of the attribution determination in question. Nevertheless, such alignment is infrequent, contingent on the political cost-benefit calculation of each EU member State when deciding whether to act directly with full political responsibility through an official and independent statement.\n# iii. Incoherency and Lack of Standardization\nThe collective FVEY attributions reviewed indicated incoherency, a lack of standardization, and an absence of transparent criteria, primarily in selecting which cyber operations the United States or the United Kingdom would lead the FVEY to collectively attribute. Likewise, there is uncertainty about the criteria guiding the EU and NATO in determining which attributions to publicly support, all while navigating possible political storms. Questions persist regarding the degree of certainty justifying an attribution in the first place and how to measure that degree. Further considerations involve the timing and format of coordinated announcements, whether through verbal statements by senior government officials (such as heads of states, relevant ministers, and senior officials from the U.S. National Security Council and their counterparts in other States), or by written statements of an authorized governmental agency or ministry, or both in concert.\n134.

See Cases 10, 11, supra Section IV(B).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nThe United States has been inconsistent in the way it has chosen to express its official attribution and synchronize it with its partners in the FVEY. At times, it settles for filing or unsealing indictments in absentia (e.g., Cases 4, 7) or for joining advisories (e.g., Case 6). Occasionally, the U.S. action of indicting and/or joining an advisory is in addition to an explicit official political announcement (e.g., Case 9). Conversely, the other \"Four Eyes\" always officially attribute responsibility through official announcements of senior officials, mostly by written statements of the relevant ministers.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of Case 10 as a collective attribution in the table is highly questionable. This marks the inaugural and sole instance where the EU independently initiated, on behalf of its member States, a statement, purported to collectively attribute responsibility. It was primarily in response to Germany's official attribution and ostensibly at its request. Ultimately, the declaration was more of an urgent general warning to Russia against interfering in European national democratic processes rather than a distinct attribution of responsibility for enduring wrongdoings. However, to enable consensus among the twenty-seven EU member States, the statement's wording was softened and generalized, using \"some\" member States, instead of specifying the States, and \"associating\" the wrongdoing with them, instead of clearly \"attributing\" it to Russia. Unsurprisingly, this declaration did not spur additional States to participate in this collective \"attribution,\" except Australia, which expressed its solidarity. By stark contrast, the EU declaration in Case 14, which addresses the same threat of Russian interference in foreign States' democratic pro\n138.

Doubtful Credibility\nThere are only a small number of official attributions and an even smaller number of collective attributions that do not rely primarily on the American attribution process. The credibility and legitimacy deficiencies of the American attribution process, as highlighted in the previous Part—such as ambiguous normativity, limited transparency, and reliance on potentially biased American investigative teams instead of impartial multinational teams—persist unresolved in collective attributions. These issues may deter States from participating in explicit attributions as opposed to partial attributions. The cases reviewed indicate that States' willingness to participate in collective attributions based on the outcome of another State's national attribution process is limited, even if this system belongs to a cyber power State such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, the deterrence and effectiveness of such attributions also remain low.¹⁴⁴\nCase 11 requires a closer look as it raises serious doubts about the credibility of both the American and British attribution processes, and whether their outcomes are credible and persuasive enough to encourage a growing number of States to participate in such collective attributions. In this case, the Ukrainian Government suspected Russia just because it was then the only State interested in destabilizing Ukraine.¹⁴⁵ Just forty-eight hours later, the United States and the United Kingdom provided the fastest attribution determination each of these allies had ever announced. It relied primarily on some technical information \"almost certainly\" linking the GRU to this cyber attack.¹⁴⁶ Anne Neuberger, the White House's Deputy National Secu\n¹⁴³.

While the swift collective attribution may be linked to the looming possibility of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine set to commence in a few days, it does not necessarily justify what might be perceived by any impartial observer as taking shortcuts in the attribution process. This certainly does not enhance trust in the process; on the contrary, it raises concerns.\nThe absence of transparent standardization and criteria is crucial to maintain flexibility in reconciling two conflicting characteristics. On one hand, the List of Non-Binding Norms is non-enforceable due to legal ambiguities and difficulties that are not easily resolved in the contemporary geopolitical situation, as described above. On the other hand, there is the challenge of enhancing State compliance with the List to reduce global risks and instability. However, this flexibility is not necessarily an ad-\n147.

Shaping “Rules of the Road”\nAiming to bolster deterrence, the United States and the United Kingdom initiated the collective attribution process as a response to attacking States in cyberspace. However, in the absence of normative clarity, attribution announcements refer to unacceptable and irresponsible State behavior, rather than specifying international rules or norms allegedly breached by the given cyber attack. Thus, the policy implemented usually involves delegitimization (\"naming and shaming\") and retorsions, lawful measures that can be imposed without the need for detailed legal justification. The objective is to shape \"rules of the road\" by specifying instances of unacceptable cyber activity on case-by-case bases and to develop State practice accordingly. This involves instilling among the entire community of nations the perspectives of collective attributors regarding which cyber operations may constitute irresponsible State behavior. Such activities would be deemed irresponsible State behavior when conducted by official State agents or entities, as well as by hacking groups affiliated with these entities, operating under their instruction, direction, or control. Although the List of Non-Binding Norms does not refer to economic or national security espionage, bilateral agreements and multinational commitments prohibit the theft of intellectual property (IP), trade secrets, and business information to gain competitive commercial advantages. Such multinational commitments may be an additional source for shaping \"rules of the road\" in the commitments' context.\nThe cases reviewed can be categorized into subcategories representing types of irresponsible State behavior. Each subcategory has the potential to form specific prohibitions on certain types of conduct, akin to rules of the road. Below is a classification of the cases reviewed into four subcategories,\n150. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12.\n151.

See, e.g., G20 Leaders' Communique, Antalya Summit ¶ 26 (Nov. 2015), https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/23729/g20-antalya-leaders-summit-communique.pdf.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nwith one caveat. This is not a one-size-fits-all classification. Some cases can be classified under more than one subcategory (as exemplified below by Case 3).\n(a) Interfering with State democratic processes, primarily elections (Cases 3, 10, 14).\n(b) Endangerment of critical infrastructure and supply chain (Cases 3, 11, 12).\n(c) Interference in inherently governmental functions $^{154}$ (Cases 1, 2, 5, 7, 13).\n(d) Theft of IP and commercial secrets (economic espionage) $^{155}$ (Cases 4, 6, 8, 9).\nShaping rules of the road, case by case, could be more effective if the collective attributing States use each case as an opportunity to shape the applicable international rules in the given context. However, the United States and the United Kingdom have not yet taken any significant action in this direction. $^{156}$\nIn May 2022, the UK Attorney General addressed collective attribution and the ensuing response to the wrongdoing as important measures in shaping the international order in cyberspace. $^{157}$ She emphasized that\nThe law needs to be clear and well understood if it is to be part of a framework for governing international relations and to rein in irresponsible cyber behaviour.

For additional clarity, she also suggests defining types of disruptive State cyber activities in various vulnerable sectors, such as energy security, essential medical care, economic stability, and democratic processes. Identifying a type of such cyber activity and examining it in its relevant context would determine whether it disrupts or denies another State’s ability to exercise its sovereign power to freely decide and act. If so, it would constitute a clear violation of the non-intervention norm, rendering it an unlawful activity. Since the UK Attorney General proposed this approach, the United States and the United Kingdom have jointly undertaken only two additional collective attributions (Cases 13, 14). However, instead of attributing unlawful cyber activities to Iran and Russia, the UK Foreign Secretary characterized Iranian actions as “reckless” and “unacceptable”¹⁵⁹ and Russian actions as “completely unacceptable.”¹⁶⁰ This aligns with the established practice of the FVEY, as evidenced in the cases reviewed. Nevertheless, adopting and implementing the British Attorney General’s integrated legal and political approach within the collective attribution strategy could potentially confer a more binding aspect to norms, such as the prohibitions on intervention and use of force, sovereignty of States, due diligence, and the boundaries of permitted espionage. This might create incentives for States, mindful of their reputation as responsible and law-abiding entities, to adhere to these norms as interpreted and applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, enforcing them through collective attribution and responses would be more consistent and coherent, thus, more effective in shaping State practice and international law.\n¹⁵⁸. Id.

Sanctions as a Collective Response\nAnother dimension of the legality of the attributed violation lies in the appropriate response. As mentioned earlier, both the FVEY and the EU confine their responses to retorsions, such as travel bans and asset freezing, undertaken against the entities and persons engaged in conducting the malicious cyber attacks in question. The expectation that a collective attribution would prompt retorsions from a high number of participating States, forming an effective collective deterrent response, has not materialized as of yet.¹⁶¹ Nevertheless, such a response has become a common practice of the United States and to a lesser extent, the EU and the FVEY.\nAt the level of the United States, sanctions are imposed with greater frequency against individuals and entities based on findings and charges detailed in joint advisories or unsealed indictments and law enforcement investigations. Despite the considerable number of sanctioned individuals and entities, many are government personnel and entities associated with the CRINK, and a significant number have also been indicted.¹⁶² While the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish but to bring about a positive change in behavior,¹⁶³ this change has not materialized as of yet. At the level of the FVEY partners, the United Kingdom has regulated its own independent cyber related sanctions regime and occasionally imposed sanctions in coordination with the United States.¹⁶⁴ Australia legislated a cyber sanctions law in December 2021. In January 2024, it implemented it for the first time against a Russian cybercriminal found responsible for the Medibank\n¹⁶¹.

Moreover, the EU's process of imposing sanctions in response to cyber attacks is too slow and less effective; it may extend even beyond a year, as the decision must be unanimous and rely on evidence that can withstand judicial scrutiny. Thus far, the EU has sanctioned, under its cyber-related sanctions framework, only eight individuals and four entities affiliated with the CRINK, encompassing both asset freezes and travel bans. These sanctions were instituted in two phases, in July and October of 2020. As of now, no additional sanctions have been imposed through this channel, and there have been no challenges to review any of these sanctions before the European Court of Justice.¹⁶⁶ Therefore, it seems that the EU cyber-sanction regime may have “already run its course,” as anticipated by some critics.¹⁶⁷ Furthermore, a German research team, which analyzed the EU's collective response in Cases 1–4, questioned the effectiveness of such responses, doubting whether they “really have a deterrent effect on aggressors or are ultimately just symbolic politics.”¹⁶⁸\nDespite the above, this article does not purport to reach an unequivocal conclusion, based on sufficient credible information, regarding the effectiveness of the collective attribution and sanctions policy in achieving its primary objectives. These goals include deterring, disrupting, and demonstrating readiness to defend international norms¹⁶⁹ and inducing a change in\n165. Media Release, Austl.

Ultimately, sanctions are not designed to punish but rather to motivate positive changes in State behavior.¹⁷⁰ Given that the main outlaw States in cyberspace—Russia, Iran, and North Korea—are already subject to extensive multinational sanctions regimes for reasons unrelated to “irresponsible” malicious cyber operations,¹⁷¹ the impact of sanctions imposed as a response to malicious cyber activities is difficult to evaluate decisively. Nevertheless, the increasing frequency and scale of politically motivated cyber operations suggest that the deterring effect of collective attributions, along with retorsions, is weak.¹⁷² Due to the lack of authorized information regarding the outcomes of these sanctions and in the face of persistent politically motivated cyber attacks originating from the same culpable States and orchestrated by their governmental entities, it would not be inaccurate to argue that the effectiveness of this policy has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Meanwhile, it still has a symbolic, declarative impact needed to emphasize the red lines that States should not cross.\nIn conclusion, at present, collective attribution is no more than the upshot of the national attribution process, mostly American and British, with the addition of evidence sharing with like-minded States, in a manner that imposes no burden on the U.S. or UK intelligence community. The United States and the United Kingdom are always the driving force, while a CRINK State almost always stands on the receiving end. States and alliances participating in collective attributions, particularly the EU and FVEY, do not determine whether to join the attribution through direct involvement in investigative and attribution processes, but rather are influenced by political affiliations and international commitments within international frameworks, such as the G7, G20, and U.S.-EU or UK-EU dialogues. As a result, the collectiveness as implemented in the attribution process does not bolster the credibility of the American or British attribution determinations. This could notably change if the number of States committed to joining the attributions significantly increases, not due to political pressure or other political considerations, but rather due to an enhanced, joint, impartial, transparent, professional, and multinational process as the International Cyber Ransomware Initiative has recently demonstrated within its limited\n¹⁷⁰.

CONCLUSION\nMore than a decade has passed since Leon Panetta first used the metaphor of the Pearl Harbor attack to depict how serious and risky a cyber attack could be, warning “potential aggressors . . . that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.” $^{174}$ Even graver and more precise warnings have been issued recurringly by U.S. presidents and senior officials in administrations since 2012. $^{175}$ President Biden, who during his first weeks in office had to handle a series of serious ransomware cyber operations originating in Russia that dealt a blow to U.S. public interests, announced: “I made it clear to President Putin . . . that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions—interfering with our elections . . .—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia . . .” $^{176}$ In the same speech, the President emphasized that only nations “working together and in common” can solve “the accelerating global challenges.” He added, “we [the United States] cannot do it alone.” That is easier said than done in the international arena. Despite technological developments that have improved attribution capabilities, the international community has not yet established a binding legal framework for cyberspace. Instead, the United States, along with the United Kingdom, has chosen to build upon a national official attribution system by imposing collective attribution and responses to the wrongdoing, aiming to concurrently achieve two goals: (1) to reinforce State deterrence through public collective attribution and imposing costs; and (2) shaping and internalizing “rules of the road” for responsible State behavior in cyberspace. $^{177}$\n173.

The United States, as the major attributor, assigns responsibility to specific States without allowing transparency regarding the evidence, the criteria of selecting the cases, and maintaining ambiguity about the legal grounds on which their charges rely. Furthermore, since the attribution determination in any given case is not subject to external and objective scrutiny, it is hard to indicate impartiality, legality, coherency, and consistency in the process, which collapses into one measure—attribution, accusation, judging, and punishing by retorsions. This is a far cry from satisfying any \"right\" or \"fair process.\" Thus far, the overwhelming majority of collective attributions have been American-led. The participants are American governmental experts, in cooperation mostly with American tech platforms whose loyalty to American national security interests is not questioned. There is no effort to involve independent, reputable international experts in the process, which is not sufficiently transparent and, on the face of things, may be perceived as one-sided. At most, the American process may constitute an exchange of views and intelligence sharing with counterpart agencies in the FVEY.\nClose and clandestine cooperation—among the FVEY—and sharing information with the EU's relevant institutions, as well as with a few like-minded States, is not enough to replace a proper procedure that would lend credibility and legitimacy to the process and its outcomes. The absence of representative, impartial multinational experts in the process exacerbates the legitimacy gap. This is even more true when the State at the receiving end of the attribution process is always a rival State from the CRINK group. Such dynamics erode the process' legitimacy and may discourage States from embracing its findings and joining the collective attributions, let alone responses. Moreover, it can explain the ineffectiveness of international initiatives, such as the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, and the negligible effectiveness of the collective attributions. This article pointed to one initiative, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which, in my opinion, has the potential to become more effective in countering ransomware and cooperating in law enforcement once the ransomware is detected or when credible intelligence can anticipate the details of the upcom\nsignal to Russia without any reference to specific international rules about the cost Russia might pay if it continues with its destabilizing actions).\n331\nInternational Law Studies\n2024\ning cyber attack. The motive, whether political or criminal, does not matter when ransomware cripples major governmental services, even more so when it prompts States to declare an emergency, as happened in Costa Rica. $^{178}$  If the International Counter Ransomware Initiative proves itself effective, it could be part of a mechanism to tackle politically motivated cyber attacks by expanding its designation.\nThis article presents the considerable cumulative experience gained from destructive and disruptive State or State-sponsored cyber attacks and their accompanying attribution processes. This, coupled with the growing number of States expressing their perspectives in enduring public debates regarding the terms and boundaries for applying major international norms to cyberspace, illustrate the image of a wide-open field that must be fenced in by further development and regulation. In my opinion, there is fertile ground for a justified reevaluation of the collective attribution process and the responses to cyber wrongdoing. This is critical to bolster the credibility, legitimacy, and subsequently the effectiveness of these collective attributions in shaping the rules of road and enhancing State accountability.\n178.

NotPetya (June 2017)¹⁸⁴\nThe NotPetya malware targeted Ukraine but spilled over to more than sixty States, including Russia. This malware acted as ransomware, causing enormous economic damage amounting to billions of dollars and serious disruptions in important public services. This cyber operation was politely motivated to damage Ukrainian businesses and sow public anger.\nIn February 2018, the FVEY collectively attributed this cyber attack to the GRU. Shortly after, more than fifteen like-minded States officially supported this attribution.¹⁸⁵ The U.S. Department of Justice indicted GRU officers involved in these cyber activities while the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions.\nIn July 2020, the EU approved sanctions against Unit 74455 of the GRU for the NotPetya cyber attack, the Lazarus group for the WannaCry attack, and against Russians and North Koreans who have been indicted in the United States.¹⁸⁶\n## 3. Series of GRU Cyber Attacks (2015–2018)¹⁸⁷\nOn October 4, 2018, the United States and the United Kingdom attributed to Russia responsibility for a series of politically motivated cyber attacks conducted by the GRU against various targets. These attacks included, among others, the BadRabbit ransomware campaign (October 2017), a ransomware cyber attack aimed at Ukrainian targets that also spilled over to other European countries; the Democratic National Committee hack during the American elections (2016); the cyber attacks (December 2015 and\n¹⁸⁴.

The statement explicitly connected this GRU cyber operation to other reckless cyber operations revealed on the same day.¹⁸⁸\nAlso on this day, the EU published a joint statement by the presidents of the Council of Europe and the European Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The statement was limited to the attack on the OPCW, with a general reference to the British accusations about further unacceptable cyber activities.\nThe United States indicted and sanctioned officers of the GRU for being involved in those cyber attacks.¹⁸⁹ In July 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against four GRU officers who attempted a cyber attack against the OPCW. In October 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against the GRU’s Unit 26165 and two GRU officers who participated in the Bundestag Hack in 2015.¹⁹⁰\n¹⁸⁸.

Operation Cloud Hopper (2006–December 2018)¹⁹¹\nThis was an economic cyber espionage campaign targeting the IP and sensitive commercial data of large-scale service providers operating in the United States, Europe, and Asia. It is highly likely that the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) ran this campaign through a hacker group known as the APT10, which was almost certainly responsible for a campaign of activity against global Managed Service Providers (MSPs) since at least 2016, widely known as Cloud Hopper.\nOn December 20, 2018, the United Kingdom officially attributed responsibility for this campaign to China's MSS. The U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously indicted and imposed personal sanctions on two Chinese hackers allegedly part of APT10 and involved in this cyber campaign.¹⁹² The following day, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada published official attribution statements with similar content. Japan and Germany joined these attribution determinations.¹⁹³\nAfter a four-month delay, the EU published a declaration focusing on APT10 malicious cyber activities, including IP theft, while avoiding explicit attribution to the Chinese Government.¹⁹⁴\n¹⁹¹.

The suspected perpetrators, APT29 (also known as the “Dukes” or “Cozy Bear”), were identified “almost certainly” as part of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).199 Based on this alert, the United Kingdom and Canada, through their ministries of foreign affairs, were the sole members of the FVEY to officially attribute responsibility to Russia, while the United States simultaneously published the aforementioned joint advisory warning. Australia and New Zealand did not join this attribution. It should be noted that two days later, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two Chinese hackers working with China’s MSS of targeting IP, including COVID-19 research.200\n## 7. Malicious Cyber Activity—2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games\nOn October 19, 2020, the United Kingdom attributed to Russia (the GRU) the destructive cyber campaign conducted against the 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in South Korea and the cyber reconnaissance that targeted officials and organizations involved in the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo, prior to its postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the United Kingdom officially announced its attribution determination, the U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously unsealed an indictment charging Russians involved in the cyber attacks in 2018.

Hafnium Hack (Microsoft Exchange Server) (March 2021) 209\nIn July 2021, the United States, joined by the FVEY and Japan, attributed malicious cyber activity and irresponsible State behavior to China for stealing IP for commercial advantage and espionage through hackers contracted to the MSS (APT 31, APT 40). The EU statement did not assign direct responsibility to China but emphasized that the malicious cyber activities were undertaken from China's territory, urging it to prevent such activities.²¹⁰ The North Atlantic Council's statement \"acknowledges\" the statements made by the FVEY member States and expresses \"solidarity\" with those who were affected, calling on all States, \"including China,\" to uphold their international commitments.²¹¹\n10. Interference in European States' Democratic Processes (September 2021)\nOn September 24, 2021, shortly before the German elections, the EU High Representative denounced Russia for trying to interfere in European democratic processes by accessing computer systems and personal accounts in the EU member States and stealing data. The official statement relied on \"some EU member states\" that have observed malicious cyber activities, \"collectively designated as Ghostwriter and associated these with the Russian state.\"²¹² The statement asserts that such activities contradict the List of Non-Binding Norms, calling to immediately cease them and urging Russia to adhere to the List.

DDoS Attack Against Ukraine (February 15–16, 2022)\nA week prior to the Russian invasion, an unprecedented DDoS attack crashed Ukrainian banks and government websites. Although the head of the Cybersecurity Department of Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it was too early to identify specific perpetrators, Ukraine pointed the finger at Russia as the only country interested in destabilizing Ukraine. Forty-eight hours later, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia collectively blamed Russia for conducting the operation through its GRU. This collective attribution is exceptional primarily for one reason: It is the fastest political decision made to date officially attributing State responsibility.\n# 12. Blocking the KA-SAT Network (February 16, 2022)\nOn May 10, 2022, the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre assessed that Russia's GRU was almost certainly responsible for the cyber attack against ViaSat, a multinational communications provider, one hour prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This cyber attack, which is believed to have targeted the KA-SAT network to disrupt or cut off Ukraine's military communication, spilled over to civilian customers in Ukraine and across Europe, making tens of thousands of terminals inoperable in a manner that was irreversible. Based on these findings and new intelligence, the United Kingdom and the United States, joined by their partners in the FVEY and the EU, collectively attributed responsibility\n213.

Cyber Attacks Targeting Albanian Governmental Websites (July 15, 2022)\nOn September 7, 2022, Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran. The reason for such a serious response was a major cyber-campaign conducted against it nearly two months earlier. This campaign targeted significant Albanian government websites, including websites for providing essential public services and websites of the Albanian Parliament and Prime Minister's office. Consequently, essential websites were shut down, and governmental data, including sensitive emails, were leaked. Although Albania is a NATO member State, it has not applied to activate Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Albania is not a cyber-power State. Therefore, it appealed to the United States, United Kingdom, and other capable States to investigate these cyber attacks and assist in ensuring resiliency. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have attributed State responsibility to Iran, while the EU and NATO have not deviated from their cautious path, avoiding explicit attribution statements.\nIn September 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security and its Minister of Intelligence as engaging in cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies.\n14.

INTRODUCTION Twelve years ago, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was the first to warn of the threat of a cyber\"Pearl Harbor\"or a cyber\"9/11\"terrorist attack, as well as of cyber threats that\"could virtually paralyze the nation.\"¹ Ten years later, Costa Rica was the victim of an unprecedented assault when ransomware cyber attacks virtually paralyzed it to the extent that its president had to officially declare a state of emergency. Albania, a NATO member State, severed diplomatic ties with Iran following Iranian cyber attacks that aimed to cripple Albania's online government services and leak sensitive emails and government data.² In an era of global interconnectedness, the risks are borderless, severe global effects are at stake, and even sensitive national security computer control systems can be targeted. Unsurprisingly, these threatening cyber capabilities carry strategic implications for geopolitics, including the\"Great Power Competition.\"³ This rivalry between powers, coupled with deep ideological disparities (democratic versus authoritarian values), has become a major obstacle in ensuring global safety and stability in and through cyberspace. Rather than reaching a universal consensus on binding comprehensive international regulation, the international community, influenced by the conflicting views of competing powers, has made little headway. Consensus has been limited to agreeing in principle that international law, particularly the UN Charter, is applicable to cyberspace and concluding eleven voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace (the\"List of Non-Binding These disparities, coupled with the policy of silence or ambiguity that major power States embrace and implement regarding disputed legal issues, have resulted in a normative ambiguity. This ambiguity provides major powers with enough leeway to strive for “cyberspace superiority”⁵ while ostensibly maintaining their reputation as law-abiding nations. On the other side of the fence, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea (CRINK) have exploited this ambiguity and the technical characteristics of cyberspace for advancing their interests. Under such circumstances, the List of Non-Binding Norms’s effectiveness in changing State behavior and the level of State compliance are low. Moreover, the norms’ effectiveness and State compliance are influenced by the extent to which the norms and the process of application are perceived as legitimate, as well as the degree to which the outcomes align with the expectations derived from these norms and processes.⁶ ⁴.

To gauge the extent to which the United States has developed its attribution policy in the past decade, it is worth revisiting Secretary Panetta's 2012 remarks.⁷ In response to two consecutive destructive cyber attacks, he hinted at the improving technological capabilities to address the attribution problem by identifying cyber attackers and attributing responsibility.⁸ Therefore, “potential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions that may try to harm America.”⁹ However, it is important to note that neither the United States nor the direct victim States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, officially attributed responsibility for these cyber attacks to Iran, even though its responsibility has been widely accepted.\nIn fact, my previous published research on State practice in cyberspace between 2012 and 2018, co-authored with Yuval Shany, revealed that explicit official attributions were the exception during that period.¹⁰ Nonetheless, the last two attribution determinations addressed in that study indicated a shift from national official attributions toward collective attributions.¹¹ Indeed, the collective activity of nations in attributing responsibility to States for irresponsible behavior in cyberspace and in responding to such behavior has become a vital component of the deterrence pillar within the U.S. National Cyber Strategy. The United Kingdom, the closest ally to the United States, has endorsed this strategy.¹²\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\nThis article evaluates whether the collective attribution process and its outcomes can be perceived as legitimate and credible by the international community, including impartial, nonaligned States. Furthermore, it evaluates whether this process has become a crucial component in effectively holding States accountable for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms and in deterring States from such violations. Analyzing these and related issues requires a sound understanding of the official attribution process in practice, focusing on identifying legitimacy and credibility disparities, and researching the collective attributions announced so far. The article is built exclusively upon open-source intelligence.\nThe article continues as follows. Part II describes the official attribution process, differentiating between technological, legal, and political attributions and discussing the reluctance of States to officially attribute re es/deterrence-in-the-cyber-age-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary (presenting the United Kingdom’s deterrence strategy, mirroring the U.S. approach).\n\nVol. 103 sponsibility. Part III explores major aspects of the American attribution process, the most influential one, excluding the internal division of labor among the U.S. national security and law enforcement entities. It includes five sections that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could affect the extent to which the process's outcomes would be perceived as credible and legitimate. The first is the instrumental ambiguity the United States has embraced in the absence of a binding international convention, which has an adverse effect on transparency and source-based legitimacy. The subsequent three sections—intelligence-based attribution, attribution by indictment, and the private sector's role in ensuring cyber security—are important for mitigating the challenge of transparency but are still insufficient to ensure credibility and legitimacy. The fifth section explores collaboration between the private sector, particularly American corporations, including the most powerful tech platforms globally, and U.S. national security entities responsible for the American attribution process. This all-American collaboration may raise serious concerns among non-American constituencies about the credibility and legitimacy of the U.S. attribution process and its outcomes. Part IV delves into the specific collective attributions starting with three international initiatives. Two of these, initially planned to catalyze and empower collective attributions, have already faded, while the third initiative holds potential as part of a solution. Section IV(B) is a table that succinctly presents fourteen cases of collective attribution, spanning from the first collective attribution on December 19, 2017, until January 1, 2024. A detailed overview of these fourteen cases appears as an annex at the end of this article. Section IV(C) analyzes the findings. Part V concludes.\n## II. OFFICIAL ATTRIBUTION Much has been written in the literature about detecting, identifying, and attributing responsibility for cyber attacks to a culprit State by the official authorities of the victim State.¹³ Only a decade ago, the prevalent view con ¹³.

Nevertheless, this task remains easier said than done, particularly considering the challenges associated with legally attributing State responsibility, which I will address in a subsequent article.\n\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 Every victim State thoroughly analyzes the information collected from all sources, including from cyber power State allies and cyber security and tech firms, to conclude whether the information is well-established and sufficient for a definite attribution. Even if the information includes enough evidence for attribution, the victim State's political leadership must weigh a wide range of strategic considerations and then determine whether to officially attribute responsibility; what level of transparency to implement; whether to retaliate, and if so, how, covertly or overtly; and which type of response would be perceived as lawful or legitimate in the given circumstances?\nA State might avoid an official attribution to preclude risks and actions that do not coincide with its national security interests, such as jeopardizing intelligence sources, disclosing intelligence gaps that the victim State may have pertaining to its rivals' cyber capabilities, exposing the victim State's confidential cyber capabilities, and averting the significant risk of misattribution, which could lead policymakers to wrongly engage in retribution and escalation.\nFurthermore, by refraining from public attribution, the victim State eliminates public pressure for retaliation and may lead the culprit State to believe it has not been detected. This strategy could allow the victim State to covertly monitor the operation and gather valuable intelligence about its rival's cyber capabilities. Additionally, it could facilitate the detection of additional covert operations employing the same cyber techniques while also considering disinformation or deception operations.[17] Moreover, powers that still obscure their political and legal approaches to pending cyber legal questions—such as the boundaries of legitimate\"cyber espionage,\"the clear threshold for constituting a prohibited\"use of force\"and a prohibited intervention, and how\"territorial sovereignty\"should be applied in cyberspace—might hesitate to officially attribute responsibility in specific circumstances. This is because such attribution could reduce the legal ambiguity these States have embraced to preserve their technological edge and maintain strategic leeway.\nTherefore, attribution is primarily a political decision relying on prudent and thorough discretion on whether to officially attribute responsibil-\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\nAs noted above, the difficulties of legally attributing State responsibility will be addressed in a subsequent article. For the purposes of the present article, it is worth noting the following: pursuant to the rules of State responsibility, a State harmed by a malicious cyber operation that is willing to officially attribute responsibility to an attacking State and has a legal justification for a lawful response, must meet two cumulative requirements.[20] The first is to indicate a breach of an international rule that binds States under circumstances like those of the cyber incident in question. This might be controversial as long as international cyber law remains in its embryonic stage and the extent and conditions under which customary rules of international law would apply to cyberspace as binding law continue to be open-ended. The second requirement is to identify a perpetrator suspected of breaching the international rule and substantiate their connection—either as an official agent or as a proxy—to a specific State.\nThus far, none of the attributing States have faced demands to legally prove their attribution statement within the framework of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Due to cyberspace's unique characteristics and legal ambiguity, the legal demands for substantiating State responsibility in cyberspace are uncertain, making it more difficult to legally attribute such responsibility.[21] While legally attributing State responsibility for international Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 wrongdoing in the physical (non-virtual) domain is complicated and exceedingly rare, it has never been done regarding States' malicious cyber operations. In this context, Delbert Tran defined the\"attribution problem\"as a complete\"red herring.\"22 In circumstances where a sufficient degree of certainty (rather than absolute certainty) is enough to impose responsibility, and computer scientists have developed a range of tools to trace the culprits, the problem can be solved by\"configuring the law.\"23 Clement Guitton finds the attribution of State responsibility\"a lot more complex and nuanced,\"adding that the lack of binding standards of proof provides the States involved with great flexibility to manipulatively achieve their political aims.24 Nevertheless, the following section shows that leading cyber power States are not enthusiastic, to put it mildly, about officially attributing responsibility to other States for violating norms of responsible State behavior. This is despite the fact that official attribution is a political act, ostensibly exempt from meeting legal requirements, such as transparent and admissible evidence. To date, this process has never been applied in court with respect to cyber incidents.\n# A. Reluctance of States to Officially Attribute Responsibility During recent decades, States have conducted hundreds or thousands of disruptive and destructive cyber attacks either through their official organs and agents or through proxies. Only in a tiny fraction of cases did States officially attribute responsibility to other States based on technical and all-source intelligence. At times, these official attributions also relied on private sector contributions through confidential or nonconfidential reports of relevant companies. At least until the second half of 2017, victim States would refrain from officially attributing responsibility to another State unless they were amid an armed conflict, during which they often blamed OF INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION (Cesare P.R. Romano, Karen Alter &amp; Yuval Shany eds., 2013).\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\nIn fact, until 2017 the United States was the only State that had officially attributed responsibility to another State for executing a specific cyber attack in peacetime. The United States did so only twice, both in rare circumstances: attribution to North Korea for executing the Sony Pictures hack, and attribution to Russia for conducting the Democratic National Committee hack and additional cyber operations meddling in the American election campaign (2016).²⁶ Another well-known damaging cyber attack, the Ababil operation (distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against New York's financial sector in 2011–2013), was investigated and, three years later, resulted in indicting in absentia foreign operatives who were Iranian government agents.²⁷ The detailed indictment, on the face of things, could be sufficient for officially attributing responsibility to the Iranian regime. However, the U.S. Administration declined to follow this path, likely due to political and national security considerations. The United States implemented the same approach and refrained from official attributions on additional occasions when the Department of Justice also indicted Chinese, Russian, and North Korean governmental operatives for breaching U.S. law.²⁸ The United Kingdom also avoided officially attributing State responsibility until October 2017, when it did so for the first time with respect to the WannaCry cyber attack.²⁹ Interestingly, France continues to embrace a Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 more cautious approach, preferring discreet diplomatic channels to increase the odds of peacefully resolving tense situations while averting the risk of escalation. Consequently, to date, France has never officially, and on its own—as opposed to under the EU's collective attributions detailed below—attributed to another State responsibility for a cyber attack targeted at French national interests.³⁰ Strangely, France even declined to attribute responsibility for the 2017 Macron Leaks, even when the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging six officers of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) for responsibility for this malicious Russian cyber operation.³¹ Germany has embraced a similar policy, with two exceptions related solely to Russian intervention in German election campaigns.³² The first exception occurred in October 2018, when Germany joined a collective attribution led by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, attributing to the GRU responsibility for a series of severe cyber attacks, including the Bundestag hack of 2015.³³ In 2019, more than four years later, the German\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\nIt is noteworthy that this was the first report of a State officially holding another State accountable for a cyber attack and responding with an official diplomatic protest, relying on information that merely met the level of “suspicions.” Apparently, this sort of cutting corners or lowering the bar of evidence stemmed from the urgent need to stop or deter Russia from interfering with the quickly approaching German elections race. This coincides with the principle, according to which an official attribution is a purely political decision, not necessarily a legal attribution that should meet specific legal requirements. It is no surprise that two months later, an updated Mandiant Threat Intelligence Research report asserted that it could not that the GRU was, “‘with almost absolute certainty,’ behind the APT28 cyberespionage campaign, which attacked a number of targets worldwide, including the German Bundestag...” (emphasis added).\n\nVol. 103\"rule out Russian contributions to either UNC1151 or Ghostwriter.\"³⁷ However, it stated that their researchers had not uncovered direct evidence of such contributions.³⁸ While official attribution is a political decision, it still relies solely on the outcomes of the national attribution process. The attribution determination does not rely on full transparency or even a significant degree of transparency, let alone the ability to withstand any external, independent, and impartial scrutiny. This provides room for questioning the credibility and legitimacy of the official attribution. Part III addresses several segments of the U.S. national attribution process, examining how they may have potential positive or negative impacts on the legitimacy and credibility of the collective process and its outcomes.\n## III. EVALUATING ASPECTS OF LEGITIMACY AND CREDIBILITY IN THE ATTRIBUTION PROCESS National security interests dictate confidentiality regarding classified intelligence, including information about sensitive cyber tools, detection capabilities, and military cyber capabilities. However, in the absence of multinational, impartial, legal, and professional scrutiny regarding the accuracy and lawfulness of the official attribution in any given situation, attributing States must be mindful of how various constituencies could perceive their attribution statements. Without accepted clear and binding rules, these statements may not be viewed as lawful. Nevertheless, there is a concerted effort to influence public opinion through enhancing the legitimacy of the attribution process. If successful, this could bolster the effectiveness of its attribution determinations.\nThe following sections address five segments that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could positively or negatively influence how the outcomes of the process are perceived for credibility and\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\n# A. An Instrumental Ambiguity\nCyberspace's unique technological attributes produce opportunities for cyber power States to surreptitiously generate significant strategic gains through covert cyber operations, thereby minimizing the risk of being held accountable for breaching the law and harming their reputation as law abiding States. On the one hand, States strive to evade legal responsibility by distancing themselves from any factual or legal linkage to the malicious cyber operations in question. On the other hand, national security interests dictate the non-disclosure of classified information for both victim and attacking States. However, such data could help them substantiate arguments to strengthen or dismiss relevant accusations.\nAs mentioned above, States, particularly the leading powers involved in the Great Power Competition, have embraced instrumental ambiguity, including maintaining silence on questions related to the interpretation and application of recognized principles and rules of customary international law in cyberspace. The primary motive behind this policy is to retain a sufficient margin of maneuver to enable the protection and promotion of strategic national interests in the rapidly evolving cybersphere. This policy of ambiguity inherently leads to accountability gaps that the most influential cyber power States, like the United States, are reluctant to resolve. Nevertheless, it is crucial for these States to play a decisive role in shaping international cyber law in a manner and at a time that aligns best with their national security interests. Unsurprisingly, they seek to avoid situations requiring an independent, international, judicial forum, such as the International Court of Justice, to resolve legal ambiguities surrounding State conduct in cyberspace.\nNotwithstanding the growing number of States that have clarified, albeit partially and cautiously, their views about a limited number of legal questions, the policy of ambiguity still prevails. The policy influences policymakers when considering whether to officially attribute responsibility and\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nwhen considering how transparent to be regarding relevant evidence and legal arguments.³⁹\nOfficial attribution regarding cyber incidents in itself does not eliminate the need for transparency. This requirement is inherent in the legal obligation to substantiate State responsibility in both non-cyber and cyber incidents.⁴⁰ Transparency is essential to legitimize the official attribution by reflecting its “right process” through its process-based and outcome-based legitimacy.⁴¹ In the absence of accessible international judicial or quasi-judicial forums, as well as an impartial international monitoring institution, conflicting States might seek to influence the final “judgment” of the “international court of legitimacy.” This type of influence often involves legitimizing one side while delegitimizing the other. To achieve this, States should enhance transparency regarding their findings and, more importantly, with respect to processes and procedures undertaken. This includes ensuring that they align with Thomas Franck’s concept of the “right process.”⁴² The degree to which this transparency is genuine and comprehensive serves to strengthen their arguments in attributing responsibility or denying it, respectively.\nRelying solely on the investigative role of the United States or the United Kingdom, coupled with limited transparency and unwillingness to disclose persuasive evidence, opens the door to plausible deniability. Excluding independent, objective, and multinational experts, as well as representatives from other States, from participating in the attribution process also provides grounds for criticizing the integrity of the process. The absence of these persons may raise concerns about the process being flawed, unfounded, politically biased, and non-transparent, thus, not credible or legit-\n³⁹.

FRANCK, supra note 6, at 19, 24, 235 (the institution’s, or rule’s legitimacy derives from a generally held belief that each of them has been established and operates according to accepted principles of right process).\n\nShould a State that officially attributes State responsibility for wrongful acts in cyberspace evade disclosure of the evidence and confidential information upon which the attribution and, if undertaken, retribution rely?\nThe first to address this question, in November 2016, was Brian Egan, U.S. State Department Legal Advisor, who noted that States are not required to act with full transparency when attributing responsibility to another State.43 Since then, a growing number of States have embraced a legal stance that denies the obligation to reveal classified evidence prior to attribution or countermeasures, making the extent of disclosure a matter of policy that often involves complex considerations.44 Striking a balance between accountability, diplomatic relations, and, most importantly, national security, including the strategic interest of maintaining instrumental ambiguity, remains a significant challenge in the evolving landscape of cyberspace governance. Yet simply prioritizing national security interests to the extent of excluding transparency may erode trust in the attribution statement. Nevertheless, powers like the United States and the United Kingdom, which possess advanced cyber capabilities and robust intelligence, do not hesitate to base their attribution claims solely on their intelligence assessment system, thereby preserving confidentiality and national security interests.\n## B. Intelligence-Based Attribution The term\"intelligence assessment\"usually does not imply absolute certainty nor admissibility in court but rather the degree of certainty and credibility with which a certain factual narrative should be perceived, using the qualifiers of the national intelligence community about high, moderate, or low likelihood/certainty of the narrative as described in the attribution statement.45 The degree of certainty obviously depends on the level of trust in the information collected and the extent to which it is considered reliable and credible. The more reliable and credible, the higher the degree of cer Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 tainty, and the more that information may whet the policymakers' appetites to officially attribute responsibility to the culprit State if additional political considerations justify such an attribution.\nUp to this point, the United States and the United Kingdom have adhered to this official format of attribution, responding publicly with measures such as diplomatic démarche and sanctions when attributions were based on an intelligence assessment of high certainty and the interest of national security allowed a limited transparency to withstand an appropriate judicial or administrative review. By endorsing this practice, both States have averted compromising sensitive intelligence to justify their official attribution and retorsion, which is a response within the prerogative of any State. Even if the attribution of State responsibility proves to be mistaken, the response undertaken remains lawful, albeit unfriendly, and is often reciprocally retaliated. Nevertheless, covert cyber operations remain a viable response, either alongside or instead of retorsions. However, if exposed, their legality would inevitably be challenged.\nCritics of intelligence assessment as major grounds for attribution argue that it relies on criteria that\"may at best amount to circumstantial evidence,\"far below the evidentiary standards used in courts.[46] This allows States to manipulate cases to fit preconceived narratives and embody political agendas; it may lead to misleading results involving the misinterpretation of information influenced by what later turns out to be a false conception.[47] None of the official American attributions since 2014, nor any of the collective attributions that the United States and the United Kingdom have announced since 2017, have corroborated this criticism. Both States have officially attributed responsibility relying on their intelligence and a high degree of certainty (\"almost certainly\"). Some of these attributions have also referred to open-source investigative reports and technological findings of tech and cyber security companies, mostly American, as discussed below. Others were also followed, months or even years later, by detailed American indictments delivering the message that they rely on sufficient and admissible evidence. However, only a limited number of States have been sufficiently convinced or politically motivated to officially adopt and join these attribution statements. Even these States did not do so because they truly participated in the attribution process itself or obtained access to Nevertheless, the investigation team determining the attribution remains exclusively American. The limited number of participating States might also indicate that those States, which the United States and the United Kingdom interchangeably have not allowed to participate in the process or share classified information, are hesitant to blindly trust American or British intelligence assessments. Considering that the United States is the driving force behind these attributions and that its rivals, such as the CRINK States, are consistently on the receiving end underscores the importance of challenging the credibility of the process and its outcomes.\nConcurrently with intelligence-based attribution, the United States has endorsed, on its own, another method to mitigate the demand for transparency. This is attribution by indictment (\"naming and shaming\"). The next section will demonstrate that, despite its relative transparency, attribution by indictment has not proven a benchmark for credibility and trust.\n## C. Attribution by Indictment Until now, the United States stands as the first and only State to “name and shame” by indicting, in absentia, foreign State-sponsored hackers, mostly citizens of the CRINK. They have been accused of breaching the U.S. Code by committing cybercrimes against Americans and U.S. entities. These indictments provide an opportunity to describe their worldwide malicious cyber activity. They include declassified information about unlawful cyber activities, shedding light on relevant State responsibility. This responsibility stems from the fact that, while committing the unlawful activities, the defendants were either State agents (such as soldiers, officers, or other government officials) or third parties under the State’s control, direction, instruction, or empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority.⁴⁸ However, indicting unlawful combatants, such as spies captured during peacetime or armed conflict while conducting their mission in the territory ⁴⁸. Articles on State Responsibility, supra note 20, arts. 4–5, 8.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 of the accusing State, is unexceptional and reflects customary international law.⁴⁹ Nevertheless, indicting, in absentia, defendants identified as official agents of a foreign State for remotely hacking and damaging, during peacetime, targets located in the territory of the accusing State is both exceptional and unprecedented.⁵⁰ This could be acceptable if the hacks were criminally motivated and could not be attributed to a specific State, according to the Articles on State Responsibility.\nThe U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, admitted that “traditional military and intelligence activity is a separate sphere of conduct that ought not be subject to domestic criminal law,” with the recognized exception noted above of charging intelligence officers operating undercover in the United States.⁵¹ Barr introduced new and unprecedented exceptions such as State-sponsored computer intrusions “for the purpose of intellectual property theft for the use of [the Chinese] private sector, bank robbery, and interfering with our democratic elections” and “deliberate, indiscriminate theft of vast amounts of sensitive personal data of civilians,”⁵² as occurred in the case of hacking Equifax. In Barr’s words, such cases “cannot be countenanced.”⁵³ In fact, such cases have led to the submission of indictments in deviation from the customary principles of international law and the recognized principle of criminal responsibility. One scholar labeled this a “judicialized attribution,” a new tool to convey more concrete and less political attribution focusing on the evidence and lawfulness of the behavior according to domestic law rather than international law.⁵⁴ This is despite the fact that both the superiors and subordinates who followed their orders purportedly committed the attributed crimes remotely from\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\nFurthermore, invoking this policy of indictments requires proceeding in front of a federal grand jury to investigate and decide whether and on what charges to indict. This process is expected to be unbiased, reinforcing the indictment's credibility. However, the jury operates behind closed doors, hearing the federal prosecutor and live testimonies of relevant witnesses, mostly federal investigators, and American cyber security and technology experts. In fact, the process is controlled and guided by the federal prosecutor of the case rather than a judge. Moreover, the indictments may also rely on evidence from American tech and cybersecurity companies, which, as explored below, closely collaborate with local governmental authorities. The national loyalty of these companies is often taken for granted.55 While this perception may not be entirely accurate, it is sufficient to undermine the trust in the impartiality and credibility of the American attribution process by significant portions of the international community, particularly populations and governments in the Global South.\nMoreover, Article 28(f) of the 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report approved by the UN General Assembly asserts that\"the accusation of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against states should be substantiated.\"56 The question of whether the American and British practice in this regard meets this requirement is still contested. As mentioned above, a growing number of States have publicly endorsed the view that States attributing responsibility do not need to disclose classified evidence. States like the United States and the United Kingdom maintain that their findings are substantiated by the professional work of criminal investigators, tech experts, and intelligence professionals who Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 do not violate Article 28, which is silent about the ways in which accusations should be substantiated.\nIn contrast, the CRINK States, the exclusive subjects of such attribution processes, often disregard or automatically reject the accusations against them. Russia consistently demands that attributing States substantiate their accusations by revealing evidence, particularly forensic or technical evidence.57 China, which always criticizes the U.S. tendency to function as the\"global sheriff,\"has recently responded by employing the same attribution approach, directing accusations toward the United States for cyber attacks allegedly conducted against Chinese entities.58 Interestingly, the Obama Administration, striving to avoid escalation and miscalculation, refrained from officially attributing explicit responsibility to States for specific cyber attacks and preferred to do so indirectly by unsealing an indictment against Iranians three years later.59 A shift has been noted since 2018 when indictments started to complement the administration's official attribution statements. However, the policy in this regard remains inconsistent. Not every official attribution is accompanied by indictment, and conversely, not every indictment is accompanied by an official attribution.\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\nThus far, the United States has not succeeded in prompting even a single State, not even its closest ally, the United Kingdom, to follow it in implementing this\"naming and shaming\"strategy. Unsurprisingly, this American strategy has not deterred the CRINK States. As the FBI's Deputy Director put it when announcing another indictment:\"Time and again, Russia has made it clear: They will not abide by accepted norms, and instead, they intend to continue their destructive, destabilizing cyber behavior.\"61 Additionally, U.S. federal indictments, even when accompanied by collective attributions, have not significantly increased the number of States joining the collective attribution.62 This, coupled with the growing number of CRINK-sponsored cyber attacks, raises significant doubts about the extent to which this strategy is indeed effective. The responses to these doubts vary widely. Some scholars opine that this strategy appears to be a failure and\"even might be self-defeating.\"63 In contrast, others argue that it serves more than just deterrence, notably enabling other actions like sanctions to Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 assist the U.S. efforts in constructing the desired international norms for cyberspace.⁶⁴ For the purposes of this article, it suffices to note that by unsealing indictments in absentia, the United States strives to have it all. On the one hand, it purportedly maintains credible evidence and a reasonable degree of transparency through detailed charges sufficient for imposing ex parte administrative personal sanctions against unreachable foreign defendants. On the other hand, none of these defendants are likely to extradite themselves to challenge the legal and administrative proceedings, including the credibility of the evidence. The U.S. Assistant Attorney General described the indictments as “just a piece of the puzzle,” representing a critical, credible step towards imposing meaningful consequences, adding that it is part of building consensus inside and outside the United States about responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace.⁶⁵ In conclusion, the benefit of attribution through indictment may be associated with three possible objectives: using the prestige of the American justice proceedings along with a degree of transparency to reinforce the attribution’s credibility through the lens of other impartial States; deterring States from launching similar attacks and damaging their reputation as law-abiding States; and building a broad international consensus to compel States to adhere to norms of responsible State behavior, such as the prohibition on conducting cyber attacks against critical infrastructure facilities. Nevertheless, the experience of recent years has not indicated any remarkable success in accomplishing all these objectives, at least not enhancing the credibility of the attributions through such indirect measures, nor significantly increasing the number of States joining the collective attributions ⁶⁴.

However, neither provides transparent evidence that could withstand external and impartial scrutiny, subsequently substantiating the attribution determinations and ensuring their credibility.\nThe next section delves into the significant role played by the private sector, particularly in the United States, illustrating how private sector collaboration with the U.S. Government may enhance the level of transparency in determining and announcing official attributions. However, concurrently, it may raise concerns about the legitimacy and credibility of such attributions.\n## D. The Role of the Private Sector The private sector, through its major tech and cyber security firms, plays a key role in the attribution process, as it possesses significant tech capabilities for detecting and investigating cyber incidents. Western companies, mostly American, such as Meta (Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram), Microsoft (Windows, Azure), Amazon (Amazon Web Services), Alphabet (Google, YouTube), X (previously Twitter), Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Verizon, dominate cyberspace in both software and hardware, encompassing global social media, big data, cloud services, artificial intelligence, computer operating systems, and search engines. Each of these realms is a playground where any vulnerability exposed by third parties could be exploited, posing serious threats to the company's reputation and business success. Thus, these companies invest vast resources to consistently lead in technology, developing cutting-edge capabilities to detect, investigate, and thwart any threat, regardless of its motives through in-house cyber threat intelligence teams. Moreover, global tech platforms, in particular, have achieved worldwide dominance and maintain a formidable presence in cyberspace, a level of control that State cyber powers, including a cyber superpower like the United States, struggle to maintain.⁶⁷ Additional- ⁶⁶.

Nevertheless, voices are growing, as embodied in proposals and decisions, calling to limit the global impact of Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 ly, civil society organizations, such as the Citizen Lab, which focus mostly on safeguarding human rights from malicious cyber operations, and leading multinational cyber security firms, such as Mandiant, CrowdStrike, Kaspersky, and Symantec, have been evolving their cyber security expertise to successfully detect, thwart, and investigate any harmful cyber operation from any source.⁶⁸ That said, victim States less capable in cyberspace would seek immediate assistance from a cyber power ally to confront any hostile cyber operation or campaign and investigate accountability. Typically, such aid would involve collaboration with domestic or global cyber security and tech companies that have become major players in the field of cyber threat intelligence, holding capabilities that may even exceed those of government intelligence agencies.⁶⁹ These capabilities are crucial for gathering, processing, and analyzing technological findings to promptly establish situational awareness for the State's decision-makers.⁷⁰ Multiple firms have already engaged in such activities and provided their client States, and sometimes the public, with relatively prompt and detailed technical reports. These reports may include clear-cut technical evidence to detect and distinctly identify the perpetrators. However, technical attribution alone is not always sufficient for attributing responsibility with a full or high level of certainty. As these companies); see also Elena Chachko, National Security by Platform, 25 STANFORD TECHNOLOGY LAW REVIEW 55 (2021). The Russia-Ukraine war has raised a serious debate regarding the unique and unprecedented role that powerful tech platforms, like Starlink and Microsoft, have independently realized during this war. Addressing this intriguing issue is beyond the scope of this article.\n⁶⁸ Kristen E. Eichensehr, Public-Private Cybersecurity, 95 TEXAS LAW REVIEW 467 (2017) (describing the roles of the U.S. Government and the private sector in the context of contending with international cybersecurity threats, including botnet takedowns, remediating zero-day vulnerabilities, and attributing cyber intrusions to States or Statesponsored cyber attackers); see also Jennifer Maddocks, Outsourcing of Governmental Functions in Contemporary Conflict: Rethinking the Issue of Attribution, 59 VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 47, 68 (2019) (discussing the option of attributing to States responsibility for private companies' activities by virtue of Article 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility).\n⁶⁹ Kris Oosthoek &amp; Christian Doerr, Cyber Threat Intelligence: A Product Without a Process?, 34 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 300, 302 (2020).\n⁷⁰ Id. at 301; see also Nicholas Tsagourias &amp; Michael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges, 31 EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 941 (2020); Sasha Romanosky &amp; Benjamin Boudreaux, Private-Sector Attribution of Cyber Incidents: Benefits and Risks to the U.S. Government, 34 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 463 (2021); Eichensehr, supra note 16, 547–50.\nInternational Law Studies Private sector firms that investigate and expose malicious cyber tools and methodologies used in specific cyber attacks publish their findings to Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 raise awareness about these threats among both governmental and nongovernmental users. More importantly, this helps enhance their cyber security capabilities and their preparedness to detect and thwart such threats. At the same time, such information may raise suspicions that a specific cyber attack is, in fact, an act of State or a State-sponsored operation. Occasionally, a private sector technological investigation may lead to complete attribution, including identification of the culprit State or its official organ.73 This occurs despite the general business orientation to avoid involvement in inter-State conflicts. Such attribution is a proper alternative to the official attribution that the victim State may avoid due to its strategic and national security considerations, as noted above. In such circumstances, the company's explicit technological attribution may influence international public opinion, delegitimizing the suspected State in the eyes of other States. Furthermore, any State could become a victim of similar unacceptable behavior at any time, and each may use such attributions to politically attribute responsibility to the suspected State.\nThe following section addresses the collaboration U.S. national security agencies maintain with relevant American private sector companies, including in the context of the attribution process. Naturally, this partnership is not completely transparent, nor is it exclusive to the United States. It also encompasses attribution determinations, raising doubts about the extent to which these determinations should be perceived as credible and legitimate through the lens of neutral observers.\n## E. Private Sector Collaboration with Governments A voluntary contribution by private sector companies to national efforts to defend the country from external threats is common, self-evident, and not limited to wartime. Thus, authorities of States cooperate and maintain close and confidential ties with leading domestic entities in the private sector in every relevant field, including health, transportation, tech-industry, telecommunications, and cybersecurity. Liberal democracies, as opposed to authoritarian regimes, maintain such cooperation within the boundaries of law. The Snowden disclosures of June 2013 about secret National Security Agency (NSA) operations involving American telecom companies rein\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\nDue to the Great Power Competition and the intensifying tension, particularly in cyberspace, the U.S. Administration has preemptively imposed a Federal ban on procuring software and services from certain Chinese and Russian tech and software companies that may secretly serve as long arms for both competitor powers in the sensitive fields of cyberspace and telecommunications. Moreover, the U.S. Administration has also urged its allies and relevant companies to follow suit.76 Recently, the U.S. Bureau of Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 Industry and Security has published its first final determination, prohibiting Kaspersky from directly or indirectly providing cybersecurity products and services in the United States or to U.S. persons and entities. Shortly before this, President Biden signed a bill requiring ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, to divest TikTok's U.S. assets by January 2025 or face a national ban, unless the U.S. courts find this legislation unconstitutional.77 Nevertheless, given the cyberspace architecture and its unique features, such governmental bans or new restrictive legislation may not be sufficient to meet the challenge of ensuring cybersecurity. The major American tech platforms have consistently developed their leading technological competencies and exercise significant control over information flow and cyber access to sensitive critical infrastructure through their technological systems. Furthermore, they have become a predominant global force in cyberspace.

However, in the absence of an independent international mechanism of accountability, the American attribution process, including the said collaboration, should withstand the scrutiny of its primary target constituency—the international community or international public opinion. Naturally, national security aspects of this collaboration remain confidential, though not always entirely so. Similarly, transparency may partially manifest itself in three dimensions: unexpected and undesired transparency—by leakers and whistleblowers; forced and balanced transparency—exclusively by virtue of judicial warrants that balance between conflicted interests, usually national security on one side and human rights on the other; and coordinated transparency—at the initiative of federal authorities in concert with the respective tech platforms.\n⁸³.

Conversely, if the companies are not willing to do something for any government, they will also not do it for the U.S.90 However, she finds that despite all their efforts to appear neutral, “the companies have not yet achieved—and quite likely will never succeed in achieving—perfect neutrality. They are still strongly associated with the U.S., where they remain domiciled and maintain their headquarters.”91 Additionally, they cannot ignore that the U.S. Government is their most significant customer, and just as importantly, the U.S. Government possesses the power to adversely affect their business operations through new domestic legislation that subsequently may also impact their global operations.\nNonetheless, scholars have indicated a shift in the way the major U.S. global tech companies treat U.S. Government requests for collaboration.92 This shift stemmed from the urgent need to salvage the reputations of companies in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures, and it refers primarily to governmental requests that collide with constitutional rights like freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Accordingly, the companies have begun implementing a policy of publicly rejecting and litigating against such governmental demands. In this context, companies will not carry out governmental requests that may collide with human rights unless litigation fails and explicit court warrants are issued, as almost occurred in the San Bernardino case.93 Therefore, Ashley Deeks counts private sector tech compa blogs.microsoft.com/uploads/2017/03/Transcript-of-Brad-Smiths-Keynote-Address-at-the-RSA-Conference-2017.pdf.\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\nIndeed, tech platforms and cybersecurity firms such as Microsoft, Mandiant, CrowdStrike, and Symantec have deviated from the cautious approach of avoiding full attribution and have increased the number of occasions in which they clearly attributed responsibility for a cyber attack to a State from the CRINK group.⁹⁵ It is safe to assume that any explicit private sector attribution of responsibility to a State, even for a State-sponsored cyber attack, would not have been made public before being shared with the FBI, NSA, or any other pertinent American authority.⁹⁶ This would no-apple-iphone-fbi/ (The Justice Department obtained a court order directing Apple to write software to bypass the security feature in the iPhone used by a terrorist who was killed after shooting and killing fourteen people and injuring others.

Twelve years later, the company admitted that a\"sophisticated nation-state hacking unit\"other than the NSA had exploited that backdoor, at least starting in December 2015. Bloomberg's investigation found that the hacking group was Chinese and connected to the Chinese government.\nUnsurprisingly, a significant part of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission's¹⁰³ recommendations were devoted to cybersecurity collaboration with the private sector. President Biden embraced this by issuing the Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, calling on private sector companies to partner with the federal government to foster a Vol. 103 more secure cyberspace. Subsequently, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency established the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, and the NSA launched the Cybersecurity Collaboration Center. The NSA's Director left no room for doubt, saying,\"in this era of strategic competition, government, academia and industry partners must work together as a coalition with shared risks, shared goals and shared solutions.\"For both sides, the U.S. government and the American tech platforms, close collaboration is a force multiplier in serving shared values and national interests. Conversely, the CRINK group and its allies use this visible all-American collaboration, and more significantly, the invisible collaboration, as a force multiplier in criticizing the credibility, legitimacy, and neutrality of the American attribution process and its unsurprising outcomes. Neutral or\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\nThe next Part focuses on the collective attribution policy that the United States, along with its closest allies, has been implementing since 2017. Given the experience to date, should this policy be welcomed or re-evaluated? That is the question discussed below.\n## IV. COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION In 2017, in the wake of two developments—the collapse of the fifth round of the UN–GGE and large-scale cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya—the United States and the United Kingdom extended the policy of official attribution to a new pattern of collective attribution aimed at deterring States from violating norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. As the table below shows, all the reviewed collective attributions, except one, relied on the national attribution processes of the United States and the United Kingdom regarding cyber attacks that targeted them or their allies. Prior to discussing the cumulative experience of the collective attribution concept per se, and to illustrate the complete picture in this context, the first section of this Part reviews three international initiatives that the United States introduced to deter States and advance responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace in conjunction with holding States accountable by relying on the concept of collective attribution.\n## A. Collective Attribution Within International Initiatives Despite the legal obstacles and instrumental ambiguity noted above, the List of Non-Binding Norms remains the main international instrument to hold States accountable for wrongdoing that violates the voluntary norms of responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. This accountability is essential for establishing effective deterrence, while the attribution determination is a keystone for invoking accountability in any given incident.\nIn its updated National Cyber Strategy, the Trump Administration announced the launch of the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative to re 2023), https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/huawei_china_claims/ (reporting on post of China’s Ministry of State Security on WeChat, in which the United States is accused of running cyber attacks and espionage for more than ten years against China, Russia, and forty-five other countries and regions, and of implanting backdoors in equipment and software and using American global technology brands to monitor and steal data).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 inforce efforts to deter States from violating the List of Non-Binding Norms through “official attribution,” “collective attribution,” a “naming and shaming” strategy, and through a “collective response” by jointly imposing sanctions against States accused of violating the List.¹⁰⁹ Ultimately, no State has officially announced that it will join the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, not even the closest ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, although it promptly endorsed the pillars of the U.S. strategy.¹¹⁰ The International Cyber Deterrence Initiative has not evolved into an effective international initiative, such as the Proliferation Security Initiative¹¹¹ or the International Counter Ransomware Initiative discussed below. In fact, the United States never officially launched the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, and senior U.S. officials have rarely referred to it.¹¹² The literature includes only one study that references the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, focusing solely on the collective response rather than the credible collective attribution that is implicitly a prerequisite to any collective response.¹¹³ Within this study, the scholar examined the policy embraced by each State party in the FVEY in building offensive cyber capabilities. The findings reveal that the FVEY States, excluding New Zealand, align with the approach of responding firmly to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Additionally, those States have developed the offensive cyber capabilities needed, among others, to uphold such a policy. The scholar concludes by suggesting that the FVEY and other like-minded allies enhance the credibility of their deterrent collective response ¹⁰⁹. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12.\n¹¹⁰.

It also calls on States to transparently impose costs under international law. The Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has only been invoked once since 2019. On February 21, 2020, fifteen out of the twenty-eight Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace partner States teamed up with Georgia and attributed responsibility to Russia for a disruptive cyber campaign conducted by the GRU. They politically denounced Russia and demanded it comply with the List of Non-Binding Norms.[115] Two months later, on April 16, 2020, the Czech Republic's National Cyber and Information Security Agency warned of a real threat of serious cyber attacks against its healthcare sector amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The day after, the U.S. Secretary of State released a statement in which he mentioned the Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace framework and warned against conducting such dangerous cyber attacks or knowingly allowing them:\"Anyone that engages in such an action should expect consequences.\"[116] Eventually, the threat was not real Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 ized and Christopher Ford, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State, credited American deterrence for this.¹¹⁷ However, since the warning statements declined to identify the State allegedly behind the malicious plan, this cannot be labeled as a collective attribution. Moreover, neither the Czech nor the American authorities were transparent enough to convince observers that this was not a shot in the dark, but rather a successful preventive response to a credible and imminent threat.\nAs indicated above, neither the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative nor the Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has gained political significance. Unsurprisingly, the anticipation that States beyond the closest allies of the United States would align with American or British attribution statements and impose various costs—political, economic, and otherwise—proved unfounded. It appears that the United States has relinquished both initiatives and, together with its partners in the FVEY, has remained focused on the collective attribution endeavor, as detailed in the following section.\nHowever, beyond the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, in October 2021 the United States established an international initiative to counter the threat of ransomware cyber operations, which the Biden Administration has recently defined as a threat to U.S. national security.¹¹⁸ Although this International Counter Ransomware Initiative¹¹⁹ deals exclusively with criminally motivated ransomware cyber operations, it remains relevant in the context of the present discussion of collective attribution by States. This is because its primary goal is to uphold multinational cooperation to counteract ransomware threats and bolster both resiliency and deterrence. To achieve this, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative strengthens cooperation by facilitating the sharing of information and professional expertise among the participating States and private sector companies. More crucially for the focus of this article is its collaborative effort to detect and identify hackers or hacker groups involved in ransomware attacks, whether independently ¹¹⁷.

Similarly, the Initiative has not yet led to the attribution of responsibility to States that tolerate recurring cyber attacks initiated from their sovereign territories.\nRussia has already demonstrated that Russian ransomware gangs, such as REvil, may thrive or decline depending on the regime's willingness to cooperate.[121] Ultimately, increasing collaboration among the International Counter Ransomware Initiative States may encompass holding States accountable for ransomware cyber operations, even when initiated and directed from their sovereign territory, violating the due diligence principle. Apart from addressing the legal complexities associated with such accusations, the Initiative's parties may also seek to attribute responsibility and hold States accountable for what they have already defined as prohibited\"irresponsible behaviors.\"Nonetheless, when upheld by a common multinational investigative team, the resulting attribution is collective and certainly more legitimate and credible. During the concluding stages of this article's preparation, the United Kingdom's National Crime Agency publicly exposed Operation Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 Cronos.¹²² An international law enforcement task force led by the UK's National Crime Agency and the FBI and consisting of eleven International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States (United States, United Kingdom, France, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Netherlands, Finland, and Germany) successfully executed an international disruption campaign, taking control of the website and services (ransomware-as-a-service) of LockBit. This criminal hacking group is recognized as the world's most harmful cybercrime group. The outcomes of this operation included the seizure in three countries of LockBit's data exfiltration infrastructure by members of the task force. Two LockBit operatives were arrested in coordination with Europol. The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against two Russian citizens for conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks. The Department of Justice also announced that two defendants responsible for using LockBit to execute ransomware attacks were in custody and would face trial in the United States. The lessons learned from this experience could prove valuable for the United States and the United Kingdom in addressing the pitfalls of the current collective attribution process and response. This could serve as a test case demonstrating how successful cooperation between International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States can be in fighting criminally motivated, as well as politically motivated, cybercrime. Thus, the Initiative, in particular, may serve as an appropriate pilot for exploring optional solutions to better tackle the challenges associated with collective attributions and responses. More importantly, such solutions would enhance State accountability and the effectiveness of attributions in changing State behavior in cyberspace.\n## B. Table of Collective Attributions as of January 1, 2024 The number of collective attributions has been steadily increasing at a slow pace since the first on December 19, 2017. Thus far, the number has reached fourteen collective attributions.¹²³ Each may refer to a single cyber attack or a campaign comprising a bulk of cyber activities that may even span over years. The fourteen cases are described in an expanded list at- ¹²².

Five Eyes' Key Role\nDespite being an intelligence alliance, the FVEY partners are not obligated to full transparency between their intelligence agencies. However, they do share intelligence at a level of confidentiality not extended to other allies. This alliance is the core of the collective attribution strategy, while the United States and the United Kingdom are its driving forces. They cooperate in investigating wide-scale cyber attacks by exchanging confidential information and mobilizing, separately or in conjunction, to assist victim\n¹²⁵.

One indication reinforcing this assessment is taken from the recent Canadian attribution statement. Press Release, Glob. Affairs Canada, Statement on Russia’s Malicious Cyber Activity Affecting Europe and Ukraine (May 10, 2022), https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2022/05/statement-on-russias-malicious-cyber-activity-affecting-europe-and-ukraine.html (recalling each of the seven previous malicious cyber operations attributed to Russia. All are included in the table.). Another indication can be taken from the Press Release, UK Att’y Gen’s Off., Attorney General to Set Out the UK’s Position on Cybersecurity and International Law (May 19, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/attorney-general-to-set-out-the-uks-position-on-cybersecurity-and-international-law (this report enumerated examples of cyber attacks where the United Kingdom “named and shamed” State actors. All are included in the table.).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace\nVol. 103\nStates upon their request, especially when their capability to investigate cyber attacks independently is poor or limited.¹²⁷ Both the United States and the United Kingdom are responsible for all collective attributions listed in the table presented above, except one (Case 10), to be discussed below. The FVEY's attribution announcements are made concurrently and in coordination.¹²⁸ However, they rely on sharing classified information, not on the findings of an independent FVEY multinational investigative team or any other form of international investigative mechanism. Like the decision to officially attribute State responsibility itself, endorsing an official attribution made by another State is a political prerogative for each sovereign State, which may announce it as its own official attribution. Such attribution determinations rely on various cumulative considerations, including the accuracy and credibility of evidence shared with all partners. While Canada has, thus far, actively participated in all collective attributions initiated by the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia refrained in three instances (Cases 6, 7, 13) and New Zealand in four (Cases 6, 7, 11, 13). Neither New Zealand nor Australia publicly justified their decision to refrain in each of these instances.\n## ii. EU and NATO Attributions or Partial Attribution Statements\nThe EU, representing twenty-seven European States, has had a notable practice of declarations in support of collective attributions. Thus far, it participated in eleven out of fourteen collective attributions, while NATO participated in six out of these same eleven attributions. However, the attribution statements on behalf of the EU and NATO could hardly be considered fully attributive. Instead, they may be perceived as a partial attribution of responsibility, making a limited contribution to the collective attribution strategy.\n¹²⁷. See, e.g., Cases 5, 13, supra Section IV(B) (providing examples in which the United Kingdom assisted the Georgian authorities in contending with and investigating the malicious cyber campaign); see Press Release, U.S. Embassy Tirana, Committed Partners in Cyberspace: U.S. Concludes First Defensive Hunt Operation in Albania (Mar. 23, 2023), https://al.usembassy.gov/committed-partners-in-cyberspace-u-s-concludes-first-defensive-hunt-operation-in-albania/.\n¹²⁸. At times, the dates on statements from Australia and New Zealand may not match those of other FVEY partners. However, the announcements are most likely published simultaneously with those of the FVEY partners, and at times the incompatibility of dates may be due to the different time zones.\nInternational Law Studies\n\n(a) The EU and NATO do not possess independent cyber investigative capabilities. Both rely heavily on more capable allies, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, EU and NATO member States, like Sweden, the Netherlands, Estonia, Austria, France, and Germany, each of which possess independent investigative capabilities, allegedly provide the EU security authorities with “deficient and incomplete” evidence in order to preserve the confidentiality of their cyber capabilities.¹²⁹ To date, the EU has joined an official attribution initiated by one of its members only once (Case 10), and the attribution is highly questionable. NATO has never joined an attribution that was not initiated by the United States or the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that both States also face challenges in implementing a high degree of transparency with the EU security authorities due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of their intelligence sources. Nevertheless, the direct involvement of the United States and the United Kingdom in investigating cyber attacks appears to be a differentiating factor, possibly explaining why both, along with Canada and New Zealand, refrained from participating in the EU and Germany collective attribution (Case 10), while Australia settled for expressing solidarity.¹³⁰ (b) The EU and NATO have joined collective attributions through brief declarations or statements issued on behalf of both Councils. The wording of these official declarations or statements must be cautious and measured to achieve unanimity within a truly brief period. Typically, they condemn the cyber attack in question, express concerns about it, and show solidarity with the affected States. The EU and NATO choose to avoid any explicit attribution of responsibility to the CRINK States. At the same time, the United States and the United Kingdom explicitly attribute responsibility primarily to specific official agents or organs of any State within the ¹²⁹.

The EU and NATO refrain from attributing responsibility even to CRINK's official entities, such as intelligence agencies and national security institutions, which some of the U.S. or UK attribution determinations refer to in detail. In Case 9, for instance, the North Atlantic Council's statement acknowledges official statements made by its members—United States, United Kingdom, and Canada—attributing to China responsibility for compromising the Microsoft Exchange Server. The statement continues expressing solidarity with those who were affected, calling on\"all states, including China,\"to uphold their international commitments and\"act responsibly, including in cyberspace.\"131 Similarly, the EU's declaration refrains from explicitly attributing responsibility to China for malicious cyber activities, as opposed to the FVEY attribution statements.132 Instead, the EU\"strongly denounces\"these malicious cyber activities, urging China to comply with norms of responsible State behavior and prevent the use of its territory for such activities.133 The EU approach further differs from the FVEY by emphasizing adherence to the List of Non-Binding Norms, including due diligence, rather than strictly assigning State responsibility. However, challenges arise when applying due diligence to cyberspace, given uncertainties about its compatibility with the specific circumstances and the contested nature of its application in this\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\n(c) Each of the EU member States may publish official attribution statements independently, like any sovereign State. Such statements may be more blatant and explicit than the EU's soft and general statements. An increased frequency of explicit independent statements, especially from cyber power States, aligning around the same conclusion in a specific cyber incident might impact the perceived legitimacy and credibility of the attribution determination in question. Nevertheless, such alignment is infrequent, contingent on the political cost-benefit calculation of each EU member State when deciding whether to act directly with full political responsibility through an official and independent statement.[135] # iii. Incoherency and Lack of Standardization The collective FVEY attributions reviewed indicated incoherency, a lack of standardization, and an absence of transparent criteria, primarily in selecting which cyber operations the United States or the United Kingdom would lead the FVEY to collectively attribute. Likewise, there is uncertainty about the criteria guiding the EU and NATO in determining which attributions to publicly support, all while navigating possible political storms.[136] Questions persist regarding the degree of certainty justifying an attribution in the first place and how to measure that degree.[137] Further considerations involve the timing and format of coordinated announcements, whether through verbal statements by senior government officials (such as heads of states, relevant ministers, and senior officials from the U.S. National Security Council and their counterparts in other States), or by written statements of an authorized governmental agency or ministry, or both in concert.\n\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 The United States has been inconsistent in the way it has chosen to express its official attribution and synchronize it with its partners in the FVEY. At times, it settles for filing or unsealing indictments in absentia (e.g., Cases 4, 7) or for joining advisories (e.g., Case 6). Occasionally, the U.S. action of indicting and/or joining an advisory is in addition to an explicit official political announcement (e.g., Case 9). Conversely, the other\"Four Eyes\"always officially attribute responsibility through official announcements of senior officials, mostly by written statements of the relevant ministers.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of Case 10 as a collective attribution in the table is highly questionable. This marks the inaugural and sole instance where the EU independently initiated, on behalf of its member States, a statement, purported to collectively attribute responsibility.[138] It was primarily in response to Germany's official attribution and ostensibly at its request.[139] Ultimately, the declaration was more of an urgent general warning to Russia against interfering in European national democratic processes rather than a distinct attribution of responsibility for enduring wrongdoings.[140] However, to enable consensus among the twenty-seven EU member States, the statement's wording was softened and generalized, using\"some\"member States, instead of specifying the States, and\"associating\"the wrongdoing with them, instead of clearly\"attributing\"it to Russia.[141] Unsurprisingly, this declaration did not spur additional States to participate in this collective\"attribution,\"except Australia, which expressed its solidarity.[142] By stark contrast, the EU declaration in Case 14, which addresses the same threat of Russian interference in foreign States' democratic pro\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\n## 2. Doubtful Credibility\nThere are only a small number of official attributions and an even smaller number of collective attributions that do not rely primarily on the American attribution process. The credibility and legitimacy deficiencies of the American attribution process, as highlighted in the previous Part—such as ambiguous normativity, limited transparency, and reliance on potentially biased American investigative teams instead of impartial multinational teams—persist unresolved in collective attributions. These issues may deter States from participating in explicit attributions as opposed to partial attributions. The cases reviewed indicate that States' willingness to participate in collective attributions based on the outcome of another State's national attribution process is limited, even if this system belongs to a cyber power State such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, the deterrence and effectiveness of such attributions also remain low.¹⁴⁴\nCase 11 requires a closer look as it raises serious doubts about the credibility of both the American and British attribution processes, and whether their outcomes are credible and persuasive enough to encourage a growing number of States to participate in such collective attributions. In this case, the Ukrainian Government suspected Russia just because it was then the only State interested in destabilizing Ukraine.¹⁴⁵ Just forty-eight hours later, the United States and the United Kingdom provided the fastest attribution determination each of these allies had ever announced. It relied primarily on some technical information \"almost certainly\" linking the GRU to this cyber attack.¹⁴⁶ Anne Neuberger, the White House's Deputy National Secu\n¹⁴³.

While the swift collective attribution may be linked to the looming possibility of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine set to commence in a few days, it does not necessarily justify what might be perceived by any impartial observer as taking shortcuts in the attribution process. This certainly does not enhance trust in the process; on the contrary, it raises concerns.\nThe absence of transparent standardization and criteria is crucial to maintain flexibility in reconciling two conflicting characteristics. On one hand, the List of Non-Binding Norms is non-enforceable due to legal ambiguities and difficulties that are not easily resolved in the contemporary geopolitical situation, as described above. On the other hand, there is the challenge of enhancing State compliance with the List to reduce global risks and instability. However, this flexibility is not necessarily an ad-\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\n# 3. Shaping “Rules of the Road”\nAiming to bolster deterrence, the United States and the United Kingdom initiated the collective attribution process as a response to attacking States in cyberspace.[150] However, in the absence of normative clarity, attribution announcements refer to unacceptable and irresponsible State behavior, rather than specifying international rules or norms allegedly breached by the given cyber attack. Thus, the policy implemented usually involves delegitimization (\"naming and shaming\") and retorsions, lawful measures that can be imposed without the need for detailed legal justification. The objective is to shape \"rules of the road\" by specifying instances of unacceptable cyber activity on case-by-case bases and to develop State practice accordingly. This involves instilling among the entire community of nations the perspectives of collective attributors regarding which cyber operations may constitute irresponsible State behavior.[151] Such activities would be deemed irresponsible State behavior when conducted by official State agents or entities, as well as by hacking groups affiliated with these entities, operating under their instruction, direction, or control.[152] Although the List of Non-Binding Norms does not refer to economic or national security espionage, bilateral agreements and multinational commitments prohibit the theft of intellectual property (IP), trade secrets, and business information to gain competitive commercial advantages.[153] Such multinational commitments may be an additional source for shaping \"rules of the road\" in the commitments' context.\nThe cases reviewed can be categorized into subcategories representing types of irresponsible State behavior. Each subcategory has the potential to form specific prohibitions on certain types of conduct, akin to rules of the road. Below is a classification of the cases reviewed into four subcategories,\n\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 with one caveat. This is not a one-size-fits-all classification. Some cases can be classified under more than one subcategory (as exemplified below by Case 3).\n(a) Interfering with State democratic processes, primarily elections (Cases 3, 10, 14).\n(b) Endangerment of critical infrastructure and supply chain (Cases 3, 11, 12).\n(c) Interference in inherently governmental functions (Cases 1, 2, 5, 7, 13).\n(d) Theft of IP and commercial secrets (economic espionage) (Cases 4, 6, 8, 9).\nShaping rules of the road, case by case, could be more effective if the collective attributing States use each case as an opportunity to shape the applicable international rules in the given context. However, the United States and the United Kingdom have not yet taken any significant action in this direction. \nIn May 2022, the UK Attorney General addressed collective attribution and the ensuing response to the wrongdoing as important measures in shaping the international order in cyberspace. She emphasized that The law needs to be clear and well understood if it is to be part of a framework for governing international relations and to rein in irresponsible cyber behaviour. Setting out more detail on what constitutes unlawful In articulating this perspective using the norm of non-intervention, she recommends applying it to any State’s cyber activity that undermines another State’s ability to exercise control over matters that it is entitled to decide autonomously through the principle of State sovereignty. For additional clarity, she also suggests defining types of disruptive State cyber activities in various vulnerable sectors, such as energy security, essential medical care, economic stability, and democratic processes. Identifying a type of such cyber activity and examining it in its relevant context would determine whether it disrupts or denies another State’s ability to exercise its sovereign power to freely decide and act. If so, it would constitute a clear violation of the non-intervention norm, rendering it an unlawful activity. Since the UK Attorney General proposed this approach, the United States and the United Kingdom have jointly undertaken only two additional collective attributions (Cases 13, 14). However, instead of attributing unlawful cyber activities to Iran and Russia, the UK Foreign Secretary characterized Iranian actions as “reckless” and “unacceptable”¹⁵⁹ and Russian actions as “completely unacceptable.”¹⁶⁰ This aligns with the established practice of the FVEY, as evidenced in the cases reviewed. Nevertheless, adopting and implementing the British Attorney General’s integrated legal and political approach within the collective attribution strategy could potentially confer a more binding aspect to norms, such as the prohibitions on intervention and use of force, sovereignty of States, due diligence, and the boundaries of permitted espionage. This might create incentives for States, mindful of their reputation as responsible and law-abiding entities, to adhere to these norms as interpreted and applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, enforcing them through collective attribution and responses would be more consistent and coherent, thus, more effective in shaping State practice and international law.\n¹⁵⁸. Id.

Sanctions as a Collective Response Another dimension of the legality of the attributed violation lies in the appropriate response. As mentioned earlier, both the FVEY and the EU confine their responses to retorsions, such as travel bans and asset freezing, undertaken against the entities and persons engaged in conducting the malicious cyber attacks in question. The expectation that a collective attribution would prompt retorsions from a high number of participating States, forming an effective collective deterrent response, has not materialized as of yet.¹⁶¹ Nevertheless, such a response has become a common practice of the United States and to a lesser extent, the EU and the FVEY.\nAt the level of the United States, sanctions are imposed with greater frequency against individuals and entities based on findings and charges detailed in joint advisories or unsealed indictments and law enforcement investigations. Despite the considerable number of sanctioned individuals and entities, many are government personnel and entities associated with the CRINK, and a significant number have also been indicted.¹⁶² While the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish but to bring about a positive change in behavior,¹⁶³ this change has not materialized as of yet. At the level of the FVEY partners, the United Kingdom has regulated its own independent cyber related sanctions regime and occasionally imposed sanctions in coordination with the United States.¹⁶⁴ Australia legislated a cyber sanctions law in December 2021. In January 2024, it implemented it for the first time against a Russian cybercriminal found responsible for the Medibank ¹⁶¹. See discussion supra Section IV(A) (International Cyber Deterrence Initiative).\n¹⁶².

Moreover, the EU's process of imposing sanctions in response to cyber attacks is too slow and less effective; it may extend even beyond a year, as the decision must be unanimous and rely on evidence that can withstand judicial scrutiny. Thus far, the EU has sanctioned, under its cyber-related sanctions framework, only eight individuals and four entities affiliated with the CRINK, encompassing both asset freezes and travel bans. These sanctions were instituted in two phases, in July and October of 2020. As of now, no additional sanctions have been imposed through this channel, and there have been no challenges to review any of these sanctions before the European Court of Justice.¹⁶⁶ Therefore, it seems that the EU cyber-sanction regime may have “already run its course,” as anticipated by some critics.¹⁶⁷ Furthermore, a German research team, which analyzed the EU's collective response in Cases 1–4, questioned the effectiveness of such responses, doubting whether they “really have a deterrent effect on aggressors or are ultimately just symbolic politics.”¹⁶⁸ Despite the above, this article does not purport to reach an unequivocal conclusion, based on sufficient credible information, regarding the effectiveness of the collective attribution and sanctions policy in achieving its primary objectives. These goals include deterring, disrupting, and demonstrating readiness to defend international norms¹⁶⁹ and inducing a change in Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 State behavior to align with norms of responsible State behavior. Ultimately, sanctions are not designed to punish but rather to motivate positive changes in State behavior.¹⁷⁰ Given that the main outlaw States in cyberspace—Russia, Iran, and North Korea—are already subject to extensive multinational sanctions regimes for reasons unrelated to “irresponsible” malicious cyber operations,¹⁷¹ the impact of sanctions imposed as a response to malicious cyber activities is difficult to evaluate decisively. Nevertheless, the increasing frequency and scale of politically motivated cyber operations suggest that the deterring effect of collective attributions, along with retorsions, is weak.¹⁷² Due to the lack of authorized information regarding the outcomes of these sanctions and in the face of persistent politically motivated cyber attacks originating from the same culpable States and orchestrated by their governmental entities, it would not be inaccurate to argue that the effectiveness of this policy has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Meanwhile, it still has a symbolic, declarative impact needed to emphasize the red lines that States should not cross.\nIn conclusion, at present, collective attribution is no more than the upshot of the national attribution process, mostly American and British, with the addition of evidence sharing with like-minded States, in a manner that imposes no burden on the U.S. or UK intelligence community. The United States and the United Kingdom are always the driving force, while a CRINK State almost always stands on the receiving end. States and alliances participating in collective attributions, particularly the EU and FVEY, do not determine whether to join the attribution through direct involvement in investigative and attribution processes, but rather are influenced by political affiliations and international commitments within international frameworks, such as the G7, G20, and U.S.-EU or UK-EU dialogues. As a result, the collectiveness as implemented in the attribution process does not bolster the credibility of the American or British attribution determinations. This could notably change if the number of States committed to joining the attributions significantly increases, not due to political pressure or other political considerations, but rather due to an enhanced, joint, impartial, transparent, professional, and multinational process as the International Cyber Ransomware Initiative has recently demonstrated within its limited ¹⁷⁰.

CONCLUSION\nMore than a decade has passed since Leon Panetta first used the metaphor of the Pearl Harbor attack to depict how serious and risky a cyber attack could be, warning “potential aggressors . . . that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.” $^{174}$ Even graver and more precise warnings have been issued recurringly by U.S. presidents and senior officials in administrations since 2012. $^{175}$ President Biden, who during his first weeks in office had to handle a series of serious ransomware cyber operations originating in Russia that dealt a blow to U.S. public interests, announced: “I made it clear to President Putin . . . that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions—interfering with our elections . . .—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia . . .” $^{176}$ In the same speech, the President emphasized that only nations “working together and in common” can solve “the accelerating global challenges.” He added, “we [the United States] cannot do it alone.” That is easier said than done in the international arena. Despite technological developments that have improved attribution capabilities, the international community has not yet established a binding legal framework for cyberspace. Instead, the United States, along with the United Kingdom, has chosen to build upon a national official attribution system by imposing collective attribution and responses to the wrongdoing, aiming to concurrently achieve two goals: (1) to reinforce State deterrence through public collective attribution and imposing costs; and (2) shaping and internalizing “rules of the road” for responsible State behavior in cyberspace. $^{177}$\n\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 However, this article highlights fundamental flaws that impact the credibility and legitimacy of this attribution process and subsequently its effectiveness. The United States, as the major attributor, assigns responsibility to specific States without allowing transparency regarding the evidence, the criteria of selecting the cases, and maintaining ambiguity about the legal grounds on which their charges rely. Furthermore, since the attribution determination in any given case is not subject to external and objective scrutiny, it is hard to indicate impartiality, legality, coherency, and consistency in the process, which collapses into one measure—attribution, accusation, judging, and punishing by retorsions. This is a far cry from satisfying any\"right\"or\"fair process.\"Thus far, the overwhelming majority of collective attributions have been American-led. The participants are American governmental experts, in cooperation mostly with American tech platforms whose loyalty to American national security interests is not questioned. There is no effort to involve independent, reputable international experts in the process, which is not sufficiently transparent and, on the face of things, may be perceived as one-sided. At most, the American process may constitute an exchange of views and intelligence sharing with counterpart agencies in the FVEY.\nClose and clandestine cooperation—among the FVEY—and sharing information with the EU's relevant institutions, as well as with a few like-minded States, is not enough to replace a proper procedure that would lend credibility and legitimacy to the process and its outcomes. The absence of representative, impartial multinational experts in the process exacerbates the legitimacy gap. This is even more true when the State at the receiving end of the attribution process is always a rival State from the CRINK group. Such dynamics erode the process' legitimacy and may discourage States from embracing its findings and joining the collective attributions, let alone responses. Moreover, it can explain the ineffectiveness of international initiatives, such as the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, and the negligible effectiveness of the collective attributions. This article pointed to one initiative, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which, in my opinion, has the potential to become more effective in countering ransomware and cooperating in law enforcement once the ransomware is detected or when credible intelligence can anticipate the details of the upcom signal to Russia without any reference to specific international rules about the cost Russia might pay if it continues with its destabilizing actions).\n\nThis article presents the considerable cumulative experience gained from destructive and disruptive State or State-sponsored cyber attacks and their accompanying attribution processes. This, coupled with the growing number of States expressing their perspectives in enduring public debates regarding the terms and boundaries for applying major international norms to cyberspace,[179] illustrate the image of a wide-open field that must be fenced in by further development and regulation. In my opinion, there is fertile ground for a justified reevaluation of the collective attribution process and the responses to cyber wrongdoing. This is critical to bolster the credibility, legitimacy, and subsequently the effectiveness of these collective attributions in shaping the rules of road and enhancing State accountability.\n\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 # ANNEX—A DETAILED OVERVIEW OF COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTIONS 2017–2024 A ransomware cyber operation in which hundreds of thousands of computers were hacked and encrypted in over 150 States, causing serious economic damage and disrupting vital public services like healthcare, transportation, banks, etc.\nOn December 19, 2017, the United States and the United Kingdom led the FVEY members to attribute this cyber attack to North Korea, simultaneously and in coordination, constituting the first collective attribution. Shortly after, more than ten like-minded States joined this attribution.\nIn April 2018, the European Council published a statement of support, which included condemnation while avoiding clear identification of the culprit States. This declaration addressed both WannaCry and NotPetya.¹⁸¹ In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted a North Korean hacker associated with Lazarus Group, which works for the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau. The charges were related to his involvement in the Sony Hack (2014) and the WannaCry attack.¹⁸² In February 2021, The U.S. Department of Justice indicted three more North Korean military hackers with the same hacking group (Lazarus) in the Sony Hack and WannaCry.¹⁸³ ¹⁸⁰.

This malware acted as ransomware, causing enormous economic damage amounting to billions of dollars and serious disruptions in important public services. This cyber operation was politely motivated to damage Ukrainian businesses and sow public anger.\nIn February 2018, the FVEY collectively attributed this cyber attack to the GRU. Shortly after, more than fifteen like-minded States officially supported this attribution.¹⁸⁵ The U.S. Department of Justice indicted GRU officers involved in these cyber activities while the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions.\nIn July 2020, the EU approved sanctions against Unit 74455 of the GRU for the NotPetya cyber attack, the Lazarus group for the WannaCry attack, and against Russians and North Koreans who have been indicted in the United States.¹⁸⁶ ## 3. Series of GRU Cyber Attacks (2015–2018)¹⁸⁷ On October 4, 2018, the United States and the United Kingdom attributed to Russia responsibility for a series of politically motivated cyber attacks conducted by the GRU against various targets. These attacks included, among others, the BadRabbit ransomware campaign, a ransomware cyber attack aimed at Ukrainian targets that also spilled over to other European countries; the Democratic National Committee hack during the American elections (2016); the cyber attacks, https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-minister-condemns-russia-for-notpetya-attacks.\n¹⁸⁵.

Germany supported this attribution and added the Bundestag hack as another cyber attack attributed to GRU operatives.\nOn October 4, 2018, the Dutch and UK Prime Ministers made a joint statement attributing to the GRU responsibility for attempting to access the secure computer systems of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague. The statement explicitly connected this GRU cyber operation to other reckless cyber operations revealed on the same day.¹⁸⁸ Also on this day, the EU published a joint statement by the presidents of the Council of Europe and the European Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The statement was limited to the attack on the OPCW, with a general reference to the British accusations about further unacceptable cyber activities.\nThe United States indicted and sanctioned officers of the GRU for being involved in those cyber attacks.¹⁸⁹ In July 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against four GRU officers who attempted a cyber attack against the OPCW. In October 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against the GRU’s Unit 26165 and two GRU officers who participated in the Bundestag Hack in 2015.¹⁹⁰ ¹⁸⁸.

It is highly likely that the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) ran this campaign through a hacker group known as the APT10, which was almost certainly responsible for a campaign of activity against global Managed Service Providers (MSPs) since at least 2016, widely known as Cloud Hopper.\nOn December 20, 2018, the United Kingdom officially attributed responsibility for this campaign to China's MSS. The U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously indicted and imposed personal sanctions on two Chinese hackers allegedly part of APT10 and involved in this cyber campaign.¹⁹² The following day, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada published official attribution statements with similar content. Japan and Germany joined these attribution determinations.¹⁹³ After a four-month delay, the EU published a declaration focusing on APT10 malicious cyber activities, including IP theft, while avoiding explicit attribution to the Chinese Government.¹⁹⁴ ¹⁹¹.

Malicious Cyber Activity—2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games\nOn October 19, 2020, the United Kingdom attributed to Russia (the GRU) the destructive cyber campaign conducted against the 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in South Korea and the cyber reconnaissance that targeted officials and organizations involved in the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo, prior to its postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the United Kingdom officially announced its attribution determination,[201] the U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously unsealed an indictment charging Russians involved in the cyber attacks in 2018.[202] Although the aim was to call out Russia and pressure it to cancel its plans to disrupt the upcoming Olympic Games, the United Kingdom\n\nVol. 103 failed to expand the international support. Interestingly, the targeted States (Japan and South Korea), the other partners in the FVEY, as well as the EU, remained passive, excluding Canada²⁰³ and Poland.²⁰⁴ On April 15, 2021, the United States, joined by the United Kingdom, accused Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) operatives of conducting the SolarWinds cyber espionage operation, gaining access to tens of thousands of entities, including governmental, in the United States and worldwide. The other three State parties of the FVEY joined the collective attribution, whereas the EU statement²⁰⁶ expressed solidarity with the United States concerning the impact of malicious cyber activities, notably the SolarWinds hack, which, “the United States assesses,”²⁰⁷ was conducted by Russia. Similarly, the North Atlantic Council’s statement also expressed solidarity with the United States based on its assessments regarding Russia’s responsibility for the SolarWinds hack and called on Russia to comply with its international obligations.²⁰⁸\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\nIn July 2021, the United States, joined by the FVEY and Japan, attributed malicious cyber activity and irresponsible State behavior to China for stealing IP for commercial advantage and espionage through hackers contracted to the MSS (APT 31, APT 40). The EU statement did not assign direct responsibility to China but emphasized that the malicious cyber activities were undertaken from China's territory, urging it to prevent such activities.²¹⁰ The North Atlantic Council's statement\"acknowledges\"the statements made by the FVEY member States and expresses\"solidarity\"with those who were affected, calling on all States,\"including China,\"to uphold their international commitments.²¹¹ Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 # 11. DDoS Attack Against Ukraine (February 15–16, 2022) A week prior to the Russian invasion, an unprecedented DDoS attack crashed Ukrainian banks and government websites. Although the head of the Cybersecurity Department of Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it was too early to identify specific perpetrators, Ukraine pointed the finger at Russia as the only country interested in destabilizing Ukraine.[213] Forty-eight hours later, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia collectively blamed Russia for conducting the operation through its GRU. This collective attribution is exceptional primarily for one reason: It is the fastest political decision made to date officially attributing State responsibility.\n# 12. Blocking the KA-SAT Network (February 16, 2022) On May 10, 2022, the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre assessed that Russia's GRU was almost certainly responsible for the cyber attack against ViaSat, a multinational communications provider, one hour prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This cyber attack, which is believed to have targeted the KA-SAT network to disrupt or cut off Ukraine's military communication, spilled over to civilian customers in Ukraine and across Europe, making tens of thousands of terminals inoperable in a manner that was irreversible. Based on these findings and new intelligence, the United Kingdom[214] and the United States,[215] joined by their partners in the FVEY[216] and the EU,[217] collectively attributed responsibility\n\nInternational Law Studies\n\nOn September 7, 2022, Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran. The reason for such a serious response was a major cyber-campaign conducted against it nearly two months earlier. This campaign targeted significant Albanian government websites, including websites for providing essential public services and websites of the Albanian Parliament and Prime Minister's office.[218] Consequently, essential websites were shut down, and governmental data, including sensitive emails, were leaked. Although Albania is a NATO member State, it has not applied to activate Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Albania is not a cyber-power State. Therefore, it appealed to the United States, United Kingdom, and other capable States to investigate these cyber attacks and assist in ensuring resiliency. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have attributed State responsibility to Iran, while the EU and NATO have not deviated from their cautious path, avoiding explicit attribution statements.[219] In September 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security and its Minister of Intelligence as engaging in cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies.[220] Collective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 UK politics, seeking to threaten the UK democratic process.²²¹ The National Cyber Security Centre assesses that this group is subordinate to Center 18 in the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). This malicious activity has targeted, among others, UK politicians, UK think tanks, and journalists and has selectively leaked information obtained to undermine trust in the democratic process. Such malicious Russian activity has been conducted in the United Kingdom and other like-minded States at least since 2015. Simultaneously and in coordination, the relevant ministries in each of the other four partners to the FVEY published statements of support. In addition, and also simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against two Russian operatives allegedly subordinate to the FSB Center 18 for targeting current and former U.S. federal employees from 2016 to 2022, and UK government officials, think tank researchers, and journalists in the United Kingdom. The United States and the United Kingdom also imposed personal sanctions on both operatives.²²² The EU High Representative simultaneously published a statement on behalf of the EU, avoiding an explicit reference to Russia and calling States to comply with the norms of due diligence and responsible State behavior.²²³ 343"

INTRODUCTION Twelve years ago, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was the first to warn of the threat of a cyber\"Pearl Harbor\"or a cyber\"9/11\"terrorist attack, as well as of cyber threats that\"could virtually paralyze the nation.\"¹ Ten years later, Costa Rica was the victim of an unprecedented assault when ransomware cyber attacks virtually paralyzed it to the extent that its president had to officially declare a state of emergency. Albania, a NATO member State, severed diplomatic ties with Iran following Iranian cyber attacks that aimed to cripple Albania's online government services and leak sensitive emails and government data.² In an era of global interconnectedness, the risks are borderless, severe global effects are at stake, and even sensitive national security computer control systems can be targeted. Unsurprisingly, these threatening cyber capabilities carry strategic implications for geopolitics, including the\"Great Power Competition.\"³ This rivalry between powers, coupled with deep ideological disparities (democratic versus authoritarian values), has become a major obstacle in ensuring global safety and stability in and through cyberspace. Rather than reaching a universal consensus on binding comprehensive international regulation, the international community, influenced by the conflicting views of competing powers, has made little headway. Consensus has been limited to agreeing in principle that international law, particularly the UN Charter, is applicable to cyberspace and concluding eleven voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace (the\"List of Non-Binding These disparities, coupled with the policy of silence or ambiguity that major power States embrace and implement regarding disputed legal issues, have resulted in a normative ambiguity. This ambiguity provides major powers with enough leeway to strive for “cyberspace superiority”⁵ while ostensibly maintaining their reputation as law-abiding nations. On the other side of the fence, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea (CRINK) have exploited this ambiguity and the technical characteristics of cyberspace for advancing their interests. Under such circumstances, the List of Non-Binding Norms’s effectiveness in changing State behavior and the level of State compliance are low. Moreover, the norms’ effectiveness and State compliance are influenced by the extent to which the norms and the process of application are perceived as legitimate, as well as the degree to which the outcomes align with the expectations derived from these norms and processes.⁶ ⁴.

Doc. A/70/174 (July 22, 2015) (paragraph 13 includes the List of Non-Binding Norms and paragraph 28 offers “non-exhaustive views” on principles of international law such as sovereign equality, due diligence, non-intervention, and the prohibition on the use of force that should apply to cyberspace. Hereinafter the List refers to both paragraphs 13 and 28.).\n⁵.

For a broader discussion on legitimacy, how it is reflected in the weakened normative layer and affects its effectiveness, State compliance, and related processes and outcomes in underregulated cyberspace, see Dan Efrony, *Enhancing Accountability in Cyberspace Through a Three-Tiered International Governance Regime*, 103 INTERNATIONAL LAW STUDIES (forthcoming 2024) (Part II); THOMAS M. FRANCK, *THE POWER OF LEGITIMACY AMONG NATIONS* (1990); Daniel Bodansky, *Legitimacy in International Law and International Relations*, in *INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES ON INTERNATIONAL LAW AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: THE STATE OF THE ART* 321, 321–41 (Jeffrey L. Dunoff &amp; Mark A. Pollack eds., 2013); Timothy Meyer, *How Compliance Understates Effectiveness*, 108 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW UNBOUND 93 (2014).\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 Against the backdrop of this normative ambiguity and inherent legal uncertainty, the process of attributing State responsibility stands as an essential and exclusive measure to hold specific States accountable for violating the norms of the List. To gauge the extent to which the United States has developed its attribution policy in the past decade, it is worth revisiting Secretary Panetta's 2012 remarks.⁷ In response to two consecutive destructive cyber attacks, he hinted at the improving technological capabilities to address the attribution problem by identifying cyber attackers and attributing responsibility.⁸ Therefore, “potential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions that may try to harm America.”⁹ However, it is important to note that neither the United States nor the direct victim States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, officially attributed responsibility for these cyber attacks to Iran, even though its responsibility has been widely accepted.\nIn fact, my previous published research on State practice in cyberspace between 2012 and 2018, co-authored with Yuval Shany, revealed that explicit official attributions were the exception during that period.¹⁰ Nonetheless, the last two attribution determinations addressed in that study indicated a shift from national official attributions toward collective attributions.¹¹ Indeed, the collective activity of nations in attributing responsibility to States for irresponsible behavior in cyberspace and in responding to such behavior has become a vital component of the deterrence pillar within the U.S. National Cyber Strategy. The United Kingdom, the closest ally to the United States, has endorsed this strategy.¹²\nInternational Law Studies\nThis article evaluates whether the collective attribution process and its outcomes can be perceived as legitimate and credible by the international community, including impartial, nonaligned States. Furthermore, it evaluates whether this process has become a crucial component in effectively holding States accountable for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms and in deterring States from such violations. Analyzing these and related issues requires a sound understanding of the official attribution process in practice, focusing on identifying legitimacy and credibility disparities, and researching the collective attributions announced so far. The article is built exclusively upon open-source intelligence.\nThe article continues as follows. Part II describes the official attribution process, differentiating between technological, legal, and political attributions and discussing the reluctance of States to officially attribute re es/deterrence-in-the-cyber-age-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary (presenting the United Kingdom’s deterrence strategy, mirroring the U.S. approach).\nVol. 103 sponsibility. Part III explores major aspects of the American attribution process, the most influential one, excluding the internal division of labor among the U.S. national security and law enforcement entities. It includes five sections that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could affect the extent to which the process's outcomes would be perceived as credible and legitimate. The first is the instrumental ambiguity the United States has embraced in the absence of a binding international convention, which has an adverse effect on transparency and source-based legitimacy. The subsequent three sections—intelligence-based attribution, attribution by indictment, and the private sector's role in ensuring cyber security—are important for mitigating the challenge of transparency but are still insufficient to ensure credibility and legitimacy. The fifth section explores collaboration between the private sector, particularly American corporations, including the most powerful tech platforms globally, and U.S. national security entities responsible for the American attribution process. This all-American collaboration may raise serious concerns among non-American constituencies about the credibility and legitimacy of the U.S. attribution process and its outcomes. Part IV delves into the specific collective attributions starting with three international initiatives. Two of these, initially planned to catalyze and empower collective attributions, have already faded, while the third initiative holds potential as part of a solution. Section IV(B) is a table that succinctly presents fourteen cases of collective attribution, spanning from the first collective attribution on December 19, 2017, until January 1, 2024. A detailed overview of these fourteen cases appears as an annex at the end of this article. Section IV(C) analyzes the findings. Part V concludes.\n\n---\n\n## # V. CONCLUSION\n\nMore than a decade has passed since Leon Panetta first used the metaphor of the Pearl Harbor attack to depict how serious and risky a cyber attack could be, warning “potential aggressors . . . that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.” $^{174}$ Even graver and more precise warnings have been issued recurringly by U.S. presidents and senior officials in administrations since 2012. $^{175}$ President Biden, who during his first weeks in office had to handle a series of serious ransomware cyber operations originating in Russia that dealt a blow to U.S. public interests, announced: “I made it clear to President Putin . . . that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions—interfering with our elections . . .—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia . . .” $^{176}$ In the same speech, the President emphasized that only nations “working together and in common” can solve “the accelerating global challenges.” He added, “we [the United States] cannot do it alone.” That is easier said than done in the international arena. Despite technological developments that have improved attribution capabilities, the international community has not yet established a binding legal framework for cyberspace. Instead, the United States, along with the United Kingdom, has chosen to build upon a national official attribution system by imposing collective attribution and responses to the wrongdoing, aiming to concurrently achieve two goals: (1) to reinforce State deterrence through public collective attribution and imposing costs; and (2) shaping and internalizing “rules of the road” for responsible State behavior in cyberspace. $^{177}$\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 However, this article highlights fundamental flaws that impact the credibility and legitimacy of this attribution process and subsequently its effectiveness. The United States, as the major attributor, assigns responsibility to specific States without allowing transparency regarding the evidence, the criteria of selecting the cases, and maintaining ambiguity about the legal grounds on which their charges rely. Furthermore, since the attribution determination in any given case is not subject to external and objective scrutiny, it is hard to indicate impartiality, legality, coherency, and consistency in the process, which collapses into one measure—attribution, accusation, judging, and punishing by retorsions. This is a far cry from satisfying any\"right\"or\"fair process.\"Thus far, the overwhelming majority of collective attributions have been American-led. The participants are American governmental experts, in cooperation mostly with American tech platforms whose loyalty to American national security interests is not questioned. There is no effort to involve independent, reputable international experts in the process, which is not sufficiently transparent and, on the face of things, may be perceived as one-sided. At most, the American process may constitute an exchange of views and intelligence sharing with counterpart agencies in the FVEY.\nClose and clandestine cooperation—among the FVEY—and sharing information with the EU's relevant institutions, as well as with a few like-minded States, is not enough to replace a proper procedure that would lend credibility and legitimacy to the process and its outcomes. The absence of representative, impartial multinational experts in the process exacerbates the legitimacy gap. This is even more true when the State at the receiving end of the attribution process is always a rival State from the CRINK group. Such dynamics erode the process' legitimacy and may discourage States from embracing its findings and joining the collective attributions, let alone responses. Moreover, it can explain the ineffectiveness of international initiatives, such as the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, and the negligible effectiveness of the collective attributions. This article pointed to one initiative, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which, in my opinion, has the potential to become more effective in countering ransomware and cooperating in law enforcement once the ransomware is detected or when credible intelligence can anticipate the details of the upcom signal to Russia without any reference to specific international rules about the cost Russia might pay if it continues with its destabilizing actions).\nThis article presents the considerable cumulative experience gained from destructive and disruptive State or State-sponsored cyber attacks and their accompanying attribution processes. This, coupled with the growing number of States expressing their perspectives in enduring public debates regarding the terms and boundaries for applying major international norms to cyberspace,[179] illustrate the image of a wide-open field that must be fenced in by further development and regulation. In my opinion, there is fertile ground for a justified reevaluation of the collective attribution process and the responses to cyber wrongdoing. This is critical to bolster the credibility, legitimacy, and subsequently the effectiveness of these collective attributions in shaping the rules of road and enhancing State accountability.\nCollective Attribution in Cyberspace Vol. 103 # ANNEX—A DETAILED OVERVIEW OF COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTIONS 2017–2024 A ransomware cyber operation in which hundreds of thousands of computers were hacked and encrypted in over 150 States, causing serious economic damage and disrupting vital public services like healthcare, transportation, banks, etc.\nOn December 19, 2017, the United States and the United Kingdom led the FVEY members to attribute this cyber attack to North Korea, simultaneously and in coordination, constituting the first collective attribution. Shortly after, more than ten like-minded States joined this attribution.\nIn April 2018, the European Council published a statement of support, which included condemnation while avoiding clear identification of the culprit States. This declaration addressed both WannaCry and NotPetya.¹⁸¹ In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted a North Korean hacker associated with Lazarus Group, which works for the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau. The charges were related to his involvement in the Sony Hack (2014) and the WannaCry attack.¹⁸² In February 2021, The U.S. Department of Justice indicted three more North Korean military hackers with the same hacking group (Lazarus) in the Sony Hack and WannaCry.¹⁸³ ¹⁸⁰.

This malware acted as ransomware, causing enormous economic damage amounting to billions of dollars and serious disruptions in important public services. This cyber operation was politely motivated to damage Ukrainian businesses and sow public anger.\nIn February 2018, the FVEY collectively attributed this cyber attack to the GRU. Shortly after, more than fifteen like-minded States officially supported this attribution.¹⁸⁵ The U.S. Department of Justice indicted GRU officers involved in these cyber activities while the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions.\nIn July 2020, the EU approved sanctions against Unit 74455 of the GRU for the NotPetya cyber attack, the Lazarus group for the WannaCry attack, and against Russians and North Koreans who have been indicted in the United States.¹⁸⁶ ## 3. Series of GRU Cyber Attacks (2015–2018)¹⁸⁷ On October 4, 2018, the United States and the United Kingdom attributed to Russia responsibility for a series of politically motivated cyber attacks conducted by the GRU against various targets. These attacks included, among others, the BadRabbit ransomware campaign (October 2017), a ransomware cyber attack aimed at Ukrainian targets that also spilled over to other European countries; the Democratic National Committee hack during the American elections (2016); the cyber attacks (December 2015 and ¹⁸⁴.

Germany supported this attribution and added the Bundestag hack as another cyber attack attributed to GRU operatives.\nOn October 4, 2018, the Dutch and UK Prime Ministers made a joint statement attributing to the GRU responsibility for attempting to access the secure computer systems of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague. The statement explicitly connected this GRU cyber operation to other reckless cyber operations revealed on the same day.¹⁸⁸ Also on this day, the EU published a joint statement by the presidents of the Council of Europe and the European Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The statement was limited to the attack on the OPCW, with a general reference to the British accusations about further unacceptable cyber activities.\nThe United States indicted and sanctioned officers of the GRU for being involved in those cyber attacks.¹⁸⁹ In July 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against four GRU officers who attempted a cyber attack against the OPCW. In October 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against the GRU’s Unit 26165 and two GRU officers who participated in the Bundestag Hack in 2015.¹⁹⁰ ¹⁸⁸.

The U.S. Department of Justice simultaneously indicted and imposed personal sanctions on two Chinese hackers allegedly part of APT10 and involved in this cyber campaign.¹⁹² The following day, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada published official attribution statements with similar content.

    "Collective Attribution in Cyberspace\n\nVol. 103\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nTwelve years ago, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was the first to warn of the threat of a cyber \"Pearl Harbor\" or a cyber \"9/11\" terrorist attack, as well as of cyber threats that \"could virtually paralyze the nation.\"¹ Ten years later, Costa Rica was the victim of an unprecedented assault when ransomware cyber attacks virtually paralyzed it to the extent that its president had to officially declare a state of emergency. Albania, a NATO member State, severed diplomatic ties with Iran following Iranian cyber attacks that aimed to cripple Albania's online government services and leak sensitive emails and government data.² In an era of global interconnectedness, the risks are borderless, severe global effects are at stake, and even sensitive national security computer control systems can be targeted. Unsurprisingly, these threatening cyber capabilities carry strategic implications for geopolitics, including the \"Great Power Competition.\"³ This rivalry between powers, coupled with deep ideological disparities (democratic versus authoritarian values), has become a major obstacle in ensuring global safety and stability in and through cyberspace. Rather than reaching a universal consensus on binding comprehensive international regulation, the international community, influenced by the conflicting views of competing powers, has made little headway. Consensus has been limited to agreeing in principle that international law, particularly the UN Charter, is applicable to cyberspace and concluding eleven voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace (the \"List of Non-Binding\n\n1.

This ambiguity provides major powers with enough leeway to strive for “cyberspace superiority”⁵ while ostensibly maintaining their reputation as law-abiding nations. On the other side of the fence, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea (CRINK) have exploited this ambiguity and the technical characteristics of cyberspace for advancing their interests. Under such circumstances, the List of Non-Binding Norms’s effectiveness in changing State behavior and the level of State compliance are low. Moreover, the norms’ effectiveness and State compliance are influenced by the extent to which the norms and the process of application are perceived as legitimate, as well as the degree to which the outcomes align with the expectations derived from these norms and processes.⁶\n\n⁴.

    "Collective Attribution in Cyberspace\n\nVol. 103\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this normative ambiguity and inherent legal uncertainty, the process of attributing State responsibility stands as an essential and exclusive measure to hold specific States accountable for violating the norms of the List. To gauge the extent to which the United States has developed its attribution policy in the past decade, it is worth revisiting Secretary Panetta's 2012 remarks.⁷ In response to two consecutive destructive cyber attacks, he hinted at the improving technological capabilities to address the attribution problem by identifying cyber attackers and attributing responsibility.⁸ Therefore, “potential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions that may try to harm America.”⁹ However, it is important to note that neither the United States nor the direct victim States, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, officially attributed responsibility for these cyber attacks to Iran, even though its responsibility has been widely accepted.\n\nIn fact, my previous published research on State practice in cyberspace between 2012 and 2018, co-authored with Yuval Shany, revealed that explicit official attributions were the exception during that period.¹⁰ Nonetheless, the last two attribution determinations addressed in that study indicated a shift from national official attributions toward collective attributions.¹¹\n\nIndeed, the collective activity of nations in attributing responsibility to States for irresponsible behavior in cyberspace and in responding to such behavior has become a vital component of the deterrence pillar within the U.S. National Cyber Strategy. The United Kingdom, the closest ally to the United States, has endorsed this strategy.¹²\n\n7. Panetta, supra note 1.

In this article “cyber attacks,” “cyber operations,” and “cyber activities” are used interchangeably, but the article focuses on politically motivated incidents, that is, cyber attacks conducted by States through their official organs and agents or through third parties as proxies.\n\n9.

For the purposes of this article, “official attribution” refers to any public, verbal or non-verbal, statement made by a senior official of a State authorized to formally attribute responsibility for a given cyber attack to another State. Heads of State, ministries of foreign affairs, and other ministries whose mandate includes cybersecurity naturally hold such authority. As such, official attributions must be both public and political. Therefore, in this research, indictments filed or unsealed by the U.S. Department of Justice, personal sanctions imposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury, advisory alerts issued by the U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, and other reports from national law enforcement agencies, cannot on their own constitute an official attribution of responsibility to a State. However, they can certainly provide grounds for the United States and other States to attribute responsibility officially and explicitly to another State. Subsequently, the term “collective attribution” refers to a State’s official attribution joined by at least one other nation’s official attribution. Alternately, it shall apply if the State’s official attribution announcement is accompanied simultaneously and in coordination with another State officially announcing a response to the same cyber operation through indictments, sanctions, or joint advisories.\n\nThis article evaluates whether the collective attribution process and its outcomes can be perceived as legitimate and credible by the international community, including impartial, nonaligned States. Furthermore, it evaluates whether this process has become a crucial component in effectively holding States accountable for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms and in deterring States from such violations. Analyzing these and related issues requires a sound understanding of the official attribution process in practice, focusing on identifying legitimacy and credibility disparities, and researching the collective attributions announced so far. The article is built exclusively upon open-source intelligence.\n\nThe article continues as follows. Part II describes the official attribution process, differentiating between technological, legal, and political attributions and discussing the reluctance of States to officially attribute re\n\nes/deterrence-in-the-cyber-age-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary (presenting the United Kingdom’s deterrence strategy, mirroring the U.S. approach).\n\n274",

Part III explores major aspects of the American attribution process, the most influential one, excluding the internal division of labor among the U.S. national security and law enforcement entities. It includes five sections that characterize the American attribution process, each of which could affect the extent to which the process's outcomes would be perceived as credible and legitimate. The first is the instrumental ambiguity the United States has embraced in the absence of a binding international convention, which has an adverse effect on transparency and source-based legitimacy. The subsequent three sections—intelligence-based attribution, attribution by indictment, and the private sector's role in ensuring cyber security—are important for mitigating the challenge of transparency but are still insufficient to ensure credibility and legitimacy. The fifth section explores collaboration between the private sector, particularly American corporations, including the most powerful tech platforms globally, and U.S. national security entities responsible for the American attribution process. This all-American collaboration may raise serious concerns among non-American constituencies about the credibility and legitimacy of the U.S. attribution process and its outcomes. Part IV delves into the specific collective attributions starting with three international initiatives. Two of these, initially planned to catalyze and empower collective attributions, have already faded, while the third initiative holds potential as part of a solution. Section IV(B) is a table that succinctly presents fourteen cases of collective attribution, spanning from the first collective attribution on December 19, 2017, until January 1, 2024. A detailed overview of these fourteen cases appears as an annex at the end of this article. Section IV(C) analyzes the findings. Part V concludes.\n\n## II.

Any savvy hacker, let alone a government or State-sponsored one, is capable of manipulatively concealing their identity and astutely misdirecting would-be trackers. Nonetheless, today, the prevalent view has changed; while still challenging and occasionally time-consuming, it has become more feasible to uncover the true facts. Advanced cyber forensic investigative capabilities, which cyber power States and powerful cyber security firms possess, may enable them to unmask authentic technical features of a cyber attack, including the computers involved in the operation and their geographic locations. They may even identify the hacker or group of hackers according to their authentic technological fingerprints, precluding manipulative attempts to deceive and mislead the investigators. Such technical findings may lead to a technical attribution,¹⁵ which mostly lacks credible responses to the following questions: Who, in fact, stands behind the hackers who conducted the given cyber attack? What are the real motives? Was a State involved, and to what extent?¹⁶\n\nCompleting the missing pieces of the puzzle by gathering evidence from all-source intelligence may fill the probability gaps, enabling States to officially attribute responsibility to another State for unlawful cyber operations targeting other States. Nevertheless, this task remains easier said than done, particularly considering the challenges associated with legally attributing State responsibility, which I will address in a subsequent article.\n\n14.

The term “technical attribution” is somehow misleading since technical attribution mostly does not result in clear attribution of responsibility to a State. At most, it is an estimated attribution of responsibility to a group of hackers based on the findings of tactics, techniques, and procedures.

    "Collective Attribution in Cyberspace\n\nVol. 103\n\nEvery victim State thoroughly analyzes the information collected from all sources, including from cyber power State allies and cyber security and tech firms, to conclude whether the information is well-established and sufficient for a definite attribution. Even if the information includes enough evidence for attribution, the victim State's political leadership must weigh a wide range of strategic considerations and then determine whether to officially attribute responsibility; what level of transparency to implement; whether to retaliate, and if so, how, covertly or overtly; and which type of response would be perceived as lawful or legitimate in the given circumstances?\n\nA State might avoid an official attribution to preclude risks and actions that do not coincide with its national security interests, such as jeopardizing intelligence sources, disclosing intelligence gaps that the victim State may have pertaining to its rivals' cyber capabilities, exposing the victim State's confidential cyber capabilities, and averting the significant risk of misattribution, which could lead policymakers to wrongly engage in retribution and escalation.\n\nFurthermore, by refraining from public attribution, the victim State eliminates public pressure for retaliation and may lead the culprit State to believe it has not been detected. This strategy could allow the victim State to covertly monitor the operation and gather valuable intelligence about its rival's cyber capabilities. Additionally, it could facilitate the detection of additional covert operations employing the same cyber techniques while also considering disinformation or deception operations.[17] Moreover, powers that still obscure their political and legal approaches to pending cyber legal questions—such as the boundaries of legitimate \"cyber espionage,\" the clear threshold for constituting a prohibited \"use of force\" and a prohibited intervention, and how \"territorial sovereignty\" should be applied in cyberspace—might hesitate to officially attribute responsibility in specific circumstances. This is because such attribution could reduce the legal ambiguity these States have embraced to preserve their technological edge and maintain strategic leeway.\n\nTherefore, attribution is primarily a political decision relying on prudent and thorough discretion on whether to officially attribute responsibil-\n\n17.

The attribution determination is not necessarily contingent on legal proceedings. $^{18}$  The reasonableness of such an ex ante attribution must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and under no binding requirements of transparency and standard of proof. $^{19}$  Thus, it is no more than a public political denunciation, especially when not accompanied by legal claims and countermeasures. Although the attribution may rely on technical findings and additional evidence from any other source of information, it does not necessarily have to withstand the legal scrutiny that a formal legal attribution of State responsibility might face.\n\nAs noted above, the difficulties of legally attributing State responsibility will be addressed in a subsequent article. For the purposes of the present article, it is worth noting the following: pursuant to the rules of State responsibility, a State harmed by a malicious cyber operation that is willing to officially attribute responsibility to an attacking State and has a legal justification for a lawful response, must meet two cumulative requirements.[20] The first is to indicate a breach of an international rule that binds States under circumstances like those of the cyber incident in question. This might be controversial as long as international cyber law remains in its embryonic stage and the extent and conditions under which customary rules of international law would apply to cyberspace as binding law continue to be open-ended. The second requirement is to identify a perpetrator suspected of breaching the international rule and substantiate their connection—either as an official agent or as a proxy—to a specific State.\n\nThus far, none of the attributing States have faced demands to legally prove their attribution statement within the framework of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Due to cyberspace's unique characteristics and legal ambiguity, the legal demands for substantiating State responsibility in cyberspace are uncertain, making it more difficult to legally attribute such responsibility.[21] While legally attributing State responsibility for international\n\n18.

In this context, Delbert Tran defined the \"attribution problem\" as a complete \"red herring.\"22 In circumstances where a sufficient degree of certainty (rather than absolute certainty) is enough to impose responsibility, and computer scientists have developed a range of tools to trace the culprits, the problem can be solved by \"configuring the law.\"23 Clement Guitton finds the attribution of State responsibility \"a lot more complex and nuanced,\" adding that the lack of binding standards of proof provides the States involved with great flexibility to manipulatively achieve their political aims.24\n\nNevertheless, the following section shows that leading cyber power States are not enthusiastic, to put it mildly, about officially attributing responsibility to other States for violating norms of responsible State behavior. This is despite the fact that official attribution is a political act, ostensibly exempt from meeting legal requirements, such as transparent and admissible evidence. To date, this process has never been applied in court with respect to cyber incidents.\n\n# A. Reluctance of States to Officially Attribute Responsibility\n\nDuring recent decades, States have conducted hundreds or thousands of disruptive and destructive cyber attacks either through their official organs and agents or through proxies. Only in a tiny fraction of cases did States officially attribute responsibility to other States based on technical and all-source intelligence. At times, these official attributions also relied on private sector contributions through confidential or nonconfidential reports of relevant companies. At least until the second half of 2017, victim States would refrain from officially attributing responsibility to another State unless they were amid an armed conflict, during which they often blamed\n\nOF INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION (Cesare P.R.

The United States did so only twice, both in rare circumstances: attribution to North Korea for executing the Sony Pictures hack (December 2014), and attribution to Russia for conducting the Democratic National Committee hack and additional cyber operations meddling in the American election campaign (2016).²⁶ Another well-known damaging cyber attack, the Ababil operation (distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against New York's financial sector in 2011–2013), was investigated and, three years later, resulted in indicting in absentia foreign operatives who were Iranian government agents.²⁷ The detailed indictment, on the face of things, could be sufficient for officially attributing responsibility to the Iranian regime. However, the U.S. Administration declined to follow this path, likely due to political and national security considerations. The United States implemented the same approach and refrained from official attributions on additional occasions when the Department of Justice also indicted Chinese, Russian, and North Korean governmental operatives for breaching U.S. law.²⁸\n\nThe United Kingdom also avoided officially attributing State responsibility until October 2017, when it did so for the first time with respect to the WannaCry cyber attack.²⁹ Interestingly, France continues to embrace a\n\n25.

One possible explanation might have been the relentless Russian attempts to meddle in the tense September 26, 2021, German elections and the urgent need to stop those attempts. The second, and so far, the last, exceptional official attribution reinforced this estimation. On September 5, 2021, Germany officially attributed to Russia responsibility for cyber attacks conducted by a cyber group dubbed Ghostwriter, even though the evidence was not “hard” but “reliable information” that established “suspicions” against the GRU.³⁶ This triggered an official diplomatic protest and an investigation, yet no one waited for its final findings due to the short time left (three weeks) until the elections.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this was the first report of a State officially holding another State accountable for a cyber attack and responding with an official diplomatic protest, relying on information that merely met the level of “suspicions.” Apparently, this sort of cutting corners or lowering the bar of evidence stemmed from the urgent need to stop or deter Russia from interfering with the quickly approaching German elections race.

Except for attribution by indictment, these segments are relevant to the UK attribution process, as well as those of other like-minded cyber power States. Unlike authoritarian regimes, these States have embraced the courses of action described in the following sections to contend with the demand for transparency while striving to achieve the best result for their own national security interests.\n\n# A. An Instrumental Ambiguity\n\nCyberspace's unique technological attributes produce opportunities for cyber power States to surreptitiously generate significant strategic gains through covert cyber operations, thereby minimizing the risk of being held accountable for breaching the law and harming their reputation as law abiding States. On the one hand, States strive to evade legal responsibility by distancing themselves from any factual or legal linkage to the malicious cyber operations in question. On the other hand, national security interests dictate the non-disclosure of classified information for both victim and attacking States. However, such data could help them substantiate arguments to strengthen or dismiss relevant accusations.\n\nAs mentioned above, States, particularly the leading powers involved in the Great Power Competition, have embraced instrumental ambiguity, including maintaining silence on questions related to the interpretation and application of recognized principles and rules of customary international law in cyberspace. The primary motive behind this policy is to retain a sufficient margin of maneuver to enable the protection and promotion of strategic national interests in the rapidly evolving cybersphere. This policy of ambiguity inherently leads to accountability gaps that the most influential cyber power States, like the United States, are reluctant to resolve. Nevertheless, it is crucial for these States to play a decisive role in shaping international cyber law in a manner and at a time that aligns best with their national security interests. Unsurprisingly, they seek to avoid situations requiring an independent, international, judicial forum, such as the International Court of Justice, to resolve legal ambiguities surrounding State conduct in cyberspace.\n\nNotwithstanding the growing number of States that have clarified, albeit partially and cautiously, their views about a limited number of legal questions, the policy of ambiguity still prevails. The policy influences policymakers when considering whether to officially attribute responsibility and",
    "Collective Attribution in Cyberspace\n\nVol. 103\n\nwhen considering how transparent to be regarding relevant evidence and legal arguments.³⁹\n\nOfficial attribution regarding cyber incidents in itself does not eliminate the need for transparency. This requirement is inherent in the legal obligation to substantiate State responsibility in both non-cyber and cyber incidents.⁴⁰ Transparency is essential to legitimize the official attribution by reflecting its “right process” through its process-based and outcome-based legitimacy.⁴¹ In the absence of accessible international judicial or quasi-judicial forums, as well as an impartial international monitoring institution, conflicting States might seek to influence the final “judgment” of the “international court of legitimacy.” This type of influence often involves legitimizing one side while delegitimizing the other. To achieve this, States should enhance transparency regarding their findings and, more importantly, with respect to processes and procedures undertaken. This includes ensuring that they align with Thomas Franck’s concept of the “right process.”⁴² The degree to which this transparency is genuine and comprehensive serves to strengthen their arguments in attributing responsibility or denying it, respectively.\n\nRelying solely on the investigative role of the United States or the United Kingdom, coupled with limited transparency and unwillingness to disclose persuasive evidence, opens the door to plausible deniability. Excluding independent, objective, and multinational experts, as well as representatives from other States, from participating in the attribution process also provides grounds for criticizing the integrity of the process. The absence of these persons may raise concerns about the process being flawed, unfounded, politically biased, and non-transparent, thus, not credible or legit-\n\n³⁹.

These concerns are particularly significant given the common reality of blanket denials by accused States.\n\nShould a State that officially attributes State responsibility for wrongful acts in cyberspace evade disclosure of the evidence and confidential information upon which the attribution and, if undertaken, retribution rely?\n\nThe first to address this question, in November 2016, was Brian Egan, U.S. State Department Legal Advisor, who noted that States are not required to act with full transparency when attributing responsibility to another State.43 Since then, a growing number of States have embraced a legal stance that denies the obligation to reveal classified evidence prior to attribution or countermeasures, making the extent of disclosure a matter of policy that often involves complex considerations.44 Striking a balance between accountability, diplomatic relations, and, most importantly, national security, including the strategic interest of maintaining instrumental ambiguity, remains a significant challenge in the evolving landscape of cyberspace governance. Yet simply prioritizing national security interests to the extent of excluding transparency may erode trust in the attribution statement. Nevertheless, powers like the United States and the United Kingdom, which possess advanced cyber capabilities and robust intelligence, do not hesitate to base their attribution claims solely on their intelligence assessment system, thereby preserving confidentiality and national security interests.\n\n## B. Intelligence-Based Attribution\n\nThe term \"intelligence assessment\" usually does not imply absolute certainty nor admissibility in court but rather the degree of certainty and credibility with which a certain factual narrative should be perceived, using the qualifiers of the national intelligence community about high, moderate, or low likelihood/certainty of the narrative as described in the attribution statement.45 The degree of certainty obviously depends on the level of trust in the information collected and the extent to which it is considered reliable and credible. The more reliable and credible, the higher the degree of cer\n\n43.

By endorsing this practice, both States have averted compromising sensitive intelligence to justify their official attribution and retorsion, which is a response within the prerogative of any State. Even if the attribution of State responsibility proves to be mistaken, the response undertaken remains lawful, albeit unfriendly, and is often reciprocally retaliated. Nevertheless, covert cyber operations remain a viable response, either alongside or instead of retorsions. However, if exposed, their legality would inevitably be challenged.\n\nCritics of intelligence assessment as major grounds for attribution argue that it relies on criteria that \"may at best amount to circumstantial evidence,\" far below the evidentiary standards used in courts.[46] This allows States to manipulate cases to fit preconceived narratives and embody political agendas; it may lead to misleading results involving the misinterpretation of information influenced by what later turns out to be a false conception.[47]\n\nNone of the official American attributions since 2014, nor any of the collective attributions that the United States and the United Kingdom have announced since 2017, have corroborated this criticism. Both States have officially attributed responsibility relying on their intelligence and a high degree of certainty (\"almost certainly\"). Some of these attributions have also referred to open-source investigative reports and technological findings of tech and cyber security companies, mostly American, as discussed below. Others were also followed, months or even years later, by detailed American indictments delivering the message that they rely on sufficient and admissible evidence. However, only a limited number of States have been sufficiently convinced or politically motivated to officially adopt and join these attribution statements. Even these States did not do so because they truly participated in the attribution process itself or obtained access to\n\n46. GUITTON, supra note 13, at 98–99.\n47. Id.\n\n287",
    "International Law Studies\n\n2024\n\nhighly classified and credible intelligence materials supporting the intelligence assessment. The “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance (“FVEY”)—United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—is exceptional. However, the United States shares its classified intelligence with its partners in this alliance and occasionally extends this practice to additional allied States such as France, Germany, and Japan.\n\nNevertheless, the investigation team determining the attribution remains exclusively American. The limited number of participating States might also indicate that those States, which the United States and the United Kingdom interchangeably have not allowed to participate in the process or share classified information, are hesitant to blindly trust American or British intelligence assessments. Considering that the United States is the driving force behind these attributions and that its rivals, such as the CRINK States, are consistently on the receiving end underscores the importance of challenging the credibility of the process and its outcomes.\n\nConcurrently with intelligence-based attribution, the United States has endorsed, on its own, another method to mitigate the demand for transparency. This is attribution by indictment (\"naming and shaming\"). The next section will demonstrate that, despite its relative transparency, attribution by indictment has not proven a benchmark for credibility and trust.\n\n## C. Attribution by Indictment\n\nUntil now, the United States stands as the first and only State to “name and shame” by indicting, in absentia, foreign State-sponsored hackers, mostly citizens of the CRINK. They have been accused of breaching the U.S. Code by committing cybercrimes against Americans and U.S. entities. These indictments provide an opportunity to describe their worldwide malicious cyber activity. They include declassified information about unlawful cyber activities, shedding light on relevant State responsibility. This responsibility stems from the fact that, while committing the unlawful activities, the defendants were either State agents (such as soldiers, officers, or other government officials) or third parties under the State’s control, direction, instruction, or empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of governmental authority.⁴⁸\n\nHowever, indicting unlawful combatants, such as spies captured during peacetime or armed conflict while conducting their mission in the territory\n\n⁴⁸.

In Barr’s words, such cases “cannot be countenanced.”⁵³ In fact, such cases have led to the submission of indictments in deviation from the customary principles of international law and the recognized principle of criminal responsibility. One scholar labeled this a “judicialized attribution,” a new tool to convey more concrete and less political attribution focusing on the evidence and lawfulness of the behavior according to domestic law rather than international law.⁵⁴ This is despite the fact that both the superiors and subordinates who followed their orders purportedly committed the attributed crimes remotely from\n\n49.

While both superiors and subordinates are official agents of rival States and out of reach for American law enforcement authorities, indicting only the subordinates in absentia is legally contested. Unsurprisingly, such a practice has not been adopted by other States.\n\nFurthermore, invoking this policy of indictments requires proceeding in front of a federal grand jury to investigate and decide whether and on what charges to indict. This process is expected to be unbiased, reinforcing the indictment's credibility. However, the jury operates behind closed doors, hearing the federal prosecutor and live testimonies of relevant witnesses, mostly federal investigators, and American cyber security and technology experts. In fact, the process is controlled and guided by the federal prosecutor of the case rather than a judge. Moreover, the indictments may also rely on evidence from American tech and cybersecurity companies, which, as explored below, closely collaborate with local governmental authorities. The national loyalty of these companies is often taken for granted.55 While this perception may not be entirely accurate, it is sufficient to undermine the trust in the impartiality and credibility of the American attribution process by significant portions of the international community, particularly populations and governments in the Global South.\n\nMoreover, Article 28(f) of the 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report approved by the UN General Assembly asserts that \"the accusation of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against states should be substantiated.\"56 The question of whether the American and British practice in this regard meets this requirement is still contested. As mentioned above, a growing number of States have publicly endorsed the view that States attributing responsibility do not need to disclose classified evidence.

Russia consistently demands that attributing States substantiate their accusations by revealing evidence, particularly forensic or technical evidence.57 China, which always criticizes the U.S. tendency to function as the \"global sheriff,\" has recently responded by employing the same attribution approach, directing accusations toward the United States for cyber attacks allegedly conducted against Chinese entities.58\n\nInterestingly, the Obama Administration, striving to avoid escalation and miscalculation, refrained from officially attributing explicit responsibility to States for specific cyber attacks and preferred to do so indirectly by unsealing an indictment against Iranians three years later.59 A shift has been noted since 2018 when indictments started to complement the administration's official attribution statements. However, the policy in this regard remains inconsistent. Not every official attribution is accompanied by indictment, and conversely, not every indictment is accompanied by an official attribution.\n\n57.

Thus, when indictments accompany official attributions, they are expected to bolster the attributions' \"overall credibility.\"60 The target audiences for the indictments are particularly like-minded and neutral governments that are expected to be aware of the credibility of the American criminal proceedings. Consequently, they are likely to perceive this implicit attribution of responsibility through such indictments as credible enough to draw lessons. Subsequently, they may consider whether and to what extent these lessons should affect their own policy, particularly regarding the \"irresponsible behavior\" of a State and its respective risks in cyberspace.\n\nThus far, the United States has not succeeded in prompting even a single State, not even its closest ally, the United Kingdom, to follow it in implementing this \"naming and shaming\" strategy. Unsurprisingly, this American strategy has not deterred the CRINK States. As the FBI's Deputy Director put it when announcing another indictment: \"Time and again, Russia has made it clear: They will not abide by accepted norms, and instead, they intend to continue their destructive, destabilizing cyber behavior.\"61 Additionally, U.S. federal indictments, even when accompanied by collective attributions, have not significantly increased the number of States joining the collective attribution.62 This, coupled with the growing number of CRINK-sponsored cyber attacks, raises significant doubts about the extent to which this strategy is indeed effective. The responses to these doubts vary widely.

On the one hand, it purportedly maintains credible evidence and a reasonable degree of transparency through detailed charges sufficient for imposing ex parte administrative personal sanctions against unreachable foreign defendants. On the other hand, none of these defendants are likely to extradite themselves to challenge the legal and administrative proceedings, including the credibility of the evidence.

Nevertheless, the experience of recent years has not indicated any remarkable success in accomplishing all these objectives, at least not enhancing the credibility of the attributions through such indirect measures, nor significantly increasing the number of States joining the collective attributions\n\n⁶⁴.

However, neither provides transparent evidence that could withstand external and impartial scrutiny, subsequently substantiating the attribution determinations and ensuring their credibility.\n\nThe next section delves into the significant role played by the private sector, particularly in the United States, illustrating how private sector collaboration with the U.S. Government may enhance the level of transparency in determining and announcing official attributions. However, concurrently, it may raise concerns about the legitimacy and credibility of such attributions.\n\n## D. The Role of the Private Sector\n\nThe private sector, through its major tech and cyber security firms, plays a key role in the attribution process, as it possesses significant tech capabilities for detecting and investigating cyber incidents. Western companies, mostly American, such as Meta (Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram), Microsoft (Windows, Azure), Amazon (Amazon Web Services), Alphabet (Google, YouTube), X (previously Twitter), Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Verizon, dominate cyberspace in both software and hardware, encompassing global social media, big data, cloud services, artificial intelligence, computer operating systems, and search engines. Each of these realms is a playground where any vulnerability exposed by third parties could be exploited, posing serious threats to the company's reputation and business success. Thus, these companies invest vast resources to consistently lead in technology, developing cutting-edge capabilities to detect, investigate, and thwart any threat, regardless of its motives through in-house cyber threat intelligence teams. Moreover, global tech platforms, in particular, have achieved worldwide dominance and maintain a formidable presence in cyberspace, a level of control that State cyber powers, including a cyber superpower like the United States, struggle to maintain.⁶⁷ Additional-\n\n⁶⁶.

Unless biased (as discussed in the following section), they tend to classify the hostile cyber operation as sophisticated, suggesting potential execution by either an anonymous cyber power State or hackers sponsored by such a State.72 Technical attributions are usually faster, more detailed, and more transparent than official attributions, which are, to a greater extent restricted by confidentiality and related considerations of national security. This course of action characterizes private sector companies and has a double motivation, rooted both in business interests (business-based) and adherence to norms (norms-based). Naturally, the firms that are driven by business motives are interested in branding themselves—domestically and internationally—as the leading and most reliable professional actors in their fields, ahead of any existing or potential competitor. Such branding should go hand in hand with positioning the firms as prioritizing and aligning with values of universal human rights and other major norms included in the List of Non-Binding Norms, which reflect responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace. In this context, national and international responsibility to secure human life and well-being in an unregulated and risky cyberspace, at least by sharing relevant information with the public, has become a matter of utmost importance.\n\nPrivate sector firms that investigate and expose malicious cyber tools and methodologies used in specific cyber attacks publish their findings to\n\n71.

More importantly, this helps enhance their cyber security capabilities and their preparedness to detect and thwart such threats. At the same time, such information may raise suspicions that a specific cyber attack is, in fact, an act of State or a State-sponsored operation. Occasionally, a private sector technological investigation may lead to complete attribution, including identification of the culprit State or its official organ.73 This occurs despite the general business orientation to avoid involvement in inter-State conflicts. Such attribution is a proper alternative to the official attribution that the victim State may avoid due to its strategic and national security considerations, as noted above. In such circumstances, the company's explicit technological attribution may influence international public opinion, delegitimizing the suspected State in the eyes of other States. Furthermore, any State could become a victim of similar unacceptable behavior at any time, and each may use such attributions to politically attribute responsibility to the suspected State.\n\nThe following section addresses the collaboration U.S. national security agencies maintain with relevant American private sector companies, including in the context of the attribution process. Naturally, this partnership is not completely transparent, nor is it exclusive to the United States. It also encompasses attribution determinations, raising doubts about the extent to which these determinations should be perceived as credible and legitimate through the lens of neutral observers.\n\n## E. Private Sector Collaboration with Governments\n\nA voluntary contribution by private sector companies to national efforts to defend the country from external threats is common, self-evident, and not limited to wartime. Thus, authorities of States cooperate and maintain close and confidential ties with leading domestic entities in the private sector in every relevant field, including health, transportation, tech-industry, telecommunications, and cybersecurity. Liberal democracies, as opposed to authoritarian regimes, maintain such cooperation within the boundaries of law.

As a corollary, the private sector companies, including foreign multinational platform companies operating under such regimes, must comply with their orders and restrictive regulations. Otherwise, the companies might pay excessive prices, which could include restricting, and even terminating, voluntarily or nonvoluntarily, their operations in the countries concerned.75\n\nDue to the Great Power Competition and the intensifying tension, particularly in cyberspace, the U.S. Administration has preemptively imposed a Federal ban on procuring software and services from certain Chinese and Russian tech and software companies that may secretly serve as long arms for both competitor powers in the sensitive fields of cyberspace and telecommunications.

However, in the absence of an independent international mechanism of accountability, the American attribution process, including the said collaboration, should withstand the scrutiny of its primary target constituency—the international community or international public opinion. Naturally, national security aspects of this collaboration remain confidential, though not always entirely so. Similarly, transparency may partially manifest itself in three dimensions: unexpected and undesired transparency—by leakers and whistleblowers; forced and balanced transparency—exclusively by virtue of judicial warrants that balance between conflicted interests, usually national security on one side and human rights on the other; and coordinated transparency—at the initiative of federal authorities in concert with the respective tech platforms.\n\n⁸³.

Have such American corporations ever wittingly and publicly exposed an American clandestine illegitimate cyber operation and dismantled it?87 Furthermore, how plausible is it that American tech platforms such as Meta, Microsoft, or Google would maintain confidential professional ties with States and secretly provide them with services that could be used for defensive and offensive cyber operations while keeping the pertinent American authorities out of the loop and in the dark?\n\nBrad Smith opines that the global tech and cyber security sector \"need[s] to become a trusted and neutral Digital Switzerland,\"88 and the\n\n85.

Conversely, if the companies are not willing to do something for any government, they will also not do it for the U.S.90\n\nHowever, she finds that despite all their efforts to appear neutral, “the companies have not yet achieved—and quite likely will never succeed in achieving—perfect neutrality. They are still strongly associated with the U.S., where they remain domiciled and maintain their headquarters.”91 Additionally, they cannot ignore that the U.S. Government is their most significant customer, and just as importantly, the U.S. Government possesses the power to adversely affect their business operations through new domestic legislation that subsequently may also impact their global operations.\n\nNonetheless, scholars have indicated a shift in the way the major U.S. global tech companies treat U.S. Government requests for collaboration.92 This shift stemmed from the urgent need to salvage the reputations of companies in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures, and it refers primarily to governmental requests that collide with constitutional rights like freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Accordingly, the companies have begun implementing a policy of publicly rejecting and litigating against such governmental demands.

COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION\n\nIn 2017, in the wake of two developments—the collapse of the fifth round of the UN–GGE and large-scale cyber attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya—the United States and the United Kingdom extended the policy of official attribution to a new pattern of collective attribution aimed at deterring States from violating norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. As the table below shows, all the reviewed collective attributions, except one, relied on the national attribution processes of the United States and the United Kingdom regarding cyber attacks that targeted them or their allies. Prior to discussing the cumulative experience of the collective attribution concept per se, and to illustrate the complete picture in this context, the first section of this Part reviews three international initiatives that the United States introduced to deter States and advance responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace in conjunction with holding States accountable by relying on the concept of collective attribution.\n\n## A. Collective Attribution Within International Initiatives\n\nDespite the legal obstacles and instrumental ambiguity noted above, the List of Non-Binding Norms remains the main international instrument to hold States accountable for wrongdoing that violates the voluntary norms of responsible peacetime State behavior in cyberspace.

In fact, the United States never officially launched the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, and senior U.S. officials have rarely referred to it.¹¹²\n\nThe literature includes only one study that references the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative, focusing solely on the collective response rather than the credible collective attribution that is implicitly a prerequisite to any collective response.¹¹³ Within this study, the scholar examined the policy embraced by each State party in the FVEY in building offensive cyber capabilities. The findings reveal that the FVEY States, excluding New Zealand, align with the approach of responding firmly to irresponsible State behavior in cyberspace. Additionally, those States have developed the offensive cyber capabilities needed, among others, to uphold such a policy. The scholar concludes by suggesting that the FVEY and other like-minded allies enhance the credibility of their deterrent collective response\n\n¹⁰⁹. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12.\n\n¹¹⁰.

Nevertheless, for a collective response, the attribution must be credible, and this credibility cannot be taken for granted. Admittedly, the findings of this article bolster the conclusion that the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative never materialized as an active initiative for collectively imposing costs on States violating the List of Non-Binding Norms.\n\nIn September 2019, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands co-sponsored a new international initiative and, together with twenty-five other States, issued a Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace.[114] This statement includes a commitment to hold States accountable, that is, to collectively attribute State responsibility for violating the List of Non-Binding Norms. It also calls on States to transparently impose costs under international law. The Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has only been invoked once since 2019. On February 21, 2020, fifteen out of the twenty-eight Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace partner States teamed up with Georgia and attributed responsibility to Russia for a disruptive cyber campaign conducted by the GRU. They politically denounced Russia and demanded it comply with the List of Non-Binding Norms.[115]\n\nTwo months later, on April 16, 2020, the Czech Republic's National Cyber and Information Security Agency warned of a real threat of serious cyber attacks against its healthcare sector amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The day after, the U.S. Secretary of State released a statement in which he mentioned the Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace framework and warned against conducting such dangerous cyber attacks or knowingly allowing them: \"Anyone that engages in such an action should expect consequences.\"[116] Eventually, the threat was not real\n\n114.

Moreover, neither the Czech nor the American authorities were transparent enough to convince observers that this was not a shot in the dark, but rather a successful preventive response to a credible and imminent threat.\n\nAs indicated above, neither the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative nor the Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace has gained political significance. Unsurprisingly, the anticipation that States beyond the closest allies of the United States would align with American or British attribution statements and impose various costs—political, economic, and otherwise—proved unfounded. It appears that the United States has relinquished both initiatives and, together with its partners in the FVEY, has remained focused on the collective attribution endeavor, as detailed in the following section.\n\nHowever, beyond the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, in October 2021 the United States established an international initiative to counter the threat of ransomware cyber operations, which the Biden Administration has recently defined as a threat to U.S. national security.¹¹⁸ Although this International Counter Ransomware Initiative¹¹⁹ deals exclusively with criminally motivated ransomware cyber operations, it remains relevant in the context of the present discussion of collective attribution by States. This is because its primary goal is to uphold multinational cooperation to counteract ransomware threats and bolster both resiliency and deterrence. To achieve this, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative strengthens cooperation by facilitating the sharing of information and professional expertise among the participating States and private sector companies. More crucially for the focus of this article is its collaborative effort to detect and identify hackers or hacker groups involved in ransomware attacks, whether independently\n\n¹¹⁷.

Similarly, the Initiative has not yet led to the attribution of responsibility to States that tolerate recurring cyber attacks initiated from their sovereign territories.\n\nRussia has already demonstrated that Russian ransomware gangs, such as REvil, may thrive or decline depending on the regime's willingness to cooperate.[121] Ultimately, increasing collaboration among the International Counter Ransomware Initiative States may encompass holding States accountable for ransomware cyber operations, even when initiated and directed from their sovereign territory, violating the due diligence principle. Apart from addressing the legal complexities associated with such accusations, the Initiative's parties may also seek to attribute responsibility and hold States accountable for what they have already defined as prohibited \"irresponsible behaviors.\"\n\nNonetheless, when upheld by a common multinational investigative team, the resulting attribution is collective and certainly more legitimate and credible.

This criminal hacking group is recognized as the world's most harmful cybercrime group. The outcomes of this operation included the seizure in three countries of LockBit's data exfiltration infrastructure by members of the task force. Two LockBit operatives were arrested in coordination with Europol. The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against two Russian citizens for conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks. The Department of Justice also announced that two defendants responsible for using LockBit to execute ransomware attacks were in custody and would face trial in the United States. The lessons learned from this experience could prove valuable for the United States and the United Kingdom in addressing the pitfalls of the current collective attribution process and response. This could serve as a test case demonstrating how successful cooperation between International Counter Ransomware Initiative member States can be in fighting criminally motivated, as well as politically motivated, cybercrime. Thus, the Initiative, in particular, may serve as an appropriate pilot for exploring optional solutions to better tackle the challenges associated with collective attributions and responses. More importantly, such solutions would enhance State accountability and the effectiveness of attributions in changing State behavior in cyberspace.\n\n## B.

In addition, information about cyber attacks was gathered from other sources, and a comparison was conducted against results from other sources.¹²⁵ Finally, the results, as reflected in the table above, do not purport to be exhaustive. Nevertheless, in a cautious estimate, analogous to the wording of the attributions' intelligence assessment, it can be stated that almost all the collective attributions, as defined at the outset of this article, are highly likely to be included in the table, and all the most prominent attributions are almost certainly included.¹²⁶\n\n## C. Analysis: Remarks and Insights\n\n### 1. Remarks on the Process in Practice\n\n#### i. Five Eyes' Key Role\n\nDespite being an intelligence alliance, the FVEY partners are not obligated to full transparency between their intelligence agencies. However, they do share intelligence at a level of confidentiality not extended to other allies. This alliance is the core of the collective attribution strategy, while the United States and the United Kingdom are its driving forces. They cooperate in investigating wide-scale cyber attacks by exchanging confidential information and mobilizing, separately or in conjunction, to assist victim\n\n¹²⁵.

One indication reinforcing this assessment is taken from the recent Canadian attribution statement. Press Release, Glob.

The FVEY's attribution announcements are made concurrently and in coordination.¹²⁸ However, they rely on sharing classified information, not on the findings of an independent FVEY multinational investigative team or any other form of international investigative mechanism. Like the decision to officially attribute State responsibility itself, endorsing an official attribution made by another State is a political prerogative for each sovereign State, which may announce it as its own official attribution. Such attribution determinations rely on various cumulative considerations, including the accuracy and credibility of evidence shared with all partners. While Canada has, thus far, actively participated in all collective attributions initiated by the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia refrained in three instances (Cases 6, 7, 13) and New Zealand in four (Cases 6, 7, 11, 13). Neither New Zealand nor Australia publicly justified their decision to refrain in each of these instances.\n\n## ii. EU and NATO Attributions or Partial Attribution Statements\n\nThe EU, representing twenty-seven European States, has had a notable practice of declarations in support of collective attributions. Thus far, it participated in eleven out of fourteen collective attributions, while NATO participated in six out of these same eleven attributions. However, the attribution statements on behalf of the EU and NATO could hardly be considered fully attributive. Instead, they may be perceived as a partial attribution of responsibility, making a limited contribution to the collective attribution strategy.\n\n¹²⁷. See, e.g., Cases 5, 13, supra Section IV(B) (providing examples in which the United Kingdom assisted the Georgian authorities in contending with and investigating the malicious cyber campaign); see Press Release, U.S. Embassy Tirana, Committed Partners in Cyberspace: U.S. Concludes First Defensive Hunt Operation in Albania (Mar. 23, 2023), https://al.usembassy.gov/committed-partners-in-cyberspace-u-s-concludes-first-defensive-hunt-operation-in-albania/.\n\n¹²⁸. At times, the dates on statements from Australia and New Zealand may not match those of other FVEY partners. However, the announcements are most likely published simultaneously with those of the FVEY partners, and at times the incompatibility of dates may be due to the different time zones.",
    "International Law Studies\n\n2024\n\nThe following are some probable causes driving this partial level of EU and NATO participation in collective attributions:\n\n(a) The EU and NATO do not possess independent cyber investigative capabilities. Both rely heavily on more capable allies, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, EU and NATO member States, like Sweden, the Netherlands, Estonia, Austria, France, and Germany, each of which possess independent investigative capabilities, allegedly provide the EU security authorities with “deficient and incomplete” evidence in order to preserve the confidentiality of their cyber capabilities.¹²⁹ To date, the EU has joined an official attribution initiated by one of its members only once (Case 10), and the attribution is highly questionable. NATO has never joined an attribution that was not initiated by the United States or the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that both States also face challenges in implementing a high degree of transparency with the EU security authorities due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of their intelligence sources. Nevertheless, the direct involvement of the United States and the United Kingdom in investigating cyber attacks appears to be a differentiating factor, possibly explaining why both, along with Canada and New Zealand, refrained from participating in the EU and Germany collective attribution (Case 10), while Australia settled for expressing solidarity.¹³⁰\n\n(b) The EU and NATO have joined collective attributions through brief declarations or statements issued on behalf of both Councils. The wording of these official declarations or statements must be cautious and measured to achieve unanimity within a truly brief period. Typically, they condemn the cyber attack in question, express concerns about it, and show solidarity with the affected States. The EU and NATO choose to avoid any explicit attribution of responsibility to the CRINK States. At the same time, the United States and the United Kingdom explicitly attribute responsibility primarily to specific official agents or organs of any State within the\n\n¹²⁹.

Such statements may be more blatant and explicit than the EU's soft and general statements. An increased frequency of explicit independent statements, especially from cyber power States, aligning around the same conclusion in a specific cyber incident might impact the perceived legitimacy and credibility of the attribution determination in question. Nevertheless, such alignment is infrequent, contingent on the political cost-benefit calculation of each EU member State when deciding whether to act directly with full political responsibility through an official and independent statement.[135]\n\n# iii. Incoherency and Lack of Standardization\n\nThe collective FVEY attributions reviewed indicated incoherency, a lack of standardization, and an absence of transparent criteria, primarily in selecting which cyber operations the United States or the United Kingdom would lead the FVEY to collectively attribute. Likewise, there is uncertainty about the criteria guiding the EU and NATO in determining which attributions to publicly support, all while navigating possible political storms.[136] Questions persist regarding the degree of certainty justifying an attribution in the first place and how to measure that degree.[137] Further considerations involve the timing and format of coordinated announcements, whether through verbal statements by senior government officials (such as heads of states, relevant ministers, and senior officials from the U.S. National Security Council and their counterparts in other States), or by written statements of an authorized governmental agency or ministry, or both in concert.\n\n134.

    "Collective Attribution in Cyberspace\n\nVol. 103\n\nThe United States has been inconsistent in the way it has chosen to express its official attribution and synchronize it with its partners in the FVEY. At times, it settles for filing or unsealing indictments in absentia (e.g., Cases 4, 7) or for joining advisories (e.g., Case 6). Occasionally, the U.S. action of indicting and/or joining an advisory is in addition to an explicit official political announcement (e.g., Case 9). Conversely, the other \"Four Eyes\" always officially attribute responsibility through official announcements of senior officials, mostly by written statements of the relevant ministers.\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of Case 10 as a collective attribution in the table is highly questionable. This marks the inaugural and sole instance where the EU independently initiated, on behalf of its member States, a statement, purported to collectively attribute responsibility.[138] It was primarily in response to Germany's official attribution and ostensibly at its request.[139] Ultimately, the declaration was more of an urgent general warning to Russia against interfering in European national democratic processes rather than a distinct attribution of responsibility for enduring wrongdoings.[140] However, to enable consensus among the twenty-seven EU member States, the statement's wording was softened and generalized, using \"some\" member States, instead of specifying the States, and \"associating\" the wrongdoing with them, instead of clearly \"attributing\" it to Russia.[141] Unsurprisingly, this declaration did not spur additional States to participate in this collective \"attribution,\" except Australia, which expressed its solidarity.[142] By stark contrast, the EU declaration in Case 14, which addresses the same threat of Russian interference in foreign States' democratic pro\n\n138.

Doubtful Credibility\n\nThere are only a small number of official attributions and an even smaller number of collective attributions that do not rely primarily on the American attribution process. The credibility and legitimacy deficiencies of the American attribution process, as highlighted in the previous Part—such as ambiguous normativity, limited transparency, and reliance on potentially biased American investigative teams instead of impartial multinational teams—persist unresolved in collective attributions. These issues may deter States from participating in explicit attributions as opposed to partial attributions. The cases reviewed indicate that States' willingness to participate in collective attributions based on the outcome of another State's national attribution process is limited, even if this system belongs to a cyber power State such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Consequently, the deterrence and effectiveness of such attributions also remain low.¹⁴⁴\n\nCase 11 requires a closer look as it raises serious doubts about the credibility of both the American and British attribution processes, and whether their outcomes are credible and persuasive enough to encourage a growing number of States to participate in such collective attributions. In this case, the Ukrainian Government suspected Russia just because it was then the only State interested in destabilizing Ukraine.¹⁴⁵ Just forty-eight hours later, the United States and the United Kingdom provided the fastest attribution determination each of these allies had ever announced. It relied primarily on some technical information \"almost certainly\" linking the GRU to this cyber attack.¹⁴⁶ Anne Neuberger, the White House's Deputy National Secu\n\n¹⁴³.

While the swift collective attribution may be linked to the looming possibility of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine set to commence in a few days, it does not necessarily justify what might be perceived by any impartial observer as taking shortcuts in the attribution process. This certainly does not enhance trust in the process; on the contrary, it raises concerns.\n\nThe absence of transparent standardization and criteria is crucial to maintain flexibility in reconciling two conflicting characteristics.

Shaping “Rules of the Road”\n\nAiming to bolster deterrence, the United States and the United Kingdom initiated the collective attribution process as a response to attacking States in cyberspace.[150] However, in the absence of normative clarity, attribution announcements refer to unacceptable and irresponsible State behavior, rather than specifying international rules or norms allegedly breached by the given cyber attack. Thus, the policy implemented usually involves delegitimization (\"naming and shaming\") and retorsions, lawful measures that can be imposed without the need for detailed legal justification. The objective is to shape \"rules of the road\" by specifying instances of unacceptable cyber activity on case-by-case bases and to develop State practice accordingly. This involves instilling among the entire community of nations the perspectives of collective attributors regarding which cyber operations may constitute irresponsible State behavior.[151] Such activities would be deemed irresponsible State behavior when conducted by official State agents or entities, as well as by hacking groups affiliated with these entities, operating under their instruction, direction, or control.[152] Although the List of Non-Binding Norms does not refer to economic or national security espionage, bilateral agreements and multinational commitments prohibit the theft of intellectual property (IP), trade secrets, and business information to gain competitive commercial advantages.[153] Such multinational commitments may be an additional source for shaping \"rules of the road\" in the commitments' context.\n\nThe cases reviewed can be categorized into subcategories representing types of irresponsible State behavior. Each subcategory has the potential to form specific prohibitions on certain types of conduct, akin to rules of the road. Below is a classification of the cases reviewed into four subcategories,\n\n150. THE WHITE HOUSE, supra note 12.\n151.

For additional clarity, she also suggests defining types of disruptive State cyber activities in various vulnerable sectors, such as energy security, essential medical care, economic stability, and democratic processes. Identifying a type of such cyber activity and examining it in its relevant context would determine whether it disrupts or denies another State’s ability to exercise its sovereign power to freely decide and act. If so, it would constitute a clear violation of the non-intervention norm, rendering it an unlawful activity. Since the UK Attorney General proposed this approach, the United States and the United Kingdom have jointly undertaken only two additional collective attributions (Cases 13, 14). However, instead of attributing unlawful cyber activities to Iran and Russia, the UK Foreign Secretary characterized Iranian actions as “reckless” and “unacceptable”¹⁵⁹ and Russian actions as “completely unacceptable.”¹⁶⁰ This aligns with the established practice of the FVEY, as evidenced in the cases reviewed. Nevertheless, adopting and implementing the British Attorney General’s integrated legal and political approach within the collective attribution strategy could potentially confer a more binding aspect to norms, such as the prohibitions on intervention and use of force, sovereignty of States, due diligence, and the boundaries of permitted espionage. This might create incentives for States, mindful of their reputation as responsible and law-abiding entities, to adhere to these norms as interpreted and applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, enforcing them through collective attribution and responses would be more consistent and coherent, thus, more effective in shaping State practice and international law.\n\n¹⁵⁸. Id.

As mentioned earlier, both the FVEY and the EU confine their responses to retorsions, such as travel bans and asset freezing, undertaken against the entities and persons engaged in conducting the malicious cyber attacks in question. The expectation that a collective attribution would prompt retorsions from a high number of participating States, forming an effective collective deterrent response, has not materialized as of yet.¹⁶¹ Nevertheless, such a response has become a common practice of the United States and to a lesser extent, the EU and the FVEY.\n\nAt the level of the United States, sanctions are imposed with greater frequency against individuals and entities based on findings and charges detailed in joint advisories or unsealed indictments and law enforcement investigations. Despite the considerable number of sanctioned individuals and entities, many are government personnel and entities associated with the CRINK, and a significant number have also been indicted.¹⁶² While the ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish but to bring about a positive change in behavior,¹⁶³ this change has not materialized as of yet. At the level of the FVEY partners, the United Kingdom has regulated its own independent cyber related sanctions regime and occasionally imposed sanctions in coordination with the United States.¹⁶⁴ Australia legislated a cyber sanctions law in December 2021. In January 2024, it implemented it for the first time against a Russian cybercriminal found responsible for the Medibank\n\n¹⁶¹.

Moreover, the EU's process of imposing sanctions in response to cyber attacks is too slow and less effective; it may extend even beyond a year, as the decision must be unanimous and rely on evidence that can withstand judicial scrutiny. Thus far, the EU has sanctioned, under its cyber-related sanctions framework, only eight individuals and four entities affiliated with the CRINK, encompassing both asset freezes and travel bans. These sanctions were instituted in two phases, in July and October of 2020. As of now, no additional sanctions have been imposed through this channel, and there have been no challenges to review any of these sanctions before the European Court of Justice.¹⁶⁶ Therefore, it seems that the EU cyber-sanction regime may have “already run its course,” as anticipated by some critics.¹⁶⁷ Furthermore, a German research team, which analyzed the EU's collective response in Cases 1–4, questioned the effectiveness of such responses, doubting whether they “really have a deterrent effect on aggressors or are ultimately just symbolic politics.”¹⁶⁸\n\nDespite the above, this article does not purport to reach an unequivocal conclusion, based on sufficient credible information, regarding the effectiveness of the collective attribution and sanctions policy in achieving its primary objectives.

Ultimately, sanctions are not designed to punish but rather to motivate positive changes in State behavior.¹⁷⁰ Given that the main outlaw States in cyberspace—Russia, Iran, and North Korea—are already subject to extensive multinational sanctions regimes for reasons unrelated to “irresponsible” malicious cyber operations,¹⁷¹ the impact of sanctions imposed as a response to malicious cyber activities is difficult to evaluate decisively. Nevertheless, the increasing frequency and scale of politically motivated cyber operations suggest that the deterring effect of collective attributions, along with retorsions, is weak.¹⁷² Due to the lack of authorized information regarding the outcomes of these sanctions and in the face of persistent politically motivated cyber attacks originating from the same culpable States and orchestrated by their governmental entities, it would not be inaccurate to argue that the effectiveness of this policy has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Meanwhile, it still has a symbolic, declarative impact needed to emphasize the red lines that States should not cross.\n\nIn conclusion, at present, collective attribution is no more than the upshot of the national attribution process, mostly American and British, with the addition of evidence sharing with like-minded States, in a manner that imposes no burden on the U.S. or UK intelligence community. The United States and the United Kingdom are always the driving force, while a CRINK State almost always stands on the receiving end. States and alliances participating in collective attributions, particularly the EU and FVEY, do not determine whether to join the attribution through direct involvement in investigative and attribution processes, but rather are influenced by political affiliations and international commitments within international frameworks, such as the G7, G20, and U.S.-EU or UK-EU dialogues. As a result, the collectiveness as implemented in the attribution process does not bolster the credibility of the American or British attribution determinations. This could notably change if the number of States committed to joining the attributions significantly increases, not due to political pressure or other political considerations, but rather due to an enhanced, joint, impartial, transparent, professional, and multinational process as the International Cyber Ransomware Initiative has recently demonstrated within its limited\n\n¹⁷⁰.

CONCLUSION\n\nMore than a decade has passed since Leon Panetta first used the metaphor of the Pearl Harbor attack to depict how serious and risky a cyber attack could be, warning “potential aggressors . . . that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.” $^{174}$ Even graver and more precise warnings have been issued recurringly by U.S. presidents and senior officials in administrations since 2012. $^{175}$ President Biden, who during his first weeks in office had to handle a series of serious ransomware cyber operations originating in Russia that dealt a blow to U.S. public interests, announced: “I made it clear to President Putin . . . that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions—interfering with our elections . . .—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia . . .” $^{176}$ In the same speech, the President emphasized that only nations “working together and in common” can solve “the accelerating global challenges.” He added, “we [the United States] cannot do it alone.” That is easier said than done in the international arena. Despite technological developments that have improved attribution capabilities, the international community has not yet established a binding legal framework for cyberspace. Instead, the United States, along with the United Kingdom, has chosen to build upon a national official attribution system by imposing collective attribution and responses to the wrongdoing, aiming to concurrently achieve two goals: (1) to reinforce State deterrence through public collective attribution and imposing costs; and (2) shaping and internalizing “rules of the road” for responsible State behavior in cyberspace. $^{177}$\n\n173.

    "Collective Attribution in Cyberspace\n\nVol. 103\n\nHowever, this article highlights fundamental flaws that impact the credibility and legitimacy of this attribution process and subsequently its effectiveness. The United States, as the major attributor, assigns responsibility to specific States without allowing transparency regarding the evidence, the criteria of selecting the cases, and maintaining ambiguity about the legal grounds on which their charges rely. Furthermore, since the attribution determination in any given case is not subject to external and objective scrutiny, it is hard to indicate impartiality, legality, coherency, and consistency in the process, which collapses into one measure—attribution, accusation, judging, and punishing by retorsions. This is a far cry from satisfying any \"right\" or \"fair process.\" Thus far, the overwhelming majority of collective attributions have been American-led. The participants are American governmental experts, in cooperation mostly with American tech platforms whose loyalty to American national security interests is not questioned. There is no effort to involve independent, reputable international experts in the process, which is not sufficiently transparent and, on the face of things, may be perceived as one-sided. At most, the American process may constitute an exchange of views and intelligence sharing with counterpart agencies in the FVEY.\n\nClose and clandestine cooperation—among the FVEY—and sharing information with the EU's relevant institutions, as well as with a few like-minded States, is not enough to replace a proper procedure that would lend credibility and legitimacy to the process and its outcomes. The absence of representative, impartial multinational experts in the process exacerbates the legitimacy gap. This is even more true when the State at the receiving end of the attribution process is always a rival State from the CRINK group. Such dynamics erode the process' legitimacy and may discourage States from embracing its findings and joining the collective attributions, let alone responses. Moreover, it can explain the ineffectiveness of international initiatives, such as the International Cyber Deterrence Initiative and Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, and the negligible effectiveness of the collective attributions. This article pointed to one initiative, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which, in my opinion, has the potential to become more effective in countering ransomware and cooperating in law enforcement once the ransomware is detected or when credible intelligence can anticipate the details of the upcom\n\nsignal to Russia without any reference to specific international rules about the cost Russia might pay if it continues with its destabilizing actions).\n\n331",

The motive, whether political or criminal, does not matter when ransomware cripples major governmental services, even more so when it prompts States to declare an emergency, as happened in Costa Rica. $^{178}$  If the International Counter Ransomware Initiative proves itself effective, it could be part of a mechanism to tackle politically motivated cyber attacks by expanding its designation.\n\nThis article presents the considerable cumulative experience gained from destructive and disruptive State or State-sponsored cyber attacks and their accompanying attribution processes. This, coupled with the growing number of States expressing their perspectives in enduring public debates regarding the terms and boundaries for applying major international norms to cyberspace,[179] illustrate the image of a wide-open field that must be fenced in by further development and regulation. In my opinion, there is fertile ground for a justified reevaluation of the collective attribution process and the responses to cyber wrongdoing.

This campaign targeted significant Albanian government websites, including websites for providing essential public services and websites of the Albanian Parliament and Prime Minister's office.[218] Consequently, essential websites were shut down, and governmental data, including sensitive emails, were leaked. Although Albania is a NATO member State, it has not applied to activate Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Albania is not a cyber-power State. Therefore, it appealed to the United States, United Kingdom, and other capable States to investigate these cyber attacks and assist in ensuring resiliency. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have attributed State responsibility to Iran, while the EU and NATO have not deviated from their cautious path, avoiding explicit attribution statements.[219]\n\nIn September 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security and its Minister of Intelligence as engaging in cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies.[220]\n\n14.
