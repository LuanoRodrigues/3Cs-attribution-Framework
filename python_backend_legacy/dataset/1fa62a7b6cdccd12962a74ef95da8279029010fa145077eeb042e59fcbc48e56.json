This raises the question: Is there a role for intelligence agencies—which traditionally work behind the scenes—in public attribution of offensive cyber operations? If so, what are the features that make these agencies useful in such public announcements? To answer these two questions, this article examines the emerging phenomenon of U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributing offensive cyber operations and identifies three features that make these agencies effective in public attribution: they send signals below the adversary's escalation threshold, offer credibility and nonpartisanship, and have partnerships that enable them to succeed in the attribution process. The SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee intrusions are used as illustrative case studies to examine this phenomenon.

This offensive cyber operation utilized the American information technology (IT) company SolarWinds' regular software update, which had been infected with malicious code. More than 18,000 of SolarWinds' clients were estimated to be affected, among them many U.S. governmental agencies, including parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and more. So were private companies, like Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Deloitte, and other organizations. Microsoft president Brad Smith called it “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.”\n\nFireEye made the first attribution to a “highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.” Two weeks later, in January 2021, several U.S. intelligence agencies—the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA)—with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), publicly attributed the operation to “a Russian actor.” However, it was not until April 2021 that the Biden administration explicitly named the perpetrator as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\n\nThe fact that the country's intelligence agencies were the ones making the first official public attribution, several months before the president did so, highlights a puzzle: Intelligence agencies traditionally work behind the scenes, and unlike politicians and private cybersecurity companies, may have less incentive to publicize their activity, as this might endanger their sources and methods of operation. Furthermore, in some cases, offensive cyber operations can be kept covert and underreported so that countries do not concede they were cyberattacked. In view of these two factors, intelligence agencies seem unlikely to be the agents of publicity and public attribution. However, two cases in the United States suggested this might be otherwise.\n\nThis leads to a research question: Once intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public attribution, what are the features that make them effective at doing so? I argue that public attribution by intelligence agencies is an emerging phenomenon that deserves deeper examination, regarding two issues in particular. The first is the fact that this is indeed occurring, and therefore should be explored as another attribution path. The second issue warranting study regards the features of intelligence agencies that make their",

With governments consistently under cyberattacks and the global scope of offensive cyber operations rising, recognizing and understanding the public role of intelligence agencies is vital.\n\nThe first part of the article surveys the main literature addressing the changing role of intelligence agencies in the current information age, outlines the common possible attribution paths, and highlights one that has so far received little theoretical and empirical attention—public attribution by intelligence agencies. The second part presents the empirical data regarding public attribution by intelligence agencies and shows that this is a global phenomenon, although the United States is the leading country doing so. After empirically establishing attribution by intelligence agencies as a more common phenomenon than might be expected, the article turns to the third part to ask what features of the intelligence agencies make them effective in doing public attributions. Three features are discussed: (1) they can send a credible signal beneath the escalation threshold, (2) they are perceived as professional and “a-political,” (3) their connections with the private sector and international partners. In the fourth part, I use the SolarWinds (2020) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC; 2016) intrusions as illustrative case studies intended to give the reader an initial sense of the way these functions work. The fifth and final part discusses the conclusions of this research, its policy-relevant implications, and offers avenues for future research.\n\n## INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE\n\nWhen approaching the role of intelligence agencies in public attribution of offensive cyber operations, one must first consider the way their role at large is affected by rapid technological changes. Over the past decade, intelligence work has undergone a tremendous change, and today it is not only intelligence gathering and covert actions but also carrying out offensive and defensive cyber operations. The new function and scale are both enabled by advanced cyber technologies that allow obtaining and analyzing information in ways and scopes that did not exist in the past. This is further amplified by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, used to “amplify the effectiveness of our workforce ... advance mission capability and enhance the IC's [Intelligence Community's] ability to provide data interpretation to decision makers.” This change in scope and scale offers both opportunities and challenges, and requires intelligence agencies to adapt and change: “[T]he Intelligence Community faces a moment of reckoning. If the IC cannot adopt AI and other emerging technologies successfully, it risks failure.” This challenge should be kept in mind when discussing public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies.",

            "markdown": "Intelligence agencies' work is usually being done “behind the scenes,” and when it comes to offensive cyber operations, secrecy was considered an inherent feature.10 General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency, noted that, in the beginning, “even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself.”11 While literature is offering new perspectives on the changes in intelligence agencies' work, it mostly continues to perceive their role as covert and silent.12 However, cyber technologies enable intelligence agencies to operate on much larger scales than in the past, which may conflict with the traditional secrecy of intelligence operations; the larger the scale, the higher the risk of exposure might be.13 This article explores circumstances in which intelligence agencies abandon secrecy and thus take their place on stage.\n\n## Public attribution of offensive cyber operations\n\nGovernments and private firms that suffered a cyberattack have incentives for keeping cyber intrusions secret, “Lest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment.”14 In certain cases, target states may be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of these operations, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.15 There is no pride involved in being a victim, and target states might opt for silence so as not to “admit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned.”16\n\nAttribution of offensive cyber operations has been studied from several different perspectives. These include the attribution problem and its meanings, the uniqueness of attribution in cyberspace compared to other domains, the different attribution pathways, and the various calculations decisionmakers should take into account when deciding on attribution.17 Additional scholarship has highlighted the challenge in identifying and attributing the source of an attack, the meaning of anonymity, and the difficulties this poses to the defender when deciding how to react.18\n\nIntelligence agencies face a dilemma regarding the amount and nature of information required for reaching public attribution: Should this information relate to an individual, or the state? How much evidence is required to reveal and what might be the implication for this publicity? Public attribution by a government requires intelligence agencies to provide the relevant technical and operational information. However, when it comes to public attribution they are often hesitant to disclose this because of the potential damage to their intelligence methods, sources, and access to vital assets.19",

The first is an analytic process—which is historical and backward-looking—identifying what happened and who did it. This includes establishing the technical facts of the intrusion and checking the attacker's techniques against those of previously identified actors. Every attribution of an offensive cyber operation begins with a technical and forensic investigation based on known data and information and indicators—such as technical identifiers and pieces of code—in order to understand the scale of the offensive cyber operation, the severity of the damage, the goal of the adversary, and so on. The objective of this investigation is to ensure the safety of the affected networks and computer systems.^{20}\n\nThe second stage is a strategic process, which is more forward-looking; deciding what should be communicated, by whom, and how. In this part, the target state determines what it wants to do with the findings of this forensic investigation, in keeping with its broader strategic goals and political considerations. In this stage, states can decide how they wish to communicate the attribution findings to other audiences in order to influence the interpretation of a particular incident.^{21} This stage is mainly driven by a state's policy considerations, and it can communicate its findings using one or more of five general attribution paths, separately or in concert^{22}: Technical: providing technical--forensic information that will help other entities patch their vulnerabilities and protect themselves. This kind of attribution can be done by the private sector, NGOs, or state agencies. In the U.S. context, this is done mainly by CISA and the FBI.^{23} Criminal: criminal proceedings against individuals. If a malicious cyber incident is regarded as a matter for domestic law enforcement authorities, then legal requirements for process, standards of evidence, and degrees of certainty about attribution apply^{24}; Political, Unofficial: by talking to the press under terms of anonymity; Political, Official: public attribution by state political officials, such as the president, secretary of state, secretary of homeland security and others; and Multicountry collaboration: public attribution by a number of countries together. This kind of attribution requires trust between the participating states as it requires each state to share at least some of its information and intelligence.^{25}\n\nIn recent years, there have been cases in which the intelligence agencies were the ones doing the public attribution, potentially signaling a new official attribution path. In the next paragraphs, I will examine where this occurs along the national decisionmaking process, and discuss the data and identify the possible reasons they are doing so in the U.S. case.\n\nTo illustrate this decisionmaking process, we can look at the U.S.-specific decision tree in Figure 1.

The point of departure is that an offensive cyber operation has taken place and has been detected by the defender, and the analytical attribution process has been done. Now, decisionmakers face the question whether to reveal the identity of the attacker or not. If not, there are two options: First, maintain silence. Second, provide information to private security companies so they will do the attribution.\n\nIf the decision is to reveal the identity of the attacker, once again there are two options. The first of these is nonofficial attribution, which can be publicizing the information in anonymous ways—such as talking to the press under terms of anonymity, off-record briefing, or leaking. The second is official attribution by the U.S. government. Official response can be done by the White House or Executive Office of the President; other Cabinet departments, such as the Department of Defence, Department of Justice, or Department of Homeland Security; or by intelligence agencies. The last is the focus of this study.\n\n# PUBLICITY AND OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE\n\nWhile targeted states might have clear incentives not to acknowledge having been attacked, they do not always have a choice. The magnitude of some cyber intrusions, in addition to related rumors and media reports, makes it difficult for states to avoid any public response altogether.[26] In order to examine the phenomenon of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, I took an empirical approach, examining offensive\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE",

This part serves as the basis for the qualitative examination through the illustrative case studies that follow. The following paragraphs and figures present the data on publicity of offensive cyber operations in general and specific data regarding the different entities revealing them, and the role of intelligence agencies within this. These show that public attribution by intelligence agencies is indeed an empirical phenomenon.\n\nHere it is important to address the so-called unknown unknowns or unobserved offensive cyber operations.27 These are offensive cyber operations assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources used for this research. For the purposes of this article, only offensive cyber operations that have been publicly revealed and for which there exists sufficient data to code in the dataset have been included. The presumed existence of unknown unknowns should not preclude scholars from researching these issues, which are changing the landscape of cyberwarfare politics.28\n\n### Data Compilation\n\nData compilation included three preexisting datasets, plus additional sources. The first is the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset Version 1.1,29 which provides data on the presence of cyber conflict in the existing conflicts between 2001 and 2014. To this was added new data on cyberattacks and intrusions for the years 1996 to 2019 based on the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations tracker.30 Finally, the relevant data for the years prior to 2001 were added, based on the National Security Archive Cyber Vault Project.31 All data were verified, then recoded using a new schema of variables and scaling.\n\nThe compilation and updating process also relied on reports in media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. This allowed supplementing the existing data with any new information that had come to light since the incident, and was published via mainstream media, threat intelligence reports, cybersecurity magazines, or cybersecurity companies. For verification purposes, each incident included in the dataset has at least two reliable sources and was examined by two independent coders. The dataset was finalized in June 2019 and includes 476 cyber incidents. All data was collected from open sources.\n\n### Entity Exposing the Attacker\n\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the actors that revealed the offensive cyber operation public attribution for the years 2005 to 2019.

The second relates to organizational differences. In some countries, the boundaries between intelligence agencies, other defense agencies, and law enforcement agencies is blurred. For example, cases in which the FBI was the only attributing agency are included in the data but excluded from the analysis. The U.S. cases allow for better distinguishing between the various agencies. Even with, for example, the NSA and Cyber Command being under the same roof and command, I was able to focus on cases that were attributed by the U.S. IC as a whole.\n\n# FEATURES OF INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE IN PUBLIC ATTRIBUTIONS\n\nExamination of the available evidence suggested three features of intelligence agencies that make them effective in public attributions: ability to signal below escalation threshold, reputation for credibility and nonpartisanship, and partnership existence—domestic and international. I then used two of the recent best-documented cyber operations—the SolarWinds and the DNC intrusions—as illustrative case studies in order to trace and examine the use of intelligence agencies for public attribution of offensive cyber operations.\n\n# Signal Beneath the Escalation Threshold\n\nThe nonescalatory nature of offensive cyber operations has been widely discussed in the past few years.[33] Despite the preliminary expectations that offensive cyber operations would lead to cyber war—such as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warning against the possibility of a “cyber-Pearl Harbor”—real-world events so far proved differently.

Once crossed, the power dynamics change and the operations can escalate—in the cyberdomain and cross-domain as well.^{35} However, public accusations can have a declarative-escalatory effect.^{36} States may choose not to publicly attribute an attack when attribution could cause undesirable escalation “outside the agreed competition space,” and that could publicly endanger rules or legal regimes outside the cyberdomain.^{37} This is based on the perception that defensive and offensive cyber activities are hard to distinguish, and that a defensive cyber action might be misinterpreted by the adversary as a preparation for attack.^{38}\n\nPublic attribution by senior officials has great political and geostrategical impact but also carries higher escalatory consequences and risks. Therefore, a target country wishing to respond to offensive cyber operations in the public arena and signal its adversary without risking escalation might use its intelligence agencies as the “first line” of public attribution, rather than a more declarative authority. This allows sending a clear message to the rival while staying below a threshold for undesirable escalation. While countries can opt to share information privately, including through direct channels between intelligence agencies such as the Five Eyes alliance, public attribution serves as a political and policy signal; privately conveying information does not.\n\n### Reputation for Credibility and Nonpartisanship\n\nPublic attribution plays a visible role in U.S. cyber strategy.^{39} Therefore, the way politicians communicate attribution findings to their various audiences—rival, domestic, and international—has critical bearing on how the message is received. However, this presents a challenge. High-level official attributions may carry a risk of escalation or other costs as mentioned, while nonofficial paths may not be perceived as credible. For the attribution to achieve maximum impact with minimum risk effectively, it should be highly credible, but also apolitical. Intelligence agencies often afford the best of both because they historically carry both reputations.\n\nFor example, according to the University of Texas at Austin's 2020 survey, a majority of Americans (64%) believe that the IC plays a vital role in protecting the nation. This popular support has proven consistent, bipartisan, and notably resilient over a four-year span marked by hostility and even “unprecedented assault” on American intelligence during the Trump presidency. Despite this tension, polling consistently confirmed a “durable reservoir of public confidence” in U.S. intelligence agencies.^{40} So, when",

The 2023 Department of Defense (DoD) cyber strategy stated,“Our global Allies and partners represent a foundational strategic advantage for the United States. We will build the capacity and capability of U.S. Allies and partners in cyberspace and expand avenues of potential cyber cooperation. We will continue hunt forward operations and other bilateral technical collaboration, working with Allies and partners to illuminate malicious cyber activity on their networks.41”\n\nIn this context, the credibility of the U.S. intelligence agencies can also strengthen the credibility of the entire public attribution process in the eyes of its international partners and allies. This, in turn, can contribute to enhancing its international collaborations and helps the U.S. position itself as a world leader and authority in this field. One visible result is the joint public attributions that the United States and its allies have been doing in the past few years. A recent and salient example is the joint attribution by the European Union and United States of the hacking of ViaSat to Russia on the first day of the war in Ukraine.42\n\nThe U.S. government also has strong ties to the private sector in many fields. When it comes to the cyberdomain, the private sector often holds much more information than the government and intelligence agencies can without encroaching on citizens' privacy. This makes cooperation with private cybersecurity companies crucial in maintaining the health of the overall U.S. system, both public and private.43 One significant development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 DoD cyber strategy notes that private-sector parties (e.g. private cybersecurity firms) reporting on attribution “can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place,” and states that the DoD “will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution.”44 The importance of these companies is hard to overstate; they were the first to identify and reveal both the SolarWinds and DNC intrusions, discussed below.",

They are brief by design, aiming “to give the reader a ‘feel' for a theoretical argument by providing a concrete example of its application, or to demonstrate the empirical relevance of a theoretical proposition by identifying at least one relevant case.”45 They serve as an exploratory step between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. With this in mind, the case studies below illustrate that the subject is ripe for research.\n\n### The SolarWinds Intrusion (2020)\n\nIn December 2020, the private cybersecurity company FireEye revealed an ongoing large-scale cyber operation, in which a rival country—believed to be Russia—gained access to multiple U.S. government agencies' networks. These included the Pentagon, the departments of Commerce, State, Treasury and Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Agency, as well as over 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, and many others.46\n\nSecurity researchers estimated that, starting in March 2020, and possibly earlier, Russian state-sponsored hackers gained access to the periodic update of SolarWinds' Orion IT-monitoring software, widely used by government and security agencies, leading private companies, and critical infrastructures. Orion is an IT performance monitoring system that has privileged access to IT systems to obtain log and system performance data.47 Consequently, anyone updating the software in fact granted the attackers potential access to their systems. Chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner, described the SolarWinds attack as “one of the most sophisticated and deep hacks we've faced.”48 The extent of the breach raised concerns that attackers could eventually use their access to harm American systems, disrupt or destroy information, and disable critical-system commands—although none of these are known to have happened to date. 49\n\nFormer Homeland Security advisor for the Trump administration, Thomas Bossert, described the intrusion as follows: “The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate. [...] The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months.”50 As the scale of the intrusion became clearer, there was no doubt the American government had failed to convince Russia there would be consequences to such broad hacking of federal government and corporate networks.51",

Analysts quoted in the New York Times criticized the U.S. government for remaining silent on the attack: “It was hard to know which was worse: that the federal government was blindsided again by Russian intelligence agencies, or that when it was evident what was happening, White House officials said nothing.”52\n\nIn January 2021, the FBI, DNI, NSA, and CISA publicly attributed the attack to Russia.53 It was not until April 2021—four months after the attack was detected and first revealed—that the White House publicly attributed the attack to the Russian government. The Biden administration published an Executive Order denouncing the harmful foreign activities of the Russian government and unmasking Russian agencies and companies that aided the Kremlin's hacking efforts: “Today the United States is formally naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures. The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR.54”\n\nIn this case, the intelligence agencies made the public attribution before the president, despite public criticism. This served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation in the bilateral and international arena. This kind of escalation with Russia might have had an undesirable effect for President Biden's administration during his first days in office. At the same time, it preserved the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization during a sensitive time—mere days after the Trump--Biden transition.\n\nThe credibility of intelligence agencies in public attribution also served the United States in bolstering its relations with Europe and the international community. The White House announced that it was providing training to foreign ministry lawyers and policymakers on legal standards of state behavior in cyberspace and peacetime norms. At the same time, the United States also announced first-of-its-kind international training and assistance on policy and technical aspects of attribution, to take place through the Marshall Center in Germany and support policymakers in Europe and worldwide.55\n\n### The DNC Intrusion (2016)\n\nIn April 2016, the FBI informed the DNC that an unauthorized figure had obtained extensive permissions for the DNC computer network and that the DNC was “under serious cyberattack.”56 The DNC, the governing body of",

The FBI was already monitoring suspicious activity in the network, and as early as September 2015 had warned the DNC that its network had been hacked by a Russian group dubbed “The Dukes.” The FBI already knew this group well, after detecting its attempts to break into the White House, State Department, and Joint Chief of Staff's email systems in previous years.57\n\nAt the end of April 2016, the DNC hired the services of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to address the attack.58 After a month of investigation, CrowdStrike attributed the intrusion to Russia, based on various technical clues, such as matching the attack times to working hours in the Moscow time zone.59 The campaign of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton grappled with considerable political fallout from the intrusion, including trying to refute the vast amounts of information published. The attack and resulting affair arguably influenced American public opinion during election season later that year.60\n\nThe first public attribution was made in June 2016 by CrowdStrike. In this case, experts called President Barak Obama and the government to attribute the attack publicly. For example, in July 2016, the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group issued a statement calling on President Obama to “ensure that the attacks are attributed and take prompt actions sufficient to hold those responsible accountable and deter foreign actors from pursuing such tactics in the future.”61\n\nIn October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement on behalf of the IC, explicitly attributing the attack to Russia and describing it as a direct order from the Russian government:“The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions. [...] We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.62”\n\nAt a press conference later that month, the White House spokesperson attributed the breach to the Russian government, adding that Russia's goals included attempts to undermine the stability of the U.S. political system.63 Only in his last days in office, in December 2016, did President Obama say in an interview that the “DNC hack traced to ‘highest levels' of the Kremlin.” President Obama said he similarly told Putin personally to “cut it out” in September but he refrained from public retaliation before the November election because it would “immediately be seen through a partisan lens.”64",

The United States became the focus of interest of other democracies, such as France and Germany, which were headed toward elections and feared Russian intervention.65 The United States even provided intelligence and technical assistance. For example, the NSA warned France that Russian hackers were planning to disrupt its electoral process. This allowed a French counteraction, which included planting fake information for the hackers and ultimately minimized Russia's actual influence on the election process. With considerable experience confronting Russian cyber intrusions, the United States positioned itself as an international role model in dealing with ongoing Russian intrusions and influence attempts.66\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe SolarWinds and DNC intrusions illustrate the dynamic of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, in particular in the ongoing cyber conflict between the United States and Russia. The overall credibility U.S. intelligence agencies enjoy lent greater weight to their public attributions in the eyes of both domestic and international audiences. This enhanced the standing of the United States as an experienced cyberspace actor and allowed it to position itself as a leader in the international cybersecurity arena, further strengthening its partnerships and alliances.\n\nIn both cases, public attribution by U.S. intelligence agencies occurred in the timeframe between the technical attribution made by private cybersecurity companies and the political attribution ultimately made by the U.S. president, despite public criticism. This appears to have served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation. At the same time, it allowed the United States to preserve the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization on the domestic front.\n\nThis phenomenon is occurring in the context of a larger change in the role of intelligence agencies that is facilitated and forced by the rapid advance in cyber technologies and AI. These technologies have affected these agencies' missions, from intelligence gathering to actively carrying out defensive and offensive cyber operations. Offensive cyber operations are increasing in numbers and scales, becoming an integral component of global conflict, diplomacy, and politics. Intelligence agencies are now being asked to take the public stage—often before, or altogether instead of, the country's senior officials.\n\nThis study is meant to stimulate exploration and scholarship about the factors at play when intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public",

At the broadest, \"macroscale\" level there may be high variation between states on what entity communicates attribution publicly. If so, there may be common characteristics that make some entities better than others for specific signaling purposes. For example, when intelligence agencies are doing the public attribution, as happened in both cases presented here, they can convey a message to the private sector that it plays a vital role in this process and that the information received from these companies is indeed used for national security needs. One hypothesis worth future research is that this signal has a positive effect, increasing private companies' engagement and willingness to share information with the government in the future.\n\nSimilarly, intelligence agencies' perception of the threat that rivals in cyberspace pose, and how this affects their analyses and messaging, might be examined. In its 2021 Annual Threats Assessment, the ODNI estimated,\n\nCyber threats from nation states and their surrogates will remain acute. Foreign states use cyber operations to steal information, influence populations, and damage industry, including physical and digital critical infrastructure. Although an increasing number of countries and non-state actors have these capabilities, we remain most concerned about Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.[67]\n\nThe two cases presented here involved Russia. However, in other cases, like the breach into the Office of Personal Management and Sony hack (both in 2014) involving China and North Korea, respectively, there had been no public attribution by intelligence agencies. Was there something different about the threats China and North Korea posed that led to different attribution methods?\n\nFuture research may answer these and other questions, such as uncovering variables that correlate to use of intelligence agencies in public attributions. Possible candidates might include the target type, adversarial regime type, and more. Examining the reverse instances of this study—cases without attribution by intelligence agencies—might shed light on the question of when states might be likely to use—or not—their intelligence agencies as the front line of official public attribution.\n\nWith offensive cyber operations constantly on the rise and stakes for governments increasingly higher, intelligence agencies appear to be playing an increasingly important role in the process of public attribution. Distinguishing between various attribution strategies and intelligence agencies' roles within them can provide a deeper understanding of how states perceive the context of a particular offensive cyber operation, and highlight the dynamics, trade-offs, and functions policymakers face when deciding on the path for public attribution and its possible outcomes.\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE",

This raises the question: Is there a role for intelligence agencies—which traditionally work behind the scenes—in public attribution of offensive cyber operations? If so, what are the features that make these agencies useful in such public announcements? To answer these two questions, this article examines the emerging phenomenon of U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributing offensive cyber operations and identifies three features that make these agencies effective in public attribution: they send signals below the adversary's escalation threshold, offer credibility and nonpartisanship, and have partnerships that enable them to succeed in the attribution process. The SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee intrusions are used as illustrative case studies to examine this phenomenon. This research highlights\n\nGil Baram is a Senior Lecturer at Bar Ilan University and a nonresident Research Scholar at the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity and Berkeley Risk and Security Lab, University of California, Berkeley.

This offensive cyber operation utilized the American information technology (IT) company SolarWinds' regular software update, which had been infected with malicious code. More than 18,000 of SolarWinds' clients were estimated to be affected, among them many U.S. governmental agencies, including parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and more. So were private companies, like Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Deloitte, and other organizations. Microsoft president Brad Smith called it “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.”\n\nFireEye made the first attribution to a “highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.” Two weeks later, in January 2021, several U.S. intelligence agencies—the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA)—with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), publicly attributed the operation to “a Russian actor.” However, it was not until April 2021 that the Biden administration explicitly named the perpetrator as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\n\nThe fact that the country's intelligence agencies were the ones making the first official public attribution, several months before the president did so, highlights a puzzle: Intelligence agencies traditionally work behind the scenes, and unlike politicians and private cybersecurity companies, may have less incentive to publicize their activity, as this might endanger their sources and methods of operation. Furthermore, in some cases, offensive cyber operations can be kept covert and underreported so that countries do not concede they were cyberattacked. In view of these two factors, intelligence agencies seem unlikely to be the agents of publicity and public attribution. However, two cases in the United States suggested this might be otherwise.\n\nThis leads to a research question: Once intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public attribution, what are the features that make them effective at doing so? I argue that public attribution by intelligence agencies is an emerging phenomenon that deserves deeper examination, regarding two issues in particular. The first is the fact that this is indeed occurring, and therefore should be explored as another attribution path. The second issue warranting study regards the features of intelligence agencies that make their\n\npublic attribution effective. With governments consistently under cyberattacks and the global scope of offensive cyber operations rising, recognizing and understanding the public role of intelligence agencies is vital.\n\nThe first part of the article surveys the main literature addressing the changing role of intelligence agencies in the current information age, outlines the common possible attribution paths, and highlights one that has so far received little theoretical and empirical attention—public attribution by intelligence agencies. The second part presents the empirical data regarding public attribution by intelligence agencies and shows that this is a global phenomenon, although the United States is the leading country doing so. After empirically establishing attribution by intelligence agencies as a more common phenomenon than might be expected, the article turns to the third part to ask what features of the intelligence agencies make them effective in doing public attributions. Three features are discussed: (1) they can send a credible signal beneath the escalation threshold, (2) they are perceived as professional and “a-political,” (3) their connections with the private sector and international partners. In the fourth part, I use the SolarWinds (2020) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC; 2016) intrusions as illustrative case studies intended to give the reader an initial sense of the way these functions work. The fifth and final part discusses the conclusions of this research, its policy-relevant implications, and offers avenues for future research.\n\n## INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE\n\nWhen approaching the role of intelligence agencies in public attribution of offensive cyber operations, one must first consider the way their role at large is affected by rapid technological changes. Over the past decade, intelligence work has undergone a tremendous change, and today it is not only intelligence gathering and covert actions but also carrying out offensive and defensive cyber operations. The new function and scale are both enabled by advanced cyber technologies that allow obtaining and analyzing information in ways and scopes that did not exist in the past. This is further amplified by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, used to “amplify the effectiveness of our workforce ... advance mission capability and enhance the IC's [Intelligence Community's] ability to provide data interpretation to decision makers.” This change in scope and scale offers both opportunities and challenges, and requires intelligence agencies to adapt and change: “[T]he Intelligence Community faces a moment of reckoning. If the IC cannot adopt AI and other emerging technologies successfully, it risks failure.” This challenge should be kept in mind when discussing public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies.\n\nIntelligence agencies' work is usually being done “behind the scenes,” and when it comes to offensive cyber operations, secrecy was considered an inherent feature.10 General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency, noted that, in the beginning, “even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself.”11 While literature is offering new perspectives on the changes in intelligence agencies' work, it mostly continues to perceive their role as covert and silent.12 However, cyber technologies enable intelligence agencies to operate on much larger scales than in the past, which may conflict with the traditional secrecy of intelligence operations; the larger the scale, the higher the risk of exposure might be.13 This article explores circumstances in which intelligence agencies abandon secrecy and thus take their place on stage.\n\n## Public attribution of offensive cyber operations\n\nGovernments and private firms that suffered a cyberattack have incentives for keeping cyber intrusions secret, “Lest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment.”14 In certain cases, target states may be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of these operations, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.15 There is no pride involved in being a victim, and target states might opt for silence so as not to “admit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned.”16\n\nAttribution of offensive cyber operations has been studied from several different perspectives. These include the attribution problem and its meanings, the uniqueness of attribution in cyberspace compared to other domains, the different attribution pathways, and the various calculations decisionmakers should take into account when deciding on attribution.17 Additional scholarship has highlighted the challenge in identifying and attributing the source of an attack, the meaning of anonymity, and the difficulties this poses to the defender when deciding how to react.18\n\nIntelligence agencies face a dilemma regarding the amount and nature of information required for reaching public attribution: Should this information relate to an individual, or the state? How much evidence is required to reveal and what might be the implication for this publicity? Public attribution by a government requires intelligence agencies to provide the relevant technical and operational information. However, when it comes to public attribution they are often hesitant to disclose this because of the potential damage to their intelligence methods, sources, and access to vital assets.19\n\nThe attribution process by states consists of two main stages. The first is an analytic process—which is historical and backward-looking—identifying what happened and who did it. This includes establishing the technical facts of the intrusion and checking the attacker's techniques against those of previously identified actors. Every attribution of an offensive cyber operation begins with a technical and forensic investigation based on known data and information and indicators—such as technical identifiers and pieces of code—in order to understand the scale of the offensive cyber operation, the severity of the damage, the goal of the adversary, and so on. The objective of this investigation is to ensure the safety of the affected networks and computer systems.^{20}\n\nThe second stage is a strategic process, which is more forward-looking; deciding what should be communicated, by whom, and how. In this part, the target state determines what it wants to do with the findings of this forensic investigation, in keeping with its broader strategic goals and political considerations. In this stage, states can decide how they wish to communicate the attribution findings to other audiences in order to influence the interpretation of a particular incident.^{21} This stage is mainly driven by a state's policy considerations, and it can communicate its findings using one or more of five general attribution paths, separately or in concert^{22}: Technical: providing technical--forensic information that will help other entities patch their vulnerabilities and protect themselves. This kind of attribution can be done by the private sector, NGOs, or state agencies. In the U.S. context, this is done mainly by CISA and the FBI.^{23} Criminal: criminal proceedings against individuals. If a malicious cyber incident is regarded as a matter for domestic law enforcement authorities, then legal requirements for process, standards of evidence, and degrees of certainty about attribution apply^{24}; Political, Unofficial: by talking to the press under terms of anonymity; Political, Official: public attribution by state political officials, such as the president, secretary of state, secretary of homeland security and others; and Multicountry collaboration: public attribution by a number of countries together. This kind of attribution requires trust between the participating states as it requires each state to share at least some of its information and intelligence.^{25}\n\nIn recent years, there have been cases in which the intelligence agencies were the ones doing the public attribution, potentially signaling a new official attribution path. In the next paragraphs, I will examine where this occurs along the national decisionmaking process, and discuss the data and identify the possible reasons they are doing so in the U.S. case.\n\nTo illustrate this decisionmaking process, we can look at the U.S.-specific decision tree in Figure 1. This flowchart helps explain two main factors in the attribution process—the echelon of the organizational hierarchy that\n\nGIL BARAM\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1. Attribution decision-making process (U.S.-specific).\n\nperforms the attribution, and the specific function within this level. The point of departure is that an offensive cyber operation has taken place and has been detected by the defender, and the analytical attribution process has been done. Now, decisionmakers face the question whether to reveal the identity of the attacker or not. If not, there are two options: First, maintain silence. Second, provide information to private security companies so they will do the attribution.\n\nIf the decision is to reveal the identity of the attacker, once again there are two options. The first of these is nonofficial attribution, which can be publicizing the information in anonymous ways—such as talking to the press under terms of anonymity, off-record briefing, or leaking. The second is official attribution by the U.S. government. Official response can be done by the White House or Executive Office of the President; other Cabinet departments, such as the Department of Defence, Department of Justice, or Department of Homeland Security; or by intelligence agencies. The last is the focus of this study.\n\n# PUBLICITY AND OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE\n\nWhile targeted states might have clear incentives not to acknowledge having been attacked, they do not always have a choice. The magnitude of some cyber intrusions, in addition to related rumors and media reports, makes it difficult for states to avoid any public response altogether.[26] In order to examine the phenomenon of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, I took an empirical approach, examining offensive\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\n\ncyber operations to identify the agent of publicity in each case in order to map the relevant cases. This part serves as the basis for the qualitative examination through the illustrative case studies that follow. The following paragraphs and figures present the data on publicity of offensive cyber operations in general and specific data regarding the different entities revealing them, and the role of intelligence agencies within this. These show that public attribution by intelligence agencies is indeed an empirical phenomenon.\n\nHere it is important to address the so-called unknown unknowns or unobserved offensive cyber operations.27 These are offensive cyber operations assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources used for this research. For the purposes of this article, only offensive cyber operations that have been publicly revealed and for which there exists sufficient data to code in the dataset have been included. The presumed existence of unknown unknowns should not preclude scholars from researching these issues, which are changing the landscape of cyberwarfare politics.28\n\n### Data Compilation\n\nData compilation included three preexisting datasets, plus additional sources. The first is the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset Version 1.1,29 which provides data on the presence of cyber conflict in the existing conflicts between 2001 and 2014. To this was added new data on cyberattacks and intrusions for the years 1996 to 2019 based on the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations tracker.30 Finally, the relevant data for the years prior to 2001 were added, based on the National Security Archive Cyber Vault Project.31 All data were verified, then recoded using a new schema of variables and scaling.\n\nThe compilation and updating process also relied on reports in media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. This allowed supplementing the existing data with any new information that had come to light since the incident, and was published via mainstream media, threat intelligence reports, cybersecurity magazines, or cybersecurity companies. For verification purposes, each incident included in the dataset has at least two reliable sources and was examined by two independent coders. The dataset was finalized in June 2019 and includes 476 cyber incidents. All data was collected from open sources.\n\n### Entity Exposing the Attacker\n\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the actors that revealed the offensive cyber operation public attribution for the years 2005 to 2019. In half the cases, private cybersecurity companies were the ones to expose the attack.\n\nGIL BARAM\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nFigure 2. Entity exposing the attacker (2005-2019).\n\nHowever, as illustrated below, intelligence and defense agencies revealed the attacker's identity in  $13\\%$  of the cases, doing so at higher rates than senior officials, who attributed offensive cyber operations in  $10\\%$  of the cases. This finding is particularly interesting given the general perception of intelligence organizations as secret agencies that do not disclose information to the public.\n\n# Global Phenomenon\n\nFigure 3 illustrates the data for public attribution by defense and intelligence agencies in different countries ( $N = 43$ ). While the United States clearly leads this practice, it is also being done in Germany, South Korea, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Examples of the agencies making public attributions include defense agencies such as CISA, Norway's Policy Security Service, the Polish Computer Emergency Response Team, the Security Service of Ukraine, and intelligence agencies such as the DNI, FBI, and NSA in the United States and Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV).[32] This research focuses on the United States only, for reasons discussed in the next section.\n\n# Focusing on the United States\n\nThis article focuses on the United States for two reasons. The first is that the United States is the dominant country for this path, meaning it had the\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\n\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\nFigure 3. Attribution by defense and intelligence agencies (2005-2019).\n\nhighest number of intelligence and defense agency attributions of the countries examined. The second relates to organizational differences. In some countries, the boundaries between intelligence agencies, other defense agencies, and law enforcement agencies is blurred. For example, cases in which the FBI was the only attributing agency are included in the data but excluded from the analysis. The U.S. cases allow for better distinguishing between the various agencies. Even with, for example, the NSA and Cyber Command being under the same roof and command, I was able to focus on cases that were attributed by the U.S. IC as a whole.\n\n# FEATURES OF INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE IN PUBLIC ATTRIBUTIONS\n\nExamination of the available evidence suggested three features of intelligence agencies that make them effective in public attributions: ability to signal below escalation threshold, reputation for credibility and nonpartisanship, and partnership existence—domestic and international. I then used two of the recent best-documented cyber operations—the SolarWinds and the DNC intrusions—as illustrative case studies in order to trace and examine the use of intelligence agencies for public attribution of offensive cyber operations.\n\n# Signal Beneath the Escalation Threshold\n\nThe nonescalatory nature of offensive cyber operations has been widely discussed in the past few years.[33] Despite the preliminary expectations that offensive cyber operations would lead to cyber war—such as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warning against the possibility of a “cyber-Pearl Harbor”—real-world events so far proved differently. The literature that followed showed that these kinds of operations did not lead to escalation\n\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 0, NUMBER 0\n\nof war, and scholars offer to see offensive cyber operations as a conflict short of war.^{34}\n\nOne assumption in cybersecurity literature is that offensive cyber operations are usually not escalatory until they cross a certain threshold. Once crossed, the power dynamics change and the operations can escalate—in the cyberdomain and cross-domain as well.^{35} However, public accusations can have a declarative-escalatory effect.^{36} States may choose not to publicly attribute an attack when attribution could cause undesirable escalation “outside the agreed competition space,” and that could publicly endanger rules or legal regimes outside the cyberdomain.^{37} This is based on the perception that defensive and offensive cyber activities are hard to distinguish, and that a defensive cyber action might be misinterpreted by the adversary as a preparation for attack.^{38}\n\nPublic attribution by senior officials has great political and geostrategical impact but also carries higher escalatory consequences and risks. Therefore, a target country wishing to respond to offensive cyber operations in the public arena and signal its adversary without risking escalation might use its intelligence agencies as the “first line” of public attribution, rather than a more declarative authority. This allows sending a clear message to the rival while staying below a threshold for undesirable escalation. While countries can opt to share information privately, including through direct channels between intelligence agencies such as the Five Eyes alliance, public attribution serves as a political and policy signal; privately conveying information does not.\n\n### Reputation for Credibility and Nonpartisanship\n\nPublic attribution plays a visible role in U.S. cyber strategy.^{39} Therefore, the way politicians communicate attribution findings to their various audiences—rival, domestic, and international—has critical bearing on how the message is received. However, this presents a challenge. High-level official attributions may carry a risk of escalation or other costs as mentioned, while nonofficial paths may not be perceived as credible. For the attribution to achieve maximum impact with minimum risk effectively, it should be highly credible, but also apolitical. Intelligence agencies often afford the best of both because they historically carry both reputations.\n\nFor example, according to the University of Texas at Austin's 2020 survey, a majority of Americans (64%) believe that the IC plays a vital role in protecting the nation. This popular support has proven consistent, bipartisan, and notably resilient over a four-year span marked by hostility and even “unprecedented assault” on American intelligence during the Trump presidency. Despite this tension, polling consistently confirmed a “durable reservoir of public confidence” in U.S. intelligence agencies.^{40} So, when\n\nintelligence agencies are making the public attribution, it is more likely that both the general public and the accused party perceive it as credible and reliable as an official statement, but not indicative of a policy shift or response.\n\n### Partnership Existence: International and Domestic\n\nThe importance of working with international allies and partners is highlighted throughout the U.S. cyber strategies. The 2023 Department of Defense (DoD) cyber strategy stated,“Our global Allies and partners represent a foundational strategic advantage for the United States. We will build the capacity and capability of U.S. Allies and partners in cyberspace and expand avenues of potential cyber cooperation. We will continue hunt forward operations and other bilateral technical collaboration, working with Allies and partners to illuminate malicious cyber activity on their networks.41”\n\nIn this context, the credibility of the U.S. intelligence agencies can also strengthen the credibility of the entire public attribution process in the eyes of its international partners and allies. This, in turn, can contribute to enhancing its international collaborations and helps the U.S. position itself as a world leader and authority in this field. One visible result is the joint public attributions that the United States and its allies have been doing in the past few years. A recent and salient example is the joint attribution by the European Union and United States of the hacking of ViaSat to Russia on the first day of the war in Ukraine.42\n\nThe U.S. government also has strong ties to the private sector in many fields. When it comes to the cyberdomain, the private sector often holds much more information than the government and intelligence agencies can without encroaching on citizens' privacy. This makes cooperation with private cybersecurity companies crucial in maintaining the health of the overall U.S. system, both public and private.43 One significant development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 DoD cyber strategy notes that private-sector parties (e.g. private cybersecurity firms) reporting on attribution “can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place,” and states that the DoD “will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution.”44 The importance of these companies is hard to overstate; they were the first to identify and reveal both the SolarWinds and DNC intrusions, discussed below.\n\nILLUSTRATIVE CASE STUDIES: THE SOLARWINDS AND THE DNC OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nIllustrative case studies (or plausibility probes) are used to shed light on a broader theoretical argument, especially for emerging or previously unstudied phenomena. They are brief by design, aiming “to give the reader a ‘feel' for a theoretical argument by providing a concrete example of its application, or to demonstrate the empirical relevance of a theoretical proposition by identifying at least one relevant case.”45 They serve as an exploratory step between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. With this in mind, the case studies below illustrate that the subject is ripe for research.\n\n### The SolarWinds Intrusion (2020)\n\nIn December 2020, the private cybersecurity company FireEye revealed an ongoing large-scale cyber operation, in which a rival country—believed to be Russia—gained access to multiple U.S. government agencies' networks. These included the Pentagon, the departments of Commerce, State, Treasury and Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Agency, as well as over 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, and many others.46\n\nSecurity researchers estimated that, starting in March 2020, and possibly earlier, Russian state-sponsored hackers gained access to the periodic update of SolarWinds' Orion IT-monitoring software, widely used by government and security agencies, leading private companies, and critical infrastructures. Orion is an IT performance monitoring system that has privileged access to IT systems to obtain log and system performance data.47 Consequently, anyone updating the software in fact granted the attackers potential access to their systems. Chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner, described the SolarWinds attack as “one of the most sophisticated and deep hacks we've faced.”48 The extent of the breach raised concerns that attackers could eventually use their access to harm American systems, disrupt or destroy information, and disable critical-system commands—although none of these are known to have happened to date. 49\n\nFormer Homeland Security advisor for the Trump administration, Thomas Bossert, described the intrusion as follows: “The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate. [...] The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months.”50 As the scale of the intrusion became clearer, there was no doubt the American government had failed to convince Russia there would be consequences to such broad hacking of federal government and corporate networks.51\n\nIn the SolarWinds case, FireEye identified a sophisticated nation-state hack into its own systems. The initial report was followed by extensive media coverage. Analysts quoted in the New York Times criticized the U.S. government for remaining silent on the attack: “It was hard to know which was worse: that the federal government was blindsided again by Russian intelligence agencies, or that when it was evident what was happening, White House officials said nothing.”52\n\nIn January 2021, the FBI, DNI, NSA, and CISA publicly attributed the attack to Russia.53 It was not until April 2021—four months after the attack was detected and first revealed—that the White House publicly attributed the attack to the Russian government. The Biden administration published an Executive Order denouncing the harmful foreign activities of the Russian government and unmasking Russian agencies and companies that aided the Kremlin's hacking efforts: “Today the United States is formally naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures. The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR.54”\n\nIn this case, the intelligence agencies made the public attribution before the president, despite public criticism. This served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation in the bilateral and international arena. This kind of escalation with Russia might have had an undesirable effect for President Biden's administration during his first days in office. At the same time, it preserved the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization during a sensitive time—mere days after the Trump--Biden transition.\n\nThe credibility of intelligence agencies in public attribution also served the United States in bolstering its relations with Europe and the international community. The White House announced that it was providing training to foreign ministry lawyers and policymakers on legal standards of state behavior in cyberspace and peacetime norms. At the same time, the United States also announced first-of-its-kind international training and assistance on policy and technical aspects of attribution, to take place through the Marshall Center in Germany and support policymakers in Europe and worldwide.55\n\n### The DNC Intrusion (2016)\n\nIn April 2016, the FBI informed the DNC that an unauthorized figure had obtained extensive permissions for the DNC computer network and that the DNC was “under serious cyberattack.”56 The DNC, the governing body of\n\nthe Democratic Party, was struck at a particularly sensitive time, several months ahead of the U.S. elections, and amid the campaign for the party's presidential nominee. The FBI was already monitoring suspicious activity in the network, and as early as September 2015 had warned the DNC that its network had been hacked by a Russian group dubbed “The Dukes.” The FBI already knew this group well, after detecting its attempts to break into the White House, State Department, and Joint Chief of Staff's email systems in previous years.57\n\nAt the end of April 2016, the DNC hired the services of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to address the attack.58 After a month of investigation, CrowdStrike attributed the intrusion to Russia, based on various technical clues, such as matching the attack times to working hours in the Moscow time zone.59 The campaign of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton grappled with considerable political fallout from the intrusion, including trying to refute the vast amounts of information published. The attack and resulting affair arguably influenced American public opinion during election season later that year.60\n\nThe first public attribution was made in June 2016 by CrowdStrike. In this case, experts called President Barak Obama and the government to attribute the attack publicly. For example, in July 2016, the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group issued a statement calling on President Obama to “ensure that the attacks are attributed and take prompt actions sufficient to hold those responsible accountable and deter foreign actors from pursuing such tactics in the future.”61\n\nIn October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement on behalf of the IC, explicitly attributing the attack to Russia and describing it as a direct order from the Russian government:“The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions. [...] We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.62”\n\nAt a press conference later that month, the White House spokesperson attributed the breach to the Russian government, adding that Russia's goals included attempts to undermine the stability of the U.S. political system.63 Only in his last days in office, in December 2016, did President Obama say in an interview that the “DNC hack traced to ‘highest levels' of the Kremlin.” President Obama said he similarly told Putin personally to “cut it out” in September but he refrained from public retaliation before the November election because it would “immediately be seen through a partisan lens.”64\n\nThe public disclosure of Russia's attempts to disrupt democratic elections and by extension international order drew the attention of other countries, who watched the United States closely to learn how it was dealing with attempted Russian cyber intrusions and cyber-enabled influence operations. The United States became the focus of interest of other democracies, such as France and Germany, which were headed toward elections and feared Russian intervention.65 The United States even provided intelligence and technical assistance. For example, the NSA warned France that Russian hackers were planning to disrupt its electoral process. This allowed a French counteraction, which included planting fake information for the hackers and ultimately minimized Russia's actual influence on the election process. With considerable experience confronting Russian cyber intrusions, the United States positioned itself as an international role model in dealing with ongoing Russian intrusions and influence attempts.66\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe SolarWinds and DNC intrusions illustrate the dynamic of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, in particular in the ongoing cyber conflict between the United States and Russia. The overall credibility U.S. intelligence agencies enjoy lent greater weight to their public attributions in the eyes of both domestic and international audiences. This enhanced the standing of the United States as an experienced cyberspace actor and allowed it to position itself as a leader in the international cybersecurity arena, further strengthening its partnerships and alliances.\n\nIn both cases, public attribution by U.S. intelligence agencies occurred in the timeframe between the technical attribution made by private cybersecurity companies and the political attribution ultimately made by the U.S. president, despite public criticism. This appears to have served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation. At the same time, it allowed the United States to preserve the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization on the domestic front.\n\nThis phenomenon is occurring in the context of a larger change in the role of intelligence agencies that is facilitated and forced by the rapid advance in cyber technologies and AI. These technologies have affected these agencies' missions, from intelligence gathering to actively carrying out defensive and offensive cyber operations. Offensive cyber operations are increasing in numbers and scales, becoming an integral component of global conflict, diplomacy, and politics. Intelligence agencies are now being asked to take the public stage—often before, or altogether instead of, the country's senior officials.\n\nThis study is meant to stimulate exploration and scholarship about the factors at play when intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public\n\nGIL BARAM\n\nattribution. Several avenues were presented. At the broadest, \"macroscale\" level there may be high variation between states on what entity communicates attribution publicly. If so, there may be common characteristics that make some entities better than others for specific signaling purposes. For example, when intelligence agencies are doing the public attribution, as happened in both cases presented here, they can convey a message to the private sector that it plays a vital role in this process and that the information received from these companies is indeed used for national security needs. One hypothesis worth future research is that this signal has a positive effect, increasing private companies' engagement and willingness to share information with the government in the future.\n\nSimilarly, intelligence agencies' perception of the threat that rivals in cyberspace pose, and how this affects their analyses and messaging, might be examined. In its 2021 Annual Threats Assessment, the ODNI estimated,\n\nCyber threats from nation states and their surrogates will remain acute. Foreign states use cyber operations to steal information, influence populations, and damage industry, including physical and digital critical infrastructure. Although an increasing number of countries and non-state actors have these capabilities, we remain most concerned about Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.[67]\n\nThe two cases presented here involved Russia. However, in other cases, like the breach into the Office of Personal Management and Sony hack (both in 2014) involving China and North Korea, respectively, there had been no public attribution by intelligence agencies. Was there something different about the threats China and North Korea posed that led to different attribution methods?\n\nFuture research may answer these and other questions, such as uncovering variables that correlate to use of intelligence agencies in public attributions. Possible candidates might include the target type, adversarial regime type, and more. Examining the reverse instances of this study—cases without attribution by intelligence agencies—might shed light on the question of when states might be likely to use—or not—their intelligence agencies as the front line of official public attribution.\n\nWith offensive cyber operations constantly on the rise and stakes for governments increasingly higher, intelligence agencies appear to be playing an increasingly important role in the process of public attribution. Distinguishing between various attribution strategies and intelligence agencies' roles within them can provide a deeper understanding of how states perceive the context of a particular offensive cyber operation, and highlight the dynamics, trade-offs, and functions policymakers face when deciding on the path for public attribution and its possible outcomes.\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\n\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\n17\n\n# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author thanks Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance and Herb Lin, Jon Lindsay, Jelena Vičić, Amy Zegart, and the social sciences reading group at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of this article.\n\n# DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\n# REFERENCES\n\n1. \"SolarWinds Hack Was 'Largest and Most Sophisticated Attack' Ever: Microsoft President,\" Reuters, 14 February 2021, https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2AF03Q/\n2.

This raises the question: Is there a role for intelligence agencies—which traditionally work behind the scenes—in public attribution of offensive cyber operations? If so, what are the features that make these agencies useful in such public announcements? To answer these two questions, this article examines the emerging phenomenon of U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributing offensive cyber operations and identifies three features that make these agencies effective in public attribution: they send signals below the adversary's escalation threshold, offer credibility and nonpartisanship, and have partnerships that enable them to succeed in the attribution process. The SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee intrusions are used as illustrative case studies to examine this phenomenon. This research highlights\n\nGil Baram is a Senior Lecturer at Bar Ilan University and a nonresident Research Scholar at the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity and Berkeley Risk and Security Lab, University of California, Berkeley.

This offensive cyber operation utilized the American information technology (IT) company SolarWinds' regular software update, which had been infected with malicious code. More than 18,000 of SolarWinds' clients were estimated to be affected, among them many U.S. governmental agencies, including parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and more. So were private companies, like Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Deloitte, and other organizations. Microsoft president Brad Smith called it “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.”\n\nFireEye made the first attribution to a “highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.” Two weeks later, in January 2021, several U.S. intelligence agencies—the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA)—with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), publicly attributed the operation to “a Russian actor.” However, it was not until April 2021 that the Biden administration explicitly named the perpetrator as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\n\nThe fact that the country's intelligence agencies were the ones making the first official public attribution, several months before the president did so, highlights a puzzle: Intelligence agencies traditionally work behind the scenes, and unlike politicians and private cybersecurity companies, may have less incentive to publicize their activity, as this might endanger their sources and methods of operation. Furthermore, in some cases, offensive cyber operations can be kept covert and underreported so that countries do not concede they were cyberattacked. In view of these two factors, intelligence agencies seem unlikely to be the agents of publicity and public attribution. However, two cases in the United States suggested this might be otherwise.\n\nThis leads to a research question: Once intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public attribution, what are the features that make them effective at doing so? I argue that public attribution by intelligence agencies is an emerging phenomenon that deserves deeper examination, regarding two issues in particular. The first is the fact that this is indeed occurring, and therefore should be explored as another attribution path. The second issue warranting study regards the features of intelligence agencies that make their"

With governments consistently under cyberattacks and the global scope of offensive cyber operations rising, recognizing and understanding the public role of intelligence agencies is vital.\n\nThe first part of the article surveys the main literature addressing the changing role of intelligence agencies in the current information age, outlines the common possible attribution paths, and highlights one that has so far received little theoretical and empirical attention—public attribution by intelligence agencies. The second part presents the empirical data regarding public attribution by intelligence agencies and shows that this is a global phenomenon, although the United States is the leading country doing so. After empirically establishing attribution by intelligence agencies as a more common phenomenon than might be expected, the article turns to the third part to ask what features of the intelligence agencies make them effective in doing public attributions. Three features are discussed: (1) they can send a credible signal beneath the escalation threshold, (2) they are perceived as professional and “a-political,” (3) their connections with the private sector and international partners. In the fourth part, I use the SolarWinds (2020) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC; 2016) intrusions as illustrative case studies intended to give the reader an initial sense of the way these functions work. The fifth and final part discusses the conclusions of this research, its policy-relevant implications, and offers avenues for future research.\n\n## INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE\n\nWhen approaching the role of intelligence agencies in public attribution of offensive cyber operations, one must first consider the way their role at large is affected by rapid technological changes. Over the past decade, intelligence work has undergone a tremendous change, and today it is not only intelligence gathering and covert actions but also carrying out offensive and defensive cyber operations. The new function and scale are both enabled by advanced cyber technologies that allow obtaining and analyzing information in ways and scopes that did not exist in the past. This is further amplified by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, used to “amplify the effectiveness of our workforce ... advance mission capability and enhance the IC's [Intelligence Community's] ability to provide data interpretation to decision makers.” This change in scope and scale offers both opportunities and challenges, and requires intelligence agencies to adapt and change: “[T]he Intelligence Community faces a moment of reckoning. If the IC cannot adopt AI and other emerging technologies successfully, it risks failure.” This challenge should be kept in mind when discussing public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies."

Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself.”11 While literature is offering new perspectives on the changes in intelligence agencies' work, it mostly continues to perceive their role as covert and silent.12 However, cyber technologies enable intelligence agencies to operate on much larger scales than in the past, which may conflict with the traditional secrecy of intelligence operations; the larger the scale, the higher the risk of exposure might be.13 This article explores circumstances in which intelligence agencies abandon secrecy and thus take their place on stage.\n\n## Public attribution of offensive cyber operations\n\nGovernments and private firms that suffered a cyberattack have incentives for keeping cyber intrusions secret, “Lest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment.”14 In certain cases, target states may be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of these operations, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.15 There is no pride involved in being a victim, and target states might opt for silence so as not to “admit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned.”16\n\nAttribution of offensive cyber operations has been studied from several different perspectives. These include the attribution problem and its meanings, the uniqueness of attribution in cyberspace compared to other domains, the different attribution pathways, and the various calculations decisionmakers should take into account when deciding on attribution.17 Additional scholarship has highlighted the challenge in identifying and attributing the source of an attack, the meaning of anonymity, and the difficulties this poses to the defender when deciding how to react.18\n\nIntelligence agencies face a dilemma regarding the amount and nature of information required for reaching public attribution: Should this information relate to an individual, or the state? How much evidence is required to reveal and what might be the implication for this publicity? Public attribution by a government requires intelligence agencies to provide the relevant technical and operational information. However, when it comes to public attribution they are often hesitant to disclose this because of the potential damage to their intelligence methods, sources, and access to vital assets.19"

This includes establishing the technical facts of the intrusion and checking the attacker's techniques against those of previously identified actors. Every attribution of an offensive cyber operation begins with a technical and forensic investigation based on known data and information and indicators—such as technical identifiers and pieces of code—in order to understand the scale of the offensive cyber operation, the severity of the damage, the goal of the adversary, and so on. The objective of this investigation is to ensure the safety of the affected networks and computer systems.^{20}\n\nThe second stage is a strategic process, which is more forward-looking; deciding what should be communicated, by whom, and how. In this part, the target state determines what it wants to do with the findings of this forensic investigation, in keeping with its broader strategic goals and political considerations. In this stage, states can decide how they wish to communicate the attribution findings to other audiences in order to influence the interpretation of a particular incident.^{21} This stage is mainly driven by a state's policy considerations, and it can communicate its findings using one or more of five general attribution paths, separately or in concert^{22}: Technical: providing technical--forensic information that will help other entities patch their vulnerabilities and protect themselves. This kind of attribution can be done by the private sector, NGOs, or state agencies. In the U.S. context, this is done mainly by CISA and the FBI.^{23} Criminal: criminal proceedings against individuals. If a malicious cyber incident is regarded as a matter for domestic law enforcement authorities, then legal requirements for process, standards of evidence, and degrees of certainty about attribution apply^{24}; Political, Unofficial: by talking to the press under terms of anonymity; Political, Official: public attribution by state political officials, such as the president, secretary of state, secretary of homeland security and others; and Multicountry collaboration: public attribution by a number of countries together. This kind of attribution requires trust between the participating states as it requires each state to share at least some of its information and intelligence.^{25}\n\nIn recent years, there have been cases in which the intelligence agencies were the ones doing the public attribution, potentially signaling a new official attribution path. In the next paragraphs, I will examine where this occurs along the national decisionmaking process, and discuss the data and identify the possible reasons they are doing so in the U.S. case.\n\nTo illustrate this decisionmaking process, we can look at the U.S.-specific decision tree in Figure 1.

The point of departure is that an offensive cyber operation has taken place and has been detected by the defender, and the analytical attribution process has been done. Now, decisionmakers face the question whether to reveal the identity of the attacker or not. If not, there are two options: First, maintain silence. Second, provide information to private security companies so they will do the attribution.\n\nIf the decision is to reveal the identity of the attacker, once again there are two options. The first of these is nonofficial attribution, which can be publicizing the information in anonymous ways—such as talking to the press under terms of anonymity, off-record briefing, or leaking. The second is official attribution by the U.S. government. Official response can be done by the White House or Executive Office of the President; other Cabinet departments, such as the Department of Defence, Department of Justice, or Department of Homeland Security; or by intelligence agencies.

This part serves as the basis for the qualitative examination through the illustrative case studies that follow. The following paragraphs and figures present the data on publicity of offensive cyber operations in general and specific data regarding the different entities revealing them, and the role of intelligence agencies within this. These show that public attribution by intelligence agencies is indeed an empirical phenomenon.\n\nHere it is important to address the so-called unknown unknowns or unobserved offensive cyber operations.27 These are offensive cyber operations assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources used for this research. For the purposes of this article, only offensive cyber operations that have been publicly revealed and for which there exists sufficient data to code in the dataset have been included. The presumed existence of unknown unknowns should not preclude scholars from researching these issues, which are changing the landscape of cyberwarfare politics.28\n\n### Data Compilation\n\nData compilation included three preexisting datasets, plus additional sources. The first is the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset Version 1.1,29 which provides data on the presence of cyber conflict in the existing conflicts between 2001 and 2014. To this was added new data on cyberattacks and intrusions for the years 1996 to 2019 based on the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations tracker.30 Finally, the relevant data for the years prior to 2001 were added, based on the National Security Archive Cyber Vault Project.31 All data were verified, then recoded using a new schema of variables and scaling.\n\nThe compilation and updating process also relied on reports in media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. This allowed supplementing the existing data with any new information that had come to light since the incident, and was published via mainstream media, threat intelligence reports, cybersecurity magazines, or cybersecurity companies. For verification purposes, each incident included in the dataset has at least two reliable sources and was examined by two independent coders. The dataset was finalized in June 2019 and includes 476 cyber incidents. All data was collected from open sources.\n\n### Entity Exposing the Attacker\n\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the actors that revealed the offensive cyber operation public attribution for the years 2005 to 2019.

The second relates to organizational differences. In some countries, the boundaries between intelligence agencies, other defense agencies, and law enforcement agencies is blurred. For example, cases in which the FBI was the only attributing agency are included in the data but excluded from the analysis. The U.S. cases allow for better distinguishing between the various agencies. Even with, for example, the NSA and Cyber Command being under the same roof and command, I was able to focus on cases that were attributed by the U.S. IC as a whole.\n\n# FEATURES OF INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE IN PUBLIC ATTRIBUTIONS\n\nExamination of the available evidence suggested three features of intelligence agencies that make them effective in public attributions: ability to signal below escalation threshold, reputation for credibility and nonpartisanship, and partnership existence—domestic and international. I then used two of the recent best-documented cyber operations—the SolarWinds and the DNC intrusions—as illustrative case studies in order to trace and examine the use of intelligence agencies for public attribution of offensive cyber operations.\n\n# Signal Beneath the Escalation Threshold\n\nThe nonescalatory nature of offensive cyber operations has been widely discussed in the past few years.[33] Despite the preliminary expectations that offensive cyber operations would lead to cyber war—such as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warning against the possibility of a “cyber-Pearl Harbor”—real-world events so far proved differently.

Once crossed, the power dynamics change and the operations can escalate—in the cyberdomain and cross-domain as well.^{35} However, public accusations can have a declarative-escalatory effect.^{36} States may choose not to publicly attribute an attack when attribution could cause undesirable escalation “outside the agreed competition space,” and that could publicly endanger rules or legal regimes outside the cyberdomain.^{37} This is based on the perception that defensive and offensive cyber activities are hard to distinguish, and that a defensive cyber action might be misinterpreted by the adversary as a preparation for attack.^{38}\n\nPublic attribution by senior officials has great political and geostrategical impact but also carries higher escalatory consequences and risks. Therefore, a target country wishing to respond to offensive cyber operations in the public arena and signal its adversary without risking escalation might use its intelligence agencies as the “first line” of public attribution, rather than a more declarative authority. This allows sending a clear message to the rival while staying below a threshold for undesirable escalation. While countries can opt to share information privately, including through direct channels between intelligence agencies such as the Five Eyes alliance, public attribution serves as a political and policy signal; privately conveying information does not.\n\n### Reputation for Credibility and Nonpartisanship\n\nPublic attribution plays a visible role in U.S. cyber strategy.^{39} Therefore, the way politicians communicate attribution findings to their various audiences—rival, domestic, and international—has critical bearing on how the message is received. However, this presents a challenge. High-level official attributions may carry a risk of escalation or other costs as mentioned, while nonofficial paths may not be perceived as credible. For the attribution to achieve maximum impact with minimum risk effectively, it should be highly credible, but also apolitical. Intelligence agencies often afford the best of both because they historically carry both reputations.\n\nFor example, according to the University of Texas at Austin's 2020 survey, a majority of Americans (64%) believe that the IC plays a vital role in protecting the nation. This popular support has proven consistent, bipartisan, and notably resilient over a four-year span marked by hostility and even “unprecedented assault” on American intelligence during the Trump presidency. Despite this tension, polling consistently confirmed a “durable reservoir of public confidence” in U.S. intelligence agencies.^{40} So, when"

The 2023 Department of Defense (DoD) cyber strategy stated,“Our global Allies and partners represent a foundational strategic advantage for the United States. We will build the capacity and capability of U.S. Allies and partners in cyberspace and expand avenues of potential cyber cooperation. We will continue hunt forward operations and other bilateral technical collaboration, working with Allies and partners to illuminate malicious cyber activity on their networks.41”\n\nIn this context, the credibility of the U.S. intelligence agencies can also strengthen the credibility of the entire public attribution process in the eyes of its international partners and allies. This, in turn, can contribute to enhancing its international collaborations and helps the U.S. position itself as a world leader and authority in this field. One visible result is the joint public attributions that the United States and its allies have been doing in the past few years. A recent and salient example is the joint attribution by the European Union and United States of the hacking of ViaSat to Russia on the first day of the war in Ukraine.42\n\nThe U.S. government also has strong ties to the private sector in many fields. When it comes to the cyberdomain, the private sector often holds much more information than the government and intelligence agencies can without encroaching on citizens' privacy. This makes cooperation with private cybersecurity companies crucial in maintaining the health of the overall U.S. system, both public and private.43 One significant development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 DoD cyber strategy notes that private-sector parties (e.g. private cybersecurity firms) reporting on attribution “can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place,” and states that the DoD “will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution.”44 The importance of these companies is hard to overstate; they were the first to identify and reveal both the SolarWinds and DNC intrusions, discussed below."

They are brief by design, aiming “to give the reader a ‘feel' for a theoretical argument by providing a concrete example of its application, or to demonstrate the empirical relevance of a theoretical proposition by identifying at least one relevant case.”45 They serve as an exploratory step between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. With this in mind, the case studies below illustrate that the subject is ripe for research.\n\n### The SolarWinds Intrusion (2020)\n\nIn December 2020, the private cybersecurity company FireEye revealed an ongoing large-scale cyber operation, in which a rival country—believed to be Russia—gained access to multiple U.S. government agencies' networks. These included the Pentagon, the departments of Commerce, State, Treasury and Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Agency, as well as over 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, and many others.46\n\nSecurity researchers estimated that, starting in March 2020, and possibly earlier, Russian state-sponsored hackers gained access to the periodic update of SolarWinds' Orion IT-monitoring software, widely used by government and security agencies, leading private companies, and critical infrastructures. Orion is an IT performance monitoring system that has privileged access to IT systems to obtain log and system performance data.47 Consequently, anyone updating the software in fact granted the attackers potential access to their systems. Chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner, described the SolarWinds attack as “one of the most sophisticated and deep hacks we've faced.”48 The extent of the breach raised concerns that attackers could eventually use their access to harm American systems, disrupt or destroy information, and disable critical-system commands—although none of these are known to have happened to date. 49\n\nFormer Homeland Security advisor for the Trump administration, Thomas Bossert, described the intrusion as follows: “The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate. [...] The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months.”50 As the scale of the intrusion became clearer, there was no doubt the American government had failed to convince Russia there would be consequences to such broad hacking of federal government and corporate networks.51"

Analysts quoted in the New York Times criticized the U.S. government for remaining silent on the attack: “It was hard to know which was worse: that the federal government was blindsided again by Russian intelligence agencies, or that when it was evident what was happening, White House officials said nothing.”52\n\nIn January 2021, the FBI, DNI, NSA, and CISA publicly attributed the attack to Russia.53 It was not until April 2021—four months after the attack was detected and first revealed—that the White House publicly attributed the attack to the Russian government. The Biden administration published an Executive Order denouncing the harmful foreign activities of the Russian government and unmasking Russian agencies and companies that aided the Kremlin's hacking efforts: “Today the United States is formally naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures. The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR.54”\n\nIn this case, the intelligence agencies made the public attribution before the president, despite public criticism. This served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation in the bilateral and international arena. This kind of escalation with Russia might have had an undesirable effect for President Biden's administration during his first days in office. At the same time, it preserved the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization during a sensitive time—mere days after the Trump--Biden transition.\n\nThe credibility of intelligence agencies in public attribution also served the United States in bolstering its relations with Europe and the international community. The White House announced that it was providing training to foreign ministry lawyers and policymakers on legal standards of state behavior in cyberspace and peacetime norms. At the same time, the United States also announced first-of-its-kind international training and assistance on policy and technical aspects of attribution, to take place through the Marshall Center in Germany and support policymakers in Europe and worldwide.55\n\n### The DNC Intrusion (2016)\n\nIn April 2016, the FBI informed the DNC that an unauthorized figure had obtained extensive permissions for the DNC computer network and that the DNC was “under serious cyberattack.”56 The DNC, the governing body of"

The FBI was already monitoring suspicious activity in the network, and as early as September 2015 had warned the DNC that its network had been hacked by a Russian group dubbed “The Dukes.” The FBI already knew this group well, after detecting its attempts to break into the White House, State Department, and Joint Chief of Staff's email systems in previous years.57\n\nAt the end of April 2016, the DNC hired the services of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to address the attack.58 After a month of investigation, CrowdStrike attributed the intrusion to Russia, based on various technical clues, such as matching the attack times to working hours in the Moscow time zone.59 The campaign of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton grappled with considerable political fallout from the intrusion, including trying to refute the vast amounts of information published. The attack and resulting affair arguably influenced American public opinion during election season later that year.60\n\nThe first public attribution was made in June 2016 by CrowdStrike. In this case, experts called President Barak Obama and the government to attribute the attack publicly. For example, in July 2016, the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group issued a statement calling on President Obama to “ensure that the attacks are attributed and take prompt actions sufficient to hold those responsible accountable and deter foreign actors from pursuing such tactics in the future.”61\n\nIn October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement on behalf of the IC, explicitly attributing the attack to Russia and describing it as a direct order from the Russian government:“The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions. [...] We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.62”\n\nAt a press conference later that month, the White House spokesperson attributed the breach to the Russian government, adding that Russia's goals included attempts to undermine the stability of the U.S. political system.63 Only in his last days in office, in December 2016, did President Obama say in an interview that the “DNC hack traced to ‘highest levels' of the Kremlin.” President Obama said he similarly told Putin personally to “cut it out” in September but he refrained from public retaliation before the November election because it would “immediately be seen through a partisan lens.”64"

The United States became the focus of interest of other democracies, such as France and Germany, which were headed toward elections and feared Russian intervention.65 The United States even provided intelligence and technical assistance. For example, the NSA warned France that Russian hackers were planning to disrupt its electoral process. This allowed a French counteraction, which included planting fake information for the hackers and ultimately minimized Russia's actual influence on the election process. With considerable experience confronting Russian cyber intrusions, the United States positioned itself as an international role model in dealing with ongoing Russian intrusions and influence attempts.66\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe SolarWinds and DNC intrusions illustrate the dynamic of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, in particular in the ongoing cyber conflict between the United States and Russia. The overall credibility U.S. intelligence agencies enjoy lent greater weight to their public attributions in the eyes of both domestic and international audiences. This enhanced the standing of the United States as an experienced cyberspace actor and allowed it to position itself as a leader in the international cybersecurity arena, further strengthening its partnerships and alliances.\n\nIn both cases, public attribution by U.S. intelligence agencies occurred in the timeframe between the technical attribution made by private cybersecurity companies and the political attribution ultimately made by the U.S. president, despite public criticism. This appears to have served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation. At the same time, it allowed the United States to preserve the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization on the domestic front.\n\nThis phenomenon is occurring in the context of a larger change in the role of intelligence agencies that is facilitated and forced by the rapid advance in cyber technologies and AI. These technologies have affected these agencies' missions, from intelligence gathering to actively carrying out defensive and offensive cyber operations. Offensive cyber operations are increasing in numbers and scales, becoming an integral component of global conflict, diplomacy, and politics. Intelligence agencies are now being asked to take the public stage—often before, or altogether instead of, the country's senior officials.\n\nThis study is meant to stimulate exploration and scholarship about the factors at play when intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public"

At the broadest, \"macroscale\" level there may be high variation between states on what entity communicates attribution publicly. If so, there may be common characteristics that make some entities better than others for specific signaling purposes. For example, when intelligence agencies are doing the public attribution, as happened in both cases presented here, they can convey a message to the private sector that it plays a vital role in this process and that the information received from these companies is indeed used for national security needs. One hypothesis worth future research is that this signal has a positive effect, increasing private companies' engagement and willingness to share information with the government in the future.\n\nSimilarly, intelligence agencies' perception of the threat that rivals in cyberspace pose, and how this affects their analyses and messaging, might be examined. In its 2021 Annual Threats Assessment, the ODNI estimated,\n\nCyber threats from nation states and their surrogates will remain acute. Foreign states use cyber operations to steal information, influence populations, and damage industry, including physical and digital critical infrastructure. Although an increasing number of countries and non-state actors have these capabilities, we remain most concerned about Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.[67]\n\nThe two cases presented here involved Russia. However, in other cases, like the breach into the Office of Personal Management and Sony hack (both in 2014) involving China and North Korea, respectively, there had been no public attribution by intelligence agencies. Was there something different about the threats China and North Korea posed that led to different attribution methods?\n\nFuture research may answer these and other questions, such as uncovering variables that correlate to use of intelligence agencies in public attributions. Possible candidates might include the target type, adversarial regime type, and more. Examining the reverse instances of this study—cases without attribution by intelligence agencies—might shed light on the question of when states might be likely to use—or not—their intelligence agencies as the front line of official public attribution.\n\nWith offensive cyber operations constantly on the rise and stakes for governments increasingly higher, intelligence agencies appear to be playing an increasingly important role in the process of public attribution. Distinguishing between various attribution strategies and intelligence agencies' roles within them can provide a deeper understanding of how states perceive the context of a particular offensive cyber operation, and highlight the dynamics, trade-offs, and functions policymakers face when deciding on the path for public attribution and its possible outcomes.\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE"

This raises the question: Is there a role for intelligence agencies—which traditionally work behind the scenes—in public attribution of offensive cyber operations? If so, what are the features that make these agencies useful in such public announcements? To answer these two questions, this article examines the emerging phenomenon of U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributing offensive cyber operations and identifies three features that make these agencies effective in public attribution: they send signals below the adversary's escalation threshold, offer credibility and nonpartisanship, and have partnerships that enable them to succeed in the attribution process. The SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee intrusions are used as illustrative case studies to examine this phenomenon.

This offensive cyber operation utilized the American information technology (IT) company SolarWinds' regular software update, which had been infected with malicious code. More than 18,000 of SolarWinds' clients were estimated to be affected, among them many U.S. governmental agencies, including parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and more. So were private companies, like Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Deloitte, and other organizations. Microsoft president Brad Smith called it “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.”\nFireEye made the first attribution to a “highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.” Two weeks later, in January 2021, several U.S. intelligence agencies—the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA)—with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), publicly attributed the operation to “a Russian actor.” However, it was not until April 2021 that the Biden administration explicitly named the perpetrator as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\nThe fact that the country's intelligence agencies were the ones making the first official public attribution, several months before the president did so, highlights a puzzle: Intelligence agencies traditionally work behind the scenes, and unlike politicians and private cybersecurity companies, may have less incentive to publicize their activity, as this might endanger their sources and methods of operation. Furthermore, in some cases, offensive cyber operations can be kept covert and underreported so that countries do not concede they were cyberattacked. In view of these two factors, intelligence agencies seem unlikely to be the agents of publicity and public attribution. However, two cases in the United States suggested this might be otherwise.\nThis leads to a research question: Once intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public attribution, what are the features that make them effective at doing so? I argue that public attribution by intelligence agencies is an emerging phenomenon that deserves deeper examination, regarding two issues in particular. The first is the fact that this is indeed occurring, and therefore should be explored as another attribution path. The second issue warranting study regards the features of intelligence agencies that make their\npublic attribution effective. With governments consistently under cyberattacks and the global scope of offensive cyber operations rising, recognizing and understanding the public role of intelligence agencies is vital.\nThe first part of the article surveys the main literature addressing the changing role of intelligence agencies in the current information age, outlines the common possible attribution paths, and highlights one that has so far received little theoretical and empirical attention—public attribution by intelligence agencies. The second part presents the empirical data regarding public attribution by intelligence agencies and shows that this is a global phenomenon, although the United States is the leading country doing so. After empirically establishing attribution by intelligence agencies as a more common phenomenon than might be expected, the article turns to the third part to ask what features of the intelligence agencies make them effective in doing public attributions. Three features are discussed: (1) they can send a credible signal beneath the escalation threshold, (2) they are perceived as professional and “a-political,” (3) their connections with the private sector and international partners. In the fourth part, I use the SolarWinds (2020) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC; 2016) intrusions as illustrative case studies intended to give the reader an initial sense of the way these functions work. The fifth and final part discusses the conclusions of this research, its policy-relevant implications, and offers avenues for future research.\n## INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE\nWhen approaching the role of intelligence agencies in public attribution of offensive cyber operations, one must first consider the way their role at large is affected by rapid technological changes. Over the past decade, intelligence work has undergone a tremendous change, and today it is not only intelligence gathering and covert actions but also carrying out offensive and defensive cyber operations. The new function and scale are both enabled by advanced cyber technologies that allow obtaining and analyzing information in ways and scopes that did not exist in the past. This is further amplified by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, used to “amplify the effectiveness of our workforce ... advance mission capability and enhance the IC's [Intelligence Community's] ability to provide data interpretation to decision makers.” This change in scope and scale offers both opportunities and challenges, and requires intelligence agencies to adapt and change: “[T]he Intelligence Community faces a moment of reckoning. If the IC cannot adopt AI and other emerging technologies successfully, it risks failure.” This challenge should be kept in mind when discussing public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies.\nIntelligence agencies' work is usually being done “behind the scenes,” and when it comes to offensive cyber operations, secrecy was considered an inherent feature.10 General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency, noted that, in the beginning, “even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself.”11 While literature is offering new perspectives on the changes in intelligence agencies' work, it mostly continues to perceive their role as covert and silent.12 However, cyber technologies enable intelligence agencies to operate on much larger scales than in the past, which may conflict with the traditional secrecy of intelligence operations; the larger the scale, the higher the risk of exposure might be.13 This article explores circumstances in which intelligence agencies abandon secrecy and thus take their place on stage.\n## Public attribution of offensive cyber operations\nGovernments and private firms that suffered a cyberattack have incentives for keeping cyber intrusions secret, “Lest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment.”14 In certain cases, target states may be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of these operations, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.15 There is no pride involved in being a victim, and target states might opt for silence so as not to “admit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned.”16\nAttribution of offensive cyber operations has been studied from several different perspectives. These include the attribution problem and its meanings, the uniqueness of attribution in cyberspace compared to other domains, the different attribution pathways, and the various calculations decisionmakers should take into account when deciding on attribution.17 Additional scholarship has highlighted the challenge in identifying and attributing the source of an attack, the meaning of anonymity, and the difficulties this poses to the defender when deciding how to react.18\nIntelligence agencies face a dilemma regarding the amount and nature of information required for reaching public attribution: Should this information relate to an individual, or the state? How much evidence is required to reveal and what might be the implication for this publicity? Public attribution by a government requires intelligence agencies to provide the relevant technical and operational information. However, when it comes to public attribution they are often hesitant to disclose this because of the potential damage to their intelligence methods, sources, and access to vital assets.19\nThe attribution process by states consists of two main stages. The first is an analytic process—which is historical and backward-looking—identifying what happened and who did it. This includes establishing the technical facts of the intrusion and checking the attacker's techniques against those of previously identified actors. Every attribution of an offensive cyber operation begins with a technical and forensic investigation based on known data and information and indicators—such as technical identifiers and pieces of code—in order to understand the scale of the offensive cyber operation, the severity of the damage, the goal of the adversary, and so on. The objective of this investigation is to ensure the safety of the affected networks and computer systems.^{20}\nThe second stage is a strategic process, which is more forward-looking; deciding what should be communicated, by whom, and how. In this part, the target state determines what it wants to do with the findings of this forensic investigation, in keeping with its broader strategic goals and political considerations. In this stage, states can decide how they wish to communicate the attribution findings to other audiences in order to influence the interpretation of a particular incident.^{21} This stage is mainly driven by a state's policy considerations, and it can communicate its findings using one or more of five general attribution paths, separately or in concert^{22}: Technical: providing technical--forensic information that will help other entities patch their vulnerabilities and protect themselves. This kind of attribution can be done by the private sector, NGOs, or state agencies. In the U.S. context, this is done mainly by CISA and the FBI.^{23} Criminal: criminal proceedings against individuals. If a malicious cyber incident is regarded as a matter for domestic law enforcement authorities, then legal requirements for process, standards of evidence, and degrees of certainty about attribution apply^{24}; Political, Unofficial: by talking to the press under terms of anonymity; Political, Official: public attribution by state political officials, such as the president, secretary of state, secretary of homeland security and others; and Multicountry collaboration: public attribution by a number of countries together. This kind of attribution requires trust between the participating states as it requires each state to share at least some of its information and intelligence.^{25}\nIn recent years, there have been cases in which the intelligence agencies were the ones doing the public attribution, potentially signaling a new official attribution path. In the next paragraphs, I will examine where this occurs along the national decisionmaking process, and discuss the data and identify the possible reasons they are doing so in the U.S. case.\nTo illustrate this decisionmaking process, we can look at the U.S.-specific decision tree in Figure 1. This flowchart helps explain two main factors in the attribution process—the echelon of the organizational hierarchy that\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 1. Attribution decision-making process (U.S.-specific).\nperforms the attribution, and the specific function within this level. The point of departure is that an offensive cyber operation has taken place and has been detected by the defender, and the analytical attribution process has been done. Now, decisionmakers face the question whether to reveal the identity of the attacker or not. If not, there are two options: First, maintain silence. Second, provide information to private security companies so they will do the attribution.\nIf the decision is to reveal the identity of the attacker, once again there are two options. The first of these is nonofficial attribution, which can be publicizing the information in anonymous ways—such as talking to the press under terms of anonymity, off-record briefing, or leaking. The second is official attribution by the U.S. government. Official response can be done by the White House or Executive Office of the President; other Cabinet departments, such as the Department of Defence, Department of Justice, or Department of Homeland Security; or by intelligence agencies. The last is the focus of this study.\n# PUBLICITY AND OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE\nWhile targeted states might have clear incentives not to acknowledge having been attacked, they do not always have a choice. The magnitude of some cyber intrusions, in addition to related rumors and media reports, makes it difficult for states to avoid any public response altogether.[26] In order to examine the phenomenon of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, I took an empirical approach, examining offensive\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncyber operations to identify the agent of publicity in each case in order to map the relevant cases. This part serves as the basis for the qualitative examination through the illustrative case studies that follow. The following paragraphs and figures present the data on publicity of offensive cyber operations in general and specific data regarding the different entities revealing them, and the role of intelligence agencies within this. These show that public attribution by intelligence agencies is indeed an empirical phenomenon.\nHere it is important to address the so-called unknown unknowns or unobserved offensive cyber operations.27 These are offensive cyber operations assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources used for this research. For the purposes of this article, only offensive cyber operations that have been publicly revealed and for which there exists sufficient data to code in the dataset have been included. The presumed existence of unknown unknowns should not preclude scholars from researching these issues, which are changing the landscape of cyberwarfare politics.28\n### Data Compilation\nData compilation included three preexisting datasets, plus additional sources. The first is the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset Version 1.1,29 which provides data on the presence of cyber conflict in the existing conflicts between 2001 and 2014. To this was added new data on cyberattacks and intrusions for the years 1996 to 2019 based on the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations tracker.30 Finally, the relevant data for the years prior to 2001 were added, based on the National Security Archive Cyber Vault Project.31 All data were verified, then recoded using a new schema of variables and scaling.\nThe compilation and updating process also relied on reports in media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. This allowed supplementing the existing data with any new information that had come to light since the incident, and was published via mainstream media, threat intelligence reports, cybersecurity magazines, or cybersecurity companies. For verification purposes, each incident included in the dataset has at least two reliable sources and was examined by two independent coders. The dataset was finalized in June 2019 and includes 476 cyber incidents. All data was collected from open sources.\n### Entity Exposing the Attacker\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the actors that revealed the offensive cyber operation public attribution for the years 2005 to 2019. In half the cases, private cybersecurity companies were the ones to expose the attack.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Entity exposing the attacker (2005-2019).\nHowever, as illustrated below, intelligence and defense agencies revealed the attacker's identity in  $13\\%$  of the cases, doing so at higher rates than senior officials, who attributed offensive cyber operations in  $10\\%$  of the cases. This finding is particularly interesting given the general perception of intelligence organizations as secret agencies that do not disclose information to the public.\n# Global Phenomenon\nFigure 3 illustrates the data for public attribution by defense and intelligence agencies in different countries ( $N = 43$ ). While the United States clearly leads this practice, it is also being done in Germany, South Korea, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Examples of the agencies making public attributions include defense agencies such as CISA, Norway's Policy Security Service, the Polish Computer Emergency Response Team, the Security Service of Ukraine, and intelligence agencies such as the DNI, FBI, and NSA in the United States and Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV).[32] This research focuses on the United States only, for reasons discussed in the next section.\n# Focusing on the United States\nThis article focuses on the United States for two reasons. The first is that the United States is the dominant country for this path, meaning it had the\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nFigure 3. Attribution by defense and intelligence agencies (2005-2019).\nhighest number of intelligence and defense agency attributions of the countries examined. The second relates to organizational differences. In some countries, the boundaries between intelligence agencies, other defense agencies, and law enforcement agencies is blurred. For example, cases in which the FBI was the only attributing agency are included in the data but excluded from the analysis. The U.S. cases allow for better distinguishing between the various agencies. Even with, for example, the NSA and Cyber Command being under the same roof and command, I was able to focus on cases that were attributed by the U.S. IC as a whole.\n# FEATURES OF INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE IN PUBLIC ATTRIBUTIONS\nExamination of the available evidence suggested three features of intelligence agencies that make them effective in public attributions: ability to signal below escalation threshold, reputation for credibility and nonpartisanship, and partnership existence—domestic and international. I then used two of the recent best-documented cyber operations—the SolarWinds and the DNC intrusions—as illustrative case studies in order to trace and examine the use of intelligence agencies for public attribution of offensive cyber operations.\n# Signal Beneath the Escalation Threshold\nThe nonescalatory nature of offensive cyber operations has been widely discussed in the past few years.[33] Despite the preliminary expectations that offensive cyber operations would lead to cyber war—such as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warning against the possibility of a “cyber-Pearl Harbor”—real-world events so far proved differently. The literature that followed showed that these kinds of operations did not lead to escalation\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 0, NUMBER 0\nof war, and scholars offer to see offensive cyber operations as a conflict short of war.^{34}\nOne assumption in cybersecurity literature is that offensive cyber operations are usually not escalatory until they cross a certain threshold. Once crossed, the power dynamics change and the operations can escalate—in the cyberdomain and cross-domain as well.^{35} However, public accusations can have a declarative-escalatory effect.^{36} States may choose not to publicly attribute an attack when attribution could cause undesirable escalation “outside the agreed competition space,” and that could publicly endanger rules or legal regimes outside the cyberdomain.^{37} This is based on the perception that defensive and offensive cyber activities are hard to distinguish, and that a defensive cyber action might be misinterpreted by the adversary as a preparation for attack.^{38}\nPublic attribution by senior officials has great political and geostrategical impact but also carries higher escalatory consequences and risks. Therefore, a target country wishing to respond to offensive cyber operations in the public arena and signal its adversary without risking escalation might use its intelligence agencies as the “first line” of public attribution, rather than a more declarative authority. This allows sending a clear message to the rival while staying below a threshold for undesirable escalation. While countries can opt to share information privately, including through direct channels between intelligence agencies such as the Five Eyes alliance, public attribution serves as a political and policy signal; privately conveying information does not.\n### Reputation for Credibility and Nonpartisanship\nPublic attribution plays a visible role in U.S. cyber strategy.^{39} Therefore, the way politicians communicate attribution findings to their various audiences—rival, domestic, and international—has critical bearing on how the message is received. However, this presents a challenge. High-level official attributions may carry a risk of escalation or other costs as mentioned, while nonofficial paths may not be perceived as credible. For the attribution to achieve maximum impact with minimum risk effectively, it should be highly credible, but also apolitical. Intelligence agencies often afford the best of both because they historically carry both reputations.\nFor example, according to the University of Texas at Austin's 2020 survey, a majority of Americans (64%) believe that the IC plays a vital role in protecting the nation. This popular support has proven consistent, bipartisan, and notably resilient over a four-year span marked by hostility and even “unprecedented assault” on American intelligence during the Trump presidency. Despite this tension, polling consistently confirmed a “durable reservoir of public confidence” in U.S. intelligence agencies.^{40} So, when\nintelligence agencies are making the public attribution, it is more likely that both the general public and the accused party perceive it as credible and reliable as an official statement, but not indicative of a policy shift or response.\n### Partnership Existence: International and Domestic\nThe importance of working with international allies and partners is highlighted throughout the U.S. cyber strategies. The 2023 Department of Defense (DoD) cyber strategy stated,“Our global Allies and partners represent a foundational strategic advantage for the United States. We will build the capacity and capability of U.S. Allies and partners in cyberspace and expand avenues of potential cyber cooperation. We will continue hunt forward operations and other bilateral technical collaboration, working with Allies and partners to illuminate malicious cyber activity on their networks.41”\nIn this context, the credibility of the U.S. intelligence agencies can also strengthen the credibility of the entire public attribution process in the eyes of its international partners and allies. This, in turn, can contribute to enhancing its international collaborations and helps the U.S. position itself as a world leader and authority in this field. One visible result is the joint public attributions that the United States and its allies have been doing in the past few years. A recent and salient example is the joint attribution by the European Union and United States of the hacking of ViaSat to Russia on the first day of the war in Ukraine.42\nThe U.S. government also has strong ties to the private sector in many fields. When it comes to the cyberdomain, the private sector often holds much more information than the government and intelligence agencies can without encroaching on citizens' privacy. This makes cooperation with private cybersecurity companies crucial in maintaining the health of the overall U.S. system, both public and private.43 One significant development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 DoD cyber strategy notes that private-sector parties (e.g. private cybersecurity firms) reporting on attribution “can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place,” and states that the DoD “will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution.”44 The importance of these companies is hard to overstate; they were the first to identify and reveal both the SolarWinds and DNC intrusions, discussed below.\nILLUSTRATIVE CASE STUDIES: THE SOLARWINDS AND THE DNC OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nIllustrative case studies (or plausibility probes) are used to shed light on a broader theoretical argument, especially for emerging or previously unstudied phenomena. They are brief by design, aiming “to give the reader a ‘feel' for a theoretical argument by providing a concrete example of its application, or to demonstrate the empirical relevance of a theoretical proposition by identifying at least one relevant case.”45 They serve as an exploratory step between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. With this in mind, the case studies below illustrate that the subject is ripe for research.\n### The SolarWinds Intrusion (2020)\nIn December 2020, the private cybersecurity company FireEye revealed an ongoing large-scale cyber operation, in which a rival country—believed to be Russia—gained access to multiple U.S. government agencies' networks. These included the Pentagon, the departments of Commerce, State, Treasury and Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Agency, as well as over 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, and many others.46\nSecurity researchers estimated that, starting in March 2020, and possibly earlier, Russian state-sponsored hackers gained access to the periodic update of SolarWinds' Orion IT-monitoring software, widely used by government and security agencies, leading private companies, and critical infrastructures. Orion is an IT performance monitoring system that has privileged access to IT systems to obtain log and system performance data.47 Consequently, anyone updating the software in fact granted the attackers potential access to their systems. Chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner, described the SolarWinds attack as “one of the most sophisticated and deep hacks we've faced.”48 The extent of the breach raised concerns that attackers could eventually use their access to harm American systems, disrupt or destroy information, and disable critical-system commands—although none of these are known to have happened to date. 49\nFormer Homeland Security advisor for the Trump administration, Thomas Bossert, described the intrusion as follows: “The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate. [...] The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months.”50 As the scale of the intrusion became clearer, there was no doubt the American government had failed to convince Russia there would be consequences to such broad hacking of federal government and corporate networks.51\nIn the SolarWinds case, FireEye identified a sophisticated nation-state hack into its own systems. The initial report was followed by extensive media coverage. Analysts quoted in the New York Times criticized the U.S. government for remaining silent on the attack: “It was hard to know which was worse: that the federal government was blindsided again by Russian intelligence agencies, or that when it was evident what was happening, White House officials said nothing.”52\nIn January 2021, the FBI, DNI, NSA, and CISA publicly attributed the attack to Russia.53 It was not until April 2021—four months after the attack was detected and first revealed—that the White House publicly attributed the attack to the Russian government. The Biden administration published an Executive Order denouncing the harmful foreign activities of the Russian government and unmasking Russian agencies and companies that aided the Kremlin's hacking efforts: “Today the United States is formally naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures. The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR.54”\nIn this case, the intelligence agencies made the public attribution before the president, despite public criticism. This served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation in the bilateral and international arena. This kind of escalation with Russia might have had an undesirable effect for President Biden's administration during his first days in office. At the same time, it preserved the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization during a sensitive time—mere days after the Trump--Biden transition.\nThe credibility of intelligence agencies in public attribution also served the United States in bolstering its relations with Europe and the international community. The White House announced that it was providing training to foreign ministry lawyers and policymakers on legal standards of state behavior in cyberspace and peacetime norms. At the same time, the United States also announced first-of-its-kind international training and assistance on policy and technical aspects of attribution, to take place through the Marshall Center in Germany and support policymakers in Europe and worldwide.55\n### The DNC Intrusion (2016)\nIn April 2016, the FBI informed the DNC that an unauthorized figure had obtained extensive permissions for the DNC computer network and that the DNC was “under serious cyberattack.”56 The DNC, the governing body of\nthe Democratic Party, was struck at a particularly sensitive time, several months ahead of the U.S. elections, and amid the campaign for the party's presidential nominee. The FBI was already monitoring suspicious activity in the network, and as early as September 2015 had warned the DNC that its network had been hacked by a Russian group dubbed “The Dukes.” The FBI already knew this group well, after detecting its attempts to break into the White House, State Department, and Joint Chief of Staff's email systems in previous years.57\nAt the end of April 2016, the DNC hired the services of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to address the attack.58 After a month of investigation, CrowdStrike attributed the intrusion to Russia, based on various technical clues, such as matching the attack times to working hours in the Moscow time zone.59 The campaign of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton grappled with considerable political fallout from the intrusion, including trying to refute the vast amounts of information published. The attack and resulting affair arguably influenced American public opinion during election season later that year.60\nThe first public attribution was made in June 2016 by CrowdStrike. In this case, experts called President Barak Obama and the government to attribute the attack publicly. For example, in July 2016, the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group issued a statement calling on President Obama to “ensure that the attacks are attributed and take prompt actions sufficient to hold those responsible accountable and deter foreign actors from pursuing such tactics in the future.”61\nIn October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement on behalf of the IC, explicitly attributing the attack to Russia and describing it as a direct order from the Russian government:“The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions. [...] We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.62”\nAt a press conference later that month, the White House spokesperson attributed the breach to the Russian government, adding that Russia's goals included attempts to undermine the stability of the U.S. political system.63 Only in his last days in office, in December 2016, did President Obama say in an interview that the “DNC hack traced to ‘highest levels' of the Kremlin.” President Obama said he similarly told Putin personally to “cut it out” in September but he refrained from public retaliation before the November election because it would “immediately be seen through a partisan lens.”64\nThe public disclosure of Russia's attempts to disrupt democratic elections and by extension international order drew the attention of other countries, who watched the United States closely to learn how it was dealing with attempted Russian cyber intrusions and cyber-enabled influence operations. The United States became the focus of interest of other democracies, such as France and Germany, which were headed toward elections and feared Russian intervention.65 The United States even provided intelligence and technical assistance. For example, the NSA warned France that Russian hackers were planning to disrupt its electoral process. This allowed a French counteraction, which included planting fake information for the hackers and ultimately minimized Russia's actual influence on the election process. With considerable experience confronting Russian cyber intrusions, the United States positioned itself as an international role model in dealing with ongoing Russian intrusions and influence attempts.66\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe SolarWinds and DNC intrusions illustrate the dynamic of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, in particular in the ongoing cyber conflict between the United States and Russia. The overall credibility U.S. intelligence agencies enjoy lent greater weight to their public attributions in the eyes of both domestic and international audiences. This enhanced the standing of the United States as an experienced cyberspace actor and allowed it to position itself as a leader in the international cybersecurity arena, further strengthening its partnerships and alliances.\nIn both cases, public attribution by U.S. intelligence agencies occurred in the timeframe between the technical attribution made by private cybersecurity companies and the political attribution ultimately made by the U.S. president, despite public criticism. This appears to have served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation. At the same time, it allowed the United States to preserve the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization on the domestic front.\nThis phenomenon is occurring in the context of a larger change in the role of intelligence agencies that is facilitated and forced by the rapid advance in cyber technologies and AI. These technologies have affected these agencies' missions, from intelligence gathering to actively carrying out defensive and offensive cyber operations. Offensive cyber operations are increasing in numbers and scales, becoming an integral component of global conflict, diplomacy, and politics. Intelligence agencies are now being asked to take the public stage—often before, or altogether instead of, the country's senior officials.\nThis study is meant to stimulate exploration and scholarship about the factors at play when intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public\nGIL BARAM\nattribution. Several avenues were presented. At the broadest, \"macroscale\" level there may be high variation between states on what entity communicates attribution publicly. If so, there may be common characteristics that make some entities better than others for specific signaling purposes. For example, when intelligence agencies are doing the public attribution, as happened in both cases presented here, they can convey a message to the private sector that it plays a vital role in this process and that the information received from these companies is indeed used for national security needs. One hypothesis worth future research is that this signal has a positive effect, increasing private companies' engagement and willingness to share information with the government in the future.\nSimilarly, intelligence agencies' perception of the threat that rivals in cyberspace pose, and how this affects their analyses and messaging, might be examined. In its 2021 Annual Threats Assessment, the ODNI estimated,\nCyber threats from nation states and their surrogates will remain acute. Foreign states use cyber operations to steal information, influence populations, and damage industry, including physical and digital critical infrastructure. Although an increasing number of countries and non-state actors have these capabilities, we remain most concerned about Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.[67]\nThe two cases presented here involved Russia. However, in other cases, like the breach into the Office of Personal Management and Sony hack (both in 2014) involving China and North Korea, respectively, there had been no public attribution by intelligence agencies. Was there something different about the threats China and North Korea posed that led to different attribution methods?\nFuture research may answer these and other questions, such as uncovering variables that correlate to use of intelligence agencies in public attributions. Possible candidates might include the target type, adversarial regime type, and more. Examining the reverse instances of this study—cases without attribution by intelligence agencies—might shed light on the question of when states might be likely to use—or not—their intelligence agencies as the front line of official public attribution.\nWith offensive cyber operations constantly on the rise and stakes for governments increasingly higher, intelligence agencies appear to be playing an increasingly important role in the process of public attribution. Distinguishing between various attribution strategies and intelligence agencies' roles within them can provide a deeper understanding of how states perceive the context of a particular offensive cyber operation, and highlight the dynamics, trade-offs, and functions policymakers face when deciding on the path for public attribution and its possible outcomes.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\n17\n# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author thanks Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance and Herb Lin, Jon Lindsay, Jelena Vičić, Amy Zegart, and the social sciences reading group at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of this article.\n# DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

This raises the question: Is there a role for intelligence agencies—which traditionally work behind the scenes—in public attribution of offensive cyber operations? If so, what are the features that make these agencies useful in such public announcements? To answer these two questions, this article examines the emerging phenomenon of U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributing offensive cyber operations and identifies three features that make these agencies effective in public attribution: they send signals below the adversary's escalation threshold, offer credibility and nonpartisanship, and have partnerships that enable them to succeed in the attribution process. The SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee intrusions are used as illustrative case studies to examine this phenomenon. This research highlights\nGil Baram is a Senior Lecturer at Bar Ilan University and a nonresident Research Scholar at the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity and Berkeley Risk and Security Lab, University of California, Berkeley.

This offensive cyber operation utilized the American information technology (IT) company SolarWinds' regular software update, which had been infected with malicious code. More than 18,000 of SolarWinds' clients were estimated to be affected, among them many U.S. governmental agencies, including parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and more. So were private companies, like Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Deloitte, and other organizations. Microsoft president Brad Smith called it “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.”\nFireEye made the first attribution to a “highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.” Two weeks later, in January 2021, several U.S. intelligence agencies—the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA)—with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), publicly attributed the operation to “a Russian actor.” However, it was not until April 2021 that the Biden administration explicitly named the perpetrator as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\nThe fact that the country's intelligence agencies were the ones making the first official public attribution, several months before the president did so, highlights a puzzle: Intelligence agencies traditionally work behind the scenes, and unlike politicians and private cybersecurity companies, may have less incentive to publicize their activity, as this might endanger their sources and methods of operation. Furthermore, in some cases, offensive cyber operations can be kept covert and underreported so that countries do not concede they were cyberattacked. In view of these two factors, intelligence agencies seem unlikely to be the agents of publicity and public attribution. However, two cases in the United States suggested this might be otherwise.\nThis leads to a research question: Once intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public attribution, what are the features that make them effective at doing so? I argue that public attribution by intelligence agencies is an emerging phenomenon that deserves deeper examination, regarding two issues in particular. The first is the fact that this is indeed occurring, and therefore should be explored as another attribution path. The second issue warranting study regards the features of intelligence agencies that make their\npublic attribution effective. With governments consistently under cyberattacks and the global scope of offensive cyber operations rising, recognizing and understanding the public role of intelligence agencies is vital.\nThe first part of the article surveys the main literature addressing the changing role of intelligence agencies in the current information age, outlines the common possible attribution paths, and highlights one that has so far received little theoretical and empirical attention—public attribution by intelligence agencies. The second part presents the empirical data regarding public attribution by intelligence agencies and shows that this is a global phenomenon, although the United States is the leading country doing so. After empirically establishing attribution by intelligence agencies as a more common phenomenon than might be expected, the article turns to the third part to ask what features of the intelligence agencies make them effective in doing public attributions. Three features are discussed: (1) they can send a credible signal beneath the escalation threshold, (2) they are perceived as professional and “a-political,” (3) their connections with the private sector and international partners. In the fourth part, I use the SolarWinds (2020) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC; 2016) intrusions as illustrative case studies intended to give the reader an initial sense of the way these functions work. The fifth and final part discusses the conclusions of this research, its policy-relevant implications, and offers avenues for future research.\n## INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE\nWhen approaching the role of intelligence agencies in public attribution of offensive cyber operations, one must first consider the way their role at large is affected by rapid technological changes. Over the past decade, intelligence work has undergone a tremendous change, and today it is not only intelligence gathering and covert actions but also carrying out offensive and defensive cyber operations. The new function and scale are both enabled by advanced cyber technologies that allow obtaining and analyzing information in ways and scopes that did not exist in the past. This is further amplified by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, used to “amplify the effectiveness of our workforce ... advance mission capability and enhance the IC's [Intelligence Community's] ability to provide data interpretation to decision makers.” This change in scope and scale offers both opportunities and challenges, and requires intelligence agencies to adapt and change: “[T]he Intelligence Community faces a moment of reckoning. If the IC cannot adopt AI and other emerging technologies successfully, it risks failure.” This challenge should be kept in mind when discussing public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies.\nIntelligence agencies' work is usually being done “behind the scenes,” and when it comes to offensive cyber operations, secrecy was considered an inherent feature.10 General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency, noted that, in the beginning, “even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself.”11 While literature is offering new perspectives on the changes in intelligence agencies' work, it mostly continues to perceive their role as covert and silent.12 However, cyber technologies enable intelligence agencies to operate on much larger scales than in the past, which may conflict with the traditional secrecy of intelligence operations; the larger the scale, the higher the risk of exposure might be.13 This article explores circumstances in which intelligence agencies abandon secrecy and thus take their place on stage.\n## Public attribution of offensive cyber operations\nGovernments and private firms that suffered a cyberattack have incentives for keeping cyber intrusions secret, “Lest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment.”14 In certain cases, target states may be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of these operations, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.15 There is no pride involved in being a victim, and target states might opt for silence so as not to “admit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned.”16\nAttribution of offensive cyber operations has been studied from several different perspectives. These include the attribution problem and its meanings, the uniqueness of attribution in cyberspace compared to other domains, the different attribution pathways, and the various calculations decisionmakers should take into account when deciding on attribution.17 Additional scholarship has highlighted the challenge in identifying and attributing the source of an attack, the meaning of anonymity, and the difficulties this poses to the defender when deciding how to react.18\nIntelligence agencies face a dilemma regarding the amount and nature of information required for reaching public attribution: Should this information relate to an individual, or the state? How much evidence is required to reveal and what might be the implication for this publicity? Public attribution by a government requires intelligence agencies to provide the relevant technical and operational information. However, when it comes to public attribution they are often hesitant to disclose this because of the potential damage to their intelligence methods, sources, and access to vital assets.19\nThe attribution process by states consists of two main stages. The first is an analytic process—which is historical and backward-looking—identifying what happened and who did it. This includes establishing the technical facts of the intrusion and checking the attacker's techniques against those of previously identified actors. Every attribution of an offensive cyber operation begins with a technical and forensic investigation based on known data and information and indicators—such as technical identifiers and pieces of code—in order to understand the scale of the offensive cyber operation, the severity of the damage, the goal of the adversary, and so on. The objective of this investigation is to ensure the safety of the affected networks and computer systems.^{20}\nThe second stage is a strategic process, which is more forward-looking; deciding what should be communicated, by whom, and how. In this part, the target state determines what it wants to do with the findings of this forensic investigation, in keeping with its broader strategic goals and political considerations. In this stage, states can decide how they wish to communicate the attribution findings to other audiences in order to influence the interpretation of a particular incident.^{21} This stage is mainly driven by a state's policy considerations, and it can communicate its findings using one or more of five general attribution paths, separately or in concert^{22}: Technical: providing technical--forensic information that will help other entities patch their vulnerabilities and protect themselves. This kind of attribution can be done by the private sector, NGOs, or state agencies. In the U.S. context, this is done mainly by CISA and the FBI.^{23} Criminal: criminal proceedings against individuals. If a malicious cyber incident is regarded as a matter for domestic law enforcement authorities, then legal requirements for process, standards of evidence, and degrees of certainty about attribution apply^{24}; Political, Unofficial: by talking to the press under terms of anonymity; Political, Official: public attribution by state political officials, such as the president, secretary of state, secretary of homeland security and others; and Multicountry collaboration: public attribution by a number of countries together. This kind of attribution requires trust between the participating states as it requires each state to share at least some of its information and intelligence.^{25}\nIn recent years, there have been cases in which the intelligence agencies were the ones doing the public attribution, potentially signaling a new official attribution path. In the next paragraphs, I will examine where this occurs along the national decisionmaking process, and discuss the data and identify the possible reasons they are doing so in the U.S. case.\nTo illustrate this decisionmaking process, we can look at the U.S.-specific decision tree in Figure 1. This flowchart helps explain two main factors in the attribution process—the echelon of the organizational hierarchy that\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 1. Attribution decision-making process (U.S.-specific).\nperforms the attribution, and the specific function within this level. The point of departure is that an offensive cyber operation has taken place and has been detected by the defender, and the analytical attribution process has been done. Now, decisionmakers face the question whether to reveal the identity of the attacker or not. If not, there are two options: First, maintain silence. Second, provide information to private security companies so they will do the attribution.\nIf the decision is to reveal the identity of the attacker, once again there are two options. The first of these is nonofficial attribution, which can be publicizing the information in anonymous ways—such as talking to the press under terms of anonymity, off-record briefing, or leaking. The second is official attribution by the U.S. government. Official response can be done by the White House or Executive Office of the President; other Cabinet departments, such as the Department of Defence, Department of Justice, or Department of Homeland Security; or by intelligence agencies. The last is the focus of this study.\n# PUBLICITY AND OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE\nWhile targeted states might have clear incentives not to acknowledge having been attacked, they do not always have a choice. The magnitude of some cyber intrusions, in addition to related rumors and media reports, makes it difficult for states to avoid any public response altogether.[26] In order to examine the phenomenon of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, I took an empirical approach, examining offensive\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncyber operations to identify the agent of publicity in each case in order to map the relevant cases. This part serves as the basis for the qualitative examination through the illustrative case studies that follow. The following paragraphs and figures present the data on publicity of offensive cyber operations in general and specific data regarding the different entities revealing them, and the role of intelligence agencies within this. These show that public attribution by intelligence agencies is indeed an empirical phenomenon.\nHere it is important to address the so-called unknown unknowns or unobserved offensive cyber operations.27 These are offensive cyber operations assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources used for this research. For the purposes of this article, only offensive cyber operations that have been publicly revealed and for which there exists sufficient data to code in the dataset have been included. The presumed existence of unknown unknowns should not preclude scholars from researching these issues, which are changing the landscape of cyberwarfare politics.28\n### Data Compilation\nData compilation included three preexisting datasets, plus additional sources. The first is the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset Version 1.1,29 which provides data on the presence of cyber conflict in the existing conflicts between 2001 and 2014. To this was added new data on cyberattacks and intrusions for the years 1996 to 2019 based on the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations tracker.30 Finally, the relevant data for the years prior to 2001 were added, based on the National Security Archive Cyber Vault Project.31 All data were verified, then recoded using a new schema of variables and scaling.\nThe compilation and updating process also relied on reports in media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. This allowed supplementing the existing data with any new information that had come to light since the incident, and was published via mainstream media, threat intelligence reports, cybersecurity magazines, or cybersecurity companies. For verification purposes, each incident included in the dataset has at least two reliable sources and was examined by two independent coders. The dataset was finalized in June 2019 and includes 476 cyber incidents. All data was collected from open sources.\n### Entity Exposing the Attacker\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the actors that revealed the offensive cyber operation public attribution for the years 2005 to 2019. In half the cases, private cybersecurity companies were the ones to expose the attack.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Entity exposing the attacker (2005-2019).\nHowever, as illustrated below, intelligence and defense agencies revealed the attacker's identity in  $13\\%$  of the cases, doing so at higher rates than senior officials, who attributed offensive cyber operations in  $10\\%$  of the cases. This finding is particularly interesting given the general perception of intelligence organizations as secret agencies that do not disclose information to the public.\n# Global Phenomenon\nFigure 3 illustrates the data for public attribution by defense and intelligence agencies in different countries ( $N = 43$ ). While the United States clearly leads this practice, it is also being done in Germany, South Korea, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Examples of the agencies making public attributions include defense agencies such as CISA, Norway's Policy Security Service, the Polish Computer Emergency Response Team, the Security Service of Ukraine, and intelligence agencies such as the DNI, FBI, and NSA in the United States and Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV).[32] This research focuses on the United States only, for reasons discussed in the next section.\n# Focusing on the United States\nThis article focuses on the United States for two reasons. The first is that the United States is the dominant country for this path, meaning it had the\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nFigure 3. Attribution by defense and intelligence agencies (2005-2019).\nhighest number of intelligence and defense agency attributions of the countries examined. The second relates to organizational differences. In some countries, the boundaries between intelligence agencies, other defense agencies, and law enforcement agencies is blurred. For example, cases in which the FBI was the only attributing agency are included in the data but excluded from the analysis. The U.S. cases allow for better distinguishing between the various agencies. Even with, for example, the NSA and Cyber Command being under the same roof and command, I was able to focus on cases that were attributed by the U.S. IC as a whole.\n# FEATURES OF INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE IN PUBLIC ATTRIBUTIONS\nExamination of the available evidence suggested three features of intelligence agencies that make them effective in public attributions: ability to signal below escalation threshold, reputation for credibility and nonpartisanship, and partnership existence—domestic and international. I then used two of the recent best-documented cyber operations—the SolarWinds and the DNC intrusions—as illustrative case studies in order to trace and examine the use of intelligence agencies for public attribution of offensive cyber operations.\n# Signal Beneath the Escalation Threshold\nThe nonescalatory nature of offensive cyber operations has been widely discussed in the past few years.[33] Despite the preliminary expectations that offensive cyber operations would lead to cyber war—such as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warning against the possibility of a “cyber-Pearl Harbor”—real-world events so far proved differently. The literature that followed showed that these kinds of operations did not lead to escalation\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 0, NUMBER 0\nof war, and scholars offer to see offensive cyber operations as a conflict short of war.^{34}\nOne assumption in cybersecurity literature is that offensive cyber operations are usually not escalatory until they cross a certain threshold. Once crossed, the power dynamics change and the operations can escalate—in the cyberdomain and cross-domain as well.^{35} However, public accusations can have a declarative-escalatory effect.^{36} States may choose not to publicly attribute an attack when attribution could cause undesirable escalation “outside the agreed competition space,” and that could publicly endanger rules or legal regimes outside the cyberdomain.^{37} This is based on the perception that defensive and offensive cyber activities are hard to distinguish, and that a defensive cyber action might be misinterpreted by the adversary as a preparation for attack.^{38}\nPublic attribution by senior officials has great political and geostrategical impact but also carries higher escalatory consequences and risks. Therefore, a target country wishing to respond to offensive cyber operations in the public arena and signal its adversary without risking escalation might use its intelligence agencies as the “first line” of public attribution, rather than a more declarative authority. This allows sending a clear message to the rival while staying below a threshold for undesirable escalation. While countries can opt to share information privately, including through direct channels between intelligence agencies such as the Five Eyes alliance, public attribution serves as a political and policy signal; privately conveying information does not.\n### Reputation for Credibility and Nonpartisanship\nPublic attribution plays a visible role in U.S. cyber strategy.^{39} Therefore, the way politicians communicate attribution findings to their various audiences—rival, domestic, and international—has critical bearing on how the message is received. However, this presents a challenge. High-level official attributions may carry a risk of escalation or other costs as mentioned, while nonofficial paths may not be perceived as credible. For the attribution to achieve maximum impact with minimum risk effectively, it should be highly credible, but also apolitical. Intelligence agencies often afford the best of both because they historically carry both reputations.\nFor example, according to the University of Texas at Austin's 2020 survey, a majority of Americans (64%) believe that the IC plays a vital role in protecting the nation. This popular support has proven consistent, bipartisan, and notably resilient over a four-year span marked by hostility and even “unprecedented assault” on American intelligence during the Trump presidency. Despite this tension, polling consistently confirmed a “durable reservoir of public confidence” in U.S. intelligence agencies.^{40} So, when\nintelligence agencies are making the public attribution, it is more likely that both the general public and the accused party perceive it as credible and reliable as an official statement, but not indicative of a policy shift or response.\n### Partnership Existence: International and Domestic\nThe importance of working with international allies and partners is highlighted throughout the U.S. cyber strategies. The 2023 Department of Defense (DoD) cyber strategy stated,“Our global Allies and partners represent a foundational strategic advantage for the United States. We will build the capacity and capability of U.S. Allies and partners in cyberspace and expand avenues of potential cyber cooperation. We will continue hunt forward operations and other bilateral technical collaboration, working with Allies and partners to illuminate malicious cyber activity on their networks.41”\nIn this context, the credibility of the U.S. intelligence agencies can also strengthen the credibility of the entire public attribution process in the eyes of its international partners and allies. This, in turn, can contribute to enhancing its international collaborations and helps the U.S. position itself as a world leader and authority in this field. One visible result is the joint public attributions that the United States and its allies have been doing in the past few years. A recent and salient example is the joint attribution by the European Union and United States of the hacking of ViaSat to Russia on the first day of the war in Ukraine.42\nThe U.S. government also has strong ties to the private sector in many fields. When it comes to the cyberdomain, the private sector often holds much more information than the government and intelligence agencies can without encroaching on citizens' privacy. This makes cooperation with private cybersecurity companies crucial in maintaining the health of the overall U.S. system, both public and private.43 One significant development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 DoD cyber strategy notes that private-sector parties (e.g. private cybersecurity firms) reporting on attribution “can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place,” and states that the DoD “will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution.”44 The importance of these companies is hard to overstate; they were the first to identify and reveal both the SolarWinds and DNC intrusions, discussed below.\nILLUSTRATIVE CASE STUDIES: THE SOLARWINDS AND THE DNC OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nIllustrative case studies (or plausibility probes) are used to shed light on a broader theoretical argument, especially for emerging or previously unstudied phenomena. They are brief by design, aiming “to give the reader a ‘feel' for a theoretical argument by providing a concrete example of its application, or to demonstrate the empirical relevance of a theoretical proposition by identifying at least one relevant case.”45 They serve as an exploratory step between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. With this in mind, the case studies below illustrate that the subject is ripe for research.\n### The SolarWinds Intrusion (2020)\nIn December 2020, the private cybersecurity company FireEye revealed an ongoing large-scale cyber operation, in which a rival country—believed to be Russia—gained access to multiple U.S. government agencies' networks. These included the Pentagon, the departments of Commerce, State, Treasury and Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Agency, as well as over 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, and many others.46\nSecurity researchers estimated that, starting in March 2020, and possibly earlier, Russian state-sponsored hackers gained access to the periodic update of SolarWinds' Orion IT-monitoring software, widely used by government and security agencies, leading private companies, and critical infrastructures. Orion is an IT performance monitoring system that has privileged access to IT systems to obtain log and system performance data.47 Consequently, anyone updating the software in fact granted the attackers potential access to their systems. Chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner, described the SolarWinds attack as “one of the most sophisticated and deep hacks we've faced.”48 The extent of the breach raised concerns that attackers could eventually use their access to harm American systems, disrupt or destroy information, and disable critical-system commands—although none of these are known to have happened to date. 49\nFormer Homeland Security advisor for the Trump administration, Thomas Bossert, described the intrusion as follows: “The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate. [...] The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months.”50 As the scale of the intrusion became clearer, there was no doubt the American government had failed to convince Russia there would be consequences to such broad hacking of federal government and corporate networks.51\nIn the SolarWinds case, FireEye identified a sophisticated nation-state hack into its own systems. The initial report was followed by extensive media coverage. Analysts quoted in the New York Times criticized the U.S. government for remaining silent on the attack: “It was hard to know which was worse: that the federal government was blindsided again by Russian intelligence agencies, or that when it was evident what was happening, White House officials said nothing.”52\nIn January 2021, the FBI, DNI, NSA, and CISA publicly attributed the attack to Russia.53 It was not until April 2021—four months after the attack was detected and first revealed—that the White House publicly attributed the attack to the Russian government. The Biden administration published an Executive Order denouncing the harmful foreign activities of the Russian government and unmasking Russian agencies and companies that aided the Kremlin's hacking efforts: “Today the United States is formally naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures. The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR.54”\nIn this case, the intelligence agencies made the public attribution before the president, despite public criticism. This served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation in the bilateral and international arena. This kind of escalation with Russia might have had an undesirable effect for President Biden's administration during his first days in office. At the same time, it preserved the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization during a sensitive time—mere days after the Trump--Biden transition.\nThe credibility of intelligence agencies in public attribution also served the United States in bolstering its relations with Europe and the international community. The White House announced that it was providing training to foreign ministry lawyers and policymakers on legal standards of state behavior in cyberspace and peacetime norms. At the same time, the United States also announced first-of-its-kind international training and assistance on policy and technical aspects of attribution, to take place through the Marshall Center in Germany and support policymakers in Europe and worldwide.55\n### The DNC Intrusion (2016)\nIn April 2016, the FBI informed the DNC that an unauthorized figure had obtained extensive permissions for the DNC computer network and that the DNC was “under serious cyberattack.”56 The DNC, the governing body of\nthe Democratic Party, was struck at a particularly sensitive time, several months ahead of the U.S. elections, and amid the campaign for the party's presidential nominee. The FBI was already monitoring suspicious activity in the network, and as early as September 2015 had warned the DNC that its network had been hacked by a Russian group dubbed “The Dukes.” The FBI already knew this group well, after detecting its attempts to break into the White House, State Department, and Joint Chief of Staff's email systems in previous years.57\nAt the end of April 2016, the DNC hired the services of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to address the attack.58 After a month of investigation, CrowdStrike attributed the intrusion to Russia, based on various technical clues, such as matching the attack times to working hours in the Moscow time zone.59 The campaign of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton grappled with considerable political fallout from the intrusion, including trying to refute the vast amounts of information published. The attack and resulting affair arguably influenced American public opinion during election season later that year.60\nThe first public attribution was made in June 2016 by CrowdStrike. In this case, experts called President Barak Obama and the government to attribute the attack publicly. For example, in July 2016, the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group issued a statement calling on President Obama to “ensure that the attacks are attributed and take prompt actions sufficient to hold those responsible accountable and deter foreign actors from pursuing such tactics in the future.”61\nIn October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement on behalf of the IC, explicitly attributing the attack to Russia and describing it as a direct order from the Russian government:“The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions. [...] We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.62”\nAt a press conference later that month, the White House spokesperson attributed the breach to the Russian government, adding that Russia's goals included attempts to undermine the stability of the U.S. political system.63 Only in his last days in office, in December 2016, did President Obama say in an interview that the “DNC hack traced to ‘highest levels' of the Kremlin.” President Obama said he similarly told Putin personally to “cut it out” in September but he refrained from public retaliation before the November election because it would “immediately be seen through a partisan lens.”64\nThe public disclosure of Russia's attempts to disrupt democratic elections and by extension international order drew the attention of other countries, who watched the United States closely to learn how it was dealing with attempted Russian cyber intrusions and cyber-enabled influence operations. The United States became the focus of interest of other democracies, such as France and Germany, which were headed toward elections and feared Russian intervention.65 The United States even provided intelligence and technical assistance. For example, the NSA warned France that Russian hackers were planning to disrupt its electoral process. This allowed a French counteraction, which included planting fake information for the hackers and ultimately minimized Russia's actual influence on the election process. With considerable experience confronting Russian cyber intrusions, the United States positioned itself as an international role model in dealing with ongoing Russian intrusions and influence attempts.66\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe SolarWinds and DNC intrusions illustrate the dynamic of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, in particular in the ongoing cyber conflict between the United States and Russia. The overall credibility U.S. intelligence agencies enjoy lent greater weight to their public attributions in the eyes of both domestic and international audiences. This enhanced the standing of the United States as an experienced cyberspace actor and allowed it to position itself as a leader in the international cybersecurity arena, further strengthening its partnerships and alliances.\nIn both cases, public attribution by U.S. intelligence agencies occurred in the timeframe between the technical attribution made by private cybersecurity companies and the political attribution ultimately made by the U.S. president, despite public criticism. This appears to have served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation. At the same time, it allowed the United States to preserve the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization on the domestic front.\nThis phenomenon is occurring in the context of a larger change in the role of intelligence agencies that is facilitated and forced by the rapid advance in cyber technologies and AI. These technologies have affected these agencies' missions, from intelligence gathering to actively carrying out defensive and offensive cyber operations. Offensive cyber operations are increasing in numbers and scales, becoming an integral component of global conflict, diplomacy, and politics. Intelligence agencies are now being asked to take the public stage—often before, or altogether instead of, the country's senior officials.\nThis study is meant to stimulate exploration and scholarship about the factors at play when intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public\nGIL BARAM\nattribution. Several avenues were presented. At the broadest, \"macroscale\" level there may be high variation between states on what entity communicates attribution publicly. If so, there may be common characteristics that make some entities better than others for specific signaling purposes. For example, when intelligence agencies are doing the public attribution, as happened in both cases presented here, they can convey a message to the private sector that it plays a vital role in this process and that the information received from these companies is indeed used for national security needs. One hypothesis worth future research is that this signal has a positive effect, increasing private companies' engagement and willingness to share information with the government in the future.\nSimilarly, intelligence agencies' perception of the threat that rivals in cyberspace pose, and how this affects their analyses and messaging, might be examined. In its 2021 Annual Threats Assessment, the ODNI estimated,\nCyber threats from nation states and their surrogates will remain acute. Foreign states use cyber operations to steal information, influence populations, and damage industry, including physical and digital critical infrastructure. Although an increasing number of countries and non-state actors have these capabilities, we remain most concerned about Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.[67]\nThe two cases presented here involved Russia. However, in other cases, like the breach into the Office of Personal Management and Sony hack (both in 2014) involving China and North Korea, respectively, there had been no public attribution by intelligence agencies. Was there something different about the threats China and North Korea posed that led to different attribution methods?\nFuture research may answer these and other questions, such as uncovering variables that correlate to use of intelligence agencies in public attributions. Possible candidates might include the target type, adversarial regime type, and more. Examining the reverse instances of this study—cases without attribution by intelligence agencies—might shed light on the question of when states might be likely to use—or not—their intelligence agencies as the front line of official public attribution.\nWith offensive cyber operations constantly on the rise and stakes for governments increasingly higher, intelligence agencies appear to be playing an increasingly important role in the process of public attribution. Distinguishing between various attribution strategies and intelligence agencies' roles within them can provide a deeper understanding of how states perceive the context of a particular offensive cyber operation, and highlight the dynamics, trade-offs, and functions policymakers face when deciding on the path for public attribution and its possible outcomes.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nThe author thanks Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance and Herb Lin, Jon Lindsay, Jelena Vičić, Amy Zegart, and the social sciences reading group at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of this article.\n# DISCLOSURE STATEMENT No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

This raises the question: Is there a role for intelligence agencies—which traditionally work behind the scenes—in public attribution of offensive cyber operations? If so, what are the features that make these agencies useful in such public announcements? To answer these two questions, this article examines the emerging phenomenon of U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributing offensive cyber operations and identifies three features that make these agencies effective in public attribution: they send signals below the adversary's escalation threshold, offer credibility and nonpartisanship, and have partnerships that enable them to succeed in the attribution process. The SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee intrusions are used as illustrative case studies to examine this phenomenon.

This offensive cyber operation utilized the American information technology (IT) company SolarWinds' regular software update, which had been infected with malicious code. More than 18,000 of SolarWinds' clients were estimated to be affected, among them many U.S. governmental agencies, including parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and more. So were private companies, like Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Deloitte, and other organizations. Microsoft president Brad Smith called it “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.”\nFireEye made the first attribution to a “highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.” Two weeks later, in January 2021, several U.S. intelligence agencies—the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA)—with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), publicly attributed the operation to “a Russian actor.” However, it was not until April 2021 that the Biden administration explicitly named the perpetrator as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\nThe fact that the country's intelligence agencies were the ones making the first official public attribution, several months before the president did so, highlights a puzzle: Intelligence agencies traditionally work behind the scenes, and unlike politicians and private cybersecurity companies, may have less incentive to publicize their activity, as this might endanger their sources and methods of operation. Furthermore, in some cases, offensive cyber operations can be kept covert and underreported so that countries do not concede they were cyberattacked. In view of these two factors, intelligence agencies seem unlikely to be the agents of publicity and public attribution. However, two cases in the United States suggested this might be otherwise.\nThis leads to a research question: Once intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public attribution, what are the features that make them effective at doing so? I argue that public attribution by intelligence agencies is an emerging phenomenon that deserves deeper examination, regarding two issues in particular. The first is the fact that this is indeed occurring, and therefore should be explored as another attribution path. The second issue warranting study regards the features of intelligence agencies that make their\npublic attribution effective. With governments consistently under cyberattacks and the global scope of offensive cyber operations rising, recognizing and understanding the public role of intelligence agencies is vital.\nThe first part of the article surveys the main literature addressing the changing role of intelligence agencies in the current information age, outlines the common possible attribution paths, and highlights one that has so far received little theoretical and empirical attention—public attribution by intelligence agencies. The second part presents the empirical data regarding public attribution by intelligence agencies and shows that this is a global phenomenon, although the United States is the leading country doing so. After empirically establishing attribution by intelligence agencies as a more common phenomenon than might be expected, the article turns to the third part to ask what features of the intelligence agencies make them effective in doing public attributions. Three features are discussed: (1) they can send a credible signal beneath the escalation threshold, (2) they are perceived as professional and “a-political,” (3) their connections with the private sector and international partners. In the fourth part, I use the SolarWinds (2020) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC; 2016) intrusions as illustrative case studies intended to give the reader an initial sense of the way these functions work. The fifth and final part discusses the conclusions of this research, its policy-relevant implications, and offers avenues for future research.\n## INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE\nWhen approaching the role of intelligence agencies in public attribution of offensive cyber operations, one must first consider the way their role at large is affected by rapid technological changes. Over the past decade, intelligence work has undergone a tremendous change, and today it is not only intelligence gathering and covert actions but also carrying out offensive and defensive cyber operations. The new function and scale are both enabled by advanced cyber technologies that allow obtaining and analyzing information in ways and scopes that did not exist in the past. This is further amplified by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, used to “amplify the effectiveness of our workforce ... advance mission capability and enhance the IC's [Intelligence Community's] ability to provide data interpretation to decision makers.” This change in scope and scale offers both opportunities and challenges, and requires intelligence agencies to adapt and change: “[T]he Intelligence Community faces a moment of reckoning. If the IC cannot adopt AI and other emerging technologies successfully, it risks failure.” This challenge should be kept in mind when discussing public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies.\nIntelligence agencies' work is usually being done “behind the scenes,” and when it comes to offensive cyber operations, secrecy was considered an inherent feature.10 General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency, noted that, in the beginning, “even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself.”11 While literature is offering new perspectives on the changes in intelligence agencies' work, it mostly continues to perceive their role as covert and silent.12 However, cyber technologies enable intelligence agencies to operate on much larger scales than in the past, which may conflict with the traditional secrecy of intelligence operations; the larger the scale, the higher the risk of exposure might be.13 This article explores circumstances in which intelligence agencies abandon secrecy and thus take their place on stage.\n## Public attribution of offensive cyber operations\nGovernments and private firms that suffered a cyberattack have incentives for keeping cyber intrusions secret, “Lest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment.”14 In certain cases, target states may be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of these operations, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.15 There is no pride involved in being a victim, and target states might opt for silence so as not to “admit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned.”16\nAttribution of offensive cyber operations has been studied from several different perspectives. These include the attribution problem and its meanings, the uniqueness of attribution in cyberspace compared to other domains, the different attribution pathways, and the various calculations decisionmakers should take into account when deciding on attribution.17 Additional scholarship has highlighted the challenge in identifying and attributing the source of an attack, the meaning of anonymity, and the difficulties this poses to the defender when deciding how to react.18\nIntelligence agencies face a dilemma regarding the amount and nature of information required for reaching public attribution: Should this information relate to an individual, or the state? How much evidence is required to reveal and what might be the implication for this publicity? Public attribution by a government requires intelligence agencies to provide the relevant technical and operational information. However, when it comes to public attribution they are often hesitant to disclose this because of the potential damage to their intelligence methods, sources, and access to vital assets.19\nThe attribution process by states consists of two main stages. The first is an analytic process—which is historical and backward-looking—identifying what happened and who did it. This includes establishing the technical facts of the intrusion and checking the attacker's techniques against those of previously identified actors. Every attribution of an offensive cyber operation begins with a technical and forensic investigation based on known data and information and indicators—such as technical identifiers and pieces of code—in order to understand the scale of the offensive cyber operation, the severity of the damage, the goal of the adversary, and so on. The objective of this investigation is to ensure the safety of the affected networks and computer systems.^{20}\nThe second stage is a strategic process, which is more forward-looking; deciding what should be communicated, by whom, and how. In this part, the target state determines what it wants to do with the findings of this forensic investigation, in keeping with its broader strategic goals and political considerations. In this stage, states can decide how they wish to communicate the attribution findings to other audiences in order to influence the interpretation of a particular incident.^{21} This stage is mainly driven by a state's policy considerations, and it can communicate its findings using one or more of five general attribution paths, separately or in concert^{22}: Technical: providing technical--forensic information that will help other entities patch their vulnerabilities and protect themselves. This kind of attribution can be done by the private sector, NGOs, or state agencies. In the U.S. context, this is done mainly by CISA and the FBI.^{23} Criminal: criminal proceedings against individuals. If a malicious cyber incident is regarded as a matter for domestic law enforcement authorities, then legal requirements for process, standards of evidence, and degrees of certainty about attribution apply^{24}; Political, Unofficial: by talking to the press under terms of anonymity; Political, Official: public attribution by state political officials, such as the president, secretary of state, secretary of homeland security and others; and Multicountry collaboration: public attribution by a number of countries together. This kind of attribution requires trust between the participating states as it requires each state to share at least some of its information and intelligence.^{25}\nIn recent years, there have been cases in which the intelligence agencies were the ones doing the public attribution, potentially signaling a new official attribution path. In the next paragraphs, I will examine where this occurs along the national decisionmaking process, and discuss the data and identify the possible reasons they are doing so in the U.S. case.\nTo illustrate this decisionmaking process, we can look at the U.S.-specific decision tree in Figure 1. This flowchart helps explain two main factors in the attribution process—the echelon of the organizational hierarchy that\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 1. Attribution decision-making process (U.S.-specific).\nperforms the attribution, and the specific function within this level. The point of departure is that an offensive cyber operation has taken place and has been detected by the defender, and the analytical attribution process has been done. Now, decisionmakers face the question whether to reveal the identity of the attacker or not. If not, there are two options: First, maintain silence. Second, provide information to private security companies so they will do the attribution.\nIf the decision is to reveal the identity of the attacker, once again there are two options. The first of these is nonofficial attribution, which can be publicizing the information in anonymous ways—such as talking to the press under terms of anonymity, off-record briefing, or leaking. The second is official attribution by the U.S. government. Official response can be done by the White House or Executive Office of the President; other Cabinet departments, such as the Department of Defence, Department of Justice, or Department of Homeland Security; or by intelligence agencies. The last is the focus of this study.\n# PUBLICITY AND OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE\nWhile targeted states might have clear incentives not to acknowledge having been attacked, they do not always have a choice. The magnitude of some cyber intrusions, in addition to related rumors and media reports, makes it difficult for states to avoid any public response altogether.[26] In order to examine the phenomenon of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, I took an empirical approach, examining offensive\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncyber operations to identify the agent of publicity in each case in order to map the relevant cases. This part serves as the basis for the qualitative examination through the illustrative case studies that follow. The following paragraphs and figures present the data on publicity of offensive cyber operations in general and specific data regarding the different entities revealing them, and the role of intelligence agencies within this. These show that public attribution by intelligence agencies is indeed an empirical phenomenon.\nHere it is important to address the so-called unknown unknowns or unobserved offensive cyber operations.27 These are offensive cyber operations assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources used for this research. For the purposes of this article, only offensive cyber operations that have been publicly revealed and for which there exists sufficient data to code in the dataset have been included. The presumed existence of unknown unknowns should not preclude scholars from researching these issues, which are changing the landscape of cyberwarfare politics.28\n### Data Compilation\nData compilation included three preexisting datasets, plus additional sources. The first is the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset Version 1.1,29 which provides data on the presence of cyber conflict in the existing conflicts between 2001 and 2014. To this was added new data on cyberattacks and intrusions for the years 1996 to 2019 based on the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations tracker.30 Finally, the relevant data for the years prior to 2001 were added, based on the National Security Archive Cyber Vault Project.31 All data were verified, then recoded using a new schema of variables and scaling.\nThe compilation and updating process also relied on reports in media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. This allowed supplementing the existing data with any new information that had come to light since the incident, and was published via mainstream media, threat intelligence reports, cybersecurity magazines, or cybersecurity companies. For verification purposes, each incident included in the dataset has at least two reliable sources and was examined by two independent coders. The dataset was finalized in June 2019 and includes 476 cyber incidents. All data was collected from open sources.\n### Entity Exposing the Attacker\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the actors that revealed the offensive cyber operation public attribution for the years 2005 to 2019. In half the cases, private cybersecurity companies were the ones to expose the attack.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Entity exposing the attacker (2005-2019).\nHowever, as illustrated below, intelligence and defense agencies revealed the attacker's identity in  $13\\%$  of the cases, doing so at higher rates than senior officials, who attributed offensive cyber operations in  $10\\%$  of the cases. This finding is particularly interesting given the general perception of intelligence organizations as secret agencies that do not disclose information to the public.\n# Global Phenomenon\nFigure 3 illustrates the data for public attribution by defense and intelligence agencies in different countries ( $N = 43$ ). While the United States clearly leads this practice, it is also being done in Germany, South Korea, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Examples of the agencies making public attributions include defense agencies such as CISA, Norway's Policy Security Service, the Polish Computer Emergency Response Team, the Security Service of Ukraine, and intelligence agencies such as the DNI, FBI, and NSA in the United States and Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV).[32] This research focuses on the United States only, for reasons discussed in the next section.\n# Focusing on the United States\nThis article focuses on the United States for two reasons. The first is that the United States is the dominant country for this path, meaning it had the\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nFigure 3. Attribution by defense and intelligence agencies (2005-2019).\nhighest number of intelligence and defense agency attributions of the countries examined. The second relates to organizational differences. In some countries, the boundaries between intelligence agencies, other defense agencies, and law enforcement agencies is blurred. For example, cases in which the FBI was the only attributing agency are included in the data but excluded from the analysis. The U.S. cases allow for better distinguishing between the various agencies. Even with, for example, the NSA and Cyber Command being under the same roof and command, I was able to focus on cases that were attributed by the U.S. IC as a whole.\n# FEATURES OF INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE IN PUBLIC ATTRIBUTIONS\nExamination of the available evidence suggested three features of intelligence agencies that make them effective in public attributions: ability to signal below escalation threshold, reputation for credibility and nonpartisanship, and partnership existence—domestic and international. I then used two of the recent best-documented cyber operations—the SolarWinds and the DNC intrusions—as illustrative case studies in order to trace and examine the use of intelligence agencies for public attribution of offensive cyber operations.\n# Signal Beneath the Escalation Threshold\nThe nonescalatory nature of offensive cyber operations has been widely discussed in the past few years.[33] Despite the preliminary expectations that offensive cyber operations would lead to cyber war—such as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warning against the possibility of a “cyber-Pearl Harbor”—real-world events so far proved differently. The literature that followed showed that these kinds of operations did not lead to escalation\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 0, NUMBER 0\nof war, and scholars offer to see offensive cyber operations as a conflict short of war.^{34}\nOne assumption in cybersecurity literature is that offensive cyber operations are usually not escalatory until they cross a certain threshold. Once crossed, the power dynamics change and the operations can escalate—in the cyberdomain and cross-domain as well.^{35} However, public accusations can have a declarative-escalatory effect.^{36} States may choose not to publicly attribute an attack when attribution could cause undesirable escalation “outside the agreed competition space,” and that could publicly endanger rules or legal regimes outside the cyberdomain.^{37} This is based on the perception that defensive and offensive cyber activities are hard to distinguish, and that a defensive cyber action might be misinterpreted by the adversary as a preparation for attack.^{38}\nPublic attribution by senior officials has great political and geostrategical impact but also carries higher escalatory consequences and risks. Therefore, a target country wishing to respond to offensive cyber operations in the public arena and signal its adversary without risking escalation might use its intelligence agencies as the “first line” of public attribution, rather than a more declarative authority. This allows sending a clear message to the rival while staying below a threshold for undesirable escalation. While countries can opt to share information privately, including through direct channels between intelligence agencies such as the Five Eyes alliance, public attribution serves as a political and policy signal; privately conveying information does not.\n### Reputation for Credibility and Nonpartisanship\nPublic attribution plays a visible role in U.S. cyber strategy.^{39} Therefore, the way politicians communicate attribution findings to their various audiences—rival, domestic, and international—has critical bearing on how the message is received. However, this presents a challenge. High-level official attributions may carry a risk of escalation or other costs as mentioned, while nonofficial paths may not be perceived as credible. For the attribution to achieve maximum impact with minimum risk effectively, it should be highly credible, but also apolitical. Intelligence agencies often afford the best of both because they historically carry both reputations.\nFor example, according to the University of Texas at Austin's 2020 survey, a majority of Americans (64%) believe that the IC plays a vital role in protecting the nation. This popular support has proven consistent, bipartisan, and notably resilient over a four-year span marked by hostility and even “unprecedented assault” on American intelligence during the Trump presidency. Despite this tension, polling consistently confirmed a “durable reservoir of public confidence” in U.S. intelligence agencies.^{40} So, when\nintelligence agencies are making the public attribution, it is more likely that both the general public and the accused party perceive it as credible and reliable as an official statement, but not indicative of a policy shift or response.\n### Partnership Existence: International and Domestic\nThe importance of working with international allies and partners is highlighted throughout the U.S. cyber strategies. The 2023 Department of Defense (DoD) cyber strategy stated,“Our global Allies and partners represent a foundational strategic advantage for the United States. We will build the capacity and capability of U.S. Allies and partners in cyberspace and expand avenues of potential cyber cooperation. We will continue hunt forward operations and other bilateral technical collaboration, working with Allies and partners to illuminate malicious cyber activity on their networks.41”\nIn this context, the credibility of the U.S. intelligence agencies can also strengthen the credibility of the entire public attribution process in the eyes of its international partners and allies. This, in turn, can contribute to enhancing its international collaborations and helps the U.S. position itself as a world leader and authority in this field. One visible result is the joint public attributions that the United States and its allies have been doing in the past few years. A recent and salient example is the joint attribution by the European Union and United States of the hacking of ViaSat to Russia on the first day of the war in Ukraine.42\nThe U.S. government also has strong ties to the private sector in many fields. When it comes to the cyberdomain, the private sector often holds much more information than the government and intelligence agencies can without encroaching on citizens' privacy. This makes cooperation with private cybersecurity companies crucial in maintaining the health of the overall U.S. system, both public and private.43 One significant development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 DoD cyber strategy notes that private-sector parties (e.g. private cybersecurity firms) reporting on attribution “can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place,” and states that the DoD “will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution.”44 The importance of these companies is hard to overstate; they were the first to identify and reveal both the SolarWinds and DNC intrusions, discussed below.\nILLUSTRATIVE CASE STUDIES: THE SOLARWINDS AND THE DNC OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nIllustrative case studies (or plausibility probes) are used to shed light on a broader theoretical argument, especially for emerging or previously unstudied phenomena. They are brief by design, aiming “to give the reader a ‘feel' for a theoretical argument by providing a concrete example of its application, or to demonstrate the empirical relevance of a theoretical proposition by identifying at least one relevant case.”45 They serve as an exploratory step between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. With this in mind, the case studies below illustrate that the subject is ripe for research.\n### The SolarWinds Intrusion (2020)\nIn December 2020, the private cybersecurity company FireEye revealed an ongoing large-scale cyber operation, in which a rival country—believed to be Russia—gained access to multiple U.S. government agencies' networks. These included the Pentagon, the departments of Commerce, State, Treasury and Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Agency, as well as over 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, and many others.46\nSecurity researchers estimated that, starting in March 2020, and possibly earlier, Russian state-sponsored hackers gained access to the periodic update of SolarWinds' Orion IT-monitoring software, widely used by government and security agencies, leading private companies, and critical infrastructures. Orion is an IT performance monitoring system that has privileged access to IT systems to obtain log and system performance data.47 Consequently, anyone updating the software in fact granted the attackers potential access to their systems. Chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner, described the SolarWinds attack as “one of the most sophisticated and deep hacks we've faced.”48 The extent of the breach raised concerns that attackers could eventually use their access to harm American systems, disrupt or destroy information, and disable critical-system commands—although none of these are known to have happened to date. 49\nFormer Homeland Security advisor for the Trump administration, Thomas Bossert, described the intrusion as follows: “The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate. [...] The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months.”50 As the scale of the intrusion became clearer, there was no doubt the American government had failed to convince Russia there would be consequences to such broad hacking of federal government and corporate networks.51\nIn the SolarWinds case, FireEye identified a sophisticated nation-state hack into its own systems. The initial report was followed by extensive media coverage. Analysts quoted in the New York Times criticized the U.S. government for remaining silent on the attack: “It was hard to know which was worse: that the federal government was blindsided again by Russian intelligence agencies, or that when it was evident what was happening, White House officials said nothing.”52\nIn January 2021, the FBI, DNI, NSA, and CISA publicly attributed the attack to Russia.53 It was not until April 2021—four months after the attack was detected and first revealed—that the White House publicly attributed the attack to the Russian government. The Biden administration published an Executive Order denouncing the harmful foreign activities of the Russian government and unmasking Russian agencies and companies that aided the Kremlin's hacking efforts: “Today the United States is formally naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures. The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR.54”\nIn this case, the intelligence agencies made the public attribution before the president, despite public criticism. This served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation in the bilateral and international arena. This kind of escalation with Russia might have had an undesirable effect for President Biden's administration during his first days in office. At the same time, it preserved the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization during a sensitive time—mere days after the Trump--Biden transition.\nThe credibility of intelligence agencies in public attribution also served the United States in bolstering its relations with Europe and the international community. The White House announced that it was providing training to foreign ministry lawyers and policymakers on legal standards of state behavior in cyberspace and peacetime norms. At the same time, the United States also announced first-of-its-kind international training and assistance on policy and technical aspects of attribution, to take place through the Marshall Center in Germany and support policymakers in Europe and worldwide.55\n### The DNC Intrusion (2016)\nIn April 2016, the FBI informed the DNC that an unauthorized figure had obtained extensive permissions for the DNC computer network and that the DNC was “under serious cyberattack.”56 The DNC, the governing body of\nthe Democratic Party, was struck at a particularly sensitive time, several months ahead of the U.S. elections, and amid the campaign for the party's presidential nominee. The FBI was already monitoring suspicious activity in the network, and as early as September 2015 had warned the DNC that its network had been hacked by a Russian group dubbed “The Dukes.” The FBI already knew this group well, after detecting its attempts to break into the White House, State Department, and Joint Chief of Staff's email systems in previous years.57\nAt the end of April 2016, the DNC hired the services of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to address the attack.58 After a month of investigation, CrowdStrike attributed the intrusion to Russia, based on various technical clues, such as matching the attack times to working hours in the Moscow time zone.59 The campaign of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton grappled with considerable political fallout from the intrusion, including trying to refute the vast amounts of information published. The attack and resulting affair arguably influenced American public opinion during election season later that year.60\nThe first public attribution was made in June 2016 by CrowdStrike. In this case, experts called President Barak Obama and the government to attribute the attack publicly. For example, in July 2016, the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group issued a statement calling on President Obama to “ensure that the attacks are attributed and take prompt actions sufficient to hold those responsible accountable and deter foreign actors from pursuing such tactics in the future.”61\nIn October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement on behalf of the IC, explicitly attributing the attack to Russia and describing it as a direct order from the Russian government:“The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions. [...] We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.62”\nAt a press conference later that month, the White House spokesperson attributed the breach to the Russian government, adding that Russia's goals included attempts to undermine the stability of the U.S. political system.63 Only in his last days in office, in December 2016, did President Obama say in an interview that the “DNC hack traced to ‘highest levels' of the Kremlin.” President Obama said he similarly told Putin personally to “cut it out” in September but he refrained from public retaliation before the November election because it would “immediately be seen through a partisan lens.”64\nThe public disclosure of Russia's attempts to disrupt democratic elections and by extension international order drew the attention of other countries, who watched the United States closely to learn how it was dealing with attempted Russian cyber intrusions and cyber-enabled influence operations. The United States became the focus of interest of other democracies, such as France and Germany, which were headed toward elections and feared Russian intervention.65 The United States even provided intelligence and technical assistance. For example, the NSA warned France that Russian hackers were planning to disrupt its electoral process. This allowed a French counteraction, which included planting fake information for the hackers and ultimately minimized Russia's actual influence on the election process. With considerable experience confronting Russian cyber intrusions, the United States positioned itself as an international role model in dealing with ongoing Russian intrusions and influence attempts.66\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe SolarWinds and DNC intrusions illustrate the dynamic of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, in particular in the ongoing cyber conflict between the United States and Russia. The overall credibility U.S. intelligence agencies enjoy lent greater weight to their public attributions in the eyes of both domestic and international audiences. This enhanced the standing of the United States as an experienced cyberspace actor and allowed it to position itself as a leader in the international cybersecurity arena, further strengthening its partnerships and alliances.\nIn both cases, public attribution by U.S. intelligence agencies occurred in the timeframe between the technical attribution made by private cybersecurity companies and the political attribution ultimately made by the U.S. president, despite public criticism. This appears to have served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation. At the same time, it allowed the United States to preserve the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization on the domestic front.\nThis phenomenon is occurring in the context of a larger change in the role of intelligence agencies that is facilitated and forced by the rapid advance in cyber technologies and AI. These technologies have affected these agencies' missions, from intelligence gathering to actively carrying out defensive and offensive cyber operations. Offensive cyber operations are increasing in numbers and scales, becoming an integral component of global conflict, diplomacy, and politics. Intelligence agencies are now being asked to take the public stage—often before, or altogether instead of, the country's senior officials.\nThis study is meant to stimulate exploration and scholarship about the factors at play when intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public\nGIL BARAM\nattribution. Several avenues were presented. At the broadest, \"macroscale\" level there may be high variation between states on what entity communicates attribution publicly. If so, there may be common characteristics that make some entities better than others for specific signaling purposes. For example, when intelligence agencies are doing the public attribution, as happened in both cases presented here, they can convey a message to the private sector that it plays a vital role in this process and that the information received from these companies is indeed used for national security needs. One hypothesis worth future research is that this signal has a positive effect, increasing private companies' engagement and willingness to share information with the government in the future.\nSimilarly, intelligence agencies' perception of the threat that rivals in cyberspace pose, and how this affects their analyses and messaging, might be examined. In its 2021 Annual Threats Assessment, the ODNI estimated,\nCyber threats from nation states and their surrogates will remain acute. Foreign states use cyber operations to steal information, influence populations, and damage industry, including physical and digital critical infrastructure. Although an increasing number of countries and non-state actors have these capabilities, we remain most concerned about Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.[67]\nThe two cases presented here involved Russia. However, in other cases, like the breach into the Office of Personal Management and Sony hack (both in 2014) involving China and North Korea, respectively, there had been no public attribution by intelligence agencies. Was there something different about the threats China and North Korea posed that led to different attribution methods?\nFuture research may answer these and other questions, such as uncovering variables that correlate to use of intelligence agencies in public attributions. Possible candidates might include the target type, adversarial regime type, and more. Examining the reverse instances of this study—cases without attribution by intelligence agencies—might shed light on the question of when states might be likely to use—or not—their intelligence agencies as the front line of official public attribution.\nWith offensive cyber operations constantly on the rise and stakes for governments increasingly higher, intelligence agencies appear to be playing an increasingly important role in the process of public attribution. Distinguishing between various attribution strategies and intelligence agencies' roles within them can provide a deeper understanding of how states perceive the context of a particular offensive cyber operation, and highlight the dynamics, trade-offs, and functions policymakers face when deciding on the path for public attribution and its possible outcomes.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nThe author thanks Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance and Herb Lin, Jon Lindsay, Jelena Vičić, Amy Zegart, and the social sciences reading group at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of this article.\n# DISCLOSURE STATEMENT No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

This raises the question: Is there a role for intelligence agencies—which traditionally work behind the scenes—in public attribution of offensive cyber operations? If so, what are the features that make these agencies useful in such public announcements? To answer these two questions, this article examines the emerging phenomenon of U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributing offensive cyber operations and identifies three features that make these agencies effective in public attribution: they send signals below the adversary's escalation threshold, offer credibility and nonpartisanship, and have partnerships that enable them to succeed in the attribution process. The SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee intrusions are used as illustrative case studies to examine this phenomenon.

This offensive cyber operation utilized the American information technology (IT) company SolarWinds' regular software update, which had been infected with malicious code. More than 18,000 of SolarWinds' clients were estimated to be affected, among them many U.S. governmental agencies, including parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and more. So were private companies, like Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Deloitte, and other organizations. Microsoft president Brad Smith called it “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.”\nFireEye made the first attribution to a “highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.” Two weeks later, in January 2021, several U.S. intelligence agencies—the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA)—with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), publicly attributed the operation to “a Russian actor.” However, it was not until April 2021 that the Biden administration explicitly named the perpetrator as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\nThe fact that the country's intelligence agencies were the ones making the first official public attribution, several months before the president did so, highlights a puzzle: Intelligence agencies traditionally work behind the scenes, and unlike politicians and private cybersecurity companies, may have less incentive to publicize their activity, as this might endanger their sources and methods of operation. Furthermore, in some cases, offensive cyber operations can be kept covert and underreported so that countries do not concede they were cyberattacked. In view of these two factors, intelligence agencies seem unlikely to be the agents of publicity and public attribution. However, two cases in the United States suggested this might be otherwise.\nThis leads to a research question: Once intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public attribution, what are the features that make them effective at doing so? I argue that public attribution by intelligence agencies is an emerging phenomenon that deserves deeper examination, regarding two issues in particular. The first is the fact that this is indeed occurring, and therefore should be explored as another attribution path. The second issue warranting study regards the features of intelligence agencies that make their\npublic attribution effective. With governments consistently under cyberattacks and the global scope of offensive cyber operations rising, recognizing and understanding the public role of intelligence agencies is vital.\nThe first part of the article surveys the main literature addressing the changing role of intelligence agencies in the current information age, outlines the common possible attribution paths, and highlights one that has so far received little theoretical and empirical attention—public attribution by intelligence agencies. The second part presents the empirical data regarding public attribution by intelligence agencies and shows that this is a global phenomenon, although the United States is the leading country doing so. After empirically establishing attribution by intelligence agencies as a more common phenomenon than might be expected, the article turns to the third part to ask what features of the intelligence agencies make them effective in doing public attributions. Three features are discussed: (1) they can send a credible signal beneath the escalation threshold, (2) they are perceived as professional and “a-political,” (3) their connections with the private sector and international partners. In the fourth part, I use the SolarWinds (2020) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC; 2016) intrusions as illustrative case studies intended to give the reader an initial sense of the way these functions work. The fifth and final part discusses the conclusions of this research, its policy-relevant implications, and offers avenues for future research.\n## INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE\nWhen approaching the role of intelligence agencies in public attribution of offensive cyber operations, one must first consider the way their role at large is affected by rapid technological changes. Over the past decade, intelligence work has undergone a tremendous change, and today it is not only intelligence gathering and covert actions but also carrying out offensive and defensive cyber operations. The new function and scale are both enabled by advanced cyber technologies that allow obtaining and analyzing information in ways and scopes that did not exist in the past. This is further amplified by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, used to “amplify the effectiveness of our workforce ... advance mission capability and enhance the IC's [Intelligence Community's] ability to provide data interpretation to decision makers.” This change in scope and scale offers both opportunities and challenges, and requires intelligence agencies to adapt and change: “[T]he Intelligence Community faces a moment of reckoning. If the IC cannot adopt AI and other emerging technologies successfully, it risks failure.” This challenge should be kept in mind when discussing public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies.\nIntelligence agencies' work is usually being done “behind the scenes,” and when it comes to offensive cyber operations, secrecy was considered an inherent feature.10 General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency, noted that, in the beginning, “even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself.”11 While literature is offering new perspectives on the changes in intelligence agencies' work, it mostly continues to perceive their role as covert and silent.12 However, cyber technologies enable intelligence agencies to operate on much larger scales than in the past, which may conflict with the traditional secrecy of intelligence operations; the larger the scale, the higher the risk of exposure might be.13 This article explores circumstances in which intelligence agencies abandon secrecy and thus take their place on stage.\n## Public attribution of offensive cyber operations\nGovernments and private firms that suffered a cyberattack have incentives for keeping cyber intrusions secret, “Lest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment.”14 In certain cases, target states may be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of these operations, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.15 There is no pride involved in being a victim, and target states might opt for silence so as not to “admit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned.”16\nAttribution of offensive cyber operations has been studied from several different perspectives. These include the attribution problem and its meanings, the uniqueness of attribution in cyberspace compared to other domains, the different attribution pathways, and the various calculations decisionmakers should take into account when deciding on attribution.17 Additional scholarship has highlighted the challenge in identifying and attributing the source of an attack, the meaning of anonymity, and the difficulties this poses to the defender when deciding how to react.18\nIntelligence agencies face a dilemma regarding the amount and nature of information required for reaching public attribution: Should this information relate to an individual, or the state? How much evidence is required to reveal and what might be the implication for this publicity? Public attribution by a government requires intelligence agencies to provide the relevant technical and operational information. However, when it comes to public attribution they are often hesitant to disclose this because of the potential damage to their intelligence methods, sources, and access to vital assets.19\nThe attribution process by states consists of two main stages. The first is an analytic process—which is historical and backward-looking—identifying what happened and who did it. This includes establishing the technical facts of the intrusion and checking the attacker's techniques against those of previously identified actors. Every attribution of an offensive cyber operation begins with a technical and forensic investigation based on known data and information and indicators—such as technical identifiers and pieces of code—in order to understand the scale of the offensive cyber operation, the severity of the damage, the goal of the adversary, and so on. The objective of this investigation is to ensure the safety of the affected networks and computer systems.^{20}\nThe second stage is a strategic process, which is more forward-looking; deciding what should be communicated, by whom, and how. In this part, the target state determines what it wants to do with the findings of this forensic investigation, in keeping with its broader strategic goals and political considerations. In this stage, states can decide how they wish to communicate the attribution findings to other audiences in order to influence the interpretation of a particular incident.^{21} This stage is mainly driven by a state's policy considerations, and it can communicate its findings using one or more of five general attribution paths, separately or in concert^{22}: Technical: providing technical--forensic information that will help other entities patch their vulnerabilities and protect themselves. This kind of attribution can be done by the private sector, NGOs, or state agencies. In the U.S. context, this is done mainly by CISA and the FBI.^{23} Criminal: criminal proceedings against individuals. If a malicious cyber incident is regarded as a matter for domestic law enforcement authorities, then legal requirements for process, standards of evidence, and degrees of certainty about attribution apply^{24}; Political, Unofficial: by talking to the press under terms of anonymity; Political, Official: public attribution by state political officials, such as the president, secretary of state, secretary of homeland security and others; and Multicountry collaboration: public attribution by a number of countries together. This kind of attribution requires trust between the participating states as it requires each state to share at least some of its information and intelligence.^{25}\nIn recent years, there have been cases in which the intelligence agencies were the ones doing the public attribution, potentially signaling a new official attribution path. In the next paragraphs, I will examine where this occurs along the national decisionmaking process, and discuss the data and identify the possible reasons they are doing so in the U.S. case.\nTo illustrate this decisionmaking process, we can look at the U.S.-specific decision tree in Figure 1. This flowchart helps explain two main factors in the attribution process—the echelon of the organizational hierarchy that\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 1. Attribution decision-making process (U.S.-specific).\nperforms the attribution, and the specific function within this level. The point of departure is that an offensive cyber operation has taken place and has been detected by the defender, and the analytical attribution process has been done. Now, decisionmakers face the question whether to reveal the identity of the attacker or not. If not, there are two options: First, maintain silence. Second, provide information to private security companies so they will do the attribution.\nIf the decision is to reveal the identity of the attacker, once again there are two options. The first of these is nonofficial attribution, which can be publicizing the information in anonymous ways—such as talking to the press under terms of anonymity, off-record briefing, or leaking. The second is official attribution by the U.S. government. Official response can be done by the White House or Executive Office of the President; other Cabinet departments, such as the Department of Defence, Department of Justice, or Department of Homeland Security; or by intelligence agencies. The last is the focus of this study.\n# PUBLICITY AND OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE\nWhile targeted states might have clear incentives not to acknowledge having been attacked, they do not always have a choice. The magnitude of some cyber intrusions, in addition to related rumors and media reports, makes it difficult for states to avoid any public response altogether. In order to examine the phenomenon of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, I took an empirical approach, examining offensive\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncyber operations to identify the agent of publicity in each case in order to map the relevant cases. This part serves as the basis for the qualitative examination through the illustrative case studies that follow. The following paragraphs and figures present the data on publicity of offensive cyber operations in general and specific data regarding the different entities revealing them, and the role of intelligence agencies within this. These show that public attribution by intelligence agencies is indeed an empirical phenomenon.\nHere it is important to address the so-called unknown unknowns or unobserved offensive cyber operations.27 These are offensive cyber operations assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources used for this research. For the purposes of this article, only offensive cyber operations that have been publicly revealed and for which there exists sufficient data to code in the dataset have been included. The presumed existence of unknown unknowns should not preclude scholars from researching these issues, which are changing the landscape of cyberwarfare politics.28\n### Data Compilation\nData compilation included three preexisting datasets, plus additional sources. The first is the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset Version 1.1,29 which provides data on the presence of cyber conflict in the existing conflicts between 2001 and 2014. To this was added new data on cyberattacks and intrusions for the years 1996 to 2019 based on the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations tracker.30 Finally, the relevant data for the years prior to 2001 were added, based on the National Security Archive Cyber Vault Project.31 All data were verified, then recoded using a new schema of variables and scaling.\nThe compilation and updating process also relied on reports in media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. This allowed supplementing the existing data with any new information that had come to light since the incident, and was published via mainstream media, threat intelligence reports, cybersecurity magazines, or cybersecurity companies. For verification purposes, each incident included in the dataset has at least two reliable sources and was examined by two independent coders. The dataset was finalized in June 2019 and includes 476 cyber incidents. All data was collected from open sources.\n### Entity Exposing the Attacker\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the actors that revealed the offensive cyber operation public attribution for the years 2005 to 2019. In half the cases, private cybersecurity companies were the ones to expose the attack.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Entity exposing the attacker (2005-2019).\nHowever, as illustrated below, intelligence and defense agencies revealed the attacker's identity in  $13\\%$  of the cases, doing so at higher rates than senior officials, who attributed offensive cyber operations in  $10\\%$  of the cases. This finding is particularly interesting given the general perception of intelligence organizations as secret agencies that do not disclose information to the public.\n# Global Phenomenon\nFigure 3 illustrates the data for public attribution by defense and intelligence agencies in different countries ( $N = 43$ ). While the United States clearly leads this practice, it is also being done in Germany, South Korea, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Examples of the agencies making public attributions include defense agencies such as CISA, Norway's Policy Security Service, the Polish Computer Emergency Response Team, the Security Service of Ukraine, and intelligence agencies such as the DNI, FBI, and NSA in the United States and Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV). This research focuses on the United States only, for reasons discussed in the next section.\n# Focusing on the United States\nThis article focuses on the United States for two reasons. The first is that the United States is the dominant country for this path, meaning it had the\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nFigure 3. Attribution by defense and intelligence agencies (2005-2019).\nhighest number of intelligence and defense agency attributions of the countries examined. The second relates to organizational differences. In some countries, the boundaries between intelligence agencies, other defense agencies, and law enforcement agencies is blurred. For example, cases in which the FBI was the only attributing agency are included in the data but excluded from the analysis. The U.S. cases allow for better distinguishing between the various agencies. Even with, for example, the NSA and Cyber Command being under the same roof and command, I was able to focus on cases that were attributed by the U.S. IC as a whole.\n# FEATURES OF INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE IN PUBLIC ATTRIBUTIONS\nExamination of the available evidence suggested three features of intelligence agencies that make them effective in public attributions: ability to signal below escalation threshold, reputation for credibility and nonpartisanship, and partnership existence—domestic and international. I then used two of the recent best-documented cyber operations—the SolarWinds and the DNC intrusions—as illustrative case studies in order to trace and examine the use of intelligence agencies for public attribution of offensive cyber operations.\n# Signal Beneath the Escalation Threshold\nThe nonescalatory nature of offensive cyber operations has been widely discussed in the past few years. Despite the preliminary expectations that offensive cyber operations would lead to cyber war—such as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warning against the possibility of a “cyber-Pearl Harbor”—real-world events so far proved differently. The literature that followed showed that these kinds of operations did not lead to escalation\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 0, NUMBER 0\nof war, and scholars offer to see offensive cyber operations as a conflict short of war.^{34}\nOne assumption in cybersecurity literature is that offensive cyber operations are usually not escalatory until they cross a certain threshold. Once crossed, the power dynamics change and the operations can escalate—in the cyberdomain and cross-domain as well.^{35} However, public accusations can have a declarative-escalatory effect.^{36} States may choose not to publicly attribute an attack when attribution could cause undesirable escalation “outside the agreed competition space,” and that could publicly endanger rules or legal regimes outside the cyberdomain.^{37} This is based on the perception that defensive and offensive cyber activities are hard to distinguish, and that a defensive cyber action might be misinterpreted by the adversary as a preparation for attack.^{38}\nPublic attribution by senior officials has great political and geostrategical impact but also carries higher escalatory consequences and risks. Therefore, a target country wishing to respond to offensive cyber operations in the public arena and signal its adversary without risking escalation might use its intelligence agencies as the “first line” of public attribution, rather than a more declarative authority. This allows sending a clear message to the rival while staying below a threshold for undesirable escalation. While countries can opt to share information privately, including through direct channels between intelligence agencies such as the Five Eyes alliance, public attribution serves as a political and policy signal; privately conveying information does not.\n### Reputation for Credibility and Nonpartisanship\nPublic attribution plays a visible role in U.S. cyber strategy.^{39} Therefore, the way politicians communicate attribution findings to their various audiences—rival, domestic, and international—has critical bearing on how the message is received. However, this presents a challenge. High-level official attributions may carry a risk of escalation or other costs as mentioned, while nonofficial paths may not be perceived as credible. For the attribution to achieve maximum impact with minimum risk effectively, it should be highly credible, but also apolitical. Intelligence agencies often afford the best of both because they historically carry both reputations.\nFor example, according to the University of Texas at Austin's 2020 survey, a majority of Americans (64%) believe that the IC plays a vital role in protecting the nation. This popular support has proven consistent, bipartisan, and notably resilient over a four-year span marked by hostility and even “unprecedented assault” on American intelligence during the Trump presidency. Despite this tension, polling consistently confirmed a “durable reservoir of public confidence” in U.S. intelligence agencies.^{40} So, when\nintelligence agencies are making the public attribution, it is more likely that both the general public and the accused party perceive it as credible and reliable as an official statement, but not indicative of a policy shift or response.\n### Partnership Existence: International and Domestic\nThe importance of working with international allies and partners is highlighted throughout the U.S. cyber strategies. The 2023 Department of Defense (DoD) cyber strategy stated,“Our global Allies and partners represent a foundational strategic advantage for the United States. We will build the capacity and capability of U.S. Allies and partners in cyberspace and expand avenues of potential cyber cooperation. We will continue hunt forward operations and other bilateral technical collaboration, working with Allies and partners to illuminate malicious cyber activity on their networks.41”\nIn this context, the credibility of the U.S. intelligence agencies can also strengthen the credibility of the entire public attribution process in the eyes of its international partners and allies. This, in turn, can contribute to enhancing its international collaborations and helps the U.S. position itself as a world leader and authority in this field. One visible result is the joint public attributions that the United States and its allies have been doing in the past few years. A recent and salient example is the joint attribution by the European Union and United States of the hacking of ViaSat to Russia on the first day of the war in Ukraine.42\nThe U.S. government also has strong ties to the private sector in many fields. When it comes to the cyberdomain, the private sector often holds much more information than the government and intelligence agencies can without encroaching on citizens' privacy. This makes cooperation with private cybersecurity companies crucial in maintaining the health of the overall U.S. system, both public and private.43 One significant development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 DoD cyber strategy notes that private-sector parties (e.g. private cybersecurity firms) reporting on attribution “can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place,” and states that the DoD “will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution.”44 The importance of these companies is hard to overstate; they were the first to identify and reveal both the SolarWinds and DNC intrusions, discussed below.\nILLUSTRATIVE CASE STUDIES: THE SOLARWINDS AND THE DNC OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nIllustrative case studies (or plausibility probes) are used to shed light on a broader theoretical argument, especially for emerging or previously unstudied phenomena. They are brief by design, aiming “to give the reader a ‘feel' for a theoretical argument by providing a concrete example of its application, or to demonstrate the empirical relevance of a theoretical proposition by identifying at least one relevant case.”45 They serve as an exploratory step between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. With this in mind, the case studies below illustrate that the subject is ripe for research.\n### The SolarWinds Intrusion (2020)\nIn December 2020, the private cybersecurity company FireEye revealed an ongoing large-scale cyber operation, in which a rival country—believed to be Russia—gained access to multiple U.S. government agencies' networks. These included the Pentagon, the departments of Commerce, State, Treasury and Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Agency, as well as over 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, and many others.46\nSecurity researchers estimated that, starting in March 2020, and possibly earlier, Russian state-sponsored hackers gained access to the periodic update of SolarWinds' Orion IT-monitoring software, widely used by government and security agencies, leading private companies, and critical infrastructures. Orion is an IT performance monitoring system that has privileged access to IT systems to obtain log and system performance data.47 Consequently, anyone updating the software in fact granted the attackers potential access to their systems. Chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner, described the SolarWinds attack as “one of the most sophisticated and deep hacks we've faced.”48 The extent of the breach raised concerns that attackers could eventually use their access to harm American systems, disrupt or destroy information, and disable critical-system commands—although none of these are known to have happened to date. 49\nFormer Homeland Security advisor for the Trump administration, Thomas Bossert, described the intrusion as follows: “The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate. [...] The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months.”50 As the scale of the intrusion became clearer, there was no doubt the American government had failed to convince Russia there would be consequences to such broad hacking of federal government and corporate networks.51\nIn the SolarWinds case, FireEye identified a sophisticated nation-state hack into its own systems. The initial report was followed by extensive media coverage. Analysts quoted in the New York Times criticized the U.S. government for remaining silent on the attack: “It was hard to know which was worse: that the federal government was blindsided again by Russian intelligence agencies, or that when it was evident what was happening, White House officials said nothing.”52\nIn January 2021, the FBI, DNI, NSA, and CISA publicly attributed the attack to Russia.53 It was not until April 2021—four months after the attack was detected and first revealed—that the White House publicly attributed the attack to the Russian government. The Biden administration published an Executive Order denouncing the harmful foreign activities of the Russian government and unmasking Russian agencies and companies that aided the Kremlin's hacking efforts: “Today the United States is formally naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures. The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR.54”\nIn this case, the intelligence agencies made the public attribution before the president, despite public criticism. This served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation in the bilateral and international arena. This kind of escalation with Russia might have had an undesirable effect for President Biden's administration during his first days in office. At the same time, it preserved the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization during a sensitive time—mere days after the Trump--Biden transition.\nThe credibility of intelligence agencies in public attribution also served the United States in bolstering its relations with Europe and the international community. The White House announced that it was providing training to foreign ministry lawyers and policymakers on legal standards of state behavior in cyberspace and peacetime norms. At the same time, the United States also announced first-of-its-kind international training and assistance on policy and technical aspects of attribution, to take place through the Marshall Center in Germany and support policymakers in Europe and worldwide.55\n### The DNC Intrusion (2016)\nIn April 2016, the FBI informed the DNC that an unauthorized figure had obtained extensive permissions for the DNC computer network and that the DNC was “under serious cyberattack.”56 The DNC, the governing body of\nthe Democratic Party, was struck at a particularly sensitive time, several months ahead of the U.S. elections, and amid the campaign for the party's presidential nominee. The FBI was already monitoring suspicious activity in the network, and as early as September 2015 had warned the DNC that its network had been hacked by a Russian group dubbed “The Dukes.” The FBI already knew this group well, after detecting its attempts to break into the White House, State Department, and Joint Chief of Staff's email systems in previous years.57\nAt the end of April 2016, the DNC hired the services of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to address the attack.58 After a month of investigation, CrowdStrike attributed the intrusion to Russia, based on various technical clues, such as matching the attack times to working hours in the Moscow time zone.59 The campaign of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton grappled with considerable political fallout from the intrusion, including trying to refute the vast amounts of information published. The attack and resulting affair arguably influenced American public opinion during election season later that year.60\nThe first public attribution was made in June 2016 by CrowdStrike. In this case, experts called President Barak Obama and the government to attribute the attack publicly. For example, in July 2016, the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group issued a statement calling on President Obama to “ensure that the attacks are attributed and take prompt actions sufficient to hold those responsible accountable and deter foreign actors from pursuing such tactics in the future.”61\nIn October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement on behalf of the IC, explicitly attributing the attack to Russia and describing it as a direct order from the Russian government:“The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions. [...] We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.62”\nAt a press conference later that month, the White House spokesperson attributed the breach to the Russian government, adding that Russia's goals included attempts to undermine the stability of the U.S. political system.63 Only in his last days in office, in December 2016, did President Obama say in an interview that the “DNC hack traced to ‘highest levels' of the Kremlin.” President Obama said he similarly told Putin personally to “cut it out” in September but he refrained from public retaliation before the November election because it would “immediately be seen through a partisan lens.”64\nThe public disclosure of Russia's attempts to disrupt democratic elections and by extension international order drew the attention of other countries, who watched the United States closely to learn how it was dealing with attempted Russian cyber intrusions and cyber-enabled influence operations. The United States became the focus of interest of other democracies, such as France and Germany, which were headed toward elections and feared Russian intervention.65 The United States even provided intelligence and technical assistance. For example, the NSA warned France that Russian hackers were planning to disrupt its electoral process. This allowed a French counteraction, which included planting fake information for the hackers and ultimately minimized Russia's actual influence on the election process. With considerable experience confronting Russian cyber intrusions, the United States positioned itself as an international role model in dealing with ongoing Russian intrusions and influence attempts.66\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe SolarWinds and DNC intrusions illustrate the dynamic of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, in particular in the ongoing cyber conflict between the United States and Russia. The overall credibility U.S. intelligence agencies enjoy lent greater weight to their public attributions in the eyes of both domestic and international audiences. This enhanced the standing of the United States as an experienced cyberspace actor and allowed it to position itself as a leader in the international cybersecurity arena, further strengthening its partnerships and alliances.\nIn both cases, public attribution by U.S. intelligence agencies occurred in the timeframe between the technical attribution made by private cybersecurity companies and the political attribution ultimately made by the U.S. president, despite public criticism. This appears to have served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation. At the same time, it allowed the United States to preserve the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization on the domestic front.\nThis phenomenon is occurring in the context of a larger change in the role of intelligence agencies that is facilitated and forced by the rapid advance in cyber technologies and AI. These technologies have affected these agencies' missions, from intelligence gathering to actively carrying out defensive and offensive cyber operations. Offensive cyber operations are increasing in numbers and scales, becoming an integral component of global conflict, diplomacy, and politics. Intelligence agencies are now being asked to take the public stage—often before, or altogether instead of, the country's senior officials.\nThis study is meant to stimulate exploration and scholarship about the factors at play when intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public\nGIL BARAM\nattribution. Several avenues were presented. At the broadest, \"macroscale\" level there may be high variation between states on what entity communicates attribution publicly. If so, there may be common characteristics that make some entities better than others for specific signaling purposes. For example, when intelligence agencies are doing the public attribution, as happened in both cases presented here, they can convey a message to the private sector that it plays a vital role in this process and that the information received from these companies is indeed used for national security needs. One hypothesis worth future research is that this signal has a positive effect, increasing private companies' engagement and willingness to share information with the government in the future.\nSimilarly, intelligence agencies' perception of the threat that rivals in cyberspace pose, and how this affects their analyses and messaging, might be examined. In its 2021 Annual Threats Assessment, the ODNI estimated,\nCyber threats from nation states and their surrogates will remain acute. Foreign states use cyber operations to steal information, influence populations, and damage industry, including physical and digital critical infrastructure. Although an increasing number of countries and non-state actors have these capabilities, we remain most concerned about Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.\nThe two cases presented here involved Russia. However, in other cases, like the breach into the Office of Personal Management and Sony hack (both in 2014) involving China and North Korea, respectively, there had been no public attribution by intelligence agencies. Was there something different about the threats China and North Korea posed that led to different attribution methods?\nFuture research may answer these and other questions, such as uncovering variables that correlate to use of intelligence agencies in public attributions. Possible candidates might include the target type, adversarial regime type, and more. Examining the reverse instances of this study—cases without attribution by intelligence agencies—might shed light on the question of when states might be likely to use—or not—their intelligence agencies as the front line of official public attribution.\nWith offensive cyber operations constantly on the rise and stakes for governments increasingly higher, intelligence agencies appear to be playing an increasingly important role in the process of public attribution. Distinguishing between various attribution strategies and intelligence agencies' roles within them can provide a deeper understanding of how states perceive the context of a particular offensive cyber operation, and highlight the dynamics, trade-offs, and functions policymakers face when deciding on the path for public attribution and its possible outcomes.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\n17\n# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author thanks Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance and Herb Lin, Jon Lindsay, Jelena Vičić, Amy Zegart, and the social sciences reading group at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of this article.\n# DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s)."

This raises the question: Is there a role for intelligence agencies—which traditionally work behind the scenes—in public attribution of offensive cyber operations? If so, what are the features that make these agencies useful in such public announcements? To answer these two questions, this article examines the emerging phenomenon of U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributing offensive cyber operations and identifies three features that make these agencies effective in public attribution: they send signals below the adversary's escalation threshold, offer credibility and nonpartisanship, and have partnerships that enable them to succeed in the attribution process. The SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee intrusions are used as illustrative case studies to examine this phenomenon.

This offensive cyber operation utilized the American information technology (IT) company SolarWinds' regular software update, which had been infected with malicious code. More than 18,000 of SolarWinds' clients were estimated to be affected, among them many U.S. governmental agencies, including parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and more. So were private companies, like Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Deloitte, and other organizations. Microsoft president Brad Smith called it “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.”\nFireEye made the first attribution to a “highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.” Two weeks later, in January 2021, several U.S. intelligence agencies—the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA)—with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), publicly attributed the operation to “a Russian actor.” However, it was not until April 2021 that the Biden administration explicitly named the perpetrator as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\nThe fact that the country's intelligence agencies were the ones making the first official public attribution, several months before the president did so, highlights a puzzle: Intelligence agencies traditionally work behind the scenes, and unlike politicians and private cybersecurity companies, may have less incentive to publicize their activity, as this might endanger their sources and methods of operation. Furthermore, in some cases, offensive cyber operations can be kept covert and underreported so that countries do not concede they were cyberattacked. In view of these two factors, intelligence agencies seem unlikely to be the agents of publicity and public attribution. However, two cases in the United States suggested this might be otherwise.\nThis leads to a research question: Once intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public attribution, what are the features that make them effective at doing so? I argue that public attribution by intelligence agencies is an emerging phenomenon that deserves deeper examination, regarding two issues in particular. The first is the fact that this is indeed occurring, and therefore should be explored as another attribution path. The second issue warranting study regards the features of intelligence agencies that make their\npublic attribution effective. With governments consistently under cyberattacks and the global scope of offensive cyber operations rising, recognizing and understanding the public role of intelligence agencies is vital.\nThe first part of the article surveys the main literature addressing the changing role of intelligence agencies in the current information age, outlines the common possible attribution paths, and highlights one that has so far received little theoretical and empirical attention—public attribution by intelligence agencies. The second part presents the empirical data regarding public attribution by intelligence agencies and shows that this is a global phenomenon, although the United States is the leading country doing so. After empirically establishing attribution by intelligence agencies as a more common phenomenon than might be expected, the article turns to the third part to ask what features of the intelligence agencies make them effective in doing public attributions. Three features are discussed: (1) they can send a credible signal beneath the escalation threshold, (2) they are perceived as professional and “a-political,” (3) their connections with the private sector and international partners. In the fourth part, I use the SolarWinds (2020) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC; 2016) intrusions as illustrative case studies intended to give the reader an initial sense of the way these functions work. The fifth and final part discusses the conclusions of this research, its policy-relevant implications, and offers avenues for future research.\n## INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE\nWhen approaching the role of intelligence agencies in public attribution of offensive cyber operations, one must first consider the way their role at large is affected by rapid technological changes. Over the past decade, intelligence work has undergone a tremendous change, and today it is not only intelligence gathering and covert actions but also carrying out offensive and defensive cyber operations. The new function and scale are both enabled by advanced cyber technologies that allow obtaining and analyzing information in ways and scopes that did not exist in the past. This is further amplified by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, used to “amplify the effectiveness of our workforce ... advance mission capability and enhance the IC's [Intelligence Community's] ability to provide data interpretation to decision makers.” This change in scope and scale offers both opportunities and challenges, and requires intelligence agencies to adapt and change: “[T]he Intelligence Community faces a moment of reckoning. If the IC cannot adopt AI and other emerging technologies successfully, it risks failure.” This challenge should be kept in mind when discussing public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies.\nIntelligence agencies' work is usually being done “behind the scenes,” and when it comes to offensive cyber operations, secrecy was considered an inherent feature.10 General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency, noted that, in the beginning, “even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself.”11 While literature is offering new perspectives on the changes in intelligence agencies' work, it mostly continues to perceive their role as covert and silent.12 However, cyber technologies enable intelligence agencies to operate on much larger scales than in the past, which may conflict with the traditional secrecy of intelligence operations; the larger the scale, the higher the risk of exposure might be.13 This article explores circumstances in which intelligence agencies abandon secrecy and thus take their place on stage.\n## Public attribution of offensive cyber operations\nGovernments and private firms that suffered a cyberattack have incentives for keeping cyber intrusions secret, “Lest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment.”14 In certain cases, target states may be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of these operations, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.15 There is no pride involved in being a victim, and target states might opt for silence so as not to “admit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned.”16\nAttribution of offensive cyber operations has been studied from several different perspectives. These include the attribution problem and its meanings, the uniqueness of attribution in cyberspace compared to other domains, the different attribution pathways, and the various calculations decisionmakers should take into account when deciding on attribution.17 Additional scholarship has highlighted the challenge in identifying and attributing the source of an attack, the meaning of anonymity, and the difficulties this poses to the defender when deciding how to react.18\nIntelligence agencies face a dilemma regarding the amount and nature of information required for reaching public attribution: Should this information relate to an individual, or the state? How much evidence is required to reveal and what might be the implication for this publicity? Public attribution by a government requires intelligence agencies to provide the relevant technical and operational information. However, when it comes to public attribution they are often hesitant to disclose this because of the potential damage to their intelligence methods, sources, and access to vital assets.19\nThe attribution process by states consists of two main stages. The first is an analytic process—which is historical and backward-looking—identifying what happened and who did it. This includes establishing the technical facts of the intrusion and checking the attacker's techniques against those of previously identified actors. Every attribution of an offensive cyber operation begins with a technical and forensic investigation based on known data and information and indicators—such as technical identifiers and pieces of code—in order to understand the scale of the offensive cyber operation, the severity of the damage, the goal of the adversary, and so on. The objective of this investigation is to ensure the safety of the affected networks and computer systems.^{20}\nThe second stage is a strategic process, which is more forward-looking; deciding what should be communicated, by whom, and how. In this part, the target state determines what it wants to do with the findings of this forensic investigation, in keeping with its broader strategic goals and political considerations. In this stage, states can decide how they wish to communicate the attribution findings to other audiences in order to influence the interpretation of a particular incident.^{21} This stage is mainly driven by a state's policy considerations, and it can communicate its findings using one or more of five general attribution paths, separately or in concert^{22}: Technical: providing technical--forensic information that will help other entities patch their vulnerabilities and protect themselves. This kind of attribution can be done by the private sector, NGOs, or state agencies. In the U.S. context, this is done mainly by CISA and the FBI.^{23} Criminal: criminal proceedings against individuals. If a malicious cyber incident is regarded as a matter for domestic law enforcement authorities, then legal requirements for process, standards of evidence, and degrees of certainty about attribution apply^{24}; Political, Unofficial: by talking to the press under terms of anonymity; Political, Official: public attribution by state political officials, such as the president, secretary of state, secretary of homeland security and others; and Multicountry collaboration: public attribution by a number of countries together. This kind of attribution requires trust between the participating states as it requires each state to share at least some of its information and intelligence.^{25}\nIn recent years, there have been cases in which the intelligence agencies were the ones doing the public attribution, potentially signaling a new official attribution path. In the next paragraphs, I will examine where this occurs along the national decisionmaking process, and discuss the data and identify the possible reasons they are doing so in the U.S. case.\nTo illustrate this decisionmaking process, we can look at the U.S.-specific decision tree in Figure 1. This flowchart helps explain two main factors in the attribution process—the echelon of the organizational hierarchy that\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 1. Attribution decision-making process (U.S.-specific).\nperforms the attribution, and the specific function within this level. The point of departure is that an offensive cyber operation has taken place and has been detected by the defender, and the analytical attribution process has been done. Now, decisionmakers face the question whether to reveal the identity of the attacker or not. If not, there are two options: First, maintain silence. Second, provide information to private security companies so they will do the attribution.\nIf the decision is to reveal the identity of the attacker, once again there are two options. The first of these is nonofficial attribution, which can be publicizing the information in anonymous ways—such as talking to the press under terms of anonymity, off-record briefing, or leaking. The second is official attribution by the U.S. government. Official response can be done by the White House or Executive Office of the President; other Cabinet departments, such as the Department of Defence, Department of Justice, or Department of Homeland Security; or by intelligence agencies. The last is the focus of this study.\n# PUBLICITY AND OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE\nWhile targeted states might have clear incentives not to acknowledge having been attacked, they do not always have a choice. The magnitude of some cyber intrusions, in addition to related rumors and media reports, makes it difficult for states to avoid any public response altogether. In order to examine the phenomenon of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, I took an empirical approach, examining offensive\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncyber operations to identify the agent of publicity in each case in order to map the relevant cases. This part serves as the basis for the qualitative examination through the illustrative case studies that follow. The following paragraphs and figures present the data on publicity of offensive cyber operations in general and specific data regarding the different entities revealing them, and the role of intelligence agencies within this. These show that public attribution by intelligence agencies is indeed an empirical phenomenon.\nHere it is important to address the so-called unknown unknowns or unobserved offensive cyber operations.27 These are offensive cyber operations assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources used for this research. For the purposes of this article, only offensive cyber operations that have been publicly revealed and for which there exists sufficient data to code in the dataset have been included. The presumed existence of unknown unknowns should not preclude scholars from researching these issues, which are changing the landscape of cyberwarfare politics.28\n### Data Compilation\nData compilation included three preexisting datasets, plus additional sources. The first is the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset Version 1.1,29 which provides data on the presence of cyber conflict in the existing conflicts between 2001 and 2014. To this was added new data on cyberattacks and intrusions for the years 1996 to 2019 based on the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations tracker.30 Finally, the relevant data for the years prior to 2001 were added, based on the National Security Archive Cyber Vault Project.31 All data were verified, then recoded using a new schema of variables and scaling.\nThe compilation and updating process also relied on reports in media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. This allowed supplementing the existing data with any new information that had come to light since the incident, and was published via mainstream media, threat intelligence reports, cybersecurity magazines, or cybersecurity companies. For verification purposes, each incident included in the dataset has at least two reliable sources and was examined by two independent coders. The dataset was finalized in June 2019 and includes 476 cyber incidents. All data was collected from open sources.\n### Entity Exposing the Attacker\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the actors that revealed the offensive cyber operation public attribution for the years 2005 to 2019. In half the cases, private cybersecurity companies were the ones to expose the attack.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Entity exposing the attacker (2005-2019).\nHowever, as illustrated below, intelligence and defense agencies revealed the attacker's identity in  $13\\%$  of the cases, doing so at higher rates than senior officials, who attributed offensive cyber operations in  $10\\%$  of the cases. This finding is particularly interesting given the general perception of intelligence organizations as secret agencies that do not disclose information to the public.\n# Global Phenomenon\nFigure 3 illustrates the data for public attribution by defense and intelligence agencies in different countries ( $N = 43$ ). While the United States clearly leads this practice, it is also being done in Germany, South Korea, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Examples of the agencies making public attributions include defense agencies such as CISA, Norway's Policy Security Service, the Polish Computer Emergency Response Team, the Security Service of Ukraine, and intelligence agencies such as the DNI, FBI, and NSA in the United States and Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV). This research focuses on the United States only, for reasons discussed in the next section.\n# Focusing on the United States\nThis article focuses on the United States for two reasons. The first is that the United States is the dominant country for this path, meaning it had the\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nFigure 3. Attribution by defense and intelligence agencies (2005-2019).\nhighest number of intelligence and defense agency attributions of the countries examined. The second relates to organizational differences. In some countries, the boundaries between intelligence agencies, other defense agencies, and law enforcement agencies is blurred. For example, cases in which the FBI was the only attributing agency are included in the data but excluded from the analysis. The U.S. cases allow for better distinguishing between the various agencies. Even with, for example, the NSA and Cyber Command being under the same roof and command, I was able to focus on cases that were attributed by the U.S. IC as a whole.\n# FEATURES OF INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE IN PUBLIC ATTRIBUTIONS\nExamination of the available evidence suggested three features of intelligence agencies that make them effective in public attributions: ability to signal below escalation threshold, reputation for credibility and nonpartisanship, and partnership existence—domestic and international. I then used two of the recent best-documented cyber operations—the SolarWinds and the DNC intrusions—as illustrative case studies in order to trace and examine the use of intelligence agencies for public attribution of offensive cyber operations.\n# Signal Beneath the Escalation Threshold\nThe nonescalatory nature of offensive cyber operations has been widely discussed in the past few years. Despite the preliminary expectations that offensive cyber operations would lead to cyber war—such as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warning against the possibility of a “cyber-Pearl Harbor”—real-world events so far proved differently. The literature that followed showed that these kinds of operations did not lead to escalation\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 0, NUMBER 0\nof war, and scholars offer to see offensive cyber operations as a conflict short of war.^{34}\nOne assumption in cybersecurity literature is that offensive cyber operations are usually not escalatory until they cross a certain threshold. Once crossed, the power dynamics change and the operations can escalate—in the cyberdomain and cross-domain as well.^{35} However, public accusations can have a declarative-escalatory effect.^{36} States may choose not to publicly attribute an attack when attribution could cause undesirable escalation “outside the agreed competition space,” and that could publicly endanger rules or legal regimes outside the cyberdomain.^{37} This is based on the perception that defensive and offensive cyber activities are hard to distinguish, and that a defensive cyber action might be misinterpreted by the adversary as a preparation for attack.^{38}\nPublic attribution by senior officials has great political and geostrategical impact but also carries higher escalatory consequences and risks. Therefore, a target country wishing to respond to offensive cyber operations in the public arena and signal its adversary without risking escalation might use its intelligence agencies as the “first line” of public attribution, rather than a more declarative authority. This allows sending a clear message to the rival while staying below a threshold for undesirable escalation. While countries can opt to share information privately, including through direct channels between intelligence agencies such as the Five Eyes alliance, public attribution serves as a political and policy signal; privately conveying information does not.\n### Reputation for Credibility and Nonpartisanship\nPublic attribution plays a visible role in U.S. cyber strategy.^{39} Therefore, the way politicians communicate attribution findings to their various audiences—rival, domestic, and international—has critical bearing on how the message is received. However, this presents a challenge. High-level official attributions may carry a risk of escalation or other costs as mentioned, while nonofficial paths may not be perceived as credible. For the attribution to achieve maximum impact with minimum risk effectively, it should be highly credible, but also apolitical. Intelligence agencies often afford the best of both because they historically carry both reputations.\nFor example, according to the University of Texas at Austin's 2020 survey, a majority of Americans (64%) believe that the IC plays a vital role in protecting the nation. This popular support has proven consistent, bipartisan, and notably resilient over a four-year span marked by hostility and even “unprecedented assault” on American intelligence during the Trump presidency. Despite this tension, polling consistently confirmed a “durable reservoir of public confidence” in U.S. intelligence agencies.^{40} So, when\nintelligence agencies are making the public attribution, it is more likely that both the general public and the accused party perceive it as credible and reliable as an official statement, but not indicative of a policy shift or response.\n### Partnership Existence: International and Domestic\nThe importance of working with international allies and partners is highlighted throughout the U.S. cyber strategies. The 2023 Department of Defense (DoD) cyber strategy stated,“Our global Allies and partners represent a foundational strategic advantage for the United States. We will build the capacity and capability of U.S. Allies and partners in cyberspace and expand avenues of potential cyber cooperation. We will continue hunt forward operations and other bilateral technical collaboration, working with Allies and partners to illuminate malicious cyber activity on their networks.41”\nIn this context, the credibility of the U.S. intelligence agencies can also strengthen the credibility of the entire public attribution process in the eyes of its international partners and allies. This, in turn, can contribute to enhancing its international collaborations and helps the U.S. position itself as a world leader and authority in this field. One visible result is the joint public attributions that the United States and its allies have been doing in the past few years. A recent and salient example is the joint attribution by the European Union and United States of the hacking of ViaSat to Russia on the first day of the war in Ukraine.42\nThe U.S. government also has strong ties to the private sector in many fields. When it comes to the cyberdomain, the private sector often holds much more information than the government and intelligence agencies can without encroaching on citizens' privacy. This makes cooperation with private cybersecurity companies crucial in maintaining the health of the overall U.S. system, both public and private.43 One significant development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 DoD cyber strategy notes that private-sector parties (e.g. private cybersecurity firms) reporting on attribution “can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place,” and states that the DoD “will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution.”44 The importance of these companies is hard to overstate; they were the first to identify and reveal both the SolarWinds and DNC intrusions, discussed below.\nILLUSTRATIVE CASE STUDIES: THE SOLARWINDS AND THE DNC OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nIllustrative case studies (or plausibility probes) are used to shed light on a broader theoretical argument, especially for emerging or previously unstudied phenomena. They are brief by design, aiming “to give the reader a ‘feel' for a theoretical argument by providing a concrete example of its application, or to demonstrate the empirical relevance of a theoretical proposition by identifying at least one relevant case.”45 They serve as an exploratory step between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. With this in mind, the case studies below illustrate that the subject is ripe for research.\n### The SolarWinds Intrusion (2020)\nIn December 2020, the private cybersecurity company FireEye revealed an ongoing large-scale cyber operation, in which a rival country—believed to be Russia—gained access to multiple U.S. government agencies' networks. These included the Pentagon, the departments of Commerce, State, Treasury and Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Agency, as well as over 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, and many others.46\nSecurity researchers estimated that, starting in March 2020, and possibly earlier, Russian state-sponsored hackers gained access to the periodic update of SolarWinds' Orion IT-monitoring software, widely used by government and security agencies, leading private companies, and critical infrastructures. Orion is an IT performance monitoring system that has privileged access to IT systems to obtain log and system performance data.47 Consequently, anyone updating the software in fact granted the attackers potential access to their systems. Chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner, described the SolarWinds attack as “one of the most sophisticated and deep hacks we've faced.”48 The extent of the breach raised concerns that attackers could eventually use their access to harm American systems, disrupt or destroy information, and disable critical-system commands—although none of these are known to have happened to date. 49\nFormer Homeland Security advisor for the Trump administration, Thomas Bossert, described the intrusion as follows: “The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate. [...] The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months.”50 As the scale of the intrusion became clearer, there was no doubt the American government had failed to convince Russia there would be consequences to such broad hacking of federal government and corporate networks.51\nIn the SolarWinds case, FireEye identified a sophisticated nation-state hack into its own systems. The initial report was followed by extensive media coverage. Analysts quoted in the New York Times criticized the U.S. government for remaining silent on the attack: “It was hard to know which was worse: that the federal government was blindsided again by Russian intelligence agencies, or that when it was evident what was happening, White House officials said nothing.”52\nIn January 2021, the FBI, DNI, NSA, and CISA publicly attributed the attack to Russia.53 It was not until April 2021—four months after the attack was detected and first revealed—that the White House publicly attributed the attack to the Russian government. The Biden administration published an Executive Order denouncing the harmful foreign activities of the Russian government and unmasking Russian agencies and companies that aided the Kremlin's hacking efforts: “Today the United States is formally naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures. The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR.54”\nIn this case, the intelligence agencies made the public attribution before the president, despite public criticism. This served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation in the bilateral and international arena. This kind of escalation with Russia might have had an undesirable effect for President Biden's administration during his first days in office. At the same time, it preserved the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization during a sensitive time—mere days after the Trump--Biden transition.\nThe credibility of intelligence agencies in public attribution also served the United States in bolstering its relations with Europe and the international community. The White House announced that it was providing training to foreign ministry lawyers and policymakers on legal standards of state behavior in cyberspace and peacetime norms. At the same time, the United States also announced first-of-its-kind international training and assistance on policy and technical aspects of attribution, to take place through the Marshall Center in Germany and support policymakers in Europe and worldwide.55\n### The DNC Intrusion (2016)\nIn April 2016, the FBI informed the DNC that an unauthorized figure had obtained extensive permissions for the DNC computer network and that the DNC was “under serious cyberattack.”56 The DNC, the governing body of\nthe Democratic Party, was struck at a particularly sensitive time, several months ahead of the U.S. elections, and amid the campaign for the party's presidential nominee. The FBI was already monitoring suspicious activity in the network, and as early as September 2015 had warned the DNC that its network had been hacked by a Russian group dubbed “The Dukes.” The FBI already knew this group well, after detecting its attempts to break into the White House, State Department, and Joint Chief of Staff's email systems in previous years.57\nAt the end of April 2016, the DNC hired the services of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to address the attack.58 After a month of investigation, CrowdStrike attributed the intrusion to Russia, based on various technical clues, such as matching the attack times to working hours in the Moscow time zone.59 The campaign of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton grappled with considerable political fallout from the intrusion, including trying to refute the vast amounts of information published. The attack and resulting affair arguably influenced American public opinion during election season later that year.60\nThe first public attribution was made in June 2016 by CrowdStrike. In this case, experts called President Barak Obama and the government to attribute the attack publicly. For example, in July 2016, the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group issued a statement calling on President Obama to “ensure that the attacks are attributed and take prompt actions sufficient to hold those responsible accountable and deter foreign actors from pursuing such tactics in the future.”61\nIn October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement on behalf of the IC, explicitly attributing the attack to Russia and describing it as a direct order from the Russian government:“The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions. [...] We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.62”\nAt a press conference later that month, the White House spokesperson attributed the breach to the Russian government, adding that Russia's goals included attempts to undermine the stability of the U.S. political system.63 Only in his last days in office, in December 2016, did President Obama say in an interview that the “DNC hack traced to ‘highest levels' of the Kremlin.” President Obama said he similarly told Putin personally to “cut it out” in September but he refrained from public retaliation before the November election because it would “immediately be seen through a partisan lens.”64\nThe public disclosure of Russia's attempts to disrupt democratic elections and by extension international order drew the attention of other countries, who watched the United States closely to learn how it was dealing with attempted Russian cyber intrusions and cyber-enabled influence operations. The United States became the focus of interest of other democracies, such as France and Germany, which were headed toward elections and feared Russian intervention.65 The United States even provided intelligence and technical assistance. For example, the NSA warned France that Russian hackers were planning to disrupt its electoral process. This allowed a French counteraction, which included planting fake information for the hackers and ultimately minimized Russia's actual influence on the election process. With considerable experience confronting Russian cyber intrusions, the United States positioned itself as an international role model in dealing with ongoing Russian intrusions and influence attempts.66\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe SolarWinds and DNC intrusions illustrate the dynamic of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, in particular in the ongoing cyber conflict between the United States and Russia. The overall credibility U.S. intelligence agencies enjoy lent greater weight to their public attributions in the eyes of both domestic and international audiences. This enhanced the standing of the United States as an experienced cyberspace actor and allowed it to position itself as a leader in the international cybersecurity arena, further strengthening its partnerships and alliances.\nIn both cases, public attribution by U.S. intelligence agencies occurred in the timeframe between the technical attribution made by private cybersecurity companies and the political attribution ultimately made by the U.S. president, despite public criticism. This appears to have served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation. At the same time, it allowed the United States to preserve the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization on the domestic front.\nThis phenomenon is occurring in the context of a larger change in the role of intelligence agencies that is facilitated and forced by the rapid advance in cyber technologies and AI. These technologies have affected these agencies' missions, from intelligence gathering to actively carrying out defensive and offensive cyber operations. Offensive cyber operations are increasing in numbers and scales, becoming an integral component of global conflict, diplomacy, and politics. Intelligence agencies are now being asked to take the public stage—often before, or altogether instead of, the country's senior officials.\nThis study is meant to stimulate exploration and scholarship about the factors at play when intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public\nGIL BARAM\nattribution. Several avenues were presented. At the broadest, \"macroscale\" level there may be high variation between states on what entity communicates attribution publicly. If so, there may be common characteristics that make some entities better than others for specific signaling purposes. For example, when intelligence agencies are doing the public attribution, as happened in both cases presented here, they can convey a message to the private sector that it plays a vital role in this process and that the information received from these companies is indeed used for national security needs. One hypothesis worth future research is that this signal has a positive effect, increasing private companies' engagement and willingness to share information with the government in the future.\nSimilarly, intelligence agencies' perception of the threat that rivals in cyberspace pose, and how this affects their analyses and messaging, might be examined. In its 2021 Annual Threats Assessment, the ODNI estimated,\nCyber threats from nation states and their surrogates will remain acute. Foreign states use cyber operations to steal information, influence populations, and damage industry, including physical and digital critical infrastructure. Although an increasing number of countries and non-state actors have these capabilities, we remain most concerned about Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.\nThe two cases presented here involved Russia. However, in other cases, like the breach into the Office of Personal Management and Sony hack (both in 2014) involving China and North Korea, respectively, there had been no public attribution by intelligence agencies. Was there something different about the threats China and North Korea posed that led to different attribution methods?\nFuture research may answer these and other questions, such as uncovering variables that correlate to use of intelligence agencies in public attributions. Possible candidates might include the target type, adversarial regime type, and more. Examining the reverse instances of this study—cases without attribution by intelligence agencies—might shed light on the question of when states might be likely to use—or not—their intelligence agencies as the front line of official public attribution.\nWith offensive cyber operations constantly on the rise and stakes for governments increasingly higher, intelligence agencies appear to be playing an increasingly important role in the process of public attribution. Distinguishing between various attribution strategies and intelligence agencies' roles within them can provide a deeper understanding of how states perceive the context of a particular offensive cyber operation, and highlight the dynamics, trade-offs, and functions policymakers face when deciding on the path for public attribution and its possible outcomes.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\n17\n# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author thanks Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance and Herb Lin, Jon Lindsay, Jelena Vičić, Amy Zegart, and the social sciences reading group at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of this article.\n# DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s)."

This raises the question: Is there a role for intelligence agencies—which traditionally work behind the scenes—in public attribution of offensive cyber operations? If so, what are the features that make these agencies useful in such public announcements? To answer these two questions, this article examines the emerging phenomenon of U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributing offensive cyber operations and identifies three features that make these agencies effective in public attribution: they send signals below the adversary's escalation threshold, offer credibility and nonpartisanship, and have partnerships that enable them to succeed in the attribution process. The SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee intrusions are used as illustrative case studies to examine this phenomenon.

This offensive cyber operation utilized the American information technology (IT) company SolarWinds' regular software update, which had been infected with malicious code. More than 18,000 of SolarWinds' clients were estimated to be affected, among them many U.S. governmental agencies, including parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and more. So were private companies, like Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, and Deloitte, and other organizations. Microsoft president Brad Smith called it “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.”\nFireEye made the first attribution to a “highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques.” Two weeks later, in January 2021, several U.S. intelligence agencies—the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the National Security Agency (NSA)—with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), publicly attributed the operation to “a Russian actor.” However, it was not until April 2021 that the Biden administration explicitly named the perpetrator as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\nThe fact that the country's intelligence agencies were the ones making the first official public attribution, several months before the president did so, highlights a puzzle: Intelligence agencies traditionally work behind the scenes, and unlike politicians and private cybersecurity companies, may have less incentive to publicize their activity, as this might endanger their sources and methods of operation. Furthermore, in some cases, offensive cyber operations can be kept covert and underreported so that countries do not concede they were cyberattacked. In view of these two factors, intelligence agencies seem unlikely to be the agents of publicity and public attribution. However, two cases in the United States suggested this might be otherwise.\nThis leads to a research question: Once intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public attribution, what are the features that make them effective at doing so? I argue that public attribution by intelligence agencies is an emerging phenomenon that deserves deeper examination, regarding two issues in particular. The first is the fact that this is indeed occurring, and therefore should be explored as another attribution path. The second issue warranting study regards the features of intelligence agencies that make their\npublic attribution effective. With governments consistently under cyberattacks and the global scope of offensive cyber operations rising, recognizing and understanding the public role of intelligence agencies is vital.\nThe first part of the article surveys the main literature addressing the changing role of intelligence agencies in the current information age, outlines the common possible attribution paths, and highlights one that has so far received little theoretical and empirical attention—public attribution by intelligence agencies. The second part presents the empirical data regarding public attribution by intelligence agencies and shows that this is a global phenomenon, although the United States is the leading country doing so. After empirically establishing attribution by intelligence agencies as a more common phenomenon than might be expected, the article turns to the third part to ask what features of the intelligence agencies make them effective in doing public attributions. Three features are discussed: (1) they can send a credible signal beneath the escalation threshold, (2) they are perceived as professional and “a-political,” (3) their connections with the private sector and international partners. In the fourth part, I use the SolarWinds (2020) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC; 2016) intrusions as illustrative case studies intended to give the reader an initial sense of the way these functions work. The fifth and final part discusses the conclusions of this research, its policy-relevant implications, and offers avenues for future research.\n## INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE\nWhen approaching the role of intelligence agencies in public attribution of offensive cyber operations, one must first consider the way their role at large is affected by rapid technological changes. Over the past decade, intelligence work has undergone a tremendous change, and today it is not only intelligence gathering and covert actions but also carrying out offensive and defensive cyber operations. The new function and scale are both enabled by advanced cyber technologies that allow obtaining and analyzing information in ways and scopes that did not exist in the past. This is further amplified by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, used to “amplify the effectiveness of our workforce ... advance mission capability and enhance the IC's [Intelligence Community's] ability to provide data interpretation to decision makers.” This change in scope and scale offers both opportunities and challenges, and requires intelligence agencies to adapt and change: “[T]he Intelligence Community faces a moment of reckoning. If the IC cannot adopt AI and other emerging technologies successfully, it risks failure.” This challenge should be kept in mind when discussing public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies.\nIntelligence agencies' work is usually being done “behind the scenes,” and when it comes to offensive cyber operations, secrecy was considered an inherent feature.10 General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency, noted that, in the beginning, “even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself.”11 While literature is offering new perspectives on the changes in intelligence agencies' work, it mostly continues to perceive their role as covert and silent.12 However, cyber technologies enable intelligence agencies to operate on much larger scales than in the past, which may conflict with the traditional secrecy of intelligence operations; the larger the scale, the higher the risk of exposure might be.13 This article explores circumstances in which intelligence agencies abandon secrecy and thus take their place on stage.\n## Public attribution of offensive cyber operations\nGovernments and private firms that suffered a cyberattack have incentives for keeping cyber intrusions secret, “Lest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment.”14 In certain cases, target states may be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of these operations, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions.15 There is no pride involved in being a victim, and target states might opt for silence so as not to “admit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned.”16\nAttribution of offensive cyber operations has been studied from several different perspectives. These include the attribution problem and its meanings, the uniqueness of attribution in cyberspace compared to other domains, the different attribution pathways, and the various calculations decisionmakers should take into account when deciding on attribution.17 Additional scholarship has highlighted the challenge in identifying and attributing the source of an attack, the meaning of anonymity, and the difficulties this poses to the defender when deciding how to react.18\nIntelligence agencies face a dilemma regarding the amount and nature of information required for reaching public attribution: Should this information relate to an individual, or the state? How much evidence is required to reveal and what might be the implication for this publicity? Public attribution by a government requires intelligence agencies to provide the relevant technical and operational information. However, when it comes to public attribution they are often hesitant to disclose this because of the potential damage to their intelligence methods, sources, and access to vital assets.19\nThe attribution process by states consists of two main stages. The first is an analytic process—which is historical and backward-looking—identifying what happened and who did it. This includes establishing the technical facts of the intrusion and checking the attacker's techniques against those of previously identified actors. Every attribution of an offensive cyber operation begins with a technical and forensic investigation based on known data and information and indicators—such as technical identifiers and pieces of code—in order to understand the scale of the offensive cyber operation, the severity of the damage, the goal of the adversary, and so on. The objective of this investigation is to ensure the safety of the affected networks and computer systems.^{20}\nThe second stage is a strategic process, which is more forward-looking; deciding what should be communicated, by whom, and how. In this part, the target state determines what it wants to do with the findings of this forensic investigation, in keeping with its broader strategic goals and political considerations. In this stage, states can decide how they wish to communicate the attribution findings to other audiences in order to influence the interpretation of a particular incident.^{21} This stage is mainly driven by a state's policy considerations, and it can communicate its findings using one or more of five general attribution paths, separately or in concert^{22}: Technical: providing technical--forensic information that will help other entities patch their vulnerabilities and protect themselves. This kind of attribution can be done by the private sector, NGOs, or state agencies. In the U.S. context, this is done mainly by CISA and the FBI.^{23} Criminal: criminal proceedings against individuals. If a malicious cyber incident is regarded as a matter for domestic law enforcement authorities, then legal requirements for process, standards of evidence, and degrees of certainty about attribution apply^{24}; Political, Unofficial: by talking to the press under terms of anonymity; Political, Official: public attribution by state political officials, such as the president, secretary of state, secretary of homeland security and others; and Multicountry collaboration: public attribution by a number of countries together. This kind of attribution requires trust between the participating states as it requires each state to share at least some of its information and intelligence.^{25}\nIn recent years, there have been cases in which the intelligence agencies were the ones doing the public attribution, potentially signaling a new official attribution path. In the next paragraphs, I will examine where this occurs along the national decisionmaking process, and discuss the data and identify the possible reasons they are doing so in the U.S. case.\nTo illustrate this decisionmaking process, we can look at the U.S.-specific decision tree in Figure 1. This flowchart helps explain two main factors in the attribution process—the echelon of the organizational hierarchy that\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 1. Attribution decision-making process (U.S.-specific).\nperforms the attribution, and the specific function within this level. The point of departure is that an offensive cyber operation has taken place and has been detected by the defender, and the analytical attribution process has been done. Now, decisionmakers face the question whether to reveal the identity of the attacker or not. If not, there are two options: First, maintain silence. Second, provide information to private security companies so they will do the attribution.\nIf the decision is to reveal the identity of the attacker, once again there are two options. The first of these is nonofficial attribution, which can be publicizing the information in anonymous ways—such as talking to the press under terms of anonymity, off-record briefing, or leaking. The second is official attribution by the U.S. government. Official response can be done by the White House or Executive Office of the President; other Cabinet departments, such as the Department of Defence, Department of Justice, or Department of Homeland Security; or by intelligence agencies. The last is the focus of this study.\n# PUBLICITY AND OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE\nWhile targeted states might have clear incentives not to acknowledge having been attacked, they do not always have a choice. The magnitude of some cyber intrusions, in addition to related rumors and media reports, makes it difficult for states to avoid any public response altogether.[26] In order to examine the phenomenon of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, I took an empirical approach, examining offensive\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\ncyber operations to identify the agent of publicity in each case in order to map the relevant cases. This part serves as the basis for the qualitative examination through the illustrative case studies that follow. The following paragraphs and figures present the data on publicity of offensive cyber operations in general and specific data regarding the different entities revealing them, and the role of intelligence agencies within this. These show that public attribution by intelligence agencies is indeed an empirical phenomenon.\nHere it is important to address the so-called unknown unknowns or unobserved offensive cyber operations.27 These are offensive cyber operations assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources used for this research. For the purposes of this article, only offensive cyber operations that have been publicly revealed and for which there exists sufficient data to code in the dataset have been included. The presumed existence of unknown unknowns should not preclude scholars from researching these issues, which are changing the landscape of cyberwarfare politics.28\n### Data Compilation\nData compilation included three preexisting datasets, plus additional sources. The first is the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset Version 1.1,29 which provides data on the presence of cyber conflict in the existing conflicts between 2001 and 2014. To this was added new data on cyberattacks and intrusions for the years 1996 to 2019 based on the Council on Foreign Relations' Cyber Operations tracker.30 Finally, the relevant data for the years prior to 2001 were added, based on the National Security Archive Cyber Vault Project.31 All data were verified, then recoded using a new schema of variables and scaling.\nThe compilation and updating process also relied on reports in media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. This allowed supplementing the existing data with any new information that had come to light since the incident, and was published via mainstream media, threat intelligence reports, cybersecurity magazines, or cybersecurity companies. For verification purposes, each incident included in the dataset has at least two reliable sources and was examined by two independent coders. The dataset was finalized in June 2019 and includes 476 cyber incidents. All data was collected from open sources.\n### Entity Exposing the Attacker\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the actors that revealed the offensive cyber operation public attribution for the years 2005 to 2019. In half the cases, private cybersecurity companies were the ones to expose the attack.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Entity exposing the attacker (2005-2019).\nHowever, as illustrated below, intelligence and defense agencies revealed the attacker's identity in  $13\\%$  of the cases, doing so at higher rates than senior officials, who attributed offensive cyber operations in  $10\\%$  of the cases. This finding is particularly interesting given the general perception of intelligence organizations as secret agencies that do not disclose information to the public.\n# Global Phenomenon\nFigure 3 illustrates the data for public attribution by defense and intelligence agencies in different countries ( $N = 43$ ). While the United States clearly leads this practice, it is also being done in Germany, South Korea, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Examples of the agencies making public attributions include defense agencies such as CISA, Norway's Policy Security Service, the Polish Computer Emergency Response Team, the Security Service of Ukraine, and intelligence agencies such as the DNI, FBI, and NSA in the United States and Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV).[32] This research focuses on the United States only, for reasons discussed in the next section.\n# Focusing on the United States\nThis article focuses on the United States for two reasons. The first is that the United States is the dominant country for this path, meaning it had the\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nFigure 3. Attribution by defense and intelligence agencies (2005-2019).\nhighest number of intelligence and defense agency attributions of the countries examined. The second relates to organizational differences. In some countries, the boundaries between intelligence agencies, other defense agencies, and law enforcement agencies is blurred. For example, cases in which the FBI was the only attributing agency are included in the data but excluded from the analysis. The U.S. cases allow for better distinguishing between the various agencies. Even with, for example, the NSA and Cyber Command being under the same roof and command, I was able to focus on cases that were attributed by the U.S. IC as a whole.\n# FEATURES OF INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE IN PUBLIC ATTRIBUTIONS\nExamination of the available evidence suggested three features of intelligence agencies that make them effective in public attributions: ability to signal below escalation threshold, reputation for credibility and nonpartisanship, and partnership existence—domestic and international. I then used two of the recent best-documented cyber operations—the SolarWinds and the DNC intrusions—as illustrative case studies in order to trace and examine the use of intelligence agencies for public attribution of offensive cyber operations.\n# Signal Beneath the Escalation Threshold\nThe nonescalatory nature of offensive cyber operations has been widely discussed in the past few years.[33] Despite the preliminary expectations that offensive cyber operations would lead to cyber war—such as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warning against the possibility of a “cyber-Pearl Harbor”—real-world events so far proved differently. The literature that followed showed that these kinds of operations did not lead to escalation\nAND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE VOLUME 0, NUMBER 0\nof war, and scholars offer to see offensive cyber operations as a conflict short of war.^{34}\nOne assumption in cybersecurity literature is that offensive cyber operations are usually not escalatory until they cross a certain threshold. Once crossed, the power dynamics change and the operations can escalate—in the cyberdomain and cross-domain as well.^{35} However, public accusations can have a declarative-escalatory effect.^{36} States may choose not to publicly attribute an attack when attribution could cause undesirable escalation “outside the agreed competition space,” and that could publicly endanger rules or legal regimes outside the cyberdomain.^{37} This is based on the perception that defensive and offensive cyber activities are hard to distinguish, and that a defensive cyber action might be misinterpreted by the adversary as a preparation for attack.^{38}\nPublic attribution by senior officials has great political and geostrategical impact but also carries higher escalatory consequences and risks. Therefore, a target country wishing to respond to offensive cyber operations in the public arena and signal its adversary without risking escalation might use its intelligence agencies as the “first line” of public attribution, rather than a more declarative authority. This allows sending a clear message to the rival while staying below a threshold for undesirable escalation. While countries can opt to share information privately, including through direct channels between intelligence agencies such as the Five Eyes alliance, public attribution serves as a political and policy signal; privately conveying information does not.\n### Reputation for Credibility and Nonpartisanship\nPublic attribution plays a visible role in U.S. cyber strategy.^{39} Therefore, the way politicians communicate attribution findings to their various audiences—rival, domestic, and international—has critical bearing on how the message is received. However, this presents a challenge. High-level official attributions may carry a risk of escalation or other costs as mentioned, while nonofficial paths may not be perceived as credible. For the attribution to achieve maximum impact with minimum risk effectively, it should be highly credible, but also apolitical. Intelligence agencies often afford the best of both because they historically carry both reputations.\nFor example, according to the University of Texas at Austin's 2020 survey, a majority of Americans (64%) believe that the IC plays a vital role in protecting the nation. This popular support has proven consistent, bipartisan, and notably resilient over a four-year span marked by hostility and even “unprecedented assault” on American intelligence during the Trump presidency. Despite this tension, polling consistently confirmed a “durable reservoir of public confidence” in U.S. intelligence agencies.^{40} So, when\nintelligence agencies are making the public attribution, it is more likely that both the general public and the accused party perceive it as credible and reliable as an official statement, but not indicative of a policy shift or response.\n### Partnership Existence: International and Domestic\nThe importance of working with international allies and partners is highlighted throughout the U.S. cyber strategies. The 2023 Department of Defense (DoD) cyber strategy stated,“Our global Allies and partners represent a foundational strategic advantage for the United States. We will build the capacity and capability of U.S. Allies and partners in cyberspace and expand avenues of potential cyber cooperation. We will continue hunt forward operations and other bilateral technical collaboration, working with Allies and partners to illuminate malicious cyber activity on their networks.41”\nIn this context, the credibility of the U.S. intelligence agencies can also strengthen the credibility of the entire public attribution process in the eyes of its international partners and allies. This, in turn, can contribute to enhancing its international collaborations and helps the U.S. position itself as a world leader and authority in this field. One visible result is the joint public attributions that the United States and its allies have been doing in the past few years. A recent and salient example is the joint attribution by the European Union and United States of the hacking of ViaSat to Russia on the first day of the war in Ukraine.42\nThe U.S. government also has strong ties to the private sector in many fields. When it comes to the cyberdomain, the private sector often holds much more information than the government and intelligence agencies can without encroaching on citizens' privacy. This makes cooperation with private cybersecurity companies crucial in maintaining the health of the overall U.S. system, both public and private.43 One significant development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 DoD cyber strategy notes that private-sector parties (e.g. private cybersecurity firms) reporting on attribution “can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place,” and states that the DoD “will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution.”44 The importance of these companies is hard to overstate; they were the first to identify and reveal both the SolarWinds and DNC intrusions, discussed below.\nILLUSTRATIVE CASE STUDIES: THE SOLARWINDS AND THE DNC OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\nIllustrative case studies (or plausibility probes) are used to shed light on a broader theoretical argument, especially for emerging or previously unstudied phenomena. They are brief by design, aiming “to give the reader a ‘feel' for a theoretical argument by providing a concrete example of its application, or to demonstrate the empirical relevance of a theoretical proposition by identifying at least one relevant case.”45 They serve as an exploratory step between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. With this in mind, the case studies below illustrate that the subject is ripe for research.\n### The SolarWinds Intrusion (2020)\nIn December 2020, the private cybersecurity company FireEye revealed an ongoing large-scale cyber operation, in which a rival country—believed to be Russia—gained access to multiple U.S. government agencies' networks. These included the Pentagon, the departments of Commerce, State, Treasury and Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Agency, as well as over 400 of the Fortune 500 companies, and many others.46\nSecurity researchers estimated that, starting in March 2020, and possibly earlier, Russian state-sponsored hackers gained access to the periodic update of SolarWinds' Orion IT-monitoring software, widely used by government and security agencies, leading private companies, and critical infrastructures. Orion is an IT performance monitoring system that has privileged access to IT systems to obtain log and system performance data.47 Consequently, anyone updating the software in fact granted the attackers potential access to their systems. Chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner, described the SolarWinds attack as “one of the most sophisticated and deep hacks we've faced.”48 The extent of the breach raised concerns that attackers could eventually use their access to harm American systems, disrupt or destroy information, and disable critical-system commands—although none of these are known to have happened to date. 49\nFormer Homeland Security advisor for the Trump administration, Thomas Bossert, described the intrusion as follows: “The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate. [...] The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months.”50 As the scale of the intrusion became clearer, there was no doubt the American government had failed to convince Russia there would be consequences to such broad hacking of federal government and corporate networks.51\nIn the SolarWinds case, FireEye identified a sophisticated nation-state hack into its own systems. The initial report was followed by extensive media coverage. Analysts quoted in the New York Times criticized the U.S. government for remaining silent on the attack: “It was hard to know which was worse: that the federal government was blindsided again by Russian intelligence agencies, or that when it was evident what was happening, White House officials said nothing.”52\nIn January 2021, the FBI, DNI, NSA, and CISA publicly attributed the attack to Russia.53 It was not until April 2021—four months after the attack was detected and first revealed—that the White House publicly attributed the attack to the Russian government. The Biden administration published an Executive Order denouncing the harmful foreign activities of the Russian government and unmasking Russian agencies and companies that aided the Kremlin's hacking efforts: “Today the United States is formally naming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures. The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution to the SVR.54”\nIn this case, the intelligence agencies made the public attribution before the president, despite public criticism. This served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation in the bilateral and international arena. This kind of escalation with Russia might have had an undesirable effect for President Biden's administration during his first days in office. At the same time, it preserved the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization during a sensitive time—mere days after the Trump--Biden transition.\nThe credibility of intelligence agencies in public attribution also served the United States in bolstering its relations with Europe and the international community. The White House announced that it was providing training to foreign ministry lawyers and policymakers on legal standards of state behavior in cyberspace and peacetime norms. At the same time, the United States also announced first-of-its-kind international training and assistance on policy and technical aspects of attribution, to take place through the Marshall Center in Germany and support policymakers in Europe and worldwide.55\n### The DNC Intrusion (2016)\nIn April 2016, the FBI informed the DNC that an unauthorized figure had obtained extensive permissions for the DNC computer network and that the DNC was “under serious cyberattack.”56 The DNC, the governing body of\nthe Democratic Party, was struck at a particularly sensitive time, several months ahead of the U.S. elections, and amid the campaign for the party's presidential nominee. The FBI was already monitoring suspicious activity in the network, and as early as September 2015 had warned the DNC that its network had been hacked by a Russian group dubbed “The Dukes.” The FBI already knew this group well, after detecting its attempts to break into the White House, State Department, and Joint Chief of Staff's email systems in previous years.57\nAt the end of April 2016, the DNC hired the services of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to address the attack.58 After a month of investigation, CrowdStrike attributed the intrusion to Russia, based on various technical clues, such as matching the attack times to working hours in the Moscow time zone.59 The campaign of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton grappled with considerable political fallout from the intrusion, including trying to refute the vast amounts of information published. The attack and resulting affair arguably influenced American public opinion during election season later that year.60\nThe first public attribution was made in June 2016 by CrowdStrike. In this case, experts called President Barak Obama and the government to attribute the attack publicly. For example, in July 2016, the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group issued a statement calling on President Obama to “ensure that the attacks are attributed and take prompt actions sufficient to hold those responsible accountable and deter foreign actors from pursuing such tactics in the future.”61\nIn October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement on behalf of the IC, explicitly attributing the attack to Russia and describing it as a direct order from the Russian government:“The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions. [...] We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.62”\nAt a press conference later that month, the White House spokesperson attributed the breach to the Russian government, adding that Russia's goals included attempts to undermine the stability of the U.S. political system.63 Only in his last days in office, in December 2016, did President Obama say in an interview that the “DNC hack traced to ‘highest levels' of the Kremlin.” President Obama said he similarly told Putin personally to “cut it out” in September but he refrained from public retaliation before the November election because it would “immediately be seen through a partisan lens.”64\nThe public disclosure of Russia's attempts to disrupt democratic elections and by extension international order drew the attention of other countries, who watched the United States closely to learn how it was dealing with attempted Russian cyber intrusions and cyber-enabled influence operations. The United States became the focus of interest of other democracies, such as France and Germany, which were headed toward elections and feared Russian intervention.65 The United States even provided intelligence and technical assistance. For example, the NSA warned France that Russian hackers were planning to disrupt its electoral process. This allowed a French counteraction, which included planting fake information for the hackers and ultimately minimized Russia's actual influence on the election process. With considerable experience confronting Russian cyber intrusions, the United States positioned itself as an international role model in dealing with ongoing Russian intrusions and influence attempts.66\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe SolarWinds and DNC intrusions illustrate the dynamic of public attribution of offensive cyber operations by intelligence agencies, in particular in the ongoing cyber conflict between the United States and Russia. The overall credibility U.S. intelligence agencies enjoy lent greater weight to their public attributions in the eyes of both domestic and international audiences. This enhanced the standing of the United States as an experienced cyberspace actor and allowed it to position itself as a leader in the international cybersecurity arena, further strengthening its partnerships and alliances.\nIn both cases, public attribution by U.S. intelligence agencies occurred in the timeframe between the technical attribution made by private cybersecurity companies and the political attribution ultimately made by the U.S. president, despite public criticism. This appears to have served a double purpose: it allowed the United States to send Russia a clear message while avoiding undesirable tension or escalation. At the same time, it allowed the United States to preserve the credibility of the attribution by avoiding perceived politicization on the domestic front.\nThis phenomenon is occurring in the context of a larger change in the role of intelligence agencies that is facilitated and forced by the rapid advance in cyber technologies and AI. These technologies have affected these agencies' missions, from intelligence gathering to actively carrying out defensive and offensive cyber operations. Offensive cyber operations are increasing in numbers and scales, becoming an integral component of global conflict, diplomacy, and politics. Intelligence agencies are now being asked to take the public stage—often before, or altogether instead of, the country's senior officials.\nThis study is meant to stimulate exploration and scholarship about the factors at play when intelligence agencies are chosen to deliver public\nGIL BARAM\nattribution. Several avenues were presented. At the broadest, \"macroscale\" level there may be high variation between states on what entity communicates attribution publicly. If so, there may be common characteristics that make some entities better than others for specific signaling purposes. For example, when intelligence agencies are doing the public attribution, as happened in both cases presented here, they can convey a message to the private sector that it plays a vital role in this process and that the information received from these companies is indeed used for national security needs. One hypothesis worth future research is that this signal has a positive effect, increasing private companies' engagement and willingness to share information with the government in the future.\nSimilarly, intelligence agencies' perception of the threat that rivals in cyberspace pose, and how this affects their analyses and messaging, might be examined. In its 2021 Annual Threats Assessment, the ODNI estimated,\nCyber threats from nation states and their surrogates will remain acute. Foreign states use cyber operations to steal information, influence populations, and damage industry, including physical and digital critical infrastructure. Although an increasing number of countries and non-state actors have these capabilities, we remain most concerned about Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.[67]\nThe two cases presented here involved Russia. However, in other cases, like the breach into the Office of Personal Management and Sony hack (both in 2014) involving China and North Korea, respectively, there had been no public attribution by intelligence agencies. Was there something different about the threats China and North Korea posed that led to different attribution methods?\nFuture research may answer these and other questions, such as uncovering variables that correlate to use of intelligence agencies in public attributions. Possible candidates might include the target type, adversarial regime type, and more. Examining the reverse instances of this study—cases without attribution by intelligence agencies—might shed light on the question of when states might be likely to use—or not—their intelligence agencies as the front line of official public attribution.\nWith offensive cyber operations constantly on the rise and stakes for governments increasingly higher, intelligence agencies appear to be playing an increasingly important role in the process of public attribution. Distinguishing between various attribution strategies and intelligence agencies' roles within them can provide a deeper understanding of how states perceive the context of a particular offensive cyber operation, and highlight the dynamics, trade-offs, and functions policymakers face when deciding on the path for public attribution and its possible outcomes.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE\nPUBLICLY ATTRIBUTED OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS\n\nThe author thanks Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance and Herb Lin, Jon Lindsay, Jelena Vičić, Amy Zegart, and the social sciences reading group at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of this article.\n# DISCLOSURE STATEMENT No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s)."

    "abstract": "In January 2021, U.S. intelligence agencies—the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the National Security Agency—and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency publicly attributed the SolarWinds cyber intrusion to an unnamed \"Russian actor.\" Four months later, in April 2021, the Biden Administration explicitly named the perpetrator as the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. This raises the question: Is there a role for intelligence agencies—which traditionally work behind the scenes—in public attribution of offensive cyber operations? If so, what are the features that make these agencies useful in such public announcements? To answer these two questions, this article examines the emerging phenomenon of U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributing offensive cyber operations and identifies three features that make these agencies effective in public attribution: they send signals below the adversary's escalation threshold, offer credibility and nonpartisanship, and have partnerships that enable them to succeed in the attribution process. The SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee intrusions are used as illustrative case studies to examine this phenomenon. This research highlights",
