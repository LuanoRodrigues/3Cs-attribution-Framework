Due to the ambiguity of the object of regulation, the defect of attribution mechanism, and the lack of clarity of the constituent elements of responsibility, the existing international law framework has caused the state responsibility system in cyberspace to fall into the dilemma of normative failure. This paper takes the theory of international law subjectivity as the logical starting point and systematically deconstructs the normative attributes of cyberwar and the path of responsibility determination. This paper shows that the constitutive elements of state responsibility need to break through the rigid standard of traditional \"behavior-damage\" causality and build a dynamic attribution system combining technical verification and legal presumption. Through critical analysis of the use of force threshold doctrine, this paper, based on a comprehensive analysis of the core dilemma of the determination of state responsibility, proposes to appropriately introduce the concept of \"substantial support\", and when the traditional theory of comprehensive control fails to make effective attribution, the criterion of \"substantial support\" can be used to complete the attribution of state responsibility with the increasingly developed technological traceability means.\nKeywords: cyberwarfare; international law; state responsibility; attributability\n*Corresponding author: Haonan Li, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: lihaonan22402065@zju.edu.cn. https://orcid.org/0009-0005-0476-300X\nLe Cheng, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: chengle163@hotmail.com. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4423-8585\nThe militarized transformation of cyberspace has upended the cognitive architecture of the use of force under the Westphalian system. Traditional military theory faces challenges when applied to cyber conflict (Kallberg 2016). The evolution of cyberwarfare from a technological tool to a means of strategic deterrence has led to a blurring of the legal boundaries between peacetime and armed conflict. And the increasing effectiveness of cyberattacks further complicates the legal context of cyberwarfare (Gray 2024). The traditional state responsibility regime needs to be reconfigured due to a triple adaptive dilemma: first, technological anonymity triggers a break in the chain of attribution, which puts the “effective control” criterion in Article 8 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility in a difficult position to prove; second, the non-kinetic nature of cyber operations makes it difficult to quantify the threshold for the use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations; and third, the legitimacy boundary of countermeasures creates normative conflicts under the “forward defense” strategy.\nThis paper adopts a techno-legal cross-analysis approach to focus on the normative reconstruction path of state responsibility in cyber warfare. By deconstructing the dilemma of determining state responsibility at the current stage and proposing corresponding reconstruction paths, this paper attempts to discuss how the determination standard of the attribute of force in cyberwarfare can be coordinated with the “principle of equivalence of effect” of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the mode of assuming the indirect responsibility of the state in the context of the intervention of non-state actors. It is hoped that through the reconstruction of various paths, the issue of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare can be clarified as much as possible, and the diffuse damage caused by cyberwarfare can be curbed. This paper aims to provide theoretical support for the clear identification of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare and to promote the formation of a technologically empowered international law governance paradigm.\n## Deconstructing the normative attributes of cyberwarfare\n### The evolution of the conceptual genealogy of cyberwarfare\nThe generation of the normative concept of cyberwarfare has gone through the process of discourse migration from military science to jurisprudence. The concept of cyberwarfare first appeared in a research report by the RAND Corporation in 1993,\nwhich defined cyberwarfare as a military operation being implemented or prepared to be implemented according to information-related principles (John and Ronfeldt 1993). In the strategic dimension, the concept of cyberwarfare was accompanied by the completion of the ontological construction of the theory of the “Fifth Dimension”, which was recognized by Huang (2015), who argued that “the rapid development of the global Internet has been driven by the rapid advancement of information technology, and cyberspace has begun to take shape as the ‘fifth space' beyond the land, sea, airspace and outer space”. At the same time, a variety of problems and threats such as cyber-attacks and cybercrime have also arisen, and the concept of “cyber warfare” is put forward in this context. On the one hand, along with the development of science and technology, the scale of cyber warfare has reached an unprecedented level, such as the cyber attack and defense in the Russo-Georgian war, the Iranian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the Shocknet virus, the Syrian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the airstrikes, and other cases, all of which are the embodiment of the escalation of the intensity of modern cyber warfare. On the other hand, the relevant theoretical research has been optimized based on the endless cyber warfare.\nCompared with China's late start in cyberwarfare research, western countries have begun research on cyberwarfare earlier, with a larger scale and wider scope, and have also achieved rich results in the formulation of international rules in cyberspace. Since the development of relevant theories, the current mainstream scholars believe that the content of international law on jus ad bellum can be applied to cyber warfare. For example, Reese Nguyen (2013) believes that when a cyber attack is intended to cause irreversible damage or physical loss to the physical information system, it can be recognized as constituting an attack with force. The main argument in favor of this claim is based on Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, which states that “all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. There are different doctrinal understandings of how to argue that cyberwarfare is a use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, as will be presented in the next section.\n### 2.2 Doctrines of thresholds for use of force in cyberwarfare\nAt present, mainstream scholars believe that cyberwarfare constitutes the use of force, but there are different doctrines in understanding, mainly the theory of purpose, instrumental theory, scale, and consequence theory (Huang 2015). Walter Sharp (1999), a representative of the “purpose theory”, argues that computer\nnetwork attacks are a form of economic and political coercion, and although such coercion is traditionally considered not to be a “use of force”, in the light of the purpose of the Charter of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, and the territorial integrity and political independence of States guaranteed by Article 2(4), computer network attacks should also be subject to Article 2(4) since economic and political coercion would also threaten international peace and jeopardize the territorial integrity and political independence of a State, and would therefore be covered by the scope of the Article.\nMarco Roscini (2010), a representative of the “tools doctrine”, argues that the “military force” that Article 2(4) intends to regulate is mainly embodied in the use of specific weapons (or tools) and that cyber-attacks using “weapons” such as Trojan horses, worms, etc. can also constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) if they produce specific tangible or intangible damage. The most widely accepted theory is the “scale and consequences theory”, in which Professor Michael Schmitt (1999, 2011) argues that although the main purpose of Article 2(4) is to constrain a state's external use of traditional military force to coerce others, in practice what matters is not the means used but the consequences; if a cyber-attack directly causes or is likely to cause damage to persons or objects comparable to that caused by military means, it should undoubtedly constitute a “use of force”; even if it does not cause tangible damage to persons or objects, the victimized State can still determine whether a cyber-attack constitutes a “use of force” by assessing the following seven criteria: (a) severity, (b) immediacy, (c) directness, (d) invasiveness, (e) measurability of effects, (f) presumptive legality and (g) state involvement. Although there are strengths and weaknesses in each viewpoint, as far as the existing situation is analyzed, the scale and consequence theory is recognized by majority of researchers, and the proposition of Prof. Michael Schmit has had a greater impact in the Western academic community, not only in the Tallinn Manual, which is edited by him but also recognized by Western countries. It is worth mentioning that the Tallinn Manual, as a document developed with the participation of multinational subjects, contains seven out of eight assessment criteria for defining whether a cyberattack constitutes a use of force that are identical to those mentioned in the previous article, which indicates that the evaluation criteria advocated by the scale and consequences theory have their own rationality and can be generally accepted by the majority of countries.\nIt should be noted that the research on issues related to cyberwarfare in this paper is based on cases where cyberwarfare can trigger international responsibility, and cyber infringement and cybercrime activities, which are only regulated by the domestic laws of various countries as well as a small number of international treaties, obviously do not fall into the category of use of force as stipulated in the\nCharter of the United Nations 2(4), and they also cannot trigger the responsibility of the State, and therefore do not fall within the scope of this paper's analysis.\n## Normative elements and paths to attribution of state responsibility in cyberwarfare\n### Normative basis and constitutive elements of the state responsibility regime\nThe institutional framework of state responsibility in international law is rooted in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Articles). According to Chapter I and Chapter II of the Draft Articles, the establishment of state responsibility requires the fulfillment of two normative elements: wrongfulness and attributability. In the following, the two elements will be analyzed separately.\nInitially, the analysis of wrongfulness. In Article 2 of the Draft Articles, the International Law Commission defines that “there is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law, and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.” In the context of cyberwarfare, it is clear that most cases of wrongful acts are in the form of action, as exemplified by the Russo-Georgian war: the Georgian government website was attacked, the government web server was on the verge of collapsing due to the large number of access requests it received for more than 10 h, the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was completely dysfunctional, and the website of the presidential administration was paralyzed for 24 h. As the fighting deepened, the intensity and sophistication of the cyber-attacks increased, with Russia targeting Georgia's government and news media websites as the primary targets, disabling virtually all of Georgia's government offices. Second, it is worth noting that the article does not mention that subjective fault or intent to engage in a wrongful act is required to establish state responsibility; the mere existence of a violation of the law is sufficient to give rise to international responsibility, and, by extension, state responsibility should be an objective rather than a subjective responsibility. The normative logic of this objective responsibility paradigm, which rejects the subjective fault element, is that the unlawfulness of an internationally wrongful act arises from an objective breach of an international obligation rather than from the state of mind of the acting state (Crawford 2013).\nIn addition, the article requires that the wrongful act constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state, and for a further understanding of the\nCheng and Li\nDE GRUYTER\nobligation, one can refer to the definitions in Articles 12 and 13 of the Draft Articles. Article 12 provides that there is a breach of an international obligation by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. Article 13 provides that an act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs. In other words, the key feature of a breach of an international obligation is that the obligation should have been complied with, but in fact, the State in question did not take reasonable action to comply with the obligation.\nArticle 12 makes it clear that, regardless of the origin or character of the obligation, when analyzed in terms of the sources of international law, the source of the obligation is varied, and may be a customary one, or one based on a treaty, or even a legal principle generally recognized by the international community. In the Rainbow Warrior case, for example, the arbitral tribunal stated that there is no distinction in international law between contractual and tortious liability, so any breach by a State of a duty, regardless of the source of the duty, gives rise to the responsibility of the State and therefore to an obligation to make reparation.¹ This case is very strong evidence of the broadness of the source of the obligation.\nThe broadness of the source of the obligation is conducive to the regulation of cyberwarfare. First, for States parties to cyberwarfare-related treaties, such as the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, a violation of the content of the treaty can constitute a direct breach of the obligation. Second, for countries not participating in the treaty, if the relevant practice of maintaining network security has been generally recognized in the international community and can become a kind of habit, the habit can also be used as a source of obligation, and if it does not comply with the habit, it is also possible to find that a country violates the obligation, which undoubtedly enlarges the scope of the main body needing to comply with the obligation, and allows more countries to consciously comply with the obligation. What's more, the identification and formation of general principles are essential for maintaining international law as a coherent legal system (Shao 2021). Therefore, sometimes principles can also govern the behavior of States. It should be noted, however, that even if a State commits certain acts of cyberattack against another State and causes damage, if it does not constitute a breach of an international obligation, it will not give rise to the legal responsibility of the author State.\n¹ Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (New Zealand v. France) (“Rainbow Warrior”), Award of 30 April 1990, 20 UNRIAA 215, para.75.\nCorrespondingly, attributability is then analyzed. Theoretically, all acts of individuals, corporations, or other entities in the sense of domestic law may be attributed to a State (Government) based on nationality. In dealing with this issue, the Draft Articles adopt a narrow approach, namely, the “overall control test”, whereby the only conduct that can be attributed to a State is that of State organs or other entities acting under the direction, control, or instigation of a State organ, which becomes an agent of the State at the time of the conduct (Kanehara 2019). As far as the attributability of the state in cyber warfare is concerned, if a cyber attack is initiated or directed by the state as the main body, the corresponding responsibility is borne by the state. In simple cases, the attributability of state responsibility can be quickly recognized. However, since the development of cyberwarfare, identifying the source of cyber-attacks is crucial to ensuring cybersecurity (Swate et al. 2024), its technical means have become increasingly flexible, and many attribution problems are caused by anonymous attacks, and the attackers can often easily hide their identities, which has brought great challenges to the tracking of the source of the attack. Even if the source of the attack is identified, the subject needs to be further clarified. The subject of a cyberattack can avoid being targeted by hiding or forging his identity in many ways, so pinpointing the subject is also a major challenge.\nIn addition, when a country helps another country to engage in internationally wrongful acts, the former also to the extent of the support, helps to bear state responsibility, but the main state responsibility still belongs to the wrongdoing state (Aust 2011). But regardless of the size of state responsibility, by analogy, in the context of cyberwarfare, if a country provides technical means or financial support and other help to other countries, in principle, it should also bear the corresponding responsibility, and if that State has both wrongful acts and breaches of its obligations, it may also satisfy the constituent elements of State responsibility, and thus bear State responsibility in cyberwarfare to the extent of the damage caused by that State.\n### Hierarchical construction of standards of proof\nAs a component of the constituent elements, whether it is the judgment of wrongfulness or the judgment of attributability, there is the problem of proof. In fact, for the legal field of the problem, the standard of proof has been extremely important, from the traditional theory of evidence, the standard of proof is the judge to consider and weigh the authenticity of the facts of the case to achieve the degree of proof, but also the burden of proof to provide the appropriate evidence to prove the facts of the case to achieve a certain standard (He and Wang 2017). The degree of standard of proof is directly related to the judge for the degree of conviction of the evidence, which naturally will affect the results of the judgment. Criminal law, civil law, and\nCheng and Li\nDE GRUYTER\nother substantive areas of law, after a long period of development, in their litigation process also have their standard of proof, although different standards for the results of the judgment have a decisive impact, the litigant naturally needs to try to meet the standard of proof. On the other hand, for the facts that have occurred, no one has the ability to  $100\\%$  reproduce the scene, they can only try to prove to maximize the proximity of the objective facts, thus providing judges with a good judgment environment so that judges as far as possible can make a reasonable judgment, and the standard of proof from this sense of understanding is also the embodiment of substantive justice.\nOutside the traditional field of substantive law, the standard of proof is also of great significance to the issue of international law. In international law, the composition of state responsibility needs to satisfy both illegal behavior and attributable elements, but the proof of the two elements is also a separate issue, whether the two standards of proof are consistent, and if not, what kind of standards should be used is an urgent discussion. As early as before the emergence of the problem of evidence in the field of networks, the International Court of Justice pointed out in the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua that the key to the solution to the problem lies not only in the process of attributing conduct to the law of a particular country but also in the search for substantial evidence before the process of legal attribution. It is thus clear that the question of the standard of proof is not simply an integral part of the question of the attribution of State responsibility, but is more relevant for independent discussion.\nAs far as the current situation is concerned, there is a lack of a uniform and clear standard of proof in international law. In the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice emphasized the principle of the free assessment of evidence, stating that within the limits of the Statute of the Court and the Rules of the Tribunal, the Court is free to assess the value of any evidence.3 While the persistent lack of uniform standards in international law has been detrimental to the development of proof, an analysis of the nature of the cases before the ICJ shows that there is a corresponding rationale for the absence of uniform standards of proof that the complexity and diversity of the cases before the ICJ make it difficult to arrive at a uniform standard that would be universally or primarily applicable to inter-State litigation (Watts 2000).\nIn addition, although the Court's deficiencies in the standard of proof may lead to subjective factors on the part of the judges affecting the decision of the case, in practice, the Court usually indicates in its judgments the standard of proof that it has adopted. Even if there is no expressly stated uniform standard, taking the standard of proof in a large number of judgments as a sample, it is still possible to analyze the issue of the standard of proof to one degree or another. Examining the decisions of ICJ, it can be found that the standard of proof adopted by ICJ basically draws on the system of standard of proof of the domestic courts of the common law system. According to different types of cases, the common law system of the standard of proof, according to the degree of strictness in descending order, can be divided into four types: (1) the criminal field is usually adopted with full certainty of “beyond a reasonable doubt”; (2) “clear and convincing proof”, which is highly probable but does not reach the level of incontrovertibility; (3) “preponderance of evidence”, which is usually adopted in civil proceedings and has a higher degree of reasonableness and probability; (4) prima facie evidence, which is merely required to prove indications of the correctness of an argument (Green 2009).\nThe standards of proof established for different types of cases are also of great significance in the context of cyberwarfare. Cyber-attacks are more covert and asymmetric than traditional attacks, and the degree of damage caused and the difficulty of investigation vary to different degrees, making evaluation more difficult than in traditional cases. Therefore, it is not practical to establish a uniform standard of proof, and a more reasonable approach should be to adopt different standards of proof according to the different degrees of impact brought about by cyberwarfare.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of cases have highlighted the intersection of cybercrime and cyberwarfare: operations with a clear cyberwarfare intent have incorporated tactical maneuvers normally associated with cybercrime. Cybercrime constitutes the criminal exploitation of digital systems to perpetrate unlawful activities through technological means (Hawdon 2021). Nowadays, the virtual nature, technological infrastructure, and limitless scalability of digital networks -- when combined with the misuse of big data analytics -- have paradoxically dissolved traditional national boundaries, transforming transnational criminal operations into borderless threats with globalized impact (Zhao and Cheng 2024). If the extent of cyberwarfare has reached the level of a criminal case, it should be strictly required to meet the standard of proof of a criminal case.\nTake the Shocknet virus, for example, which, in the course of cyberwarfare led to the damage of about 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz plant, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of Iranian centrifuges and delaying Iran's uranium enrichment program, in addition to the accidental spread of the Shocknet virus around the globe, which infected more than 100,000 computers. In terms of its impact, its nature has reached the seriousness of a criminal case. As Judge Higgins of the International\nCheng and Li\nDE GRUYTER\nCourt of Justice pointed out in his independent opinion in the Oil Platforms case, the more serious the allegations, the greater the degree of credibility of the evidence required.⁴ Therefore, in a case such as the Shocknet virus, which has already reached the standard of a criminal case, proof of the wrongfulness and attributability of the acts of the United States and Israel in the case will need to reach the level of beyond reasonable doubt.\nAs generative AI becomes widespread, the costs of creating and spreading viral false information, along with cross-border data storage, transfer, and processing expenses, are plummeting so that the frequency of cyber attacks is also on the rise (Cheng and Liu 2023). It is clearly unreasonable to apply the standards of cybercrime to all cyberattacks. A more rational approach would be to lower the burden of proof for cyberattacks that cause less damage and do not constitute a criminal case, similar to some of the standards of proof in civil litigation. But in any case, for the standard of proof of cyberwarfare is inappropriate to adopt the standard of prima facie evidence, \"prima facie evidence\" refers to \"sufficient to establish a fact or to establish a presumption, unless it is effectively rebutted\" evidence. A prima facie case can only mean that there is a possibility that the fact occurred, but it is not very convincing.\nMoreover, the application of that criterion to the determination of state responsibility would undoubtedly lead to a series of problems and increase the cost of dealing with cases because of its weak persuasiveness. For example, if a State was found to have committed a wrongful act merely because there was a possibility that it had done so, not only was there no basis in jurisprudence, but it would also be difficult for the international community to accept an assessment based on simple values. Additionally, the principle that the higher the gravity of the act, the higher the standard of proof is consistently reflected in academic discussions of international law, particularly concerning the International Court of Justice (Bills 2023). If a state is found to be liable for the high cost of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, it need only meet such a simple standard of proof, which clearly violates this principle.\n## 3.3 Normative boundaries of the deterrent factors of responsibility\nThe wrongfulness of an act is one of the elements of the law of state responsibility, and the absence of wrongfulness does not entail the responsibility of the state, a situation that can also be referred to as a cause of impediment to state responsibility, with an emphasis on the analysis of two cases: self-defense and countermeasures.\n⁴ Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.S.), I.C.J. Judgment of 6 November 2003, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, para.33.\nDE GRUYTER\nState responsibility in cyberwarfare\n11\nArticle 51 of the Charter of the United Nations states: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security”. The expression “armed attack” should be distinguished from “use of force” in Article 2(4). When analyzed using textual interpretation, it is clear that the degree of “armed attack” is much stronger than that of “use of force”.\nMoreover, the International Court of Justice, in the Nicaragua case, held that all attacks of force belonged to the use of force, but not all uses of force constituted an attack of force, and that only those that were the most serious and had a significant scale and consequences could constitute an “armed attack” (Leigh 1984). According to the relevant judgment, there is a difference in intensity between the two. The significance of this distinction should also be reflected in cyberattacks. If a cyber-attack by a State only constitutes a use of force under Article 2(4) but does not constitute an armed attack under Article 51, it is certainly a serious internationally wrongful act in breach of an obligation under international law of jus cogens, but the injured State can only take non-forceful “countermeasures” as provided for in the Draft Articles. Once such measures are found to constitute an armed attack, the injured State may invoke Article 51 to legitimately exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defense, including the use of force.\nCountermeasures in international law are non-forcible measures taken by an injured State against a State responsible for committing an internationally wrongful act to induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations, with the intention of restoring reciprocity between the parties (Omura 2010). Accordingly, countermeasures do not normally involve the use of force (Jia 2022). They are lawful, provided that they meet the conditions set out in Part Three of the Draft Articles.5 Countermeasures are generally used in cases where the use of force does not rise to the level of an armed attack and, by analogy, in the field of cyberwarfare in cases where the level of the attack is not overly aggressive. Cases such as the SolarWinds supply chain attack and the Stuxnet virus attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities have reached the level of an armed attack in terms of both the means used and the damage\n5 ICJ, Application of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia v. Greece), Judgment of 5 December 2011, para.164.\nCheng and Li\nDE GRUYTER\ncaused, and the right of self-defense can be triggered, no longer at the level of countermeasures.\nTraditional remedies such as compensation and restitution take some time to realize, and if one is only passively waiting for remedies there is a risk of further expanding losses, so as more timely remedies, both self-defense and countermeasures are necessary to avoid the expansion of losses to the maximum extent possible before traditional remedies can be obtained. Neither the right of self-defense nor the exercise of countermeasures is without limits. Customary law also limits the exercise of the right of self-defense, $^{6}$ and the use of force in self-defense remains wrongful if it is accompanied by a violation of international humanitarian law or human rights since special provisions of international humanitarian law (such as the prohibition on retaliatory measures against civilians or prisoners of war) and certain human rights are non-derogable in all circumstances (Crawford 2002).\nSimilarly, the scope of countermeasures is limited, as draft article 50, Paragraph 1, provides that countermeasures shall not affect: (a) the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; (b) obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; (c) obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; (d) other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. In addition, Article 50, Paragraph 2, makes it clear that a State taking countermeasures is not relieved from fulfilling its obligations: (a) under any dispute settlement procedure applicable between it and the responsible State; (b) to respect the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents, premises, archives, and documents.\n## 3.4 The practical significance of the realization mechanism of state responsibility\nThe state responsibility system is not only a rule implementation tool but also a carrier of the international community's value consensus. On this basis, once the state responsibility is recognized, it is necessary to fulfill the corresponding reality of the obligation. Attribution is not the ultimate goal; using attribution to further solve the problem is the significance of the state responsibility recognition. Under the background of cyber war, the significance of the reality is still worth paying attention to. State responsibility is assumed in various ways; here, we focus on analyzing the two main ways of restitution and compensation.\n$^{6}$ ICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep. (1996) 226, para.41.\nFirst of all, we analyze restitution, as the content of the remedy system with the largest scope of remedies, because it can directly eliminate the consequences of wrongdoing, Article 35 of the Draft Articles lists Restitution as a priority remedy. The conditions for the application of restitution included the principles of physical possibility and proportionality, which also required that restitution should not impose a “disproportionate burden” on the responsible State, such as requiring a poor State to bear a large share of the cost of restoration, which was clearly impractical and might be exempted. While the elimination of wrongful consequences is well conceived, and in practice it has been implemented to a certain extent, resulting in more effective State responsibility, restitution also faces contemporary challenges, such as the creation of irreversible damage. While it is naturally clear that nuclear contamination, species extinction, and the like cannot be truly restored in the traditional sense, it is also possible to cause irreversible damage in the context of cyberattacks.\nTake the SolarWinds supply chain attack as an example, the Russian intelligence service hijacked the U.S. SolarWinds software update by implanting malicious code to infiltrate the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and nine other federal agencies and hundreds of enterprises. This case not only resulted in the long-term exposure of intelligence networks and the leakage of sensitive data but also called into question the credibility of global IT supply chain security standards and led to a shift to “zero-trust” architectures and a sharp increase in the cost of international cooperation. While the technical damage can be remedied through compensation, the erosion of democracy is likely to be irreversible, as the cyber-attack has largely eroded public trust in the government's cybersecurity capabilities, which will be difficult to rebuild in a short period, and difficult to fully restore through restitution. Therefore, although restitution can theoretically maximize the compensation for the damage caused, it is obvious that it cannot be fully compensated in practice, and other remedies are needed to supplement it.\nSecondly, as one of the mainstream remedies, Article 31 of the Draft Articles establishes the obligation of the responsible State to provide “full reparation” for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act, which covers both material and moral damages, reflecting the purpose of the elimination of all the consequences of the injury. The principle of the Chorzów Factory case of the Permanent Court of International Justice, of 1928, also provides evidence of this: it establishes that reparation is required to restore the injured State to the “state it would have been in had the wrongful act not been committed”. Further analysis of the types of reparation and the scope of application reveals that reparation can be very broad, ranging from material to moral damages, from direct, quantifiable property damage to\nindirect, reasonably foreseeable, consequential damages, such as loss of profits due to interruption of trade. Indirect damages, however, often require stricter proof of causation, and the calculation of compensation was controversial at the current stage. In any case, as the mainstream way of assuming state responsibility, the existence of compensation is also of practical significance to the realization of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, which requires less time cost and can more efficiently compensate for the interests of the victimized state than the institutional correction and other methods.\n## Core dilemmas in the determination of state responsibility\nThe determination of state responsibility is of great significance, and can lead to real consequences such as restitution and compensation, but in the context of cyberwar, the core problems of the determination of state responsibility need to be paid attention to, mainly including the normative transformation obstacles of the technical attribution, the paradigm conflict of the application of the right of self-defense, and the systemic failure of the mechanism of responsibility assumption. Failure to analyze these dilemmas and propose solutions will make it difficult to trigger the consequences of state responsibility, which will not be conducive to the resolution of international disputes.\n### Normative transformation barriers to technical attribution\nThe MITRE ATT&CK framework, a widely adopted knowledge base of attack behaviors in the current cybersecurity field, can provide technical references for cyber-attack traceability by standardizing the description of attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures (Al-Sada et al. 2024; Georgiadou et al. 2021). However, the transformation of its technical references to legal evidence is facing difficulties.\nPrimarily, the paradigm conflict between technical logic and legal logic hinders the transformation of technical indicators into legal evidence to a certain extent. ATT&CK framework is based on the identification of attack behavioral patterns, such as the “credential dump + lateral movement” mode of APT29, attackers often use the system's functions and tools to operate by modifying the system configuration or using legitimate tools and other methods to move laterally, ATT&CK framework for the identification of the attack behavior pattern to derive technical indicators. However, according to Article 8 of the Draft Articles: The conduct of a person or\ngroup of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact, acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. It can be seen that a finding of State responsibility under international law requires proof of “effective control” of the attacking act in relation to the will of the State. For example, in the 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack, attackers injected malicious code called “Sunburst” into SolarWinds' flagship Orion software (Marelli 2022), even though security firms identified SUNBURST's TTPs through ATT&CK, such as T1059.001 command line interface abuse, but these technical characteristics can not directly prove that the Russian intelligence services of the main responsibility, the United States cited the ATT&CK report accusing Russia, but the international community in general to the “lack of direct chain of evidence” to question its legal effectiveness. In this case, even if it is recognized that there is indeed an attack, due to the inability to prove that the behavior is directed or controlled by a country, it is also difficult to use the technical indicators as evidence in the legal sense.\nSubsequently, the existence of intermediate nodes easily leads to a broken chain of evidence. Attackers commonly adopt the anonymizing technical architecture of “springboard server + virtual private network (VPN)”. Taking the 2016 Bangladesh central bank theft case as an example, although the C2 server IP of the SWIFT transaction instructions was traced to the Philippines, further investigation showed that the server was a puppet host controlled by the North Korean Lazarus group. This kind of multi-layer hopping leads to greater difficulty in technical traceability, and the result of traceability may also cause a break in the chain of evidence.\nAnother example is the attack on targets in China by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) through the QUANTUM attack platform, in which a number of modules are involved in concealing the identity of the attack, including QUANTUMBOT Module -- through the hijacking of the botnet command and control of network traffic, manipulating the botnet to launch attack activities and to hide the traces of the U.S. National Security Agency's hacking attacks.; QUANTUMBISCUIT Module -- builds a proxy springboard for quantum injection attacks against an attack target to prevent the attack from being detected retroactively; QUANTUMPHANTOM Module -- provides the technical ability to utilize network link intermediate node hijacking technology to achieve the hiding of the source of the attack, preventing the U.S. National Security Agency's cyberattacks against other countries from being traced back (Wei 2023). The use of multiple anonymization techniques undoubtedly creates a great obstacle to traceability work. Even if the source of the attack can be located accurately in the end, the identity of the operating subject behind the attack still needs to be further identified, and the attacker can be disguised as other countries/organizations or fake IP addresses, etc. to confuse the traceability (Schmitt 2017). The existence of intermediate nodes also makes it difficult to form a\nchain of evidence. The objective existence of obvious cyber attacks due to problems in the chain of evidence may not be able to carry out a trial in the end and even more accurately determine the responsibility of the state and solve the problem.\nIn addition, the “falsifiability” of technical indicators also weakens their probative value in practice. An important manifestation of this is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). It is widely recognized as the most sophisticated and powerful category of security threats (Ahmad et al. 2019). APTs are engineered by resourced, disciplined threat actors capable of sustained operations through systematic technology exploitation, blending expertise, funding, and structured coordination to maintain persistence (Maisey 2014; Mansfield-Devine 2014). APT organizations often falsify attack signatures through False Flag operations. The identification of false flags is inherently complex, primarily because attackers systematically conceal their actions while simultaneously framing innocent entities for malicious conduct (Rid and Buchanan 2015). Conducting a false flag operation in the cyber realm is fundamentally distinct and far simpler compared to its execution in the physical domain (Goodman 2010). For example, in the 2017 NotPetya ransomware incident, ATT&CK-based T1486 disk encryption analysis initially pointed to North Korea, but subsequent code homology analysis revealed a link to the Russian Sandworm organization. This type of technological misdirection makes the judicial application of the ATT&CK framework a “reasonable suspicion” challenge. As counterfeiting technologies evolve, the ATT&CK framework should also evolve with the times and develop more accurate techniques for identifying forgeries, or else the credibility of the technical indicators it produces may be further diminished in the face of the difficulty of transferring technical indicators to legal evidence.\n### Paradigm conflicts in the application of the right of self-defense\nEven in the face of cyberattacks, the exercise of the right of self-defense and countermeasures is not unlimited and still needs to comply with certain requirements, so it is still necessary to make a clearer discussion on the boundaries of the legality of the use of the right of self-defense and countermeasures in cyberwarfare.\nAs mentioned in the previous article, as to the question of whether cyber warfare constitutes the use of force under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, the “scale and consequence theory” proposed by Prof. Michael Schmit has the highest degree of acceptance at present. As long as the analysis is conducted according to the multiple indicators of scale and consequence, and the cyber-attack is considered to be a case of the use of force, then countermeasures or even the exercise of the right to self-defense can be taken. The most controversial issue at present is that the\nright to determine the use of force is in the hands of more developed countries, and the seemingly objective judgment criteria are to some extent mixed with subjective factors.\nAs is widely known, the Tallinn Manual edited by Prof. Michael Schmit, as a more authoritative and important reference document for the study of cyber warfare, has seven of the eight assessment criteria for determining whether the use of force constitutes a use of force, which are completely consistent with the criteria advocated by Prof. Michael Schmit himself. The criteria are somewhat arbitrary and subjective. For example, Professor Schmit himself, when applying these factors to analyze the 2007 cyberattack against Estonia, concluded that the attack constituted a use of force. Other scholars, however, have argued that the opposite conclusion that the cyberattack did not constitute a use of force can easily be reached by relying on these same factors, which can be easily manipulated in their application to reach conclusions that benefit the geostrategic objectives of the country being analyzed (Nguyen 2013).\nMoreover, when applied to cyberattacks, the “scale and consequence” standard has a fatal logical flaw: a given consequence of the same scale and severity can be produced by the use of force as well as by non-forceful means. The loss of life and the destruction of forests and land in a downstream country as a result of the discharge of toxic substances into a river by an upstream country or the starvation and economic turmoil of a country as a result of economic sanctions imposed by one country on another, are in themselves highly analogous to those that would normally result from the use of force. However, in general perception, these acts hardly constitute a use of force in international law or even an internationally wrongful act. In this way, such acts can escape legal sanction even if they have consequences comparable to those of the use of force. Cyberattacks, however, may be recognized as a use of force and subject to liability if they have the same legal consequences. This logical loophole exists partly because of the arbitrariness and subjectivity of the judgment standard. Western scholars with stronger discursive power often lower the threshold for the use of the right to self-defense through an expansive interpretation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, and in this regard, seemingly reasonable standards can often be interpreted to achieve political goals.\nIn addition to lowering the threshold of the right to self-defense through acts of interpretation, the United States has also put forward the “Defend Forward” strategy, which is an offensive defense strategy it has put forward in recent years in the field of cyberspace security, aiming to respond to cyber threats using proactive strikes and pre-emptive strikes. The United States Cyber Command has emphasized the need to adopt a “forward posture” in cyberspace by accessing non-Department of Defense networks or systems to weaken an adversary's cyber capabilities in advance and prevent it from taking action. Such an assertion should be relegated to the academic\ncategory of preventive self-defense, which is advocated by a few Western countries and Western scholars, but is not and should not be supported in existing international treaties and customary international law -- it means “granting the major powers an almost unrestricted license to use force” (Klabbers 2013). In summary, the definition of cyberwarfare and the various criteria for judging it, as well as the proposal of strategies such as “forward defense,” are undoubtedly suspected of serving political goals. Professor O'Connell also believes that “cyberwarfare” is a “wrong war”. It is essentially an “invented” problem in the context of the increasing militarization of cybersecurity policies of major Western countries (O'Connell 2012).\n### Systemic failure of responsibility mechanisms\nThe decentralized nature of cyberspace forms a structural contradiction with the “state-centered” responsibility framework of traditional international law, resulting in an imbalance in the distribution of responsibility between states and non-state actors, rigid rules of evidence, and a lack of enforcement mechanisms.\nFirst, the traditional logic of attribution has loopholes that need to be filled in the context of cyberspace, and the traditional theoretical criterion of “effective control” has limitations. This criterion originated from the 1986 case of Nicaragua v. United States, in which the ICJ made it clear that to attribute the conduct of non-state actors to a state (the United States), it is necessary to prove that the state exercised “effective control” over the specific military operation. Not only does the state provide general support such as funding, weapons, or training, but it also needs to have actual command over the specific unlawful action, i.e. the state needs to directly direct or specifically instruct the attack. However, the “outsourcing of tools” in cyberattacks has led to a high degree of invisibility of the state-attacker nexus. For example, in the case of the Iranian APT34 attack on Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in 2021, although the technical traceability showed that the attack tools were linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, it was not possible to prove that their actions were “specifically directed” by the state. In the context of cyberwarfare, “effective control” has the risk of being too rigid, leading to the impossibility of attribution, and the choice of whether to include other judgment criteria in such cases has been widely discussed, among which the theory of “overall control” is of particular research value.\nThe theory of “Overall Control” originated from the judgment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the case of Prosecutor v. Tadić. The Tribunal held that the conduct of a state can be attributed\nDE GRUYTER\nState responsibility in cyberwarfare\n19\nto the state even if it does not directly direct a specific attack, if the state has a strategic level of domination over non-state actors, including the provision of funds, equipment, training, and coordination of operations. From a conceptual analysis, this standard is largely different from the “effective control” standard, which has a lower threshold for attribution, and if the case of Nicaragua v. United States mentioned above were to be handled according to this standard, the United States would likely be found liable.\nIn the context of cyberwarfare, the anonymity of cyberattacks, technology dependence, and the ambiguity of actors make the traditional standard of attribution challenging, and the “overall control” theory has potential advantages in some respects. The criterion is superior in terms of identification in response to the prevalence of indirect support models. States often support cyberattacks through technological enablement, infrastructure harboring, or strategic guidance. Such behavior is more consistent with the “strategic dominance” characteristic of “overall control” than with the “specific instruction” requirement of “effective control”. For example, Russia’s relationship with APT28 is alleged to be in line with “overall control” in that the Russians provide technical resources but do not directly direct specific attacks, and the international community generally believes that the organization is supported by the Russian government and that the motivation for its attacks is closely related to Russia’s national interests.\nAccording to “overall control”, it is possible to hold Russia responsible, but according to the traditional “effective control” standard, it is difficult to hold it accountable. In addition, while the technical traceability of cyberattacks often only proves a continuing connection between the attacker and the state, and it is difficult to obtain evidence of direct orders, the “overall control” standard eliminates the need to prove a control relationship between the state and the attacker, and allows for a more efficient allocation of responsibility. Although the “overall control” standard has its role in the context of cyberwarfare, it is still difficult to accept it as the standard for attribution of responsibility in the current mainstream view, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia Serbia and Montenegro, the ICJ explicitly rejected the standard of “overall control” and insisted on the strict interpretation of “effective control”,[9] which can provide a reference basis for the attribution of responsibility for cyber warfare. Moreover, there is a risk of political abuse if a more lenient standard is adopted, as when the U.S. sanctioned a Chinese technology company based on “overall control” in the absence of publicly available technical evidence to support it. While this standard is not appropriate in all cases, it is clear that the traditional standard is not fully applicable, and the international community\n[9] Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, General List No. 91.\nshould continue to explore new, more reasonable standards in practice to address the limitations of the traditional standard.\nSecondly, the traditional attribution criterion is also difficult in practice. The system of attribution of responsibility for non-state actors is not perfect, which leads to the failure of the mechanism for assuming responsibility to play a full role, potentially allowing non-state actors to avoid legal penalties, especially transnational science and technology enterprises to circumvent the responsibility of the behavior at this stage has not been effectively resolved. For example, Zero-Day Vulnerability, as a security flaw that has not yet been discovered or fixed by software vendors, has a unique “gray area” in the trading market due to the ambiguity of its participants, uses, and legal attributes. There are cases where private vulnerability brokers sell zero-day vulnerabilities to governments, but international law does not clarify whether such transactions constitute “assisting in the commission of cyber-attacks”. In terms of the actual situation at this stage, international legislation is undoubtedly lagging behind, and existing cybercrime conventions have not yet explicitly stipulated specific provisions directly targeting “vulnerability trading”.\nIn addition, the EU's “Network Resilience Act” only requires vendors to establish a vulnerability handling process, does not regulate third-party transactions. In China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Internet Information Office, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly issued the “Provisions on the Management of Security Vulnerabilities in Network Products”, which clearly states that no organization or individual shall illegally collect, sell or distribute information on security vulnerabilities in network products, but the standard of “illegality” lacks specific interpretation, and loopholes exist in the determination of “illegality”. The U.S. “Vulnerability Equity Program” is not binding, vendors can refuse to cooperate. It can be seen that the existing law for the actors did not make comprehensive provisions, so the use of zero-day vulnerabilities in cyber attacks on multinational technology enterprises has the possibility of circumventing legal responsibility, liability mechanism due to the lack of comprehensiveness, but also may be further dysfunctional.\n## Reconstructing the path of state responsibility in cyber warfare\nUnder the increasingly complex background of cyber warfare, it is of great practical significance to find a more reasonable path of state responsibility. On the one hand, further improvement of the traditional attribution mechanism can enhance the persuasive power of the attribution; on the other hand, through the innovation of\njudicial procedures, the realization of state responsibility can be further refined to avoid the emergence of unreasonable responsibility which is too light or too heavy. State responsibility in cyberwarfare has room for improvement in both judgment standard and realization, and if it can be adjusted under the common recognition of the international community, it can to a certain extent avoid subjective factors affecting the judgment and assumption of state responsibility.\n### Improving the attribution mechanism\nOne of the important reasons why the attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyber warfare has a certain subjective element is that there is no universally recognized technical attribution mechanism, which to a certain extent has led to the divergence of attribution standards among countries for cyber warfare. Although there is more authoritative literature such as the Tallinn Manual for reference, the nature of international law is, after all, soft law. While States can use soft law to solve the problem of coordinated gaming (Guzman and Meyer 2010), international law is not as binding as it could be if a State's political aspirations need to be realized urgently. In addition, if some countries do not sign an international treaty on cybersecurity, and the content of the treaty has not developed into a custom, a considerable number of countries can claim that they do not carry out activities in the cyber field in accordance with the rules in the treaty. Moreover, even for those countries that have signed such treaties, the cost of withdrawing from them is not high. Finally, although relevant documents are constantly being issued, how to deal with conflicts between them is a subjective process. From this point of view, the mere formulation of international law on cybersecurity is relatively limited in enhancing the rationality of attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nIn this context, promoting the international community to establish a technical attribution institution can be a better choice. First of all, compared with soft law, the institution established under the wide recognition of the international community is more persuasive and can avoid to a greater extent the situation that countries choose the judgment standard of state responsibility based on their own political opinions. Secondly, the establishment of a technical attribution body can help promote policy coordination and resource sharing among countries in the field of cybersecurity. Through multilateral cooperation, countries can fully express their demands, formulate unified international legal standards to deal with transnational cyber threats under the principle of pursuing the greatest common interests, conduct in-depth discussions on reasonable motions to ensure the comprehensiveness and\nextensiveness of the attribution standards and reduce the troubles caused by the differences in the laws of different countries.\nFurthermore, technical attribution organizations can establish an information-sharing platform to share the latest information on cyberattacks and technological advances promptly, and such an information-sharing mechanism can improve the ability of countries to respond to cyber threats. For example, the Enhanced Attribution (EA) program initiated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is very informative. The goal of the EA program is to develop techniques to generate operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent and independent malicious cyber campaigns and to create a methodology by which this information can be shared with multiple parties without jeopardizing the intelligence sources and methodologies. By collecting, monitoring, and understanding adversary cyberattack operations in the red space, the program is expected to be divided into three technical areas (TAs) that will work in parallel with each other. They will span three 18-month phases, after which the agency will step in to obtain high-quality results. This activity will undoubtedly empower the attribution criteria with more precise technology, which is expected to target the subjects of wrongdoing with greater precision. Such meaningful criteria, if adopted by technical attribution agencies, would certainly contribute to the standardization of technical attribution.\nBased on the establishment of technical attribution institutions and the development of technical attribution criteria, the criterion of “effective control” in the traditional attribution criteria needs to be expanded. The obstacle to the normative transformation of technical attribution mentioned earlier is largely due to the rigid application of the criterion of “effective control”. In light of the complexity of cyberwarfare models, the concept of “material support” should be introduced, so that if a State systematically provides vulnerabilities, infrastructure, or funding to non-State actors that cause the same level of consequences as a direct direct order, it will be held liable even if there is no direct order. Although this approach has not become a common practice in the international community, the continued rigid application of the traditional criterion of proving a directive relationship will undoubtedly allow certain subjects to avoid the risk of assuming State responsibility, which is difficult to accept in terms of jurisprudence. Therefore, based on the principle of the “effective control” criterion, consideration should be given to the use of “substantial support” to make judgments when the act of support has a significant impact and is directly related to the acts or purposes of the supported party, thus constituting substantial support. The adoption of such a criterion is not only legally sound but also creates conditions for the application of technical attribution to a greater extent. The adoption of the “substantial support” criterion for attribution when the support provided by a State can be traced back to that State by technical\nmeans and it can be established that the State providing the assistance constitutes substantial support can avoid the rigid application of the traditional criterion, which would jeopardize the results obtained through technical tracing.\n### Adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism\nThe establishment of an international attribution agency is certainly of great significance to the determination of state responsibility, but it only involves the work of attribution, and if we want to comprehensively reconstruct the responsibility of the state in cyberwarfare, it must be built on the basis of a broad consensus among all countries, and the blueprint for the establishment of an international attribution agency as mentioned in the previous section is also built on the basis of the consensus of all countries. Therefore, the consensus of all countries is a fundamental condition. It is obviously unrealistic for the international community to reach consensus in the short term, because the more vulnerable countries may consider that the adjustment of rules has nothing to do with them. In this case, the big countries are more important to play a pioneering role and set an example through concrete actions. The adjustment of the multilateral cooperation mechanism is conducive to the rationalization of the judgment of national responsibility in cyber warfare, and is also conducive to the regulation of the cyber offensive behavior of individual countries, so that all countries in the international community can benefit from it. The specific cooperation mechanism can be adjusted as follows:\nForemost, regional confidence-building measures should be further developed. The most important is the establishment of a cyberspace “hotline mechanism”, which can reduce the information gap through effective communication and avoid the emergence of unnecessary cyberattacks. As early as during the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, this “hotline mechanism” demonstrated its important value. During the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, both sides in the nuclear arms race and military confrontation realized that the lack of direct communication channels could lead to miscalculation and escalation of the conflict. In 1963, the U.S. and the Soviet Union established the “hotline mechanism”, which allowed leaders to communicate quickly, directly, and privately in emergency situations, thereby eliminating the risk of nuclear war resulting from communication delays or misunderstandings of each other's actions. To this day, this mechanism is used as an important tool. In 2022, during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the U.S. and Russia established a military hotline to avoid miscalculations and military accidents. The “hotline mechanism” has gone a long way in avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings and remains indispensable in the context of cyberwarfare. 2020s attack on India's power grid could be a case in point. on October 12, 2020, Mumbai, India, experienced a massive blackout that affected\ncritical infrastructure, including stock exchanges and healthcare facilities. The New York Times reported that the blackout may have been linked to China, claiming that “Chinese malware hacked into India's power supply control system” in order to pressure India in the India-China border standoff. Although this claim was later clarified by Recorded Future, a cybersecurity company mentioned in the report, and officially denied by Indian officials, it still caused a certain degree of damage to China's image, and if the “hotline mechanism” had been adopted at that time, it could have avoided the misleading public opinion and the waste of investigation resources. This shows that China, the United States, Russia and other countries have taken the lead in setting up real-time communication channels, clarifying in a timely manner in the event of miscalculation, and reducing unnecessary costs and expenditures, which is still necessary in the context of cyber warfare.\nConcomitantly, adjusting the public-private partnership. In the context of cyberwarfare, cooperation between countries is certainly important, but operators often also have a large amount of relevant information. To further reduce the cost of controlling the occurrence of cyberwarfare, it is indispensable for operators and governments to jointly build a threat intelligence-sharing platform. Adopting this model not only facilitates research between countries based on a large number of cases provided by operators to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the cases, but also reduces the effort of searching for cyberattacks from all over the world, saves time and cost, and efficiently builds identification and defense measures. This model has been reflected in the JCDC model in the U.S. JCDC participants that include organizations and operators from both the public and private sectors, covering service providers, infrastructure operators, cybersecurity companies, and companies in the critical infrastructure industry.\nIn addition, JCDC constituents include specific government agencies designated by Congress, such as the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It is through the operator-government co-built threat intelligence-sharing platform that the JCDC shares real-time information through multiple platforms, such as Slack, the Homeland Security Information Network HSIN, and the GovDelivery service, to ensure that there is continuous dialog and collaboration among the participants. This also sets the stage for the development of proactive cyber defense programs to mitigate the most serious risks before threats become visible. Moreover, “gatekeeper liability” for technology companies can be introduced, as Article 6 of The EU's Digital Services Act indicates that “where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, the service provider shall not be liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that the provider”. By analyzing the exemption\nfrom liability of the hosting service provider of the online platform and the relevant conditions, it can be seen that the online platform should have a certain degree of responsibility for reviewing the information provided by the service recipient (Lefouili and Madio 2022). For content that is clearly of a cyber-attack nature, the provider of the online service should exercise a certain degree of scrutiny, in particular, cloud computing giants are required to filter malicious traffic, or else they may be considered to bear the corresponding joint and several liability.\nFinally, a “digital ceasefire zone” system could be included in the scope of discussion. Healthcare, energy and other livelihood areas are of great importance, and if they are subjected to cyberattacks, they will often lead to more serious consequences, and should be categorized as no-attack zones, so that if certain countries carry out non-compliant cyberattacks, violators will be automatically triggered by the United Nations to sanction them. According to the context that cyber-peacekeeping has been suggested as a strategic framework to address the multifaceted challenges posed by diverse manifestations of cyber conflict (Dorn 2017), in order to support the implementation of the system, we can also consider the establishment of a “network peacekeeping force”, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to send technical teams to assist in the restoration of network services in conflict areas. The reason why it should be coordinated by the ITU is that, under its supervision, the technical teams will be able to use more reasonable means to respond to cyber attacks. Shortly after the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, controversy erupted over the way Ukraine set up the International Volunteer Team for Cyber Defense to carry out cyberattacks against Russian targets, and its development of tools, which allows any digital device to become part of a DDoS attack network, was deemed to be a violation of international cyber norms. The existence of a unified body for coordination would make it possible to bring the corresponding tools into line with the principle of proportionality.\n### Innovations in judicial procedures\nIn addition to further clarifying the criteria for attribution of state responsibility and minimizing the frequency of cyberwar through multilateral cooperation mechanisms, there is also a need for innovation in the judicial process, because most cyberwars are ultimately handled through the judicial process, and therefore adopting a more feasible judicial process is conducive to a more reasonable distribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nFirstly, the International Court of Justice could create a panel of judges specialized in cyberspace cases, allowing for the submission of electronic evidence and anonymous witnesses. There is a precedent for such a special chamber, namely\nthe Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which is a special judicial procedure set up within the ITLOS to hear disputes between States arising from the exploration and exploitation of the international seabed area. In response to the increasingly complex cyberwarfare, which should be handled more rigorously, and the identification and allocation of State responsibility should be more reasonable, the traditional team of judges may not be able to make accurate judgments when faced with the special field of cyber. The idea that selecting judges with relevant backgrounds enhances efficiency is supported by academic research, which suggests that a judge's prior experience and characteristics can influence their decision-making (Basabe-Serrano 2019). At this time, the selection of judges with cyber background to form a team specializing in cyberspace cases is conducive to more efficiently identifying the nature of cyberattacks and, with the help of increasingly developed technological means, more reasonably allocating state responsibility on the basis of technical indicators.\nMeanwhile, through the leading role of the International Court of Justice, countries can also select judges with expertise in international law, cyber technology, data protection, and other fields through a special selection mechanism to form domestic teams specialized in handling cyber cases. From this, we can see that such a move can not only further solve the problem of cyber warfare among countries but also serve as an inspiration for the handling of cyber cases within countries. The team of judges can cooperate with other international organizations (such as Interpol and the United Nations Office on Cybercrime) to analyze the ever-emerging new forms and the constantly updating and iterative advanced technologies in order to formulate more reasonable judgment standards and solution measures, so as to jointly address the global challenges in cyberspace.\nIn addition, consideration could be given to legitimizing “preventive countermeasures” by allowing for pre-emptive defences against highly probable cyberattacks under the authority of the Security Council. Referring to Article 50 of the UN Charter on temporary measures against economic sanctions, UN Member States, in their actions for the maintenance of international peace and security, should refrain from any action that might widen a dispute or aggravate a situation. And the UN Security Council is tasked with resolving international disputes and can establish frameworks for peaceful settlements, aligning with Article 1 of the UN Charter so that Member States should take appropriate steps to prevent the extension or aggravation of the dispute in accordance with the recommendations of the UNSC (Alipour 2024). It was mentioned earlier that countermeasures must be a means to be taken only if there is a realistic attack. However, in the context of cyberwarfare, it is often too late to take countermeasures if one has to wait until there is an attack. Due to the intensity and scope of cyberattacks, a country's cyber system may not be able to function after an attack, let alone take defensive measures. Under such\ncircumstances, it is particularly important to formulate “preventive countermeasures” with reference to Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations. This kind of prevention cannot be advanced indefinitely and should be judged according to the recommendations of the UN Security Council. However, the international community needs to discuss in depth what kind of preventive measures should be taken in order to arrive at a standard. In any case, even if this kind of advance measure is recognized, it still needs to be regulated by the corresponding standards, or else powerful countries can launch disproportionate “preventive countermeasures” against less dangerous cyberattacks in pursuit of their own national political demands, which is contrary to the original purpose of the measure.\nWhile considering innovations in the judicial process, there is also a need for flexibility in the use of various methods to solve the problems that arise in the process, such as the use of legal discourse. In addressing the dual imperatives of legislative innovation and jurisprudential reconceptualization, legal discourse analysis as a vital interdisciplinary instrument, offers multidimensional frameworks to decode evolving normative constructs within contemporary governance systems (Neuwirth 2023). The degree of formality in legal language mirrors the solemn nature of judicial proceedings, whereas the presence or absence of polite expressions can signal deference, confrontational intent, or calculated positioning. These deliberate language patterns fundamentally shape both the courtroom environment and participants' interpretations of interactions, ultimately guiding behavioral responses throughout legal exchanges (Mısır and Akın 2024). In addition, the refinement of legal discourse patterning can be enhanced by studying a large number of cases in the European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union issues its rulings in 23 legally binding linguistic versions, reflecting the mandate established under Article 217 of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. This foundational provision, originally enacted as the European Council's inaugural legislative instrument, constitutionally guarantees that every member state's national language maintains equal juridical standing as an official working language of the Union (Trklja 2024). Based on the breadth of these cases, summarizing them will undoubtedly be beneficial for a more accurate use of legal language.\nUltimately, in the process of optimization, the participation of artificial intelligence is an irreversible trend, and the various advantages of artificial intelligence can undoubtedly improve efficiency, but the existence of hidden loopholes in various aspects of technology, ethics and other aspects also need to be paid attention to. Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transnational challenge demanding coordinated governance architectures, necessitating the establishment of multilateral regulatory systems capable of ensuring operational synergy, policy harmonization, and adaptive scalability across jurisdictions (Neuwirth 2024). And transitioning to centralized regulatory frameworks proves indispensable for steering generative AI\ndevelopment along ethically aligned trajectories (Cheng and Liu 2024). To effectively address existential risks in artificial intelligence development, institutionalizing ethical guardrails through a “Digital Humanism” framework becomes imperative. This paradigm prioritizes human-centric imperatives by safeguarding species-wide wellbeing and systemic security, while strategically decoupling technological advancement from zero-sum competition. Such an approach ensures that technological evolution maintains symbiotic alignment with civilizational priorities (Cheng and Gong 2024). Today sanctions and anti-sanctions have evolved into a dominant strategic pattern within contemporary geopolitical interactions (Gu and Zhao 2023), which makes it all the more important that more rational judicial procedures be used to mitigate the growing conflict.\n## Conclusions\nThe accelerated militarization of cyberspace has plunged the state responsibility system into a “triple normative dilemma”: first, the transformation of technical evidence into legal facts has led to the failure of the attribution mechanism; second, the hermeneutical controversy over the boundaries of the right to self-defense has triggered a crisis of the legitimacy of the countermeasures; and third, the vacuum in the allocation of responsibility due to the involvement of non-State actors has resulted in the systematic failure of the enforcement mechanism. These structural impediments not only undermine the deterrent effect of international law, but also contribute to the “low-cost-high-benefit” nature of cyberwarfare, which continues to induce opportunistic tactics by state actors.\nWhile existing governance frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0's “principle of equivalence of effects” and the Convention on Cybercrime's territoriality provision provide guidance on rules at the local level, they are not able to cope with complex cyberconflicts due to institutional fragmentation and technological adaptability deficiencies. For example, the Tallinn Manual's 2.0 Rule 69's eight-dimensional assessment model of the threshold for the use of force faces an attenuation of its explanatory power when dealing with generative AI-driven cognitive warfare; and the Budapest Convention's Mutual Legal Assistance Mechanism is in an implementation dilemma due to the anonymity of cryptocurrencies.\nTo solve the above dilemmas, it is urgent to build a three-in-one path of “technical verification, rule iteration, and mechanism synergy” to reconfigure the responsibility: (1) technical empowerment of attribution mechanism: building a verifiable attribution system, and realizing the transformation of MITRE ATT&CK framework into a judicial system; (2) adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism, building regional confidence measures, strengthening public-private partnership, and strengthening the\nDE GRUYTER\nState responsibility in cyberwarfare\n29\ncooperation between the public and the private; (3) multi-layer governance for responsibility-sharing: establishment of an “international arbitration tribunal for cyberspace” on the basis of the United Nations platform, and design of corresponding cyber-peacekeeping forces to cooperate in governance.\nThis reconstruction path has dual normative value: at the level of substantive law, through the legalization of preventive responsibility and due diligence, the “risk spillover” behavior of the state in cyberspace is curbed; at the level of procedural law, with the help of technology-neutral third-party evidence collection mechanism, the cognitive gap between technological logic and judicial review can be bridged. Only by realizing the in-depth mutual embedding of technical governance and international law can the “tragedy of the commons” effect of cyberwar be suppressed, and the paradigm shift of the community of destiny in cyberspace from conceptual advocacy to institutional practice be promoted.\n**Research funding:** This work was supported by the project of National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 24BYY151) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhejiang University.",

Due to the ambiguity of the object of regulation, the defect of attribution mechanism, and the lack of clarity of the constituent elements of responsibility, the existing international law framework has caused the state responsibility system in cyberspace to fall into the dilemma of normative failure. This paper takes the theory of international law subjectivity as the logical starting point and systematically deconstructs the normative attributes of cyberwar and the path of responsibility determination. This paper shows that the constitutive elements of state responsibility need to break through the rigid standard of traditional\"behavior-damage\"causality and build a dynamic attribution system combining technical verification and legal presumption. Through critical analysis of the use of force threshold doctrine, this paper, based on a comprehensive analysis of the core dilemma of the determination of state responsibility, proposes to appropriately introduce the concept of\"substantial support\", and when the traditional theory of comprehensive control fails to make effective attribution, the criterion of\"substantial support\"can be used to complete the attribution of state responsibility with the increasingly developed technological traceability means.\nKeywords: cyberwarfare; international law; state responsibility; attributability *Corresponding author: Haonan Li, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: lihaonan22402065@zju.edu.cn. https://orcid.org/0009-0005-0476-300X Le Cheng, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: chengle163@hotmail.com. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4423-8585 The militarized transformation of cyberspace has upended the cognitive architecture of the use of force under the Westphalian system. Traditional military theory faces challenges when applied to cyber conflict. The evolution of cyberwarfare from a technological tool to a means of strategic deterrence has led to a blurring of the legal boundaries between peacetime and armed conflict. And the increasing effectiveness of cyberattacks further complicates the legal context of cyberwarfare. The traditional state responsibility regime needs to be reconfigured due to a triple adaptive dilemma: first, technological anonymity triggers a break in the chain of attribution, which puts the “effective control” criterion in Article 8 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility in a difficult position to prove; second, the non-kinetic nature of cyber operations makes it difficult to quantify the threshold for the use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations; and third, the legitimacy boundary of countermeasures creates normative conflicts under the “forward defense” strategy.\nThis paper adopts a techno-legal cross-analysis approach to focus on the normative reconstruction path of state responsibility in cyber warfare. By deconstructing the dilemma of determining state responsibility at the current stage and proposing corresponding reconstruction paths, this paper attempts to discuss how the determination standard of the attribute of force in cyberwarfare can be coordinated with the “principle of equivalence of effect” of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the mode of assuming the indirect responsibility of the state in the context of the intervention of non-state actors. It is hoped that through the reconstruction of various paths, the issue of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare can be clarified as much as possible, and the diffuse damage caused by cyberwarfare can be curbed. This paper aims to provide theoretical support for the clear identification of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare and to promote the formation of a technologically empowered international law governance paradigm.\n## Deconstructing the normative attributes of cyberwarfare ### The evolution of the conceptual genealogy of cyberwarfare The generation of the normative concept of cyberwarfare has gone through the process of discourse migration from military science to jurisprudence. The concept of cyberwarfare first appeared in a research report by the RAND Corporation in 1993, which defined cyberwarfare as a military operation being implemented or prepared to be implemented according to information-related principles. In the strategic dimension, the concept of cyberwarfare was accompanied by the completion of the ontological construction of the theory of the “Fifth Dimension”, which was recognized by Huang (2015), who argued that “the rapid development of the global Internet has been driven by the rapid advancement of information technology, and cyberspace has begun to take shape as the ‘fifth space' beyond the land, sea, airspace and outer space”. At the same time, a variety of problems and threats such as cyber-attacks and cybercrime have also arisen, and the concept of “cyber warfare” is put forward in this context. On the one hand, along with the development of science and technology, the scale of cyber warfare has reached an unprecedented level, such as the cyber attack and defense in the Russo-Georgian war, the Iranian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the Shocknet virus, the Syrian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the airstrikes, and other cases, all of which are the embodiment of the escalation of the intensity of modern cyber warfare. On the other hand, the relevant theoretical research has been optimized based on the endless cyber warfare.\nCompared with China's late start in cyberwarfare research, western countries have begun research on cyberwarfare earlier, with a larger scale and wider scope, and have also achieved rich results in the formulation of international rules in cyberspace. Since the development of relevant theories, the current mainstream scholars believe that the content of international law on jus ad bellum can be applied to cyber warfare. For example, Reese Nguyen (2013) believes that when a cyber attack is intended to cause irreversible damage or physical loss to the physical information system, it can be recognized as constituting an attack with force. The main argument in favor of this claim is based on Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, which states that “all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. There are different doctrinal understandings of how to argue that cyberwarfare is a use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, as will be presented in the next section.\n### 2.2 Doctrines of thresholds for use of force in cyberwarfare At present, mainstream scholars believe that cyberwarfare constitutes the use of force, but there are different doctrines in understanding, mainly the theory of purpose, instrumental theory, scale, and consequence theory. Walter Sharp (1999), a representative of the “purpose theory”, argues that computer network attacks are a form of economic and political coercion, and although such coercion is traditionally considered not to be a “use of force”, in the light of the purpose of the Charter of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, and the territorial integrity and political independence of States guaranteed by Article 2(4), computer network attacks should also be subject to Article 2(4) since economic and political coercion would also threaten international peace and jeopardize the territorial integrity and political independence of a State, and would therefore be covered by the scope of the Article.\nMarco Roscini (2010), a representative of the “tools doctrine”, argues that the “military force” that Article 2(4) intends to regulate is mainly embodied in the use of specific weapons (or tools) and that cyber-attacks using “weapons” such as Trojan horses, worms, etc. can also constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) if they produce specific tangible or intangible damage. The most widely accepted theory is the “scale and consequences theory”, in which Professor Michael Schmitt (1999, 2011) argues that although the main purpose of Article 2(4) is to constrain a state's external use of traditional military force to coerce others, in practice what matters is not the means used but the consequences; if a cyber-attack directly causes or is likely to cause damage to persons or objects comparable to that caused by military means, it should undoubtedly constitute a “use of force”; even if it does not cause tangible damage to persons or objects, the victimized State can still determine whether a cyber-attack constitutes a “use of force” by assessing the following seven criteria: (a) severity, (b) immediacy, (c) directness, (d) invasiveness, (e) measurability of effects, (f) presumptive legality and (g) state involvement. Although there are strengths and weaknesses in each viewpoint, as far as the existing situation is analyzed, the scale and consequence theory is recognized by majority of researchers, and the proposition of Prof. Michael Schmit has had a greater impact in the Western academic community, not only in the Tallinn Manual, which is edited by him but also recognized by Western countries. It is worth mentioning that the Tallinn Manual, as a document developed with the participation of multinational subjects, contains seven out of eight assessment criteria for defining whether a cyberattack constitutes a use of force that are identical to those mentioned in the previous article, which indicates that the evaluation criteria advocated by the scale and consequences theory have their own rationality and can be generally accepted by the majority of countries.\nIt should be noted that the research on issues related to cyberwarfare in this paper is based on cases where cyberwarfare can trigger international responsibility, and cyber infringement and cybercrime activities, which are only regulated by the domestic laws of various countries as well as a small number of international treaties, obviously do not fall into the category of use of force as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations 2(4), and they also cannot trigger the responsibility of the State, and therefore do not fall within the scope of this paper's analysis.\n## Normative elements and paths to attribution of state responsibility in cyberwarfare ### Normative basis and constitutive elements of the state responsibility regime The institutional framework of state responsibility in international law is rooted in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Articles). According to Chapter I and Chapter II of the Draft Articles, the establishment of state responsibility requires the fulfillment of two normative elements: wrongfulness and attributability. In the following, the two elements will be analyzed separately.\nInitially, the analysis of wrongfulness. In Article 2 of the Draft Articles, the International Law Commission defines that “there is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law, and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.” In the context of cyberwarfare, it is clear that most cases of wrongful acts are in the form of action, as exemplified by the Russo-Georgian war: the Georgian government website was attacked, the government web server was on the verge of collapsing due to the large number of access requests it received for more than 10 h, the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was completely dysfunctional, and the website of the presidential administration was paralyzed for 24 h. As the fighting deepened, the intensity and sophistication of the cyber-attacks increased, with Russia targeting Georgia's government and news media websites as the primary targets, disabling virtually all of Georgia's government offices. Second, it is worth noting that the article does not mention that subjective fault or intent to engage in a wrongful act is required to establish state responsibility; the mere existence of a violation of the law is sufficient to give rise to international responsibility, and, by extension, state responsibility should be an objective rather than a subjective responsibility. The normative logic of this objective responsibility paradigm, which rejects the subjective fault element, is that the unlawfulness of an internationally wrongful act arises from an objective breach of an international obligation rather than from the state of mind of the acting state.\nIn addition, the article requires that the wrongful act constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state, and for a further understanding of the Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER obligation, one can refer to the definitions in Articles 12 and 13 of the Draft Articles. Article 12 provides that there is a breach of an international obligation by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. Article 13 provides that an act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs. In other words, the key feature of a breach of an international obligation is that the obligation should have been complied with, but in fact, the State in question did not take reasonable action to comply with the obligation.\nArticle 12 makes it clear that, regardless of the origin or character of the obligation, when analyzed in terms of the sources of international law, the source of the obligation is varied, and may be a customary one, or one based on a treaty, or even a legal principle generally recognized by the international community. In the Rainbow Warrior case, for example, the arbitral tribunal stated that there is no distinction in international law between contractual and tortious liability, so any breach by a State of a duty, regardless of the source of the duty, gives rise to the responsibility of the State and therefore to an obligation to make reparation.¹ This case is very strong evidence of the broadness of the source of the obligation.\nThe broadness of the source of the obligation is conducive to the regulation of cyberwarfare. First, for States parties to cyberwarfare-related treaties, such as the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, a violation of the content of the treaty can constitute a direct breach of the obligation. Second, for countries not participating in the treaty, if the relevant practice of maintaining network security has been generally recognized in the international community and can become a kind of habit, the habit can also be used as a source of obligation, and if it does not comply with the habit, it is also possible to find that a country violates the obligation, which undoubtedly enlarges the scope of the main body needing to comply with the obligation, and allows more countries to consciously comply with the obligation. What's more, the identification and formation of general principles are essential for maintaining international law as a coherent legal system. Therefore, sometimes principles can also govern the behavior of States. It should be noted, however, that even if a State commits certain acts of cyberattack against another State and causes damage, if it does not constitute a breach of an international obligation, it will not give rise to the legal responsibility of the author State.\n¹ Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (New Zealand v. France) (“Rainbow Warrior”), Award of 30 April 1990, 20 UNRIAA 215, para.75.\nCorrespondingly, attributability is then analyzed. Theoretically, all acts of individuals, corporations, or other entities in the sense of domestic law may be attributed to a State (Government) based on nationality. In dealing with this issue, the Draft Articles adopt a narrow approach, namely, the “overall control test”, whereby the only conduct that can be attributed to a State is that of State organs or other entities acting under the direction, control, or instigation of a State organ, which becomes an agent of the State at the time of the conduct. As far as the attributability of the state in cyber warfare is concerned, if a cyber attack is initiated or directed by the state as the main body, the corresponding responsibility is borne by the state. In simple cases, the attributability of state responsibility can be quickly recognized. However, since the development of cyberwarfare, identifying the source of cyber-attacks is crucial to ensuring cybersecurity, its technical means have become increasingly flexible, and many attribution problems are caused by anonymous attacks, and the attackers can often easily hide their identities, which has brought great challenges to the tracking of the source of the attack. Even if the source of the attack is identified, the subject needs to be further clarified. The subject of a cyberattack can avoid being targeted by hiding or forging his identity in many ways, so pinpointing the subject is also a major challenge.\nIn addition, when a country helps another country to engage in internationally wrongful acts, the former also to the extent of the support, helps to bear state responsibility, but the main state responsibility still belongs to the wrongdoing state. But regardless of the size of state responsibility, by analogy, in the context of cyberwarfare, if a country provides technical means or financial support and other help to other countries, in principle, it should also bear the corresponding responsibility, and if that State has both wrongful acts and breaches of its obligations, it may also satisfy the constituent elements of State responsibility, and thus bear State responsibility in cyberwarfare to the extent of the damage caused by that State.\n### Hierarchical construction of standards of proof As a component of the constituent elements, whether it is the judgment of wrongfulness or the judgment of attributability, there is the problem of proof. In fact, for the legal field of the problem, the standard of proof has been extremely important, from the traditional theory of evidence, the standard of proof is the judge to consider and weigh the authenticity of the facts of the case to achieve the degree of proof, but also the burden of proof to provide the appropriate evidence to prove the facts of the case to achieve a certain standard. The degree of standard of proof is directly related to the judge for the degree of conviction of the evidence, which naturally will affect the results of the judgment. Criminal law, civil law, and Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER other substantive areas of law, after a long period of development, in their litigation process also have their standard of proof, although different standards for the results of the judgment have a decisive impact, the litigant naturally needs to try to meet the standard of proof. On the other hand, for the facts that have occurred, no one has the ability to $100\\%$ reproduce the scene, they can only try to prove to maximize the proximity of the objective facts, thus providing judges with a good judgment environment so that judges as far as possible can make a reasonable judgment, and the standard of proof from this sense of understanding is also the embodiment of substantive justice.\nOutside the traditional field of substantive law, the standard of proof is also of great significance to the issue of international law. In international law, the composition of state responsibility needs to satisfy both illegal behavior and attributable elements, but the proof of the two elements is also a separate issue, whether the two standards of proof are consistent, and if not, what kind of standards should be used is an urgent discussion. As early as before the emergence of the problem of evidence in the field of networks, the International Court of Justice pointed out in the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua that the key to the solution to the problem lies not only in the process of attributing conduct to the law of a particular country but also in the search for substantial evidence before the process of legal attribution. It is thus clear that the question of the standard of proof is not simply an integral part of the question of the attribution of State responsibility, but is more relevant for independent discussion.\nAs far as the current situation is concerned, there is a lack of a uniform and clear standard of proof in international law. In the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice emphasized the principle of the free assessment of evidence, stating that within the limits of the Statute of the Court and the Rules of the Tribunal, the Court is free to assess the value of any evidence.3 While the persistent lack of uniform standards in international law has been detrimental to the development of proof, an analysis of the nature of the cases before the ICJ shows that there is a corresponding rationale for the absence of uniform standards of proof that the complexity and diversity of the cases before the ICJ make it difficult to arrive at a uniform standard that would be universally or primarily applicable to inter-State litigation.\nIn addition, although the Court's deficiencies in the standard of proof may lead to subjective factors on the part of the judges affecting the decision of the case, in practice, the Court usually indicates in its judgments the standard of proof that it has adopted. Even if there is no expressly stated uniform standard, taking the standard of proof in a large number of judgments as a sample, it is still possible to analyze the issue of the standard of proof to one degree or another. Examining the decisions of ICJ, it can be found that the standard of proof adopted by ICJ basically draws on the system of standard of proof of the domestic courts of the common law system. According to different types of cases, the common law system of the standard of proof, according to the degree of strictness in descending order, can be divided into four types: (1) the criminal field is usually adopted with full certainty of “beyond a reasonable doubt”; (2) “clear and convincing proof”, which is highly probable but does not reach the level of incontrovertibility; (3) “preponderance of evidence”, which is usually adopted in civil proceedings and has a higher degree of reasonableness and probability; (4) prima facie evidence, which is merely required to prove indications of the correctness of an argument.\nThe standards of proof established for different types of cases are also of great significance in the context of cyberwarfare. Cyber-attacks are more covert and asymmetric than traditional attacks, and the degree of damage caused and the difficulty of investigation vary to different degrees, making evaluation more difficult than in traditional cases. Therefore, it is not practical to establish a uniform standard of proof, and a more reasonable approach should be to adopt different standards of proof according to the different degrees of impact brought about by cyberwarfare.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of cases have highlighted the intersection of cybercrime and cyberwarfare: operations with a clear cyberwarfare intent have incorporated tactical maneuvers normally associated with cybercrime. Cybercrime constitutes the criminal exploitation of digital systems to perpetrate unlawful activities through technological means. Nowadays, the virtual nature, technological infrastructure, and limitless scalability of digital networks -- when combined with the misuse of big data analytics -- have paradoxically dissolved traditional national boundaries, transforming transnational criminal operations into borderless threats with globalized impact. If the extent of cyberwarfare has reached the level of a criminal case, it should be strictly required to meet the standard of proof of a criminal case.\nTake the Shocknet virus, for example, which, in the course of cyberwarfare led to the damage of about 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz plant, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of Iranian centrifuges and delaying Iran's uranium enrichment program, in addition to the accidental spread of the Shocknet virus around the globe, which infected more than 100,000 computers. In terms of its impact, its nature has reached the seriousness of a criminal case. As Judge Higgins of the International Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER Court of Justice pointed out in his independent opinion in the Oil Platforms case, the more serious the allegations, the greater the degree of credibility of the evidence required.⁴ Therefore, in a case such as the Shocknet virus, which has already reached the standard of a criminal case, proof of the wrongfulness and attributability of the acts of the United States and Israel in the case will need to reach the level of beyond reasonable doubt.\nAs generative AI becomes widespread, the costs of creating and spreading viral false information, along with cross-border data storage, transfer, and processing expenses, are plummeting so that the frequency of cyber attacks is also on the rise. It is clearly unreasonable to apply the standards of cybercrime to all cyberattacks. A more rational approach would be to lower the burden of proof for cyberattacks that cause less damage and do not constitute a criminal case, similar to some of the standards of proof in civil litigation. But in any case, for the standard of proof of cyberwarfare is inappropriate to adopt the standard of prima facie evidence,\"prima facie evidence\"refers to\"sufficient to establish a fact or to establish a presumption, unless it is effectively rebutted\"evidence. A prima facie case can only mean that there is a possibility that the fact occurred, but it is not very convincing.\nMoreover, the application of that criterion to the determination of state responsibility would undoubtedly lead to a series of problems and increase the cost of dealing with cases because of its weak persuasiveness. For example, if a State was found to have committed a wrongful act merely because there was a possibility that it had done so, not only was there no basis in jurisprudence, but it would also be difficult for the international community to accept an assessment based on simple values. Additionally, the principle that the higher the gravity of the act, the higher the standard of proof is consistently reflected in academic discussions of international law, particularly concerning the International Court of Justice. If a state is found to be liable for the high cost of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, it need only meet such a simple standard of proof, which clearly violates this principle.\n## 3.3 Normative boundaries of the deterrent factors of responsibility The wrongfulness of an act is one of the elements of the law of state responsibility, and the absence of wrongfulness does not entail the responsibility of the state, a situation that can also be referred to as a cause of impediment to state responsibility, with an emphasis on the analysis of two cases: self-defense and countermeasures.\n⁴ Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.S.), I.C.J. Judgment of 6 November 2003, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, para.33.\nDE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare Moreover, the International Court of Justice, in the Nicaragua case, held that all attacks of force belonged to the use of force, but not all uses of force constituted an attack of force, and that only those that were the most serious and had a significant scale and consequences could constitute an “armed attack”. According to the relevant judgment, there is a difference in intensity between the two. The significance of this distinction should also be reflected in cyberattacks. If a cyber-attack by a State only constitutes a use of force under Article 2(4) but does not constitute an armed attack under Article 51, it is certainly a serious internationally wrongful act in breach of an obligation under international law of jus cogens, but the injured State can only take non-forceful “countermeasures” as provided for in the Draft Articles. Once such measures are found to constitute an armed attack, the injured State may invoke Article 51 to legitimately exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defense, including the use of force.\nCountermeasures in international law are non-forcible measures taken by an injured State against a State responsible for committing an internationally wrongful act to induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations, with the intention of restoring reciprocity between the parties. Accordingly, countermeasures do not normally involve the use of force. They are lawful, provided that they meet the conditions set out in Part Three of the Draft Articles.5 Countermeasures are generally used in cases where the use of force does not rise to the level of an armed attack and, by analogy, in the field of cyberwarfare in cases where the level of the attack is not overly aggressive. Cases such as the SolarWinds supply chain attack and the Stuxnet virus attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities have reached the level of an armed attack in terms of both the means used and the damage Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER caused, and the right of self-defense can be triggered, no longer at the level of countermeasures.\nTraditional remedies such as compensation and restitution take some time to realize, and if one is only passively waiting for remedies there is a risk of further expanding losses, so as more timely remedies, both self-defense and countermeasures are necessary to avoid the expansion of losses to the maximum extent possible before traditional remedies can be obtained. Neither the right of self-defense nor the exercise of countermeasures is without limits. Customary law also limits the exercise of the right of self-defense, and the use of force in self-defense remains wrongful if it is accompanied by a violation of international humanitarian law or human rights since special provisions of international humanitarian law (such as the prohibition on retaliatory measures against civilians or prisoners of war) and certain human rights are non-derogable in all circumstances.\nSimilarly, the scope of countermeasures is limited, as draft article 50, Paragraph 1, provides that countermeasures shall not affect: (a) the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; (b) obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; (c) obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; (d) other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. In addition, Article 50, Paragraph 2, makes it clear that a State taking countermeasures is not relieved from fulfilling its obligations: (a) under any dispute settlement procedure applicable between it and the responsible State; (b) to respect the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents, premises, archives, and documents.\n## 3.4 The practical significance of the realization mechanism of state responsibility The state responsibility system is not only a rule implementation tool but also a carrier of the international community's value consensus. On this basis, once the state responsibility is recognized, it is necessary to fulfill the corresponding reality of the obligation. Attribution is not the ultimate goal; using attribution to further solve the problem is the significance of the state responsibility recognition. Under the background of cyber war, the significance of the reality is still worth paying attention to. State responsibility is assumed in various ways; here, we focus on analyzing the two main ways of restitution and compensation.\n ICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep. (1996) 226, para.41.\nFirst of all, we analyze restitution, as the content of the remedy system with the largest scope of remedies, because it can directly eliminate the consequences of wrongdoing, Article 35 of the Draft Articles lists Restitution as a priority remedy. The conditions for the application of restitution included the principles of physical possibility and proportionality, which also required that restitution should not impose a “disproportionate burden” on the responsible State, such as requiring a poor State to bear a large share of the cost of restoration, which was clearly impractical and might be exempted. While the elimination of wrongful consequences is well conceived, and in practice it has been implemented to a certain extent, resulting in more effective State responsibility, restitution also faces contemporary challenges, such as the creation of irreversible damage. While it is naturally clear that nuclear contamination, species extinction, and the like cannot be truly restored in the traditional sense, it is also possible to cause irreversible damage in the context of cyberattacks.\nTake the SolarWinds supply chain attack as an example, the Russian intelligence service hijacked the U.S. SolarWinds software update by implanting malicious code to infiltrate the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and nine other federal agencies and hundreds of enterprises. This case not only resulted in the long-term exposure of intelligence networks and the leakage of sensitive data but also called into question the credibility of global IT supply chain security standards and led to a shift to “zero-trust” architectures and a sharp increase in the cost of international cooperation. While the technical damage can be remedied through compensation, the erosion of democracy is likely to be irreversible, as the cyber-attack has largely eroded public trust in the government's cybersecurity capabilities, which will be difficult to rebuild in a short period, and difficult to fully restore through restitution. Therefore, although restitution can theoretically maximize the compensation for the damage caused, it is obvious that it cannot be fully compensated in practice, and other remedies are needed to supplement it.\nSecondly, as one of the mainstream remedies, Article 31 of the Draft Articles establishes the obligation of the responsible State to provide “full reparation” for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act, which covers both material and moral damages, reflecting the purpose of the elimination of all the consequences of the injury. The principle of the Chorzów Factory case of the Permanent Court of International Justice, of 1928, also provides evidence of this: it establishes that reparation is required to restore the injured State to the “state it would have been in had the wrongful act not been committed”. Further analysis of the types of reparation and the scope of application reveals that reparation can be very broad, ranging from material to moral damages, from direct, quantifiable property damage to indirect, reasonably foreseeable, consequential damages, such as loss of profits due to interruption of trade. Indirect damages, however, often require stricter proof of causation, and the calculation of compensation was controversial at the current stage. In any case, as the mainstream way of assuming state responsibility, the existence of compensation is also of practical significance to the realization of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, which requires less time cost and can more efficiently compensate for the interests of the victimized state than the institutional correction and other methods.\n## Core dilemmas in the determination of state responsibility The determination of state responsibility is of great significance, and can lead to real consequences such as restitution and compensation, but in the context of cyberwar, the core problems of the determination of state responsibility need to be paid attention to, mainly including the normative transformation obstacles of the technical attribution, the paradigm conflict of the application of the right of self-defense, and the systemic failure of the mechanism of responsibility assumption. Failure to analyze these dilemmas and propose solutions will make it difficult to trigger the consequences of state responsibility, which will not be conducive to the resolution of international disputes.\n### Normative transformation barriers to technical attribution The MITRE ATT&CK framework, a widely adopted knowledge base of attack behaviors in the current cybersecurity field, can provide technical references for cyber-attack traceability by standardizing the description of attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures. However, the transformation of its technical references to legal evidence is facing difficulties.\nPrimarily, the paradigm conflict between technical logic and legal logic hinders the transformation of technical indicators into legal evidence to a certain extent. ATT&CK framework is based on the identification of attack behavioral patterns, such as the “credential dump + lateral movement” mode of APT29, attackers often use the system's functions and tools to operate by modifying the system configuration or using legitimate tools and other methods to move laterally, ATT&CK framework for the identification of the attack behavior pattern to derive technical indicators. However, according to Article 8 of the Draft Articles: The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact, acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. It can be seen that a finding of State responsibility under international law requires proof of “effective control” of the attacking act in relation to the will of the State. For example, in the 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack, attackers injected malicious code called “Sunburst” into SolarWinds' flagship Orion software, even though security firms identified SUNBURST's TTPs through ATT&CK, such as T1059.001 command line interface abuse, but these technical characteristics can not directly prove that the Russian intelligence services of the main responsibility, the United States cited the ATT&CK report accusing Russia, but the international community in general to the “lack of direct chain of evidence” to question its legal effectiveness. In this case, even if it is recognized that there is indeed an attack, due to the inability to prove that the behavior is directed or controlled by a country, it is also difficult to use the technical indicators as evidence in the legal sense.\nSubsequently, the existence of intermediate nodes easily leads to a broken chain of evidence. Attackers commonly adopt the anonymizing technical architecture of “springboard server + virtual private network (VPN)”. Taking the 2016 Bangladesh central bank theft case as an example, although the C2 server IP of the SWIFT transaction instructions was traced to the Philippines, further investigation showed that the server was a puppet host controlled by the North Korean Lazarus group. This kind of multi-layer hopping leads to greater difficulty in technical traceability, and the result of traceability may also cause a break in the chain of evidence.\nAnother example is the attack on targets in China by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) through the QUANTUM attack platform, in which a number of modules are involved in concealing the identity of the attack, including QUANTUMBOT Module -- through the hijacking of the botnet command and control of network traffic, manipulating the botnet to launch attack activities and to hide the traces of the U.S. National Security Agency's hacking attacks.; QUANTUMBISCUIT Module -- builds a proxy springboard for quantum injection attacks against an attack target to prevent the attack from being detected retroactively; QUANTUMPHANTOM Module -- provides the technical ability to utilize network link intermediate node hijacking technology to achieve the hiding of the source of the attack, preventing the U.S. National Security Agency's cyberattacks against other countries from being traced back. The use of multiple anonymization techniques undoubtedly creates a great obstacle to traceability work. Even if the source of the attack can be located accurately in the end, the identity of the operating subject behind the attack still needs to be further identified, and the attacker can be disguised as other countries/organizations or fake IP addresses, etc. to confuse the traceability. The existence of intermediate nodes also makes it difficult to form a chain of evidence. The objective existence of obvious cyber attacks due to problems in the chain of evidence may not be able to carry out a trial in the end and even more accurately determine the responsibility of the state and solve the problem.\nIn addition, the “falsifiability” of technical indicators also weakens their probative value in practice. An important manifestation of this is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). It is widely recognized as the most sophisticated and powerful category of security threats. APTs are engineered by resourced, disciplined threat actors capable of sustained operations through systematic technology exploitation, blending expertise, funding, and structured coordination to maintain persistence. APT organizations often falsify attack signatures through False Flag operations. The identification of false flags is inherently complex, primarily because attackers systematically conceal their actions while simultaneously framing innocent entities for malicious conduct. Conducting a false flag operation in the cyber realm is fundamentally distinct and far simpler compared to its execution in the physical domain. For example, in the 2017 NotPetya ransomware incident, ATT&CK-based T1486 disk encryption analysis initially pointed to North Korea, but subsequent code homology analysis revealed a link to the Russian Sandworm organization. This type of technological misdirection makes the judicial application of the ATT&CK framework a “reasonable suspicion” challenge. As counterfeiting technologies evolve, the ATT&CK framework should also evolve with the times and develop more accurate techniques for identifying forgeries, or else the credibility of the technical indicators it produces may be further diminished in the face of the difficulty of transferring technical indicators to legal evidence.\n### Paradigm conflicts in the application of the right of self-defense Even in the face of cyberattacks, the exercise of the right of self-defense and countermeasures is not unlimited and still needs to comply with certain requirements, so it is still necessary to make a clearer discussion on the boundaries of the legality of the use of the right of self-defense and countermeasures in cyberwarfare.\nAs mentioned in the previous article, as to the question of whether cyber warfare constitutes the use of force under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, the “scale and consequence theory” proposed by Prof. Michael Schmit has the highest degree of acceptance at present. As long as the analysis is conducted according to the multiple indicators of scale and consequence, and the cyber-attack is considered to be a case of the use of force, then countermeasures or even the exercise of the right to self-defense can be taken. The most controversial issue at present is that the right to determine the use of force is in the hands of more developed countries, and the seemingly objective judgment criteria are to some extent mixed with subjective factors.\nAs is widely known, the Tallinn Manual edited by Prof. Michael Schmit, as a more authoritative and important reference document for the study of cyber warfare, has seven of the eight assessment criteria for determining whether the use of force constitutes a use of force, which are completely consistent with the criteria advocated by Prof. Michael Schmit himself. The criteria are somewhat arbitrary and subjective. For example, Professor Schmit himself, when applying these factors to analyze the 2007 cyberattack against Estonia, concluded that the attack constituted a use of force. Other scholars, however, have argued that the opposite conclusion that the cyberattack did not constitute a use of force can easily be reached by relying on these same factors, which can be easily manipulated in their application to reach conclusions that benefit the geostrategic objectives of the country being analyzed.\nMoreover, when applied to cyberattacks, the “scale and consequence” standard has a fatal logical flaw: a given consequence of the same scale and severity can be produced by the use of force as well as by non-forceful means. The loss of life and the destruction of forests and land in a downstream country as a result of the discharge of toxic substances into a river by an upstream country or the starvation and economic turmoil of a country as a result of economic sanctions imposed by one country on another, are in themselves highly analogous to those that would normally result from the use of force. However, in general perception, these acts hardly constitute a use of force in international law or even an internationally wrongful act. In this way, such acts can escape legal sanction even if they have consequences comparable to those of the use of force. Cyberattacks, however, may be recognized as a use of force and subject to liability if they have the same legal consequences. This logical loophole exists partly because of the arbitrariness and subjectivity of the judgment standard. Western scholars with stronger discursive power often lower the threshold for the use of the right to self-defense through an expansive interpretation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, and in this regard, seemingly reasonable standards can often be interpreted to achieve political goals.\nIn addition to lowering the threshold of the right to self-defense through acts of interpretation, the United States has also put forward the “Defend Forward” strategy, which is an offensive defense strategy it has put forward in recent years in the field of cyberspace security, aiming to respond to cyber threats using proactive strikes and pre-emptive strikes. The United States Cyber Command has emphasized the need to adopt a “forward posture” in cyberspace by accessing non-Department of Defense networks or systems to weaken an adversary's cyber capabilities in advance and prevent it from taking action. Such an assertion should be relegated to the academic category of preventive self-defense, which is advocated by a few Western countries and Western scholars, but is not and should not be supported in existing international treaties and customary international law -- it means “granting the major powers an almost unrestricted license to use force”. In summary, the definition of cyberwarfare and the various criteria for judging it, as well as the proposal of strategies such as “forward defense,” are undoubtedly suspected of serving political goals. Professor O'Connell also believes that “cyberwarfare” is a “wrong war”. It is essentially an “invented” problem in the context of the increasing militarization of cybersecurity policies of major Western countries.\n### Systemic failure of responsibility mechanisms The decentralized nature of cyberspace forms a structural contradiction with the “state-centered” responsibility framework of traditional international law, resulting in an imbalance in the distribution of responsibility between states and non-state actors, rigid rules of evidence, and a lack of enforcement mechanisms.\nFirst, the traditional logic of attribution has loopholes that need to be filled in the context of cyberspace, and the traditional theoretical criterion of “effective control” has limitations. This criterion originated from the 1986 case of Nicaragua v. United States, in which the ICJ made it clear that to attribute the conduct of non-state actors to a state (the United States), it is necessary to prove that the state exercised “effective control” over the specific military operation. Not only does the state provide general support such as funding, weapons, or training, but it also needs to have actual command over the specific unlawful action, i.e. the state needs to directly direct or specifically instruct the attack. However, the “outsourcing of tools” in cyberattacks has led to a high degree of invisibility of the state-attacker nexus. For example, in the case of the Iranian APT34 attack on Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in 2021, although the technical traceability showed that the attack tools were linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, it was not possible to prove that their actions were “specifically directed” by the state. In the context of cyberwarfare, “effective control” has the risk of being too rigid, leading to the impossibility of attribution, and the choice of whether to include other judgment criteria in such cases has been widely discussed, among which the theory of “overall control” is of particular research value.\nThe theory of “Overall Control” originated from the judgment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the case of Prosecutor v. Tadić. The Tribunal held that the conduct of a state can be attributed DE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare In the context of cyberwarfare, the anonymity of cyberattacks, technology dependence, and the ambiguity of actors make the traditional standard of attribution challenging, and the “overall control” theory has potential advantages in some respects. The criterion is superior in terms of identification in response to the prevalence of indirect support models. States often support cyberattacks through technological enablement, infrastructure harboring, or strategic guidance. Such behavior is more consistent with the “strategic dominance” characteristic of “overall control” than with the “specific instruction” requirement of “effective control”. For example, Russia’s relationship with APT28 is alleged to be in line with “overall control” in that the Russians provide technical resources but do not directly direct specific attacks, and the international community generally believes that the organization is supported by the Russian government and that the motivation for its attacks is closely related to Russia’s national interests.\nAccording to “overall control”, it is possible to hold Russia responsible, but according to the traditional “effective control” standard, it is difficult to hold it accountable. In addition, while the technical traceability of cyberattacks often only proves a continuing connection between the attacker and the state, and it is difficult to obtain evidence of direct orders, the “overall control” standard eliminates the need to prove a control relationship between the state and the attacker, and allows for a more efficient allocation of responsibility. Although the “overall control” standard has its role in the context of cyberwarfare, it is still difficult to accept it as the standard for attribution of responsibility in the current mainstream view, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia Serbia and Montenegro, the ICJ explicitly rejected the standard of “overall control” and insisted on the strict interpretation of “effective control”,[9] which can provide a reference basis for the attribution of responsibility for cyber warfare. Moreover, there is a risk of political abuse if a more lenient standard is adopted, as when the U.S. sanctioned a Chinese technology company based on “overall control” in the absence of publicly available technical evidence to support it. While this standard is not appropriate in all cases, it is clear that the traditional standard is not fully applicable, and the international community [9] Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, General List No. 91.\nshould continue to explore new, more reasonable standards in practice to address the limitations of the traditional standard.\nSecondly, the traditional attribution criterion is also difficult in practice. The system of attribution of responsibility for non-state actors is not perfect, which leads to the failure of the mechanism for assuming responsibility to play a full role, potentially allowing non-state actors to avoid legal penalties, especially transnational science and technology enterprises to circumvent the responsibility of the behavior at this stage has not been effectively resolved. For example, Zero-Day Vulnerability, as a security flaw that has not yet been discovered or fixed by software vendors, has a unique “gray area” in the trading market due to the ambiguity of its participants, uses, and legal attributes. There are cases where private vulnerability brokers sell zero-day vulnerabilities to governments, but international law does not clarify whether such transactions constitute “assisting in the commission of cyber-attacks”. In terms of the actual situation at this stage, international legislation is undoubtedly lagging behind, and existing cybercrime conventions have not yet explicitly stipulated specific provisions directly targeting “vulnerability trading”.\nIn addition, the EU's “Network Resilience Act” only requires vendors to establish a vulnerability handling process, does not regulate third-party transactions. In China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Internet Information Office, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly issued the “Provisions on the Management of Security Vulnerabilities in Network Products”, which clearly states that no organization or individual shall illegally collect, sell or distribute information on security vulnerabilities in network products, but the standard of “illegality” lacks specific interpretation, and loopholes exist in the determination of “illegality”. The U.S. “Vulnerability Equity Program” is not binding, vendors can refuse to cooperate. It can be seen that the existing law for the actors did not make comprehensive provisions, so the use of zero-day vulnerabilities in cyber attacks on multinational technology enterprises has the possibility of circumventing legal responsibility, liability mechanism due to the lack of comprehensiveness, but also may be further dysfunctional.\n## Reconstructing the path of state responsibility in cyber warfare Under the increasingly complex background of cyber warfare, it is of great practical significance to find a more reasonable path of state responsibility. On the one hand, further improvement of the traditional attribution mechanism can enhance the persuasive power of the attribution; on the other hand, through the innovation of judicial procedures, the realization of state responsibility can be further refined to avoid the emergence of unreasonable responsibility which is too light or too heavy. State responsibility in cyberwarfare has room for improvement in both judgment standard and realization, and if it can be adjusted under the common recognition of the international community, it can to a certain extent avoid subjective factors affecting the judgment and assumption of state responsibility.\n### Improving the attribution mechanism One of the important reasons why the attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyber warfare has a certain subjective element is that there is no universally recognized technical attribution mechanism, which to a certain extent has led to the divergence of attribution standards among countries for cyber warfare. Although there is more authoritative literature such as the Tallinn Manual for reference, the nature of international law is, after all, soft law. While States can use soft law to solve the problem of coordinated gaming, international law is not as binding as it could be if a State's political aspirations need to be realized urgently. In addition, if some countries do not sign an international treaty on cybersecurity, and the content of the treaty has not developed into a custom, a considerable number of countries can claim that they do not carry out activities in the cyber field in accordance with the rules in the treaty. Moreover, even for those countries that have signed such treaties, the cost of withdrawing from them is not high. Finally, although relevant documents are constantly being issued, how to deal with conflicts between them is a subjective process. From this point of view, the mere formulation of international law on cybersecurity is relatively limited in enhancing the rationality of attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nIn this context, promoting the international community to establish a technical attribution institution can be a better choice. First of all, compared with soft law, the institution established under the wide recognition of the international community is more persuasive and can avoid to a greater extent the situation that countries choose the judgment standard of state responsibility based on their own political opinions. Secondly, the establishment of a technical attribution body can help promote policy coordination and resource sharing among countries in the field of cybersecurity. Through multilateral cooperation, countries can fully express their demands, formulate unified international legal standards to deal with transnational cyber threats under the principle of pursuing the greatest common interests, conduct in-depth discussions on reasonable motions to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the attribution standards and reduce the troubles caused by the differences in the laws of different countries.\nFurthermore, technical attribution organizations can establish an information-sharing platform to share the latest information on cyberattacks and technological advances promptly, and such an information-sharing mechanism can improve the ability of countries to respond to cyber threats. For example, the Enhanced Attribution (EA) program initiated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is very informative. The goal of the EA program is to develop techniques to generate operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent and independent malicious cyber campaigns and to create a methodology by which this information can be shared with multiple parties without jeopardizing the intelligence sources and methodologies. By collecting, monitoring, and understanding adversary cyberattack operations in the red space, the program is expected to be divided into three technical areas (TAs) that will work in parallel with each other. They will span three 18-month phases, after which the agency will step in to obtain high-quality results. This activity will undoubtedly empower the attribution criteria with more precise technology, which is expected to target the subjects of wrongdoing with greater precision. Such meaningful criteria, if adopted by technical attribution agencies, would certainly contribute to the standardization of technical attribution.\nBased on the establishment of technical attribution institutions and the development of technical attribution criteria, the criterion of “effective control” in the traditional attribution criteria needs to be expanded. The obstacle to the normative transformation of technical attribution mentioned earlier is largely due to the rigid application of the criterion of “effective control”. In light of the complexity of cyberwarfare models, the concept of “material support” should be introduced, so that if a State systematically provides vulnerabilities, infrastructure, or funding to non-State actors that cause the same level of consequences as a direct direct order, it will be held liable even if there is no direct order. Although this approach has not become a common practice in the international community, the continued rigid application of the traditional criterion of proving a directive relationship will undoubtedly allow certain subjects to avoid the risk of assuming State responsibility, which is difficult to accept in terms of jurisprudence. Therefore, based on the principle of the “effective control” criterion, consideration should be given to the use of “substantial support” to make judgments when the act of support has a significant impact and is directly related to the acts or purposes of the supported party, thus constituting substantial support. The adoption of such a criterion is not only legally sound but also creates conditions for the application of technical attribution to a greater extent. The adoption of the “substantial support” criterion for attribution when the support provided by a State can be traced back to that State by technical means and it can be established that the State providing the assistance constitutes substantial support can avoid the rigid application of the traditional criterion, which would jeopardize the results obtained through technical tracing.\n### Adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism The establishment of an international attribution agency is certainly of great significance to the determination of state responsibility, but it only involves the work of attribution, and if we want to comprehensively reconstruct the responsibility of the state in cyberwarfare, it must be built on the basis of a broad consensus among all countries, and the blueprint for the establishment of an international attribution agency as mentioned in the previous section is also built on the basis of the consensus of all countries. Therefore, the consensus of all countries is a fundamental condition. It is obviously unrealistic for the international community to reach consensus in the short term, because the more vulnerable countries may consider that the adjustment of rules has nothing to do with them. In this case, the big countries are more important to play a pioneering role and set an example through concrete actions. The adjustment of the multilateral cooperation mechanism is conducive to the rationalization of the judgment of national responsibility in cyber warfare, and is also conducive to the regulation of the cyber offensive behavior of individual countries, so that all countries in the international community can benefit from it. The specific cooperation mechanism can be adjusted as follows: Foremost, regional confidence-building measures should be further developed. The most important is the establishment of a cyberspace “hotline mechanism”, which can reduce the information gap through effective communication and avoid the emergence of unnecessary cyberattacks. As early as during the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, this “hotline mechanism” demonstrated its important value. During the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, both sides in the nuclear arms race and military confrontation realized that the lack of direct communication channels could lead to miscalculation and escalation of the conflict. In 1963, the U.S. and the Soviet Union established the “hotline mechanism”, which allowed leaders to communicate quickly, directly, and privately in emergency situations, thereby eliminating the risk of nuclear war resulting from communication delays or misunderstandings of each other's actions. To this day, this mechanism is used as an important tool. In 2022, during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the U.S. and Russia established a military hotline to avoid miscalculations and military accidents. The “hotline mechanism” has gone a long way in avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings and remains indispensable in the context of cyberwarfare. 2020s attack on India's power grid could be a case in point. on October 12, 2020, Mumbai, India, experienced a massive blackout that affected critical infrastructure, including stock exchanges and healthcare facilities. The New York Times reported that the blackout may have been linked to China, claiming that “Chinese malware hacked into India's power supply control system” in order to pressure India in the India-China border standoff. Although this claim was later clarified by Recorded Future, a cybersecurity company mentioned in the report, and officially denied by Indian officials, it still caused a certain degree of damage to China's image, and if the “hotline mechanism” had been adopted at that time, it could have avoided the misleading public opinion and the waste of investigation resources. This shows that China, the United States, Russia and other countries have taken the lead in setting up real-time communication channels, clarifying in a timely manner in the event of miscalculation, and reducing unnecessary costs and expenditures, which is still necessary in the context of cyber warfare.\nConcomitantly, adjusting the public-private partnership. In the context of cyberwarfare, cooperation between countries is certainly important, but operators often also have a large amount of relevant information. To further reduce the cost of controlling the occurrence of cyberwarfare, it is indispensable for operators and governments to jointly build a threat intelligence-sharing platform. Adopting this model not only facilitates research between countries based on a large number of cases provided by operators to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the cases, but also reduces the effort of searching for cyberattacks from all over the world, saves time and cost, and efficiently builds identification and defense measures. This model has been reflected in the JCDC model in the U.S. JCDC participants that include organizations and operators from both the public and private sectors, covering service providers, infrastructure operators, cybersecurity companies, and companies in the critical infrastructure industry.\nIn addition, JCDC constituents include specific government agencies designated by Congress, such as the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It is through the operator-government co-built threat intelligence-sharing platform that the JCDC shares real-time information through multiple platforms, such as Slack, the Homeland Security Information Network HSIN, and the GovDelivery service, to ensure that there is continuous dialog and collaboration among the participants. This also sets the stage for the development of proactive cyber defense programs to mitigate the most serious risks before threats become visible. Moreover, “gatekeeper liability” for technology companies can be introduced, as Article 6 of The EU's Digital Services Act indicates that “where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, the service provider shall not be liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that the provider”. By analyzing the exemption from liability of the hosting service provider of the online platform and the relevant conditions, it can be seen that the online platform should have a certain degree of responsibility for reviewing the information provided by the service recipient. For content that is clearly of a cyber-attack nature, the provider of the online service should exercise a certain degree of scrutiny, in particular, cloud computing giants are required to filter malicious traffic, or else they may be considered to bear the corresponding joint and several liability.\nFinally, a “digital ceasefire zone” system could be included in the scope of discussion. Healthcare, energy and other livelihood areas are of great importance, and if they are subjected to cyberattacks, they will often lead to more serious consequences, and should be categorized as no-attack zones, so that if certain countries carry out non-compliant cyberattacks, violators will be automatically triggered by the United Nations to sanction them. According to the context that cyber-peacekeeping has been suggested as a strategic framework to address the multifaceted challenges posed by diverse manifestations of cyber conflict, in order to support the implementation of the system, we can also consider the establishment of a “network peacekeeping force”, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to send technical teams to assist in the restoration of network services in conflict areas. The reason why it should be coordinated by the ITU is that, under its supervision, the technical teams will be able to use more reasonable means to respond to cyber attacks. Shortly after the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, controversy erupted over the way Ukraine set up the International Volunteer Team for Cyber Defense to carry out cyberattacks against Russian targets, and its development of tools, which allows any digital device to become part of a DDoS attack network, was deemed to be a violation of international cyber norms. The existence of a unified body for coordination would make it possible to bring the corresponding tools into line with the principle of proportionality.\n### Innovations in judicial procedures In addition to further clarifying the criteria for attribution of state responsibility and minimizing the frequency of cyberwar through multilateral cooperation mechanisms, there is also a need for innovation in the judicial process, because most cyberwars are ultimately handled through the judicial process, and therefore adopting a more feasible judicial process is conducive to a more reasonable distribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nFirstly, the International Court of Justice could create a panel of judges specialized in cyberspace cases, allowing for the submission of electronic evidence and anonymous witnesses. There is a precedent for such a special chamber, namely the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which is a special judicial procedure set up within the ITLOS to hear disputes between States arising from the exploration and exploitation of the international seabed area. In response to the increasingly complex cyberwarfare, which should be handled more rigorously, and the identification and allocation of State responsibility should be more reasonable, the traditional team of judges may not be able to make accurate judgments when faced with the special field of cyber. The idea that selecting judges with relevant backgrounds enhances efficiency is supported by academic research, which suggests that a judge's prior experience and characteristics can influence their decision-making. At this time, the selection of judges with cyber background to form a team specializing in cyberspace cases is conducive to more efficiently identifying the nature of cyberattacks and, with the help of increasingly developed technological means, more reasonably allocating state responsibility on the basis of technical indicators.\nMeanwhile, through the leading role of the International Court of Justice, countries can also select judges with expertise in international law, cyber technology, data protection, and other fields through a special selection mechanism to form domestic teams specialized in handling cyber cases. From this, we can see that such a move can not only further solve the problem of cyber warfare among countries but also serve as an inspiration for the handling of cyber cases within countries. The team of judges can cooperate with other international organizations (such as Interpol and the United Nations Office on Cybercrime) to analyze the ever-emerging new forms and the constantly updating and iterative advanced technologies in order to formulate more reasonable judgment standards and solution measures, so as to jointly address the global challenges in cyberspace.\nIn addition, consideration could be given to legitimizing “preventive countermeasures” by allowing for pre-emptive defences against highly probable cyberattacks under the authority of the Security Council. Referring to Article 50 of the UN Charter on temporary measures against economic sanctions, UN Member States, in their actions for the maintenance of international peace and security, should refrain from any action that might widen a dispute or aggravate a situation. And the UN Security Council is tasked with resolving international disputes and can establish frameworks for peaceful settlements, aligning with Article 1 of the UN Charter so that Member States should take appropriate steps to prevent the extension or aggravation of the dispute in accordance with the recommendations of the UNSC. It was mentioned earlier that countermeasures must be a means to be taken only if there is a realistic attack. However, in the context of cyberwarfare, it is often too late to take countermeasures if one has to wait until there is an attack. Due to the intensity and scope of cyberattacks, a country's cyber system may not be able to function after an attack, let alone take defensive measures. Under such circumstances, it is particularly important to formulate “preventive countermeasures” with reference to Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations. This kind of prevention cannot be advanced indefinitely and should be judged according to the recommendations of the UN Security Council. However, the international community needs to discuss in depth what kind of preventive measures should be taken in order to arrive at a standard. In any case, even if this kind of advance measure is recognized, it still needs to be regulated by the corresponding standards, or else powerful countries can launch disproportionate “preventive countermeasures” against less dangerous cyberattacks in pursuit of their own national political demands, which is contrary to the original purpose of the measure.\nWhile considering innovations in the judicial process, there is also a need for flexibility in the use of various methods to solve the problems that arise in the process, such as the use of legal discourse. In addressing the dual imperatives of legislative innovation and jurisprudential reconceptualization, legal discourse analysis as a vital interdisciplinary instrument, offers multidimensional frameworks to decode evolving normative constructs within contemporary governance systems. The degree of formality in legal language mirrors the solemn nature of judicial proceedings, whereas the presence or absence of polite expressions can signal deference, confrontational intent, or calculated positioning. These deliberate language patterns fundamentally shape both the courtroom environment and participants' interpretations of interactions, ultimately guiding behavioral responses throughout legal exchanges (Mısır and Akın 2024). In addition, the refinement of legal discourse patterning can be enhanced by studying a large number of cases in the European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union issues its rulings in 23 legally binding linguistic versions, reflecting the mandate established under Article 217 of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. This foundational provision, originally enacted as the European Council's inaugural legislative instrument, constitutionally guarantees that every member state's national language maintains equal juridical standing as an official working language of the Union. Based on the breadth of these cases, summarizing them will undoubtedly be beneficial for a more accurate use of legal language.\nUltimately, in the process of optimization, the participation of artificial intelligence is an irreversible trend, and the various advantages of artificial intelligence can undoubtedly improve efficiency, but the existence of hidden loopholes in various aspects of technology, ethics and other aspects also need to be paid attention to. Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transnational challenge demanding coordinated governance architectures, necessitating the establishment of multilateral regulatory systems capable of ensuring operational synergy, policy harmonization, and adaptive scalability across jurisdictions. And transitioning to centralized regulatory frameworks proves indispensable for steering generative AI development along ethically aligned trajectories. To effectively address existential risks in artificial intelligence development, institutionalizing ethical guardrails through a “Digital Humanism” framework becomes imperative. This paradigm prioritizes human-centric imperatives by safeguarding species-wide wellbeing and systemic security, while strategically decoupling technological advancement from zero-sum competition. Such an approach ensures that technological evolution maintains symbiotic alignment with civilizational priorities. Today sanctions and anti-sanctions have evolved into a dominant strategic pattern within contemporary geopolitical interactions, which makes it all the more important that more rational judicial procedures be used to mitigate the growing conflict.\n## Conclusions The accelerated militarization of cyberspace has plunged the state responsibility system into a “triple normative dilemma”: first, the transformation of technical evidence into legal facts has led to the failure of the attribution mechanism; second, the hermeneutical controversy over the boundaries of the right to self-defense has triggered a crisis of the legitimacy of the countermeasures; and third, the vacuum in the allocation of responsibility due to the involvement of non-State actors has resulted in the systematic failure of the enforcement mechanism. These structural impediments not only undermine the deterrent effect of international law, but also contribute to the “low-cost-high-benefit” nature of cyberwarfare, which continues to induce opportunistic tactics by state actors.\nWhile existing governance frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0's “principle of equivalence of effects” and the Convention on Cybercrime's territoriality provision provide guidance on rules at the local level, they are not able to cope with complex cyberconflicts due to institutional fragmentation and technological adaptability deficiencies. For example, the Tallinn Manual's 2.0 Rule 69's eight-dimensional assessment model of the threshold for the use of force faces an attenuation of its explanatory power when dealing with generative AI-driven cognitive warfare; and the Budapest Convention's Mutual Legal Assistance Mechanism is in an implementation dilemma due to the anonymity of cryptocurrencies.\nTo solve the above dilemmas, it is urgent to build a three-in-one path of “technical verification, rule iteration, and mechanism synergy” to reconfigure the responsibility: (1) technical empowerment of attribution mechanism: building a verifiable attribution system, and realizing the transformation of MITRE ATT&CK framework into a judicial system; (2) adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism, building regional confidence measures, strengthening public-private partnership, and strengthening the DE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare This reconstruction path has dual normative value: at the level of substantive law, through the legalization of preventive responsibility and due diligence, the “risk spillover” behavior of the state in cyberspace is curbed; at the level of procedural law, with the help of technology-neutral third-party evidence collection mechanism, the cognitive gap between technological logic and judicial review can be bridged. Only by realizing the in-depth mutual embedding of technical governance and international law can the “tragedy of the commons” effect of cyberwar be suppressed, and the paradigm shift of the community of destiny in cyberspace from conceptual advocacy to institutional practice be promoted.\n**Research funding:** This work was supported by the project of National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 24BYY151) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhejiang University.",

The concept of cyberwarfare first appeared in a research report by the RAND Corporation in 1993, which defined cyberwarfare as a military operation being implemented or prepared to be implemented according to information-related principles (John and Ronfeldt 1993). In the strategic dimension, the concept of cyberwarfare was accompanied by the completion of the ontological construction of the theory of the “Fifth Dimension”, which was recognized by Huang (2015), who argued that “the rapid development of the global Internet has been driven by the rapid advancement of information technology, and cyberspace has begun to take shape as the ‘fifth space' beyond the land, sea, airspace and outer space”. At the same time, a variety of problems and threats such as cyber-attacks and cybercrime have also arisen, and the concept of “cyber warfare” is put forward in this context. On the one hand, along with the development of science and technology, the scale of cyber warfare has reached an unprecedented level, such as the cyber attack and defense in the Russo-Georgian war, the Iranian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the Shocknet virus, the Syrian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the airstrikes, and other cases, all of which are the embodiment of the escalation of the intensity of modern cyber warfare.

On the one hand, further improvement of the traditional attribution mechanism can enhance the persuasive power of the attribution; on the other hand, through the innovation of judicial procedures, the realization of state responsibility can be further refined to avoid the emergence of unreasonable responsibility which is too light or too heavy. State responsibility in cyberwarfare has room for improvement in both judgment standard and realization, and if it can be adjusted under the common recognition of the international community, it can to a certain extent avoid subjective factors affecting the judgment and assumption of state responsibility."

These structural impediments not only undermine the deterrent effect of international law, but also contribute to the “low-cost-high-benefit” nature of cyberwarfare, which continues to induce opportunistic tactics by state actors."

Due to the ambiguity of the object of regulation, the defect of attribution mechanism, and the lack of clarity of the constituent elements of responsibility, the existing international law framework has caused the state responsibility system in cyberspace to fall into the dilemma of normative failure. This paper takes the theory of international law subjectivity as the logical starting point and systematically deconstructs the normative attributes of cyberwar and the path of responsibility determination. This paper shows that the constitutive elements of state responsibility need to break through the rigid standard of traditional\"behavior-damage\"causality and build a dynamic attribution system combining technical verification and legal presumption. Through critical analysis of the use of force threshold doctrine, this paper, based on a comprehensive analysis of the core dilemma of the determination of state responsibility, proposes to appropriately introduce the concept of\"substantial support\", and when the traditional theory of comprehensive control fails to make effective attribution, the criterion of\"substantial support\"can be used to complete the attribution of state responsibility with the increasingly developed technological traceability means.\nKeywords: cyberwarfare; international law; state responsibility; attributability *Corresponding author: Haonan Li, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: lihaonan22402065@zju.edu.cn. https://orcid.org/0009-0005-0476-300X Le Cheng, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: chengle163@hotmail.com. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4423-8585 The militarized transformation of cyberspace has upended the cognitive architecture of the use of force under the Westphalian system. Traditional military theory faces challenges when applied to cyber conflict (Kallberg 2016). The evolution of cyberwarfare from a technological tool to a means of strategic deterrence has led to a blurring of the legal boundaries between peacetime and armed conflict. And the increasing effectiveness of cyberattacks further complicates the legal context of cyberwarfare (Gray 2024). The traditional state responsibility regime needs to be reconfigured due to a triple adaptive dilemma: first, technological anonymity triggers a break in the chain of attribution, which puts the “effective control” criterion in Article 8 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility in a difficult position to prove; second, the non-kinetic nature of cyber operations makes it difficult to quantify the threshold for the use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations; and third, the legitimacy boundary of countermeasures creates normative conflicts under the “forward defense” strategy.\nThis paper adopts a techno-legal cross-analysis approach to focus on the normative reconstruction path of state responsibility in cyber warfare. By deconstructing the dilemma of determining state responsibility at the current stage and proposing corresponding reconstruction paths, this paper attempts to discuss how the determination standard of the attribute of force in cyberwarfare can be coordinated with the “principle of equivalence of effect” of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the mode of assuming the indirect responsibility of the state in the context of the intervention of non-state actors. It is hoped that through the reconstruction of various paths, the issue of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare can be clarified as much as possible, and the diffuse damage caused by cyberwarfare can be curbed. This paper aims to provide theoretical support for the clear identification of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare and to promote the formation of a technologically empowered international law governance paradigm.",
    "## Deconstructing the normative attributes of cyberwarfare ### The evolution of the conceptual genealogy of cyberwarfare The generation of the normative concept of cyberwarfare has gone through the process of discourse migration from military science to jurisprudence. The concept of cyberwarfare first appeared in a research report by the RAND Corporation in 1993, which defined cyberwarfare as a military operation being implemented or prepared to be implemented according to information-related principles (John and Ronfeldt 1993). In the strategic dimension, the concept of cyberwarfare was accompanied by the completion of the ontological construction of the theory of the “Fifth Dimension”, which was recognized by Huang (2015), who argued that “the rapid development of the global Internet has been driven by the rapid advancement of information technology, and cyberspace has begun to take shape as the ‘fifth space' beyond the land, sea, airspace and outer space”.

On the one hand, along with the development of science and technology, the scale of cyber warfare has reached an unprecedented level, such as the cyber attack and defense in the Russo-Georgian war, the Iranian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the Shocknet virus, the Syrian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the airstrikes, and other cases, all of which are the embodiment of the escalation of the intensity of modern cyber warfare. On the other hand, the relevant theoretical research has been optimized based on the endless cyber warfare.": "Compared with China's late start in cyberwarfare research, western countries have begun research on cyberwarfare earlier, with a larger scale and wider scope, and have also achieved rich results in the formulation of international rules in cyberspace. Since the development of relevant theories, the current mainstream scholars believe that the content of international law on jus ad bellum can be applied to cyber warfare. For example, Reese Nguyen (2013) believes that when a cyber attack is intended to cause irreversible damage or physical loss to the physical information system, it can be recognized as constituting an attack with force. The main argument in favor of this claim is based on Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, which states that “all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. There are different doctrinal understandings of how to argue that cyberwarfare is a use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, as will be presented in the next section.\n### 2.2 Doctrines of thresholds for use of force in cyberwarfare At present, mainstream scholars believe that cyberwarfare constitutes the use of force, but there are different doctrines in understanding, mainly the theory of purpose, instrumental theory, scale, and consequence theory (Huang 2015). Walter Sharp (1999), a representative of the “purpose theory”, argues that computer network attacks are a form of economic and political coercion, and although such coercion is traditionally considered not to be a “use of force”, in the light of the purpose of the Charter of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, and the territorial integrity and political independence of States guaranteed by Article 2(4), computer network attacks should also be subject to Article 2(4) since economic and political coercion would also threaten international peace and jeopardize the territorial integrity and political independence of a State, and would therefore be covered by the scope of the Article.\nMarco Roscini (2010), a representative of the “tools doctrine”, argues that the “military force” that Article 2(4) intends to regulate is mainly embodied in the use of specific weapons (or tools) and that cyber-attacks using “weapons” such as Trojan horses, worms, etc. can also constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) if they produce specific tangible or intangible damage. The most widely accepted theory is the “scale and consequences theory”, in which Professor Michael Schmitt (1999, 2011) argues that although the main purpose of Article 2(4) is to constrain a state's external use of traditional military force to coerce others, in practice what matters is not the means used but the consequences; if a cyber-attack directly causes or is likely to cause damage to persons or objects comparable to that caused by military means, it should undoubtedly constitute a “use of force”; even if it does not cause tangible damage to persons or objects, the victimized State can still determine whether a cyber-attack constitutes a “use of force” by assessing the following seven criteria: (a) severity, (b) immediacy, (c) directness, (d) invasiveness, (e) measurability of effects, (f) presumptive legality and (g) state involvement. Although there are strengths and weaknesses in each viewpoint, as far as the existing situation is analyzed, the scale and consequence theory is recognized by majority of researchers, and the proposition of Prof. Michael Schmit has had a greater impact in the Western academic community, not only in the Tallinn Manual, which is edited by him but also recognized by Western countries. It is worth mentioning that the Tallinn Manual, as a document developed with the participation of multinational subjects, contains seven out of eight assessment criteria for defining whether a cyberattack constitutes a use of force that are identical to those mentioned in the previous article, which indicates that the evaluation criteria advocated by the scale and consequences theory have their own rationality and can be generally accepted by the majority of countries.\nIt should be noted that the research on issues related to cyberwarfare in this paper is based on cases where cyberwarfare can trigger international responsibility, and cyber infringement and cybercrime activities, which are only regulated by the domestic laws of various countries as well as a small number of international treaties, obviously do not fall into the category of use of force as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations 2(4), and they also cannot trigger the responsibility of the State, and therefore do not fall within the scope of this paper's analysis.",
    "## Normative elements and paths to attribution of state responsibility in cyberwarfare ### Normative basis and constitutive elements of the state responsibility regime The institutional framework of state responsibility in international law is rooted in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Articles). According to Chapter I and Chapter II of the Draft Articles, the establishment of state responsibility requires the fulfillment of two normative elements: wrongfulness and attributability. In the following, the two elements will be analyzed separately.": "Initially, the analysis of wrongfulness. In Article 2 of the Draft Articles, the International Law Commission defines that “there is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law, and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.” In the context of cyberwarfare, it is clear that most cases of wrongful acts are in the form of action, as exemplified by the Russo-Georgian war: the Georgian government website was attacked, the government web server was on the verge of collapsing due to the large number of access requests it received for more than 10 h, the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was completely dysfunctional, and the website of the presidential administration was paralyzed for 24 h. As the fighting deepened, the intensity and sophistication of the cyber-attacks increased, with Russia targeting Georgia's government and news media websites as the primary targets, disabling virtually all of Georgia's government offices. Second, it is worth noting that the article does not mention that subjective fault or intent to engage in a wrongful act is required to establish state responsibility; the mere existence of a violation of the law is sufficient to give rise to international responsibility, and, by extension, state responsibility should be an objective rather than a subjective responsibility. The normative logic of this objective responsibility paradigm, which rejects the subjective fault element, is that the unlawfulness of an internationally wrongful act arises from an objective breach of an international obligation rather than from the state of mind of the acting state (Crawford 2013).\nIn addition, the article requires that the wrongful act constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state, and for a further understanding of the Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER obligation, one can refer to the definitions in Articles 12 and 13 of the Draft Articles. Article 12 provides that there is a breach of an international obligation by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. Article 13 provides that an act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs. In other words, the key feature of a breach of an international obligation is that the obligation should have been complied with, but in fact, the State in question did not take reasonable action to comply with the obligation.\nArticle 12 makes it clear that, regardless of the origin or character of the obligation, when analyzed in terms of the sources of international law, the source of the obligation is varied, and may be a customary one, or one based on a treaty, or even a legal principle generally recognized by the international community. In the Rainbow Warrior case, for example, the arbitral tribunal stated that there is no distinction in international law between contractual and tortious liability, so any breach by a State of a duty, regardless of the source of the duty, gives rise to the responsibility of the State and therefore to an obligation to make reparation.¹ This case is very strong evidence of the broadness of the source of the obligation.\nThe broadness of the source of the obligation is conducive to the regulation of cyberwarfare. First, for States parties to cyberwarfare-related treaties, such as the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, a violation of the content of the treaty can constitute a direct breach of the obligation. Second, for countries not participating in the treaty, if the relevant practice of maintaining network security has been generally recognized in the international community and can become a kind of habit, the habit can also be used as a source of obligation, and if it does not comply with the habit, it is also possible to find that a country violates the obligation, which undoubtedly enlarges the scope of the main body needing to comply with the obligation, and allows more countries to consciously comply with the obligation. What's more, the identification and formation of general principles are essential for maintaining international law as a coherent legal system (Shao 2021). Therefore, sometimes principles can also govern the behavior of States. It should be noted, however, that even if a State commits certain acts of cyberattack against another State and causes damage, if it does not constitute a breach of an international obligation, it will not give rise to the legal responsibility of the author State.\n¹ Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (New Zealand v. France) (“Rainbow Warrior”), Award of 30 April 1990, 20 UNRIAA 215, para.75.\nCorrespondingly, attributability is then analyzed. Theoretically, all acts of individuals, corporations, or other entities in the sense of domestic law may be attributed to a State (Government) based on nationality. In dealing with this issue, the Draft Articles adopt a narrow approach, namely, the “overall control test”, whereby the only conduct that can be attributed to a State is that of State organs or other entities acting under the direction, control, or instigation of a State organ, which becomes an agent of the State at the time of the conduct (Kanehara 2019). As far as the attributability of the state in cyber warfare is concerned, if a cyber attack is initiated or directed by the state as the main body, the corresponding responsibility is borne by the state. In simple cases, the attributability of state responsibility can be quickly recognized. However, since the development of cyberwarfare, identifying the source of cyber-attacks is crucial to ensuring cybersecurity (Swate et al. 2024), its technical means have become increasingly flexible, and many attribution problems are caused by anonymous attacks, and the attackers can often easily hide their identities, which has brought great challenges to the tracking of the source of the attack. Even if the source of the attack is identified, the subject needs to be further clarified. The subject of a cyberattack can avoid being targeted by hiding or forging his identity in many ways, so pinpointing the subject is also a major challenge.\nIn addition, when a country helps another country to engage in internationally wrongful acts, the former also to the extent of the support, helps to bear state responsibility, but the main state responsibility still belongs to the wrongdoing state (Aust 2011). But regardless of the size of state responsibility, by analogy, in the context of cyberwarfare, if a country provides technical means or financial support and other help to other countries, in principle, it should also bear the corresponding responsibility, and if that State has both wrongful acts and breaches of its obligations, it may also satisfy the constituent elements of State responsibility, and thus bear State responsibility in cyberwarfare to the extent of the damage caused by that State.\n### Hierarchical construction of standards of proof As a component of the constituent elements, whether it is the judgment of wrongfulness or the judgment of attributability, there is the problem of proof. In fact, for the legal field of the problem, the standard of proof has been extremely important, from the traditional theory of evidence, the standard of proof is the judge to consider and weigh the authenticity of the facts of the case to achieve the degree of proof, but also the burden of proof to provide the appropriate evidence to prove the facts of the case to achieve a certain standard (He and Wang 2017). The degree of standard of proof is directly related to the judge for the degree of conviction of the evidence, which naturally will affect the results of the judgment. Criminal law, civil law, and Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER other substantive areas of law, after a long period of development, in their litigation process also have their standard of proof, although different standards for the results of the judgment have a decisive impact, the litigant naturally needs to try to meet the standard of proof. On the other hand, for the facts that have occurred, no one has the ability to $100\\%$ reproduce the scene, they can only try to prove to maximize the proximity of the objective facts, thus providing judges with a good judgment environment so that judges as far as possible can make a reasonable judgment, and the standard of proof from this sense of understanding is also the embodiment of substantive justice.\nOutside the traditional field of substantive law, the standard of proof is also of great significance to the issue of international law. In international law, the composition of state responsibility needs to satisfy both illegal behavior and attributable elements, but the proof of the two elements is also a separate issue, whether the two standards of proof are consistent, and if not, what kind of standards should be used is an urgent discussion. As early as before the emergence of the problem of evidence in the field of networks, the International Court of Justice pointed out in the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua that the key to the solution to the problem lies not only in the process of attributing conduct to the law of a particular country but also in the search for substantial evidence before the process of legal attribution. It is thus clear that the question of the standard of proof is not simply an integral part of the question of the attribution of State responsibility, but is more relevant for independent discussion.\nAs far as the current situation is concerned, there is a lack of a uniform and clear standard of proof in international law. In the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice emphasized the principle of the free assessment of evidence, stating that within the limits of the Statute of the Court and the Rules of the Tribunal, the Court is free to assess the value of any evidence.3 While the persistent lack of uniform standards in international law has been detrimental to the development of proof, an analysis of the nature of the cases before the ICJ shows that there is a corresponding rationale for the absence of uniform standards of proof that the complexity and diversity of the cases before the ICJ make it difficult to arrive at a uniform standard that would be universally or primarily applicable to inter-State litigation (Watts 2000).\nIn addition, although the Court's deficiencies in the standard of proof may lead to subjective factors on the part of the judges affecting the decision of the case, in practice, the Court usually indicates in its judgments the standard of proof that it has adopted. Even if there is no expressly stated uniform standard, taking the standard of proof in a large number of judgments as a sample, it is still possible to analyze the issue of the standard of proof to one degree or another. Examining the decisions of ICJ, it can be found that the standard of proof adopted by ICJ basically draws on the system of standard of proof of the domestic courts of the common law system. According to different types of cases, the common law system of the standard of proof, according to the degree of strictness in descending order, can be divided into four types: (1) the criminal field is usually adopted with full certainty of “beyond a reasonable doubt”; (2) “clear and convincing proof”, which is highly probable but does not reach the level of incontrovertibility; (3) “preponderance of evidence”, which is usually adopted in civil proceedings and has a higher degree of reasonableness and probability; (4) prima facie evidence, which is merely required to prove indications of the correctness of an argument (Green 2009).\nThe standards of proof established for different types of cases are also of great significance in the context of cyberwarfare. Cyber-attacks are more covert and asymmetric than traditional attacks, and the degree of damage caused and the difficulty of investigation vary to different degrees, making evaluation more difficult than in traditional cases. Therefore, it is not practical to establish a uniform standard of proof, and a more reasonable approach should be to adopt different standards of proof according to the different degrees of impact brought about by cyberwarfare.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of cases have highlighted the intersection of cybercrime and cyberwarfare: operations with a clear cyberwarfare intent have incorporated tactical maneuvers normally associated with cybercrime. Cybercrime constitutes the criminal exploitation of digital systems to perpetrate unlawful activities through technological means (Hawdon 2021). Nowadays, the virtual nature, technological infrastructure, and limitless scalability of digital networks -- when combined with the misuse of big data analytics -- have paradoxically dissolved traditional national boundaries, transforming transnational criminal operations into borderless threats with globalized impact (Zhao and Cheng 2024). If the extent of cyberwarfare has reached the level of a criminal case, it should be strictly required to meet the standard of proof of a criminal case.\nTake the Shocknet virus, for example, which, in the course of cyberwarfare led to the damage of about 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz plant, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of Iranian centrifuges and delaying Iran's uranium enrichment program, in addition to the accidental spread of the Shocknet virus around the globe, which infected more than 100,000 computers. In terms of its impact, its nature has reached the seriousness of a criminal case. As Judge Higgins of the International Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER Court of Justice pointed out in his independent opinion in the Oil Platforms case, the more serious the allegations, the greater the degree of credibility of the evidence required.⁴ Therefore, in a case such as the Shocknet virus, which has already reached the standard of a criminal case, proof of the wrongfulness and attributability of the acts of the United States and Israel in the case will need to reach the level of beyond reasonable doubt.\nAs generative AI becomes widespread, the costs of creating and spreading viral false information, along with cross-border data storage, transfer, and processing expenses, are plummeting so that the frequency of cyber attacks is also on the rise (Cheng and Liu 2023). It is clearly unreasonable to apply the standards of cybercrime to all cyberattacks. A more rational approach would be to lower the burden of proof for cyberattacks that cause less damage and do not constitute a criminal case, similar to some of the standards of proof in civil litigation. But in any case, for the standard of proof of cyberwarfare is inappropriate to adopt the standard of prima facie evidence,\"prima facie evidence\"refers to\"sufficient to establish a fact or to establish a presumption, unless it is effectively rebutted\"evidence. A prima facie case can only mean that there is a possibility that the fact occurred, but it is not very convincing.\nMoreover, the application of that criterion to the determination of state responsibility would undoubtedly lead to a series of problems and increase the cost of dealing with cases because of its weak persuasiveness. For example, if a State was found to have committed a wrongful act merely because there was a possibility that it had done so, not only was there no basis in jurisprudence, but it would also be difficult for the international community to accept an assessment based on simple values. Additionally, the principle that the higher the gravity of the act, the higher the standard of proof is consistently reflected in academic discussions of international law, particularly concerning the International Court of Justice (Bills 2023). If a state is found to be liable for the high cost of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, it need only meet such a simple standard of proof, which clearly violates this principle.",
    "## 3.3 Normative boundaries of the deterrent factors of responsibility The wrongfulness of an act is one of the elements of the law of state responsibility, and the absence of wrongfulness does not entail the responsibility of the state, a situation that can also be referred to as a cause of impediment to state responsibility, with an emphasis on the analysis of two cases: self-defense and countermeasures.": "⁴ Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.S.), I.C.J. Judgment of 6 November 2003, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, para.33.\nDE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare Moreover, the International Court of Justice, in the Nicaragua case, held that all attacks of force belonged to the use of force, but not all uses of force constituted an attack of force, and that only those that were the most serious and had a significant scale and consequences could constitute an “armed attack” (Leigh 1984). According to the relevant judgment, there is a difference in intensity between the two. The significance of this distinction should also be reflected in cyberattacks. If a cyber-attack by a State only constitutes a use of force under Article 2(4) but does not constitute an armed attack under Article 51, it is certainly a serious internationally wrongful act in breach of an obligation under international law of jus cogens, but the injured State can only take non-forceful “countermeasures” as provided for in the Draft Articles. Once such measures are found to constitute an armed attack, the injured State may invoke Article 51 to legitimately exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defense, including the use of force.\nCountermeasures in international law are non-forcible measures taken by an injured State against a State responsible for committing an internationally wrongful act to induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations, with the intention of restoring reciprocity between the parties (Omura 2010). Accordingly, countermeasures do not normally involve the use of force (Jia 2022). They are lawful, provided that they meet the conditions set out in Part Three of the Draft Articles.5 Countermeasures are generally used in cases where the use of force does not rise to the level of an armed attack and, by analogy, in the field of cyberwarfare in cases where the level of the attack is not overly aggressive. Cases such as the SolarWinds supply chain attack and the Stuxnet virus attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities have reached the level of an armed attack in terms of both the means used and the damage Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER caused, and the right of self-defense can be triggered, no longer at the level of countermeasures.\nTraditional remedies such as compensation and restitution take some time to realize, and if one is only passively waiting for remedies there is a risk of further expanding losses, so as more timely remedies, both self-defense and countermeasures are necessary to avoid the expansion of losses to the maximum extent possible before traditional remedies can be obtained. Neither the right of self-defense nor the exercise of countermeasures is without limits. Customary law also limits the exercise of the right of self-defense, and the use of force in self-defense remains wrongful if it is accompanied by a violation of international humanitarian law or human rights since special provisions of international humanitarian law (such as the prohibition on retaliatory measures against civilians or prisoners of war) and certain human rights are non-derogable in all circumstances (Crawford 2002).\nSimilarly, the scope of countermeasures is limited, as draft article 50, Paragraph 1, provides that countermeasures shall not affect: (a) the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; (b) obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; (c) obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; (d) other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. In addition, Article 50, Paragraph 2, makes it clear that a State taking countermeasures is not relieved from fulfilling its obligations: (a) under any dispute settlement procedure applicable between it and the responsible State; (b) to respect the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents, premises, archives, and documents.",
    "## 3.4 The practical significance of the realization mechanism of state responsibility The state responsibility system is not only a rule implementation tool but also a carrier of the international community's value consensus. On this basis, once the state responsibility is recognized, it is necessary to fulfill the corresponding reality of the obligation. Attribution is not the ultimate goal; using attribution to further solve the problem is the significance of the state responsibility recognition. Under the background of cyber war, the significance of the reality is still worth paying attention to. State responsibility is assumed in various ways; here, we focus on analyzing the two main ways of restitution and compensation.": " ICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep. (1996) 226, para.41.\nFirst of all, we analyze restitution, as the content of the remedy system with the largest scope of remedies, because it can directly eliminate the consequences of wrongdoing, Article 35 of the Draft Articles lists Restitution as a priority remedy. The conditions for the application of restitution included the principles of physical possibility and proportionality, which also required that restitution should not impose a “disproportionate burden” on the responsible State, such as requiring a poor State to bear a large share of the cost of restoration, which was clearly impractical and might be exempted. While the elimination of wrongful consequences is well conceived, and in practice it has been implemented to a certain extent, resulting in more effective State responsibility, restitution also faces contemporary challenges, such as the creation of irreversible damage. While it is naturally clear that nuclear contamination, species extinction, and the like cannot be truly restored in the traditional sense, it is also possible to cause irreversible damage in the context of cyberattacks.\nTake the SolarWinds supply chain attack as an example, the Russian intelligence service hijacked the U.S. SolarWinds software update by implanting malicious code to infiltrate the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and nine other federal agencies and hundreds of enterprises. This case not only resulted in the long-term exposure of intelligence networks and the leakage of sensitive data but also called into question the credibility of global IT supply chain security standards and led to a shift to “zero-trust” architectures and a sharp increase in the cost of international cooperation. While the technical damage can be remedied through compensation, the erosion of democracy is likely to be irreversible, as the cyber-attack has largely eroded public trust in the government's cybersecurity capabilities, which will be difficult to rebuild in a short period, and difficult to fully restore through restitution. Therefore, although restitution can theoretically maximize the compensation for the damage caused, it is obvious that it cannot be fully compensated in practice, and other remedies are needed to supplement it.\nSecondly, as one of the mainstream remedies, Article 31 of the Draft Articles establishes the obligation of the responsible State to provide “full reparation” for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act, which covers both material and moral damages, reflecting the purpose of the elimination of all the consequences of the injury. The principle of the Chorzów Factory case of the Permanent Court of International Justice, of 1928, also provides evidence of this: it establishes that reparation is required to restore the injured State to the “state it would have been in had the wrongful act not been committed”. Further analysis of the types of reparation and the scope of application reveals that reparation can be very broad, ranging from material to moral damages, from direct, quantifiable property damage to indirect, reasonably foreseeable, consequential damages, such as loss of profits due to interruption of trade. Indirect damages, however, often require stricter proof of causation, and the calculation of compensation was controversial at the current stage. In any case, as the mainstream way of assuming state responsibility, the existence of compensation is also of practical significance to the realization of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, which requires less time cost and can more efficiently compensate for the interests of the victimized state than the institutional correction and other methods.",
    "## Core dilemmas in the determination of state responsibility The determination of state responsibility is of great significance, and can lead to real consequences such as restitution and compensation, but in the context of cyberwar, the core problems of the determination of state responsibility need to be paid attention to, mainly including the normative transformation obstacles of the technical attribution, the paradigm conflict of the application of the right of self-defense, and the systemic failure of the mechanism of responsibility assumption. Failure to analyze these dilemmas and propose solutions will make it difficult to trigger the consequences of state responsibility, which will not be conducive to the resolution of international disputes.": "### Normative transformation barriers to technical attribution The MITRE ATT&CK framework, a widely adopted knowledge base of attack behaviors in the current cybersecurity field, can provide technical references for cyber-attack traceability by standardizing the description of attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures (Al-Sada et al. 2024; Georgiadou et al. 2021). However, the transformation of its technical references to legal evidence is facing difficulties.\nPrimarily, the paradigm conflict between technical logic and legal logic hinders the transformation of technical indicators into legal evidence to a certain extent. ATT&CK framework is based on the identification of attack behavioral patterns, such as the “credential dump + lateral movement” mode of APT29, attackers often use the system's functions and tools to operate by modifying the system configuration or using legitimate tools and other methods to move laterally, ATT&CK framework for the identification of the attack behavior pattern to derive technical indicators. However, according to Article 8 of the Draft Articles: The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact, acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. It can be seen that a finding of State responsibility under international law requires proof of “effective control” of the attacking act in relation to the will of the State. For example, in the 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack, attackers injected malicious code called “Sunburst” into SolarWinds' flagship Orion software (Marelli 2022), even though security firms identified SUNBURST's TTPs through ATT&CK, such as T1059.001 command line interface abuse, but these technical characteristics can not directly prove that the Russian intelligence services of the main responsibility, the United States cited the ATT&CK report accusing Russia, but the international community in general to the “lack of direct chain of evidence” to question its legal effectiveness. In this case, even if it is recognized that there is indeed an attack, due to the inability to prove that the behavior is directed or controlled by a country, it is also difficult to use the technical indicators as evidence in the legal sense.\nSubsequently, the existence of intermediate nodes easily leads to a broken chain of evidence. Attackers commonly adopt the anonymizing technical architecture of “springboard server + virtual private network (VPN)”. Taking the 2016 Bangladesh central bank theft case as an example, although the C2 server IP of the SWIFT transaction instructions was traced to the Philippines, further investigation showed that the server was a puppet host controlled by the North Korean Lazarus group. This kind of multi-layer hopping leads to greater difficulty in technical traceability, and the result of traceability may also cause a break in the chain of evidence.\nAnother example is the attack on targets in China by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) through the QUANTUM attack platform, in which a number of modules are involved in concealing the identity of the attack, including QUANTUMBOT Module -- through the hijacking of the botnet command and control of network traffic, manipulating the botnet to launch attack activities and to hide the traces of the U.S. National Security Agency's hacking attacks.; QUANTUMBISCUIT Module -- builds a proxy springboard for quantum injection attacks against an attack target to prevent the attack from being detected retroactively; QUANTUMPHANTOM Module -- provides the technical ability to utilize network link intermediate node hijacking technology to achieve the hiding of the source of the attack, preventing the U.S. National Security Agency's cyberattacks against other countries from being traced back (Wei 2023). The use of multiple anonymization techniques undoubtedly creates a great obstacle to traceability work. Even if the source of the attack can be located accurately in the end, the identity of the operating subject behind the attack still needs to be further identified, and the attacker can be disguised as other countries/organizations or fake IP addresses, etc. to confuse the traceability (Schmitt 2017). The existence of intermediate nodes also makes it difficult to form a chain of evidence. The objective existence of obvious cyber attacks due to problems in the chain of evidence may not be able to carry out a trial in the end and even more accurately determine the responsibility of the state and solve the problem.\nIn addition, the “falsifiability” of technical indicators also weakens their probative value in practice. An important manifestation of this is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). It is widely recognized as the most sophisticated and powerful category of security threats (Ahmad et al. 2019). APTs are engineered by resourced, disciplined threat actors capable of sustained operations through systematic technology exploitation, blending expertise, funding, and structured coordination to maintain persistence (Maisey 2014; Mansfield-Devine 2014). APT organizations often falsify attack signatures through False Flag operations. The identification of false flags is inherently complex, primarily because attackers systematically conceal their actions while simultaneously framing innocent entities for malicious conduct (Rid and Buchanan 2015). Conducting a false flag operation in the cyber realm is fundamentally distinct and far simpler compared to its execution in the physical domain (Goodman 2010). For example, in the 2017 NotPetya ransomware incident, ATT&CK-based T1486 disk encryption analysis initially pointed to North Korea, but subsequent code homology analysis revealed a link to the Russian Sandworm organization. This type of technological misdirection makes the judicial application of the ATT&CK framework a “reasonable suspicion” challenge. As counterfeiting technologies evolve, the ATT&CK framework should also evolve with the times and develop more accurate techniques for identifying forgeries, or else the credibility of the technical indicators it produces may be further diminished in the face of the difficulty of transferring technical indicators to legal evidence.\n### Paradigm conflicts in the application of the right of self-defense Even in the face of cyberattacks, the exercise of the right of self-defense and countermeasures is not unlimited and still needs to comply with certain requirements, so it is still necessary to make a clearer discussion on the boundaries of the legality of the use of the right of self-defense and countermeasures in cyberwarfare.\nAs mentioned in the previous article, as to the question of whether cyber warfare constitutes the use of force under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, the “scale and consequence theory” proposed by Prof. Michael Schmit has the highest degree of acceptance at present. As long as the analysis is conducted according to the multiple indicators of scale and consequence, and the cyber-attack is considered to be a case of the use of force, then countermeasures or even the exercise of the right to self-defense can be taken. The most controversial issue at present is that the right to determine the use of force is in the hands of more developed countries, and the seemingly objective judgment criteria are to some extent mixed with subjective factors.\nAs is widely known, the Tallinn Manual edited by Prof. Michael Schmit, as a more authoritative and important reference document for the study of cyber warfare, has seven of the eight assessment criteria for determining whether the use of force constitutes a use of force, which are completely consistent with the criteria advocated by Prof. Michael Schmit himself. The criteria are somewhat arbitrary and subjective. For example, Professor Schmit himself, when applying these factors to analyze the 2007 cyberattack against Estonia, concluded that the attack constituted a use of force. Other scholars, however, have argued that the opposite conclusion that the cyberattack did not constitute a use of force can easily be reached by relying on these same factors, which can be easily manipulated in their application to reach conclusions that benefit the geostrategic objectives of the country being analyzed (Nguyen 2013).\nMoreover, when applied to cyberattacks, the “scale and consequence” standard has a fatal logical flaw: a given consequence of the same scale and severity can be produced by the use of force as well as by non-forceful means. The loss of life and the destruction of forests and land in a downstream country as a result of the discharge of toxic substances into a river by an upstream country or the starvation and economic turmoil of a country as a result of economic sanctions imposed by one country on another, are in themselves highly analogous to those that would normally result from the use of force. However, in general perception, these acts hardly constitute a use of force in international law or even an internationally wrongful act. In this way, such acts can escape legal sanction even if they have consequences comparable to those of the use of force. Cyberattacks, however, may be recognized as a use of force and subject to liability if they have the same legal consequences. This logical loophole exists partly because of the arbitrariness and subjectivity of the judgment standard. Western scholars with stronger discursive power often lower the threshold for the use of the right to self-defense through an expansive interpretation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, and in this regard, seemingly reasonable standards can often be interpreted to achieve political goals.\nIn addition to lowering the threshold of the right to self-defense through acts of interpretation, the United States has also put forward the “Defend Forward” strategy, which is an offensive defense strategy it has put forward in recent years in the field of cyberspace security, aiming to respond to cyber threats using proactive strikes and pre-emptive strikes. The United States Cyber Command has emphasized the need to adopt a “forward posture” in cyberspace by accessing non-Department of Defense networks or systems to weaken an adversary's cyber capabilities in advance and prevent it from taking action. Such an assertion should be relegated to the academic category of preventive self-defense, which is advocated by a few Western countries and Western scholars, but is not and should not be supported in existing international treaties and customary international law -- it means “granting the major powers an almost unrestricted license to use force” (Klabbers 2013). In summary, the definition of cyberwarfare and the various criteria for judging it, as well as the proposal of strategies such as “forward defense,” are undoubtedly suspected of serving political goals. Professor O'Connell also believes that “cyberwarfare” is a “wrong war”. It is essentially an “invented” problem in the context of the increasing militarization of cybersecurity policies of major Western countries (O'Connell 2012).\n### Systemic failure of responsibility mechanisms The decentralized nature of cyberspace forms a structural contradiction with the “state-centered” responsibility framework of traditional international law, resulting in an imbalance in the distribution of responsibility between states and non-state actors, rigid rules of evidence, and a lack of enforcement mechanisms.\nFirst, the traditional logic of attribution has loopholes that need to be filled in the context of cyberspace, and the traditional theoretical criterion of “effective control” has limitations. This criterion originated from the 1986 case of Nicaragua v. United States, in which the ICJ made it clear that to attribute the conduct of non-state actors to a state (the United States), it is necessary to prove that the state exercised “effective control” over the specific military operation. Not only does the state provide general support such as funding, weapons, or training, but it also needs to have actual command over the specific unlawful action, i.e. the state needs to directly direct or specifically instruct the attack. However, the “outsourcing of tools” in cyberattacks has led to a high degree of invisibility of the state-attacker nexus. For example, in the case of the Iranian APT34 attack on Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in 2021, although the technical traceability showed that the attack tools were linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, it was not possible to prove that their actions were “specifically directed” by the state. In the context of cyberwarfare, “effective control” has the risk of being too rigid, leading to the impossibility of attribution, and the choice of whether to include other judgment criteria in such cases has been widely discussed, among which the theory of “overall control” is of particular research value.\nThe theory of “Overall Control” originated from the judgment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the case of Prosecutor v. Tadić. The Tribunal held that the conduct of a state can be attributed DE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare In the context of cyberwarfare, the anonymity of cyberattacks, technology dependence, and the ambiguity of actors make the traditional standard of attribution challenging, and the “overall control” theory has potential advantages in some respects. The criterion is superior in terms of identification in response to the prevalence of indirect support models. States often support cyberattacks through technological enablement, infrastructure harboring, or strategic guidance. Such behavior is more consistent with the “strategic dominance” characteristic of “overall control” than with the “specific instruction” requirement of “effective control”. For example, Russia’s relationship with APT28 is alleged to be in line with “overall control” in that the Russians provide technical resources but do not directly direct specific attacks, and the international community generally believes that the organization is supported by the Russian government and that the motivation for its attacks is closely related to Russia’s national interests.\nAccording to “overall control”, it is possible to hold Russia responsible, but according to the traditional “effective control” standard, it is difficult to hold it accountable. In addition, while the technical traceability of cyberattacks often only proves a continuing connection between the attacker and the state, and it is difficult to obtain evidence of direct orders, the “overall control” standard eliminates the need to prove a control relationship between the state and the attacker, and allows for a more efficient allocation of responsibility. Although the “overall control” standard has its role in the context of cyberwarfare, it is still difficult to accept it as the standard for attribution of responsibility in the current mainstream view, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia Serbia and Montenegro, the ICJ explicitly rejected the standard of “overall control” and insisted on the strict interpretation of “effective control”,[9] which can provide a reference basis for the attribution of responsibility for cyber warfare. Moreover, there is a risk of political abuse if a more lenient standard is adopted, as when the U.S. sanctioned a Chinese technology company based on “overall control” in the absence of publicly available technical evidence to support it. While this standard is not appropriate in all cases, it is clear that the traditional standard is not fully applicable, and the international community [9] Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, General List No. 91.\nshould continue to explore new, more reasonable standards in practice to address the limitations of the traditional standard.\nSecondly, the traditional attribution criterion is also difficult in practice. The system of attribution of responsibility for non-state actors is not perfect, which leads to the failure of the mechanism for assuming responsibility to play a full role, potentially allowing non-state actors to avoid legal penalties, especially transnational science and technology enterprises to circumvent the responsibility of the behavior at this stage has not been effectively resolved. For example, Zero-Day Vulnerability, as a security flaw that has not yet been discovered or fixed by software vendors, has a unique “gray area” in the trading market due to the ambiguity of its participants, uses, and legal attributes. There are cases where private vulnerability brokers sell zero-day vulnerabilities to governments, but international law does not clarify whether such transactions constitute “assisting in the commission of cyber-attacks”. In terms of the actual situation at this stage, international legislation is undoubtedly lagging behind, and existing cybercrime conventions have not yet explicitly stipulated specific provisions directly targeting “vulnerability trading”.\nIn addition, the EU's “Network Resilience Act” only requires vendors to establish a vulnerability handling process, does not regulate third-party transactions. In China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Internet Information Office, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly issued the “Provisions on the Management of Security Vulnerabilities in Network Products”, which clearly states that no organization or individual shall illegally collect, sell or distribute information on security vulnerabilities in network products, but the standard of “illegality” lacks specific interpretation, and loopholes exist in the determination of “illegality”. The U.S. “Vulnerability Equity Program” is not binding, vendors can refuse to cooperate. It can be seen that the existing law for the actors did not make comprehensive provisions, so the use of zero-day vulnerabilities in cyber attacks on multinational technology enterprises has the possibility of circumventing legal responsibility, liability mechanism due to the lack of comprehensiveness, but also may be further dysfunctional.",
    "## Reconstructing the path of state responsibility in cyber warfare Under the increasingly complex background of cyber warfare, it is of great practical significance to find a more reasonable path of state responsibility. On the one hand, further improvement of the traditional attribution mechanism can enhance the persuasive power of the attribution; on the other hand, through the innovation of judicial procedures, the realization of state responsibility can be further refined to avoid the emergence of unreasonable responsibility which is too light or too heavy. State responsibility in cyberwarfare has room for improvement in both judgment standard and realization, and if it can be adjusted under the common recognition of the international community, it can to a certain extent avoid subjective factors affecting the judgment and assumption of state responsibility.": "### Improving the attribution mechanism One of the important reasons why the attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyber warfare has a certain subjective element is that there is no universally recognized technical attribution mechanism, which to a certain extent has led to the divergence of attribution standards among countries for cyber warfare. Although there is more authoritative literature such as the Tallinn Manual for reference, the nature of international law is, after all, soft law. While States can use soft law to solve the problem of coordinated gaming (Guzman and Meyer 2010), international law is not as binding as it could be if a State's political aspirations need to be realized urgently. In addition, if some countries do not sign an international treaty on cybersecurity, and the content of the treaty has not developed into a custom, a considerable number of countries can claim that they do not carry out activities in the cyber field in accordance with the rules in the treaty. Moreover, even for those countries that have signed such treaties, the cost of withdrawing from them is not high. Finally, although relevant documents are constantly being issued, how to deal with conflicts between them is a subjective process. From this point of view, the mere formulation of international law on cybersecurity is relatively limited in enhancing the rationality of attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nIn this context, promoting the international community to establish a technical attribution institution can be a better choice. First of all, compared with soft law, the institution established under the wide recognition of the international community is more persuasive and can avoid to a greater extent the situation that countries choose the judgment standard of state responsibility based on their own political opinions. Secondly, the establishment of a technical attribution body can help promote policy coordination and resource sharing among countries in the field of cybersecurity. Through multilateral cooperation, countries can fully express their demands, formulate unified international legal standards to deal with transnational cyber threats under the principle of pursuing the greatest common interests, conduct in-depth discussions on reasonable motions to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the attribution standards and reduce the troubles caused by the differences in the laws of different countries.\nFurthermore, technical attribution organizations can establish an information-sharing platform to share the latest information on cyberattacks and technological advances promptly, and such an information-sharing mechanism can improve the ability of countries to respond to cyber threats. For example, the Enhanced Attribution (EA) program initiated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is very informative. The goal of the EA program is to develop techniques to generate operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent and independent malicious cyber campaigns and to create a methodology by which this information can be shared with multiple parties without jeopardizing the intelligence sources and methodologies. By collecting, monitoring, and understanding adversary cyberattack operations in the red space, the program is expected to be divided into three technical areas (TAs) that will work in parallel with each other. They will span three 18-month phases, after which the agency will step in to obtain high-quality results. This activity will undoubtedly empower the attribution criteria with more precise technology, which is expected to target the subjects of wrongdoing with greater precision. Such meaningful criteria, if adopted by technical attribution agencies, would certainly contribute to the standardization of technical attribution.\nBased on the establishment of technical attribution institutions and the development of technical attribution criteria, the criterion of “effective control” in the traditional attribution criteria needs to be expanded. The obstacle to the normative transformation of technical attribution mentioned earlier is largely due to the rigid application of the criterion of “effective control”. In light of the complexity of cyberwarfare models, the concept of “material support” should be introduced, so that if a State systematically provides vulnerabilities, infrastructure, or funding to non-State actors that cause the same level of consequences as a direct direct order, it will be held liable even if there is no direct order. Although this approach has not become a common practice in the international community, the continued rigid application of the traditional criterion of proving a directive relationship will undoubtedly allow certain subjects to avoid the risk of assuming State responsibility, which is difficult to accept in terms of jurisprudence. Therefore, based on the principle of the “effective control” criterion, consideration should be given to the use of “substantial support” to make judgments when the act of support has a significant impact and is directly related to the acts or purposes of the supported party, thus constituting substantial support. The adoption of such a criterion is not only legally sound but also creates conditions for the application of technical attribution to a greater extent. The adoption of the “substantial support” criterion for attribution when the support provided by a State can be traced back to that State by technical means and it can be established that the State providing the assistance constitutes substantial support can avoid the rigid application of the traditional criterion, which would jeopardize the results obtained through technical tracing.\n### Adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism The establishment of an international attribution agency is certainly of great significance to the determination of state responsibility, but it only involves the work of attribution, and if we want to comprehensively reconstruct the responsibility of the state in cyberwarfare, it must be built on the basis of a broad consensus among all countries, and the blueprint for the establishment of an international attribution agency as mentioned in the previous section is also built on the basis of the consensus of all countries. Therefore, the consensus of all countries is a fundamental condition. It is obviously unrealistic for the international community to reach consensus in the short term, because the more vulnerable countries may consider that the adjustment of rules has nothing to do with them. In this case, the big countries are more important to play a pioneering role and set an example through concrete actions. The adjustment of the multilateral cooperation mechanism is conducive to the rationalization of the judgment of national responsibility in cyber warfare, and is also conducive to the regulation of the cyber offensive behavior of individual countries, so that all countries in the international community can benefit from it. The specific cooperation mechanism can be adjusted as follows: Foremost, regional confidence-building measures should be further developed. The most important is the establishment of a cyberspace “hotline mechanism”, which can reduce the information gap through effective communication and avoid the emergence of unnecessary cyberattacks. As early as during the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, this “hotline mechanism” demonstrated its important value. During the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, both sides in the nuclear arms race and military confrontation realized that the lack of direct communication channels could lead to miscalculation and escalation of the conflict. In 1963, the U.S. and the Soviet Union established the “hotline mechanism”, which allowed leaders to communicate quickly, directly, and privately in emergency situations, thereby eliminating the risk of nuclear war resulting from communication delays or misunderstandings of each other's actions. To this day, this mechanism is used as an important tool. In 2022, during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the U.S. and Russia established a military hotline to avoid miscalculations and military accidents. The “hotline mechanism” has gone a long way in avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings and remains indispensable in the context of cyberwarfare. 2020s attack on India's power grid could be a case in point. on October 12, 2020, Mumbai, India, experienced a massive blackout that affected critical infrastructure, including stock exchanges and healthcare facilities. The New York Times reported that the blackout may have been linked to China, claiming that “Chinese malware hacked into India's power supply control system” in order to pressure India in the India-China border standoff. Although this claim was later clarified by Recorded Future, a cybersecurity company mentioned in the report, and officially denied by Indian officials, it still caused a certain degree of damage to China's image, and if the “hotline mechanism” had been adopted at that time, it could have avoided the misleading public opinion and the waste of investigation resources. This shows that China, the United States, Russia and other countries have taken the lead in setting up real-time communication channels, clarifying in a timely manner in the event of miscalculation, and reducing unnecessary costs and expenditures, which is still necessary in the context of cyber warfare.\nConcomitantly, adjusting the public-private partnership. In the context of cyberwarfare, cooperation between countries is certainly important, but operators often also have a large amount of relevant information. To further reduce the cost of controlling the occurrence of cyberwarfare, it is indispensable for operators and governments to jointly build a threat intelligence-sharing platform. Adopting this model not only facilitates research between countries based on a large number of cases provided by operators to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the cases, but also reduces the effort of searching for cyberattacks from all over the world, saves time and cost, and efficiently builds identification and defense measures. This model has been reflected in the JCDC model in the U.S. JCDC participants that include organizations and operators from both the public and private sectors, covering service providers, infrastructure operators, cybersecurity companies, and companies in the critical infrastructure industry.\nIn addition, JCDC constituents include specific government agencies designated by Congress, such as the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It is through the operator-government co-built threat intelligence-sharing platform that the JCDC shares real-time information through multiple platforms, such as Slack, the Homeland Security Information Network HSIN, and the GovDelivery service, to ensure that there is continuous dialog and collaboration among the participants. This also sets the stage for the development of proactive cyber defense programs to mitigate the most serious risks before threats become visible. Moreover, “gatekeeper liability” for technology companies can be introduced, as Article 6 of The EU's Digital Services Act indicates that “where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, the service provider shall not be liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that the provider”. By analyzing the exemption from liability of the hosting service provider of the online platform and the relevant conditions, it can be seen that the online platform should have a certain degree of responsibility for reviewing the information provided by the service recipient (Lefouili and Madio 2022). For content that is clearly of a cyber-attack nature, the provider of the online service should exercise a certain degree of scrutiny, in particular, cloud computing giants are required to filter malicious traffic, or else they may be considered to bear the corresponding joint and several liability.\nFinally, a “digital ceasefire zone” system could be included in the scope of discussion. Healthcare, energy and other livelihood areas are of great importance, and if they are subjected to cyberattacks, they will often lead to more serious consequences, and should be categorized as no-attack zones, so that if certain countries carry out non-compliant cyberattacks, violators will be automatically triggered by the United Nations to sanction them. According to the context that cyber-peacekeeping has been suggested as a strategic framework to address the multifaceted challenges posed by diverse manifestations of cyber conflict (Dorn 2017), in order to support the implementation of the system, we can also consider the establishment of a “network peacekeeping force”, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to send technical teams to assist in the restoration of network services in conflict areas. The reason why it should be coordinated by the ITU is that, under its supervision, the technical teams will be able to use more reasonable means to respond to cyber attacks. Shortly after the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, controversy erupted over the way Ukraine set up the International Volunteer Team for Cyber Defense to carry out cyberattacks against Russian targets, and its development of tools, which allows any digital device to become part of a DDoS attack network, was deemed to be a violation of international cyber norms. The existence of a unified body for coordination would make it possible to bring the corresponding tools into line with the principle of proportionality.\n### Innovations in judicial procedures In addition to further clarifying the criteria for attribution of state responsibility and minimizing the frequency of cyberwar through multilateral cooperation mechanisms, there is also a need for innovation in the judicial process, because most cyberwars are ultimately handled through the judicial process, and therefore adopting a more feasible judicial process is conducive to a more reasonable distribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nFirstly, the International Court of Justice could create a panel of judges specialized in cyberspace cases, allowing for the submission of electronic evidence and anonymous witnesses. There is a precedent for such a special chamber, namely the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which is a special judicial procedure set up within the ITLOS to hear disputes between States arising from the exploration and exploitation of the international seabed area. In response to the increasingly complex cyberwarfare, which should be handled more rigorously, and the identification and allocation of State responsibility should be more reasonable, the traditional team of judges may not be able to make accurate judgments when faced with the special field of cyber. The idea that selecting judges with relevant backgrounds enhances efficiency is supported by academic research, which suggests that a judge's prior experience and characteristics can influence their decision-making (Basabe-Serrano 2019). At this time, the selection of judges with cyber background to form a team specializing in cyberspace cases is conducive to more efficiently identifying the nature of cyberattacks and, with the help of increasingly developed technological means, more reasonably allocating state responsibility on the basis of technical indicators.\nMeanwhile, through the leading role of the International Court of Justice, countries can also select judges with expertise in international law, cyber technology, data protection, and other fields through a special selection mechanism to form domestic teams specialized in handling cyber cases. From this, we can see that such a move can not only further solve the problem of cyber warfare among countries but also serve as an inspiration for the handling of cyber cases within countries. The team of judges can cooperate with other international organizations (such as Interpol and the United Nations Office on Cybercrime) to analyze the ever-emerging new forms and the constantly updating and iterative advanced technologies in order to formulate more reasonable judgment standards and solution measures, so as to jointly address the global challenges in cyberspace.\nIn addition, consideration could be given to legitimizing “preventive countermeasures” by allowing for pre-emptive defences against highly probable cyberattacks under the authority of the Security Council. Referring to Article 50 of the UN Charter on temporary measures against economic sanctions, UN Member States, in their actions for the maintenance of international peace and security, should refrain from any action that might widen a dispute or aggravate a situation. And the UN Security Council is tasked with resolving international disputes and can establish frameworks for peaceful settlements, aligning with Article 1 of the UN Charter so that Member States should take appropriate steps to prevent the extension or aggravation of the dispute in accordance with the recommendations of the UNSC (Alipour 2024). It was mentioned earlier that countermeasures must be a means to be taken only if there is a realistic attack. However, in the context of cyberwarfare, it is often too late to take countermeasures if one has to wait until there is an attack. Due to the intensity and scope of cyberattacks, a country's cyber system may not be able to function after an attack, let alone take defensive measures. Under such circumstances, it is particularly important to formulate “preventive countermeasures” with reference to Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations. This kind of prevention cannot be advanced indefinitely and should be judged according to the recommendations of the UN Security Council. However, the international community needs to discuss in depth what kind of preventive measures should be taken in order to arrive at a standard. In any case, even if this kind of advance measure is recognized, it still needs to be regulated by the corresponding standards, or else powerful countries can launch disproportionate “preventive countermeasures” against less dangerous cyberattacks in pursuit of their own national political demands, which is contrary to the original purpose of the measure.\nWhile considering innovations in the judicial process, there is also a need for flexibility in the use of various methods to solve the problems that arise in the process, such as the use of legal discourse. In addressing the dual imperatives of legislative innovation and jurisprudential reconceptualization, legal discourse analysis as a vital interdisciplinary instrument, offers multidimensional frameworks to decode evolving normative constructs within contemporary governance systems (Neuwirth 2023). The degree of formality in legal language mirrors the solemn nature of judicial proceedings, whereas the presence or absence of polite expressions can signal deference, confrontational intent, or calculated positioning. These deliberate language patterns fundamentally shape both the courtroom environment and participants' interpretations of interactions, ultimately guiding behavioral responses throughout legal exchanges (Mısır and Akın 2024). In addition, the refinement of legal discourse patterning can be enhanced by studying a large number of cases in the European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union issues its rulings in 23 legally binding linguistic versions, reflecting the mandate established under Article 217 of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. This foundational provision, originally enacted as the European Council's inaugural legislative instrument, constitutionally guarantees that every member state's national language maintains equal juridical standing as an official working language of the Union (Trklja 2024). Based on the breadth of these cases, summarizing them will undoubtedly be beneficial for a more accurate use of legal language.\nUltimately, in the process of optimization, the participation of artificial intelligence is an irreversible trend, and the various advantages of artificial intelligence can undoubtedly improve efficiency, but the existence of hidden loopholes in various aspects of technology, ethics and other aspects also need to be paid attention to. Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transnational challenge demanding coordinated governance architectures, necessitating the establishment of multilateral regulatory systems capable of ensuring operational synergy, policy harmonization, and adaptive scalability across jurisdictions (Neuwirth 2024). And transitioning to centralized regulatory frameworks proves indispensable for steering generative AI development along ethically aligned trajectories (Cheng and Liu 2024). To effectively address existential risks in artificial intelligence development, institutionalizing ethical guardrails through a “Digital Humanism” framework becomes imperative. This paradigm prioritizes human-centric imperatives by safeguarding species-wide wellbeing and systemic security, while strategically decoupling technological advancement from zero-sum competition. Such an approach ensures that technological evolution maintains symbiotic alignment with civilizational priorities (Cheng and Gong 2024). Today sanctions and anti-sanctions have evolved into a dominant strategic pattern within contemporary geopolitical interactions (Gu and Zhao 2023), which makes it all the more important that more rational judicial procedures be used to mitigate the growing conflict.",
    "## Conclusions The accelerated militarization of cyberspace has plunged the state responsibility system into a “triple normative dilemma”: first, the transformation of technical evidence into legal facts has led to the failure of the attribution mechanism; second, the hermeneutical controversy over the boundaries of the right to self-defense has triggered a crisis of the legitimacy of the countermeasures; and third, the vacuum in the allocation of responsibility due to the involvement of non-State actors has resulted in the systematic failure of the enforcement mechanism. These structural impediments not only undermine the deterrent effect of international law, but also contribute to the “low-cost-high-benefit” nature of cyberwarfare, which continues to induce opportunistic tactics by state actors.": "While existing governance frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0's “principle of equivalence of effects” and the Convention on Cybercrime's territoriality provision provide guidance on rules at the local level, they are not able to cope with complex cyberconflicts due to institutional fragmentation and technological adaptability deficiencies. For example, the Tallinn Manual's 2.0 Rule 69's eight-dimensional assessment model of the threshold for the use of force faces an attenuation of its explanatory power when dealing with generative AI-driven cognitive warfare; and the Budapest Convention's Mutual Legal Assistance Mechanism is in an implementation dilemma due to the anonymity of cryptocurrencies.\nTo solve the above dilemmas, it is urgent to build a three-in-one path of “technical verification, rule iteration, and mechanism synergy” to reconfigure the responsibility: (1) technical empowerment of attribution mechanism: building a verifiable attribution system, and realizing the transformation of MITRE ATT&CK framework into a judicial system; (2) adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism, building regional confidence measures, strengthening public-private partnership, and strengthening the DE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare This reconstruction path has dual normative value: at the level of substantive law, through the legalization of preventive responsibility and due diligence, the “risk spillover” behavior of the state in cyberspace is curbed; at the level of procedural law, with the help of technology-neutral third-party evidence collection mechanism, the cognitive gap between technological logic and judicial review can be bridged. Only by realizing the in-depth mutual embedding of technical governance and international law can the “tragedy of the commons” effect of cyberwar be suppressed, and the paradigm shift of the community of destiny in cyberspace from conceptual advocacy to institutional practice be promoted.\n**Research funding:** This work was supported by the project of National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 24BYY151) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhejiang University."

Due to the ambiguity of the object of regulation, the defect of attribution mechanism, and the lack of clarity of the constituent elements of responsibility, the existing international law framework has caused the state responsibility system in cyberspace to fall into the dilemma of normative failure. This paper takes the theory of international law subjectivity as the logical starting point and systematically deconstructs the normative attributes of cyberwar and the path of responsibility determination. This paper shows that the constitutive elements of state responsibility need to break through the rigid standard of traditional\"behavior-damage\"causality and build a dynamic attribution system combining technical verification and legal presumption. Through critical analysis of the use of force threshold doctrine, this paper, based on a comprehensive analysis of the core dilemma of the determination of state responsibility, proposes to appropriately introduce the concept of\"substantial support\", and when the traditional theory of comprehensive control fails to make effective attribution, the criterion of\"substantial support\"can be used to complete the attribution of state responsibility with the increasingly developed technological traceability means.\nKeywords: cyberwarfare; international law; state responsibility; attributability *Corresponding author: Haonan Li, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: lihaonan22402065@zju.edu.cn. https://orcid.org/0009-0005-0476-300X Le Cheng, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: chengle163@hotmail.com. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4423-8585 The militarized transformation of cyberspace has upended the cognitive architecture of the use of force under the Westphalian system. Traditional military theory faces challenges when applied to cyber conflict. The evolution of cyberwarfare from a technological tool to a means of strategic deterrence has led to a blurring of the legal boundaries between peacetime and armed conflict. And the increasing effectiveness of cyberattacks further complicates the legal context of cyberwarfare. The traditional state responsibility regime needs to be reconfigured due to a triple adaptive dilemma: first, technological anonymity triggers a break in the chain of attribution, which puts the “effective control” criterion in Article 8 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility in a difficult position to prove; second, the non-kinetic nature of cyber operations makes it difficult to quantify the threshold for the use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations; and third, the legitimacy boundary of countermeasures creates normative conflicts under the “forward defense” strategy.\nThis paper adopts a techno-legal cross-analysis approach to focus on the normative reconstruction path of state responsibility in cyber warfare. By deconstructing the dilemma of determining state responsibility at the current stage and proposing corresponding reconstruction paths, this paper attempts to discuss how the determination standard of the attribute of force in cyberwarfare can be coordinated with the “principle of equivalence of effect” of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the mode of assuming the indirect responsibility of the state in the context of the intervention of non-state actors. It is hoped that through the reconstruction of various paths, the issue of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare can be clarified as much as possible, and the diffuse damage caused by cyberwarfare can be curbed. This paper aims to provide theoretical support for the clear identification of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare and to promote the formation of a technologically empowered international law governance paradigm.\n## Deconstructing the normative attributes of cyberwarfare ### The evolution of the conceptual genealogy of cyberwarfare The generation of the normative concept of cyberwarfare has gone through the process of discourse migration from military science to jurisprudence. The concept of cyberwarfare first appeared in a research report by the RAND Corporation in 1993, which defined cyberwarfare as a military operation being implemented or prepared to be implemented according to information-related principles. In the strategic dimension, the concept of cyberwarfare was accompanied by the completion of the ontological construction of the theory of the “Fifth Dimension”, which was recognized by Huang (2015), who argued that “the rapid development of the global Internet has been driven by the rapid advancement of information technology, and cyberspace has begun to take shape as the ‘fifth space' beyond the land, sea, airspace and outer space”. At the same time, a variety of problems and threats such as cyber-attacks and cybercrime have also arisen, and the concept of “cyber warfare” is put forward in this context. On the one hand, along with the development of science and technology, the scale of cyber warfare has reached an unprecedented level, such as the cyber attack and defense in the Russo-Georgian war, the Iranian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the Shocknet virus, the Syrian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the airstrikes, and other cases, all of which are the embodiment of the escalation of the intensity of modern cyber warfare. On the other hand, the relevant theoretical research has been optimized based on the endless cyber warfare.\nCompared with China's late start in cyberwarfare research, western countries have begun research on cyberwarfare earlier, with a larger scale and wider scope, and have also achieved rich results in the formulation of international rules in cyberspace. Since the development of relevant theories, the current mainstream scholars believe that the content of international law on jus ad bellum can be applied to cyber warfare. For example, Reese Nguyen (2013) believes that when a cyber attack is intended to cause irreversible damage or physical loss to the physical information system, it can be recognized as constituting an attack with force. The main argument in favor of this claim is based on Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, which states that “all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. There are different doctrinal understandings of how to argue that cyberwarfare is a use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, as will be presented in the next section.\n### 2.2 Doctrines of thresholds for use of force in cyberwarfare At present, mainstream scholars believe that cyberwarfare constitutes the use of force, but there are different doctrines in understanding, mainly the theory of purpose, instrumental theory, scale, and consequence theory. Walter Sharp (1999), a representative of the “purpose theory”, argues that computer network attacks are a form of economic and political coercion, and although such coercion is traditionally considered not to be a “use of force”, in the light of the purpose of the Charter of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, and the territorial integrity and political independence of States guaranteed by Article 2(4), computer network attacks should also be subject to Article 2(4) since economic and political coercion would also threaten international peace and jeopardize the territorial integrity and political independence of a State, and would therefore be covered by the scope of the Article.\nMarco Roscini (2010), a representative of the “tools doctrine”, argues that the “military force” that Article 2(4) intends to regulate is mainly embodied in the use of specific weapons (or tools) and that cyber-attacks using “weapons” such as Trojan horses, worms, etc. can also constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) if they produce specific tangible or intangible damage. The most widely accepted theory is the “scale and consequences theory”, in which Professor Michael Schmitt (1999, 2011) argues that although the main purpose of Article 2(4) is to constrain a state's external use of traditional military force to coerce others, in practice what matters is not the means used but the consequences; if a cyber-attack directly causes or is likely to cause damage to persons or objects comparable to that caused by military means, it should undoubtedly constitute a “use of force”; even if it does not cause tangible damage to persons or objects, the victimized State can still determine whether a cyber-attack constitutes a “use of force” by assessing the following seven criteria: (a) severity, (b) immediacy, (c) directness, (d) invasiveness, (e) measurability of effects, (f) presumptive legality and (g) state involvement. Although there are strengths and weaknesses in each viewpoint, as far as the existing situation is analyzed, the scale and consequence theory is recognized by majority of researchers, and the proposition of Prof. Michael Schmit has had a greater impact in the Western academic community, not only in the Tallinn Manual, which is edited by him but also recognized by Western countries. It is worth mentioning that the Tallinn Manual, as a document developed with the participation of multinational subjects, contains seven out of eight assessment criteria for defining whether a cyberattack constitutes a use of force that are identical to those mentioned in the previous article, which indicates that the evaluation criteria advocated by the scale and consequences theory have their own rationality and can be generally accepted by the majority of countries.\nIt should be noted that the research on issues related to cyberwarfare in this paper is based on cases where cyberwarfare can trigger international responsibility, and cyber infringement and cybercrime activities, which are only regulated by the domestic laws of various countries as well as a small number of international treaties, obviously do not fall into the category of use of force as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations 2(4), and they also cannot trigger the responsibility of the State, and therefore do not fall within the scope of this paper's analysis.\n## Normative elements and paths to attribution of state responsibility in cyberwarfare ### Normative basis and constitutive elements of the state responsibility regime The institutional framework of state responsibility in international law is rooted in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Articles). According to Chapter I and Chapter II of the Draft Articles, the establishment of state responsibility requires the fulfillment of two normative elements: wrongfulness and attributability. In the following, the two elements will be analyzed separately.\nInitially, the analysis of wrongfulness. In Article 2 of the Draft Articles, the International Law Commission defines that “there is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law, and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.” In the context of cyberwarfare, it is clear that most cases of wrongful acts are in the form of action, as exemplified by the Russo-Georgian war: the Georgian government website was attacked, the government web server was on the verge of collapsing due to the large number of access requests it received for more than 10 h, the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was completely dysfunctional, and the website of the presidential administration was paralyzed for 24 h. As the fighting deepened, the intensity and sophistication of the cyber-attacks increased, with Russia targeting Georgia's government and news media websites as the primary targets, disabling virtually all of Georgia's government offices. Second, it is worth noting that the article does not mention that subjective fault or intent to engage in a wrongful act is required to establish state responsibility; the mere existence of a violation of the law is sufficient to give rise to international responsibility, and, by extension, state responsibility should be an objective rather than a subjective responsibility. The normative logic of this objective responsibility paradigm, which rejects the subjective fault element, is that the unlawfulness of an internationally wrongful act arises from an objective breach of an international obligation rather than from the state of mind of the acting state.\nIn addition, the article requires that the wrongful act constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state, and for a further understanding of the Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER obligation, one can refer to the definitions in Articles 12 and 13 of the Draft Articles. Article 12 provides that there is a breach of an international obligation by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. Article 13 provides that an act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs. In other words, the key feature of a breach of an international obligation is that the obligation should have been complied with, but in fact, the State in question did not take reasonable action to comply with the obligation.\nArticle 12 makes it clear that, regardless of the origin or character of the obligation, when analyzed in terms of the sources of international law, the source of the obligation is varied, and may be a customary one, or one based on a treaty, or even a legal principle generally recognized by the international community. In the Rainbow Warrior case, for example, the arbitral tribunal stated that there is no distinction in international law between contractual and tortious liability, so any breach by a State of a duty, regardless of the source of the duty, gives rise to the responsibility of the State and therefore to an obligation to make reparation.¹ This case is very strong evidence of the broadness of the source of the obligation.\nThe broadness of the source of the obligation is conducive to the regulation of cyberwarfare. First, for States parties to cyberwarfare-related treaties, such as the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, a violation of the content of the treaty can constitute a direct breach of the obligation. Second, for countries not participating in the treaty, if the relevant practice of maintaining network security has been generally recognized in the international community and can become a kind of habit, the habit can also be used as a source of obligation, and if it does not comply with the habit, it is also possible to find that a country violates the obligation, which undoubtedly enlarges the scope of the main body needing to comply with the obligation, and allows more countries to consciously comply with the obligation. What's more, the identification and formation of general principles are essential for maintaining international law as a coherent legal system. Therefore, sometimes principles can also govern the behavior of States. It should be noted, however, that even if a State commits certain acts of cyberattack against another State and causes damage, if it does not constitute a breach of an international obligation, it will not give rise to the legal responsibility of the author State.\n¹ Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (New Zealand v. France) (“Rainbow Warrior”), Award of 30 April 1990, 20 UNRIAA 215, para.75.\nCorrespondingly, attributability is then analyzed. Theoretically, all acts of individuals, corporations, or other entities in the sense of domestic law may be attributed to a State (Government) based on nationality. In dealing with this issue, the Draft Articles adopt a narrow approach, namely, the “overall control test”, whereby the only conduct that can be attributed to a State is that of State organs or other entities acting under the direction, control, or instigation of a State organ, which becomes an agent of the State at the time of the conduct. As far as the attributability of the state in cyber warfare is concerned, if a cyber attack is initiated or directed by the state as the main body, the corresponding responsibility is borne by the state. In simple cases, the attributability of state responsibility can be quickly recognized. However, since the development of cyberwarfare, identifying the source of cyber-attacks is crucial to ensuring cybersecurity, its technical means have become increasingly flexible, and many attribution problems are caused by anonymous attacks, and the attackers can often easily hide their identities, which has brought great challenges to the tracking of the source of the attack. Even if the source of the attack is identified, the subject needs to be further clarified. The subject of a cyberattack can avoid being targeted by hiding or forging his identity in many ways, so pinpointing the subject is also a major challenge.\nIn addition, when a country helps another country to engage in internationally wrongful acts, the former also to the extent of the support, helps to bear state responsibility, but the main state responsibility still belongs to the wrongdoing state. But regardless of the size of state responsibility, by analogy, in the context of cyberwarfare, if a country provides technical means or financial support and other help to other countries, in principle, it should also bear the corresponding responsibility, and if that State has both wrongful acts and breaches of its obligations, it may also satisfy the constituent elements of State responsibility, and thus bear State responsibility in cyberwarfare to the extent of the damage caused by that State.\n### Hierarchical construction of standards of proof As a component of the constituent elements, whether it is the judgment of wrongfulness or the judgment of attributability, there is the problem of proof. In fact, for the legal field of the problem, the standard of proof has been extremely important, from the traditional theory of evidence, the standard of proof is the judge to consider and weigh the authenticity of the facts of the case to achieve the degree of proof, but also the burden of proof to provide the appropriate evidence to prove the facts of the case to achieve a certain standard. The degree of standard of proof is directly related to the judge for the degree of conviction of the evidence, which naturally will affect the results of the judgment. Criminal law, civil law, and Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER other substantive areas of law, after a long period of development, in their litigation process also have their standard of proof, although different standards for the results of the judgment have a decisive impact, the litigant naturally needs to try to meet the standard of proof. On the other hand, for the facts that have occurred, no one has the ability to $100\\%$ reproduce the scene, they can only try to prove to maximize the proximity of the objective facts, thus providing judges with a good judgment environment so that judges as far as possible can make a reasonable judgment, and the standard of proof from this sense of understanding is also the embodiment of substantive justice.\nOutside the traditional field of substantive law, the standard of proof is also of great significance to the issue of international law. In international law, the composition of state responsibility needs to satisfy both illegal behavior and attributable elements, but the proof of the two elements is also a separate issue, whether the two standards of proof are consistent, and if not, what kind of standards should be used is an urgent discussion. As early as before the emergence of the problem of evidence in the field of networks, the International Court of Justice pointed out in the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua that the key to the solution to the problem lies not only in the process of attributing conduct to the law of a particular country but also in the search for substantial evidence before the process of legal attribution. It is thus clear that the question of the standard of proof is not simply an integral part of the question of the attribution of State responsibility, but is more relevant for independent discussion.\nAs far as the current situation is concerned, there is a lack of a uniform and clear standard of proof in international law. In the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice emphasized the principle of the free assessment of evidence, stating that within the limits of the Statute of the Court and the Rules of the Tribunal, the Court is free to assess the value of any evidence.3 While the persistent lack of uniform standards in international law has been detrimental to the development of proof, an analysis of the nature of the cases before the ICJ shows that there is a corresponding rationale for the absence of uniform standards of proof that the complexity and diversity of the cases before the ICJ make it difficult to arrive at a uniform standard that would be universally or primarily applicable to inter-State litigation.\nIn addition, although the Court's deficiencies in the standard of proof may lead to subjective factors on the part of the judges affecting the decision of the case, in practice, the Court usually indicates in its judgments the standard of proof that it has adopted. Even if there is no expressly stated uniform standard, taking the standard of proof in a large number of judgments as a sample, it is still possible to analyze the issue of the standard of proof to one degree or another. Examining the decisions of ICJ, it can be found that the standard of proof adopted by ICJ basically draws on the system of standard of proof of the domestic courts of the common law system. According to different types of cases, the common law system of the standard of proof, according to the degree of strictness in descending order, can be divided into four types: (1) the criminal field is usually adopted with full certainty of “beyond a reasonable doubt”; (2) “clear and convincing proof”, which is highly probable but does not reach the level of incontrovertibility; (3) “preponderance of evidence”, which is usually adopted in civil proceedings and has a higher degree of reasonableness and probability; (4) prima facie evidence, which is merely required to prove indications of the correctness of an argument.\nThe standards of proof established for different types of cases are also of great significance in the context of cyberwarfare. Cyber-attacks are more covert and asymmetric than traditional attacks, and the degree of damage caused and the difficulty of investigation vary to different degrees, making evaluation more difficult than in traditional cases. Therefore, it is not practical to establish a uniform standard of proof, and a more reasonable approach should be to adopt different standards of proof according to the different degrees of impact brought about by cyberwarfare.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of cases have highlighted the intersection of cybercrime and cyberwarfare: operations with a clear cyberwarfare intent have incorporated tactical maneuvers normally associated with cybercrime. Cybercrime constitutes the criminal exploitation of digital systems to perpetrate unlawful activities through technological means. Nowadays, the virtual nature, technological infrastructure, and limitless scalability of digital networks -- when combined with the misuse of big data analytics -- have paradoxically dissolved traditional national boundaries, transforming transnational criminal operations into borderless threats with globalized impact. If the extent of cyberwarfare has reached the level of a criminal case, it should be strictly required to meet the standard of proof of a criminal case.\nTake the Shocknet virus, for example, which, in the course of cyberwarfare led to the damage of about 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz plant, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of Iranian centrifuges and delaying Iran's uranium enrichment program, in addition to the accidental spread of the Shocknet virus around the globe, which infected more than 100,000 computers. In terms of its impact, its nature has reached the seriousness of a criminal case. As Judge Higgins of the International Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER Court of Justice pointed out in his independent opinion in the Oil Platforms case, the more serious the allegations, the greater the degree of credibility of the evidence required.⁴ Therefore, in a case such as the Shocknet virus, which has already reached the standard of a criminal case, proof of the wrongfulness and attributability of the acts of the United States and Israel in the case will need to reach the level of beyond reasonable doubt.\nAs generative AI becomes widespread, the costs of creating and spreading viral false information, along with cross-border data storage, transfer, and processing expenses, are plummeting so that the frequency of cyber attacks is also on the rise. It is clearly unreasonable to apply the standards of cybercrime to all cyberattacks. A more rational approach would be to lower the burden of proof for cyberattacks that cause less damage and do not constitute a criminal case, similar to some of the standards of proof in civil litigation. But in any case, for the standard of proof of cyberwarfare is inappropriate to adopt the standard of prima facie evidence,\"prima facie evidence\"refers to\"sufficient to establish a fact or to establish a presumption, unless it is effectively rebutted\"evidence. A prima facie case can only mean that there is a possibility that the fact occurred, but it is not very convincing.\nMoreover, the application of that criterion to the determination of state responsibility would undoubtedly lead to a series of problems and increase the cost of dealing with cases because of its weak persuasiveness. For example, if a State was found to have committed a wrongful act merely because there was a possibility that it had done so, not only was there no basis in jurisprudence, but it would also be difficult for the international community to accept an assessment based on simple values. Additionally, the principle that the higher the gravity of the act, the higher the standard of proof is consistently reflected in academic discussions of international law, particularly concerning the International Court of Justice. If a state is found to be liable for the high cost of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, it need only meet such a simple standard of proof, which clearly violates this principle.\n## 3.3 Normative boundaries of the deterrent factors of responsibility The wrongfulness of an act is one of the elements of the law of state responsibility, and the absence of wrongfulness does not entail the responsibility of the state, a situation that can also be referred to as a cause of impediment to state responsibility, with an emphasis on the analysis of two cases: self-defense and countermeasures.\n⁴ Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.S.), I.C.J. Judgment of 6 November 2003, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, para.33.\nDE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare Moreover, the International Court of Justice, in the Nicaragua case, held that all attacks of force belonged to the use of force, but not all uses of force constituted an attack of force, and that only those that were the most serious and had a significant scale and consequences could constitute an “armed attack”. According to the relevant judgment, there is a difference in intensity between the two. The significance of this distinction should also be reflected in cyberattacks. If a cyber-attack by a State only constitutes a use of force under Article 2(4) but does not constitute an armed attack under Article 51, it is certainly a serious internationally wrongful act in breach of an obligation under international law of jus cogens, but the injured State can only take non-forceful “countermeasures” as provided for in the Draft Articles. Once such measures are found to constitute an armed attack, the injured State may invoke Article 51 to legitimately exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defense, including the use of force.\nCountermeasures in international law are non-forcible measures taken by an injured State against a State responsible for committing an internationally wrongful act to induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations, with the intention of restoring reciprocity between the parties. Accordingly, countermeasures do not normally involve the use of force. They are lawful, provided that they meet the conditions set out in Part Three of the Draft Articles.5 Countermeasures are generally used in cases where the use of force does not rise to the level of an armed attack and, by analogy, in the field of cyberwarfare in cases where the level of the attack is not overly aggressive. Cases such as the SolarWinds supply chain attack and the Stuxnet virus attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities have reached the level of an armed attack in terms of both the means used and the damage Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER caused, and the right of self-defense can be triggered, no longer at the level of countermeasures.\nTraditional remedies such as compensation and restitution take some time to realize, and if one is only passively waiting for remedies there is a risk of further expanding losses, so as more timely remedies, both self-defense and countermeasures are necessary to avoid the expansion of losses to the maximum extent possible before traditional remedies can be obtained. Neither the right of self-defense nor the exercise of countermeasures is without limits. Customary law also limits the exercise of the right of self-defense, and the use of force in self-defense remains wrongful if it is accompanied by a violation of international humanitarian law or human rights since special provisions of international humanitarian law (such as the prohibition on retaliatory measures against civilians or prisoners of war) and certain human rights are non-derogable in all circumstances.\nSimilarly, the scope of countermeasures is limited, as draft article 50, Paragraph 1, provides that countermeasures shall not affect: (a) the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; (b) obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; (c) obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; (d) other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. In addition, Article 50, Paragraph 2, makes it clear that a State taking countermeasures is not relieved from fulfilling its obligations: (a) under any dispute settlement procedure applicable between it and the responsible State; (b) to respect the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents, premises, archives, and documents.\n## 3.4 The practical significance of the realization mechanism of state responsibility The state responsibility system is not only a rule implementation tool but also a carrier of the international community's value consensus. On this basis, once the state responsibility is recognized, it is necessary to fulfill the corresponding reality of the obligation. Attribution is not the ultimate goal; using attribution to further solve the problem is the significance of the state responsibility recognition. Under the background of cyber war, the significance of the reality is still worth paying attention to. State responsibility is assumed in various ways; here, we focus on analyzing the two main ways of restitution and compensation.\n ICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep. (1996) 226, para.41.\nFirst of all, we analyze restitution, as the content of the remedy system with the largest scope of remedies, because it can directly eliminate the consequences of wrongdoing, Article 35 of the Draft Articles lists Restitution as a priority remedy. The conditions for the application of restitution included the principles of physical possibility and proportionality, which also required that restitution should not impose a “disproportionate burden” on the responsible State, such as requiring a poor State to bear a large share of the cost of restoration, which was clearly impractical and might be exempted. While the elimination of wrongful consequences is well conceived, and in practice it has been implemented to a certain extent, resulting in more effective State responsibility, restitution also faces contemporary challenges, such as the creation of irreversible damage. While it is naturally clear that nuclear contamination, species extinction, and the like cannot be truly restored in the traditional sense, it is also possible to cause irreversible damage in the context of cyberattacks.\nTake the SolarWinds supply chain attack as an example, the Russian intelligence service hijacked the U.S. SolarWinds software update by implanting malicious code to infiltrate the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and nine other federal agencies and hundreds of enterprises. This case not only resulted in the long-term exposure of intelligence networks and the leakage of sensitive data but also called into question the credibility of global IT supply chain security standards and led to a shift to “zero-trust” architectures and a sharp increase in the cost of international cooperation. While the technical damage can be remedied through compensation, the erosion of democracy is likely to be irreversible, as the cyber-attack has largely eroded public trust in the government's cybersecurity capabilities, which will be difficult to rebuild in a short period, and difficult to fully restore through restitution. Therefore, although restitution can theoretically maximize the compensation for the damage caused, it is obvious that it cannot be fully compensated in practice, and other remedies are needed to supplement it.\nSecondly, as one of the mainstream remedies, Article 31 of the Draft Articles establishes the obligation of the responsible State to provide “full reparation” for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act, which covers both material and moral damages, reflecting the purpose of the elimination of all the consequences of the injury. The principle of the Chorzów Factory case of the Permanent Court of International Justice, of 1928, also provides evidence of this: it establishes that reparation is required to restore the injured State to the “state it would have been in had the wrongful act not been committed”. Further analysis of the types of reparation and the scope of application reveals that reparation can be very broad, ranging from material to moral damages, from direct, quantifiable property damage to indirect, reasonably foreseeable, consequential damages, such as loss of profits due to interruption of trade. Indirect damages, however, often require stricter proof of causation, and the calculation of compensation was controversial at the current stage. In any case, as the mainstream way of assuming state responsibility, the existence of compensation is also of practical significance to the realization of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, which requires less time cost and can more efficiently compensate for the interests of the victimized state than the institutional correction and other methods.\n## Core dilemmas in the determination of state responsibility The determination of state responsibility is of great significance, and can lead to real consequences such as restitution and compensation, but in the context of cyberwar, the core problems of the determination of state responsibility need to be paid attention to, mainly including the normative transformation obstacles of the technical attribution, the paradigm conflict of the application of the right of self-defense, and the systemic failure of the mechanism of responsibility assumption. Failure to analyze these dilemmas and propose solutions will make it difficult to trigger the consequences of state responsibility, which will not be conducive to the resolution of international disputes.\n### Normative transformation barriers to technical attribution The MITRE ATT&CK framework, a widely adopted knowledge base of attack behaviors in the current cybersecurity field, can provide technical references for cyber-attack traceability by standardizing the description of attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures. However, the transformation of its technical references to legal evidence is facing difficulties.\nPrimarily, the paradigm conflict between technical logic and legal logic hinders the transformation of technical indicators into legal evidence to a certain extent. ATT&CK framework is based on the identification of attack behavioral patterns, such as the “credential dump + lateral movement” mode of APT29, attackers often use the system's functions and tools to operate by modifying the system configuration or using legitimate tools and other methods to move laterally, ATT&CK framework for the identification of the attack behavior pattern to derive technical indicators. However, according to Article 8 of the Draft Articles: The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact, acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. It can be seen that a finding of State responsibility under international law requires proof of “effective control” of the attacking act in relation to the will of the State. For example, in the 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack, attackers injected malicious code called “Sunburst” into SolarWinds' flagship Orion software, even though security firms identified SUNBURST's TTPs through ATT&CK, such as T1059.001 command line interface abuse, but these technical characteristics can not directly prove that the Russian intelligence services of the main responsibility, the United States cited the ATT&CK report accusing Russia, but the international community in general to the “lack of direct chain of evidence” to question its legal effectiveness. In this case, even if it is recognized that there is indeed an attack, due to the inability to prove that the behavior is directed or controlled by a country, it is also difficult to use the technical indicators as evidence in the legal sense.\nSubsequently, the existence of intermediate nodes easily leads to a broken chain of evidence. Attackers commonly adopt the anonymizing technical architecture of “springboard server + virtual private network (VPN)”. Taking the 2016 Bangladesh central bank theft case as an example, although the C2 server IP of the SWIFT transaction instructions was traced to the Philippines, further investigation showed that the server was a puppet host controlled by the North Korean Lazarus group. This kind of multi-layer hopping leads to greater difficulty in technical traceability, and the result of traceability may also cause a break in the chain of evidence.\nAnother example is the attack on targets in China by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) through the QUANTUM attack platform, in which a number of modules are involved in concealing the identity of the attack, including QUANTUMBOT Module -- through the hijacking of the botnet command and control of network traffic, manipulating the botnet to launch attack activities and to hide the traces of the U.S. National Security Agency's hacking attacks.; QUANTUMBISCUIT Module -- builds a proxy springboard for quantum injection attacks against an attack target to prevent the attack from being detected retroactively; QUANTUMPHANTOM Module -- provides the technical ability to utilize network link intermediate node hijacking technology to achieve the hiding of the source of the attack, preventing the U.S. National Security Agency's cyberattacks against other countries from being traced back. The use of multiple anonymization techniques undoubtedly creates a great obstacle to traceability work. Even if the source of the attack can be located accurately in the end, the identity of the operating subject behind the attack still needs to be further identified, and the attacker can be disguised as other countries/organizations or fake IP addresses, etc. to confuse the traceability. The existence of intermediate nodes also makes it difficult to form a chain of evidence. The objective existence of obvious cyber attacks due to problems in the chain of evidence may not be able to carry out a trial in the end and even more accurately determine the responsibility of the state and solve the problem.\nIn addition, the “falsifiability” of technical indicators also weakens their probative value in practice. An important manifestation of this is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). It is widely recognized as the most sophisticated and powerful category of security threats. APTs are engineered by resourced, disciplined threat actors capable of sustained operations through systematic technology exploitation, blending expertise, funding, and structured coordination to maintain persistence. APT organizations often falsify attack signatures through False Flag operations. The identification of false flags is inherently complex, primarily because attackers systematically conceal their actions while simultaneously framing innocent entities for malicious conduct. Conducting a false flag operation in the cyber realm is fundamentally distinct and far simpler compared to its execution in the physical domain. For example, in the 2017 NotPetya ransomware incident, ATT&CK-based T1486 disk encryption analysis initially pointed to North Korea, but subsequent code homology analysis revealed a link to the Russian Sandworm organization. This type of technological misdirection makes the judicial application of the ATT&CK framework a “reasonable suspicion” challenge. As counterfeiting technologies evolve, the ATT&CK framework should also evolve with the times and develop more accurate techniques for identifying forgeries, or else the credibility of the technical indicators it produces may be further diminished in the face of the difficulty of transferring technical indicators to legal evidence.\n### Paradigm conflicts in the application of the right of self-defense Even in the face of cyberattacks, the exercise of the right of self-defense and countermeasures is not unlimited and still needs to comply with certain requirements, so it is still necessary to make a clearer discussion on the boundaries of the legality of the use of the right of self-defense and countermeasures in cyberwarfare.\nAs mentioned in the previous article, as to the question of whether cyber warfare constitutes the use of force under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, the “scale and consequence theory” proposed by Prof. Michael Schmit has the highest degree of acceptance at present. As long as the analysis is conducted according to the multiple indicators of scale and consequence, and the cyber-attack is considered to be a case of the use of force, then countermeasures or even the exercise of the right to self-defense can be taken. The most controversial issue at present is that the right to determine the use of force is in the hands of more developed countries, and the seemingly objective judgment criteria are to some extent mixed with subjective factors.\nAs is widely known, the Tallinn Manual edited by Prof. Michael Schmit, as a more authoritative and important reference document for the study of cyber warfare, has seven of the eight assessment criteria for determining whether the use of force constitutes a use of force, which are completely consistent with the criteria advocated by Prof. Michael Schmit himself. The criteria are somewhat arbitrary and subjective. For example, Professor Schmit himself, when applying these factors to analyze the 2007 cyberattack against Estonia, concluded that the attack constituted a use of force. Other scholars, however, have argued that the opposite conclusion that the cyberattack did not constitute a use of force can easily be reached by relying on these same factors, which can be easily manipulated in their application to reach conclusions that benefit the geostrategic objectives of the country being analyzed.\nMoreover, when applied to cyberattacks, the “scale and consequence” standard has a fatal logical flaw: a given consequence of the same scale and severity can be produced by the use of force as well as by non-forceful means. The loss of life and the destruction of forests and land in a downstream country as a result of the discharge of toxic substances into a river by an upstream country or the starvation and economic turmoil of a country as a result of economic sanctions imposed by one country on another, are in themselves highly analogous to those that would normally result from the use of force. However, in general perception, these acts hardly constitute a use of force in international law or even an internationally wrongful act. In this way, such acts can escape legal sanction even if they have consequences comparable to those of the use of force. Cyberattacks, however, may be recognized as a use of force and subject to liability if they have the same legal consequences. This logical loophole exists partly because of the arbitrariness and subjectivity of the judgment standard. Western scholars with stronger discursive power often lower the threshold for the use of the right to self-defense through an expansive interpretation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, and in this regard, seemingly reasonable standards can often be interpreted to achieve political goals.\nIn addition to lowering the threshold of the right to self-defense through acts of interpretation, the United States has also put forward the “Defend Forward” strategy, which is an offensive defense strategy it has put forward in recent years in the field of cyberspace security, aiming to respond to cyber threats using proactive strikes and pre-emptive strikes. The United States Cyber Command has emphasized the need to adopt a “forward posture” in cyberspace by accessing non-Department of Defense networks or systems to weaken an adversary's cyber capabilities in advance and prevent it from taking action. Such an assertion should be relegated to the academic category of preventive self-defense, which is advocated by a few Western countries and Western scholars, but is not and should not be supported in existing international treaties and customary international law -- it means “granting the major powers an almost unrestricted license to use force”. In summary, the definition of cyberwarfare and the various criteria for judging it, as well as the proposal of strategies such as “forward defense,” are undoubtedly suspected of serving political goals. Professor O'Connell also believes that “cyberwarfare” is a “wrong war”. It is essentially an “invented” problem in the context of the increasing militarization of cybersecurity policies of major Western countries.\n### Systemic failure of responsibility mechanisms The decentralized nature of cyberspace forms a structural contradiction with the “state-centered” responsibility framework of traditional international law, resulting in an imbalance in the distribution of responsibility between states and non-state actors, rigid rules of evidence, and a lack of enforcement mechanisms.\nFirst, the traditional logic of attribution has loopholes that need to be filled in the context of cyberspace, and the traditional theoretical criterion of “effective control” has limitations. This criterion originated from the 1986 case of Nicaragua v. United States, in which the ICJ made it clear that to attribute the conduct of non-state actors to a state (the United States), it is necessary to prove that the state exercised “effective control” over the specific military operation. Not only does the state provide general support such as funding, weapons, or training, but it also needs to have actual command over the specific unlawful action, i.e. the state needs to directly direct or specifically instruct the attack. However, the “outsourcing of tools” in cyberattacks has led to a high degree of invisibility of the state-attacker nexus. For example, in the case of the Iranian APT34 attack on Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in 2021, although the technical traceability showed that the attack tools were linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, it was not possible to prove that their actions were “specifically directed” by the state. In the context of cyberwarfare, “effective control” has the risk of being too rigid, leading to the impossibility of attribution, and the choice of whether to include other judgment criteria in such cases has been widely discussed, among which the theory of “overall control” is of particular research value.\nThe theory of “Overall Control” originated from the judgment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the case of Prosecutor v. Tadić. The Tribunal held that the conduct of a state can be attributed DE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare In the context of cyberwarfare, the anonymity of cyberattacks, technology dependence, and the ambiguity of actors make the traditional standard of attribution challenging, and the “overall control” theory has potential advantages in some respects. The criterion is superior in terms of identification in response to the prevalence of indirect support models. States often support cyberattacks through technological enablement, infrastructure harboring, or strategic guidance. Such behavior is more consistent with the “strategic dominance” characteristic of “overall control” than with the “specific instruction” requirement of “effective control”. For example, Russia’s relationship with APT28 is alleged to be in line with “overall control” in that the Russians provide technical resources but do not directly direct specific attacks, and the international community generally believes that the organization is supported by the Russian government and that the motivation for its attacks is closely related to Russia’s national interests.\nAccording to “overall control”, it is possible to hold Russia responsible, but according to the traditional “effective control” standard, it is difficult to hold it accountable. In addition, while the technical traceability of cyberattacks often only proves a continuing connection between the attacker and the state, and it is difficult to obtain evidence of direct orders, the “overall control” standard eliminates the need to prove a control relationship between the state and the attacker, and allows for a more efficient allocation of responsibility. Although the “overall control” standard has its role in the context of cyberwarfare, it is still difficult to accept it as the standard for attribution of responsibility in the current mainstream view, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia Serbia and Montenegro, the ICJ explicitly rejected the standard of “overall control” and insisted on the strict interpretation of “effective control”,[9] which can provide a reference basis for the attribution of responsibility for cyber warfare. Moreover, there is a risk of political abuse if a more lenient standard is adopted, as when the U.S. sanctioned a Chinese technology company based on “overall control” in the absence of publicly available technical evidence to support it. While this standard is not appropriate in all cases, it is clear that the traditional standard is not fully applicable, and the international community [9] Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, General List No. 91.\nshould continue to explore new, more reasonable standards in practice to address the limitations of the traditional standard.\nSecondly, the traditional attribution criterion is also difficult in practice. The system of attribution of responsibility for non-state actors is not perfect, which leads to the failure of the mechanism for assuming responsibility to play a full role, potentially allowing non-state actors to avoid legal penalties, especially transnational science and technology enterprises to circumvent the responsibility of the behavior at this stage has not been effectively resolved. For example, Zero-Day Vulnerability, as a security flaw that has not yet been discovered or fixed by software vendors, has a unique “gray area” in the trading market due to the ambiguity of its participants, uses, and legal attributes. There are cases where private vulnerability brokers sell zero-day vulnerabilities to governments, but international law does not clarify whether such transactions constitute “assisting in the commission of cyber-attacks”. In terms of the actual situation at this stage, international legislation is undoubtedly lagging behind, and existing cybercrime conventions have not yet explicitly stipulated specific provisions directly targeting “vulnerability trading”.\nIn addition, the EU's “Network Resilience Act” only requires vendors to establish a vulnerability handling process, does not regulate third-party transactions. In China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Internet Information Office, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly issued the “Provisions on the Management of Security Vulnerabilities in Network Products”, which clearly states that no organization or individual shall illegally collect, sell or distribute information on security vulnerabilities in network products, but the standard of “illegality” lacks specific interpretation, and loopholes exist in the determination of “illegality”. The U.S. “Vulnerability Equity Program” is not binding, vendors can refuse to cooperate. It can be seen that the existing law for the actors did not make comprehensive provisions, so the use of zero-day vulnerabilities in cyber attacks on multinational technology enterprises has the possibility of circumventing legal responsibility, liability mechanism due to the lack of comprehensiveness, but also may be further dysfunctional.\n## Reconstructing the path of state responsibility in cyber warfare Under the increasingly complex background of cyber warfare, it is of great practical significance to find a more reasonable path of state responsibility. On the one hand, further improvement of the traditional attribution mechanism can enhance the persuasive power of the attribution; on the other hand, through the innovation of judicial procedures, the realization of state responsibility can be further refined to avoid the emergence of unreasonable responsibility which is too light or too heavy. State responsibility in cyberwarfare has room for improvement in both judgment standard and realization, and if it can be adjusted under the common recognition of the international community, it can to a certain extent avoid subjective factors affecting the judgment and assumption of state responsibility.\n### Improving the attribution mechanism One of the important reasons why the attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyber warfare has a certain subjective element is that there is no universally recognized technical attribution mechanism, which to a certain extent has led to the divergence of attribution standards among countries for cyber warfare. Although there is more authoritative literature such as the Tallinn Manual for reference, the nature of international law is, after all, soft law. While States can use soft law to solve the problem of coordinated gaming, international law is not as binding as it could be if a State's political aspirations need to be realized urgently. In addition, if some countries do not sign an international treaty on cybersecurity, and the content of the treaty has not developed into a custom, a considerable number of countries can claim that they do not carry out activities in the cyber field in accordance with the rules in the treaty. Moreover, even for those countries that have signed such treaties, the cost of withdrawing from them is not high. Finally, although relevant documents are constantly being issued, how to deal with conflicts between them is a subjective process. From this point of view, the mere formulation of international law on cybersecurity is relatively limited in enhancing the rationality of attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nIn this context, promoting the international community to establish a technical attribution institution can be a better choice. First of all, compared with soft law, the institution established under the wide recognition of the international community is more persuasive and can avoid to a greater extent the situation that countries choose the judgment standard of state responsibility based on their own political opinions. Secondly, the establishment of a technical attribution body can help promote policy coordination and resource sharing among countries in the field of cybersecurity. Through multilateral cooperation, countries can fully express their demands, formulate unified international legal standards to deal with transnational cyber threats under the principle of pursuing the greatest common interests, conduct in-depth discussions on reasonable motions to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the attribution standards and reduce the troubles caused by the differences in the laws of different countries.\nFurthermore, technical attribution organizations can establish an information-sharing platform to share the latest information on cyberattacks and technological advances promptly, and such an information-sharing mechanism can improve the ability of countries to respond to cyber threats. For example, the Enhanced Attribution (EA) program initiated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is very informative. The goal of the EA program is to develop techniques to generate operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent and independent malicious cyber campaigns and to create a methodology by which this information can be shared with multiple parties without jeopardizing the intelligence sources and methodologies. By collecting, monitoring, and understanding adversary cyberattack operations in the red space, the program is expected to be divided into three technical areas (TAs) that will work in parallel with each other. They will span three 18-month phases, after which the agency will step in to obtain high-quality results. This activity will undoubtedly empower the attribution criteria with more precise technology, which is expected to target the subjects of wrongdoing with greater precision. Such meaningful criteria, if adopted by technical attribution agencies, would certainly contribute to the standardization of technical attribution.\nBased on the establishment of technical attribution institutions and the development of technical attribution criteria, the criterion of “effective control” in the traditional attribution criteria needs to be expanded. The obstacle to the normative transformation of technical attribution mentioned earlier is largely due to the rigid application of the criterion of “effective control”. In light of the complexity of cyberwarfare models, the concept of “material support” should be introduced, so that if a State systematically provides vulnerabilities, infrastructure, or funding to non-State actors that cause the same level of consequences as a direct direct order, it will be held liable even if there is no direct order. Although this approach has not become a common practice in the international community, the continued rigid application of the traditional criterion of proving a directive relationship will undoubtedly allow certain subjects to avoid the risk of assuming State responsibility, which is difficult to accept in terms of jurisprudence. Therefore, based on the principle of the “effective control” criterion, consideration should be given to the use of “substantial support” to make judgments when the act of support has a significant impact and is directly related to the acts or purposes of the supported party, thus constituting substantial support. The adoption of such a criterion is not only legally sound but also creates conditions for the application of technical attribution to a greater extent. The adoption of the “substantial support” criterion for attribution when the support provided by a State can be traced back to that State by technical means and it can be established that the State providing the assistance constitutes substantial support can avoid the rigid application of the traditional criterion, which would jeopardize the results obtained through technical tracing.\n### Adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism The establishment of an international attribution agency is certainly of great significance to the determination of state responsibility, but it only involves the work of attribution, and if we want to comprehensively reconstruct the responsibility of the state in cyberwarfare, it must be built on the basis of a broad consensus among all countries, and the blueprint for the establishment of an international attribution agency as mentioned in the previous section is also built on the basis of the consensus of all countries. Therefore, the consensus of all countries is a fundamental condition. It is obviously unrealistic for the international community to reach consensus in the short term, because the more vulnerable countries may consider that the adjustment of rules has nothing to do with them. In this case, the big countries are more important to play a pioneering role and set an example through concrete actions. The adjustment of the multilateral cooperation mechanism is conducive to the rationalization of the judgment of national responsibility in cyber warfare, and is also conducive to the regulation of the cyber offensive behavior of individual countries, so that all countries in the international community can benefit from it. The specific cooperation mechanism can be adjusted as follows: Foremost, regional confidence-building measures should be further developed. The most important is the establishment of a cyberspace “hotline mechanism”, which can reduce the information gap through effective communication and avoid the emergence of unnecessary cyberattacks. As early as during the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, this “hotline mechanism” demonstrated its important value. During the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, both sides in the nuclear arms race and military confrontation realized that the lack of direct communication channels could lead to miscalculation and escalation of the conflict. In 1963, the U.S. and the Soviet Union established the “hotline mechanism”, which allowed leaders to communicate quickly, directly, and privately in emergency situations, thereby eliminating the risk of nuclear war resulting from communication delays or misunderstandings of each other's actions. To this day, this mechanism is used as an important tool. In 2022, during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the U.S. and Russia established a military hotline to avoid miscalculations and military accidents. The “hotline mechanism” has gone a long way in avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings and remains indispensable in the context of cyberwarfare. 2020s attack on India's power grid could be a case in point. on October 12, 2020, Mumbai, India, experienced a massive blackout that affected critical infrastructure, including stock exchanges and healthcare facilities. The New York Times reported that the blackout may have been linked to China, claiming that “Chinese malware hacked into India's power supply control system” in order to pressure India in the India-China border standoff. Although this claim was later clarified by Recorded Future, a cybersecurity company mentioned in the report, and officially denied by Indian officials, it still caused a certain degree of damage to China's image, and if the “hotline mechanism” had been adopted at that time, it could have avoided the misleading public opinion and the waste of investigation resources. This shows that China, the United States, Russia and other countries have taken the lead in setting up real-time communication channels, clarifying in a timely manner in the event of miscalculation, and reducing unnecessary costs and expenditures, which is still necessary in the context of cyber warfare.\nConcomitantly, adjusting the public-private partnership. In the context of cyberwarfare, cooperation between countries is certainly important, but operators often also have a large amount of relevant information. To further reduce the cost of controlling the occurrence of cyberwarfare, it is indispensable for operators and governments to jointly build a threat intelligence-sharing platform. Adopting this model not only facilitates research between countries based on a large number of cases provided by operators to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the cases, but also reduces the effort of searching for cyberattacks from all over the world, saves time and cost, and efficiently builds identification and defense measures. This model has been reflected in the JCDC model in the U.S. JCDC participants that include organizations and operators from both the public and private sectors, covering service providers, infrastructure operators, cybersecurity companies, and companies in the critical infrastructure industry.\nIn addition, JCDC constituents include specific government agencies designated by Congress, such as the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It is through the operator-government co-built threat intelligence-sharing platform that the JCDC shares real-time information through multiple platforms, such as Slack, the Homeland Security Information Network HSIN, and the GovDelivery service, to ensure that there is continuous dialog and collaboration among the participants. This also sets the stage for the development of proactive cyber defense programs to mitigate the most serious risks before threats become visible. Moreover, “gatekeeper liability” for technology companies can be introduced, as Article 6 of The EU's Digital Services Act indicates that “where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, the service provider shall not be liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that the provider”. By analyzing the exemption from liability of the hosting service provider of the online platform and the relevant conditions, it can be seen that the online platform should have a certain degree of responsibility for reviewing the information provided by the service recipient. For content that is clearly of a cyber-attack nature, the provider of the online service should exercise a certain degree of scrutiny, in particular, cloud computing giants are required to filter malicious traffic, or else they may be considered to bear the corresponding joint and several liability.\nFinally, a “digital ceasefire zone” system could be included in the scope of discussion. Healthcare, energy and other livelihood areas are of great importance, and if they are subjected to cyberattacks, they will often lead to more serious consequences, and should be categorized as no-attack zones, so that if certain countries carry out non-compliant cyberattacks, violators will be automatically triggered by the United Nations to sanction them. According to the context that cyber-peacekeeping has been suggested as a strategic framework to address the multifaceted challenges posed by diverse manifestations of cyber conflict, in order to support the implementation of the system, we can also consider the establishment of a “network peacekeeping force”, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to send technical teams to assist in the restoration of network services in conflict areas. The reason why it should be coordinated by the ITU is that, under its supervision, the technical teams will be able to use more reasonable means to respond to cyber attacks. Shortly after the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, controversy erupted over the way Ukraine set up the International Volunteer Team for Cyber Defense to carry out cyberattacks against Russian targets, and its development of tools, which allows any digital device to become part of a DDoS attack network, was deemed to be a violation of international cyber norms. The existence of a unified body for coordination would make it possible to bring the corresponding tools into line with the principle of proportionality.\n### Innovations in judicial procedures In addition to further clarifying the criteria for attribution of state responsibility and minimizing the frequency of cyberwar through multilateral cooperation mechanisms, there is also a need for innovation in the judicial process, because most cyberwars are ultimately handled through the judicial process, and therefore adopting a more feasible judicial process is conducive to a more reasonable distribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nFirstly, the International Court of Justice could create a panel of judges specialized in cyberspace cases, allowing for the submission of electronic evidence and anonymous witnesses. There is a precedent for such a special chamber, namely the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which is a special judicial procedure set up within the ITLOS to hear disputes between States arising from the exploration and exploitation of the international seabed area. In response to the increasingly complex cyberwarfare, which should be handled more rigorously, and the identification and allocation of State responsibility should be more reasonable, the traditional team of judges may not be able to make accurate judgments when faced with the special field of cyber. The idea that selecting judges with relevant backgrounds enhances efficiency is supported by academic research, which suggests that a judge's prior experience and characteristics can influence their decision-making. At this time, the selection of judges with cyber background to form a team specializing in cyberspace cases is conducive to more efficiently identifying the nature of cyberattacks and, with the help of increasingly developed technological means, more reasonably allocating state responsibility on the basis of technical indicators.\nMeanwhile, through the leading role of the International Court of Justice, countries can also select judges with expertise in international law, cyber technology, data protection, and other fields through a special selection mechanism to form domestic teams specialized in handling cyber cases. From this, we can see that such a move can not only further solve the problem of cyber warfare among countries but also serve as an inspiration for the handling of cyber cases within countries. The team of judges can cooperate with other international organizations (such as Interpol and the United Nations Office on Cybercrime) to analyze the ever-emerging new forms and the constantly updating and iterative advanced technologies in order to formulate more reasonable judgment standards and solution measures, so as to jointly address the global challenges in cyberspace.\nIn addition, consideration could be given to legitimizing “preventive countermeasures” by allowing for pre-emptive defences against highly probable cyberattacks under the authority of the Security Council. Referring to Article 50 of the UN Charter on temporary measures against economic sanctions, UN Member States, in their actions for the maintenance of international peace and security, should refrain from any action that might widen a dispute or aggravate a situation. And the UN Security Council is tasked with resolving international disputes and can establish frameworks for peaceful settlements, aligning with Article 1 of the UN Charter so that Member States should take appropriate steps to prevent the extension or aggravation of the dispute in accordance with the recommendations of the UNSC. It was mentioned earlier that countermeasures must be a means to be taken only if there is a realistic attack. However, in the context of cyberwarfare, it is often too late to take countermeasures if one has to wait until there is an attack. Due to the intensity and scope of cyberattacks, a country's cyber system may not be able to function after an attack, let alone take defensive measures. Under such circumstances, it is particularly important to formulate “preventive countermeasures” with reference to Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations. This kind of prevention cannot be advanced indefinitely and should be judged according to the recommendations of the UN Security Council. However, the international community needs to discuss in depth what kind of preventive measures should be taken in order to arrive at a standard. In any case, even if this kind of advance measure is recognized, it still needs to be regulated by the corresponding standards, or else powerful countries can launch disproportionate “preventive countermeasures” against less dangerous cyberattacks in pursuit of their own national political demands, which is contrary to the original purpose of the measure.\nWhile considering innovations in the judicial process, there is also a need for flexibility in the use of various methods to solve the problems that arise in the process, such as the use of legal discourse. In addressing the dual imperatives of legislative innovation and jurisprudential reconceptualization, legal discourse analysis as a vital interdisciplinary instrument, offers multidimensional frameworks to decode evolving normative constructs within contemporary governance systems. The degree of formality in legal language mirrors the solemn nature of judicial proceedings, whereas the presence or absence of polite expressions can signal deference, confrontational intent, or calculated positioning. These deliberate language patterns fundamentally shape both the courtroom environment and participants' interpretations of interactions, ultimately guiding behavioral responses throughout legal exchanges (Mısır and Akın 2024). In addition, the refinement of legal discourse patterning can be enhanced by studying a large number of cases in the European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union issues its rulings in 23 legally binding linguistic versions, reflecting the mandate established under Article 217 of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. This foundational provision, originally enacted as the European Council's inaugural legislative instrument, constitutionally guarantees that every member state's national language maintains equal juridical standing as an official working language of the Union. Based on the breadth of these cases, summarizing them will undoubtedly be beneficial for a more accurate use of legal language.\nUltimately, in the process of optimization, the participation of artificial intelligence is an irreversible trend, and the various advantages of artificial intelligence can undoubtedly improve efficiency, but the existence of hidden loopholes in various aspects of technology, ethics and other aspects also need to be paid attention to. Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transnational challenge demanding coordinated governance architectures, necessitating the establishment of multilateral regulatory systems capable of ensuring operational synergy, policy harmonization, and adaptive scalability across jurisdictions. And transitioning to centralized regulatory frameworks proves indispensable for steering generative AI development along ethically aligned trajectories. To effectively address existential risks in artificial intelligence development, institutionalizing ethical guardrails through a “Digital Humanism” framework becomes imperative. This paradigm prioritizes human-centric imperatives by safeguarding species-wide wellbeing and systemic security, while strategically decoupling technological advancement from zero-sum competition. Such an approach ensures that technological evolution maintains symbiotic alignment with civilizational priorities. Today sanctions and anti-sanctions have evolved into a dominant strategic pattern within contemporary geopolitical interactions, which makes it all the more important that more rational judicial procedures be used to mitigate the growing conflict.\n## Conclusions The accelerated militarization of cyberspace has plunged the state responsibility system into a “triple normative dilemma”: first, the transformation of technical evidence into legal facts has led to the failure of the attribution mechanism; second, the hermeneutical controversy over the boundaries of the right to self-defense has triggered a crisis of the legitimacy of the countermeasures; and third, the vacuum in the allocation of responsibility due to the involvement of non-State actors has resulted in the systematic failure of the enforcement mechanism. These structural impediments not only undermine the deterrent effect of international law, but also contribute to the “low-cost-high-benefit” nature of cyberwarfare, which continues to induce opportunistic tactics by state actors.\nWhile existing governance frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0's “principle of equivalence of effects” and the Convention on Cybercrime's territoriality provision provide guidance on rules at the local level, they are not able to cope with complex cyberconflicts due to institutional fragmentation and technological adaptability deficiencies. For example, the Tallinn Manual's 2.0 Rule 69's eight-dimensional assessment model of the threshold for the use of force faces an attenuation of its explanatory power when dealing with generative AI-driven cognitive warfare; and the Budapest Convention's Mutual Legal Assistance Mechanism is in an implementation dilemma due to the anonymity of cryptocurrencies.\nTo solve the above dilemmas, it is urgent to build a three-in-one path of “technical verification, rule iteration, and mechanism synergy” to reconfigure the responsibility: (1) technical empowerment of attribution mechanism: building a verifiable attribution system, and realizing the transformation of MITRE ATT&CK framework into a judicial system; (2) adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism, building regional confidence measures, strengthening public-private partnership, and strengthening the DE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare This reconstruction path has dual normative value: at the level of substantive law, through the legalization of preventive responsibility and due diligence, the “risk spillover” behavior of the state in cyberspace is curbed; at the level of procedural law, with the help of technology-neutral third-party evidence collection mechanism, the cognitive gap between technological logic and judicial review can be bridged. Only by realizing the in-depth mutual embedding of technical governance and international law can the “tragedy of the commons” effect of cyberwar be suppressed, and the paradigm shift of the community of destiny in cyberspace from conceptual advocacy to institutional practice be promoted.\n**Research funding:** This work was supported by the project of National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 24BYY151) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhejiang University.",

Due to the ambiguity of the object of regulation, the defect of attribution mechanism, and the lack of clarity of the constituent elements of responsibility, the existing international law framework has caused the state responsibility system in cyberspace to fall into the dilemma of normative failure. This paper takes the theory of international law subjectivity as the logical starting point and systematically deconstructs the normative attributes of cyberwar and the path of responsibility determination. This paper shows that the constitutive elements of state responsibility need to break through the rigid standard of traditional\"behavior-damage\"causality and build a dynamic attribution system combining technical verification and legal presumption. Through critical analysis of the use of force threshold doctrine, this paper, based on a comprehensive analysis of the core dilemma of the determination of state responsibility, proposes to appropriately introduce the concept of\"substantial support\", and when the traditional theory of comprehensive control fails to make effective attribution, the criterion of\"substantial support\"can be used to complete the attribution of state responsibility with the increasingly developed technological traceability means.\nKeywords: cyberwarfare; international law; state responsibility; attributability *Corresponding author: Haonan Li, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: lihaonan22402065@zju.edu.cn. https://orcid.org/0009-0005-0476-300X Le Cheng, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: chengle163@hotmail.com. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4423-8585 The militarized transformation of cyberspace has upended the cognitive architecture of the use of force under the Westphalian system. Traditional military theory faces challenges when applied to cyber conflict (Kallberg 2016). The evolution of cyberwarfare from a technological tool to a means of strategic deterrence has led to a blurring of the legal boundaries between peacetime and armed conflict. And the increasing effectiveness of cyberattacks further complicates the legal context of cyberwarfare (Gray 2024). The traditional state responsibility regime needs to be reconfigured due to a triple adaptive dilemma: first, technological anonymity triggers a break in the chain of attribution, which puts the “effective control” criterion in Article 8 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility in a difficult position to prove; second, the non-kinetic nature of cyber operations makes it difficult to quantify the threshold for the use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations; and third, the legitimacy boundary of countermeasures creates normative conflicts under the “forward defense” strategy.\nThis paper adopts a techno-legal cross-analysis approach to focus on the normative reconstruction path of state responsibility in cyber warfare. By deconstructing the dilemma of determining state responsibility at the current stage and proposing corresponding reconstruction paths, this paper attempts to discuss how the determination standard of the attribute of force in cyberwarfare can be coordinated with the “principle of equivalence of effect” of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the mode of assuming the indirect responsibility of the state in the context of the intervention of non-state actors. It is hoped that through the reconstruction of various paths, the issue of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare can be clarified as much as possible, and the diffuse damage caused by cyberwarfare can be curbed. This paper aims to provide theoretical support for the clear identification of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare and to promote the formation of a technologically empowered international law governance paradigm.\n## Deconstructing the normative attributes of cyberwarfare ### The evolution of the conceptual genealogy of cyberwarfare The generation of the normative concept of cyberwarfare has gone through the process of discourse migration from military science to jurisprudence. The concept of cyberwarfare first appeared in a research report by the RAND Corporation in 1993, which defined cyberwarfare as a military operation being implemented or prepared to be implemented according to information-related principles (John and Ronfeldt 1993). In the strategic dimension, the concept of cyberwarfare was accompanied by the completion of the ontological construction of the theory of the “Fifth Dimension”, which was recognized by Huang (2015), who argued that “the rapid development of the global Internet has been driven by the rapid advancement of information technology, and cyberspace has begun to take shape as the ‘fifth space' beyond the land, sea, airspace and outer space”. At the same time, a variety of problems and threats such as cyber-attacks and cybercrime have also arisen, and the concept of “cyber warfare” is put forward in this context. On the one hand, along with the development of science and technology, the scale of cyber warfare has reached an unprecedented level, such as the cyber attack and defense in the Russo-Georgian war, the Iranian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the Shocknet virus, the Syrian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the airstrikes, and other cases, all of which are the embodiment of the escalation of the intensity of modern cyber warfare. On the other hand, the relevant theoretical research has been optimized based on the endless cyber warfare.\nCompared with China's late start in cyberwarfare research, western countries have begun research on cyberwarfare earlier, with a larger scale and wider scope, and have also achieved rich results in the formulation of international rules in cyberspace. Since the development of relevant theories, the current mainstream scholars believe that the content of international law on jus ad bellum can be applied to cyber warfare. For example, Reese Nguyen (2013) believes that when a cyber attack is intended to cause irreversible damage or physical loss to the physical information system, it can be recognized as constituting an attack with force. The main argument in favor of this claim is based on Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, which states that “all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. There are different doctrinal understandings of how to argue that cyberwarfare is a use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, as will be presented in the next section.\n### 2.2 Doctrines of thresholds for use of force in cyberwarfare At present, mainstream scholars believe that cyberwarfare constitutes the use of force, but there are different doctrines in understanding, mainly the theory of purpose, instrumental theory, scale, and consequence theory (Huang 2015). Walter Sharp (1999), a representative of the “purpose theory”, argues that computer network attacks are a form of economic and political coercion, and although such coercion is traditionally considered not to be a “use of force”, in the light of the purpose of the Charter of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, and the territorial integrity and political independence of States guaranteed by Article 2(4), computer network attacks should also be subject to Article 2(4) since economic and political coercion would also threaten international peace and jeopardize the territorial integrity and political independence of a State, and would therefore be covered by the scope of the Article.\nMarco Roscini (2010), a representative of the “tools doctrine”, argues that the “military force” that Article 2(4) intends to regulate is mainly embodied in the use of specific weapons (or tools) and that cyber-attacks using “weapons” such as Trojan horses, worms, etc. can also constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) if they produce specific tangible or intangible damage. The most widely accepted theory is the “scale and consequences theory”, in which Professor Michael Schmitt (1999, 2011) argues that although the main purpose of Article 2(4) is to constrain a state's external use of traditional military force to coerce others, in practice what matters is not the means used but the consequences; if a cyber-attack directly causes or is likely to cause damage to persons or objects comparable to that caused by military means, it should undoubtedly constitute a “use of force”; even if it does not cause tangible damage to persons or objects, the victimized State can still determine whether a cyber-attack constitutes a “use of force” by assessing the following seven criteria: (a) severity, (b) immediacy, (c) directness, (d) invasiveness, (e) measurability of effects, (f) presumptive legality and (g) state involvement. Although there are strengths and weaknesses in each viewpoint, as far as the existing situation is analyzed, the scale and consequence theory is recognized by majority of researchers, and the proposition of Prof. Michael Schmit has had a greater impact in the Western academic community, not only in the Tallinn Manual, which is edited by him but also recognized by Western countries. It is worth mentioning that the Tallinn Manual, as a document developed with the participation of multinational subjects, contains seven out of eight assessment criteria for defining whether a cyberattack constitutes a use of force that are identical to those mentioned in the previous article, which indicates that the evaluation criteria advocated by the scale and consequences theory have their own rationality and can be generally accepted by the majority of countries.\nIt should be noted that the research on issues related to cyberwarfare in this paper is based on cases where cyberwarfare can trigger international responsibility, and cyber infringement and cybercrime activities, which are only regulated by the domestic laws of various countries as well as a small number of international treaties, obviously do not fall into the category of use of force as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations 2(4), and they also cannot trigger the responsibility of the State, and therefore do not fall within the scope of this paper's analysis.\n## Normative elements and paths to attribution of state responsibility in cyberwarfare ### Normative basis and constitutive elements of the state responsibility regime The institutional framework of state responsibility in international law is rooted in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Articles). According to Chapter I and Chapter II of the Draft Articles, the establishment of state responsibility requires the fulfillment of two normative elements: wrongfulness and attributability. In the following, the two elements will be analyzed separately.\nInitially, the analysis of wrongfulness. In Article 2 of the Draft Articles, the International Law Commission defines that “there is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law, and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.” In the context of cyberwarfare, it is clear that most cases of wrongful acts are in the form of action, as exemplified by the Russo-Georgian war: the Georgian government website was attacked, the government web server was on the verge of collapsing due to the large number of access requests it received for more than 10 h, the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was completely dysfunctional, and the website of the presidential administration was paralyzed for 24 h. As the fighting deepened, the intensity and sophistication of the cyber-attacks increased, with Russia targeting Georgia's government and news media websites as the primary targets, disabling virtually all of Georgia's government offices. Second, it is worth noting that the article does not mention that subjective fault or intent to engage in a wrongful act is required to establish state responsibility; the mere existence of a violation of the law is sufficient to give rise to international responsibility, and, by extension, state responsibility should be an objective rather than a subjective responsibility. The normative logic of this objective responsibility paradigm, which rejects the subjective fault element, is that the unlawfulness of an internationally wrongful act arises from an objective breach of an international obligation rather than from the state of mind of the acting state (Crawford 2013).\nIn addition, the article requires that the wrongful act constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state, and for a further understanding of the Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER obligation, one can refer to the definitions in Articles 12 and 13 of the Draft Articles. Article 12 provides that there is a breach of an international obligation by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. Article 13 provides that an act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs. In other words, the key feature of a breach of an international obligation is that the obligation should have been complied with, but in fact, the State in question did not take reasonable action to comply with the obligation.\nArticle 12 makes it clear that, regardless of the origin or character of the obligation, when analyzed in terms of the sources of international law, the source of the obligation is varied, and may be a customary one, or one based on a treaty, or even a legal principle generally recognized by the international community. In the Rainbow Warrior case, for example, the arbitral tribunal stated that there is no distinction in international law between contractual and tortious liability, so any breach by a State of a duty, regardless of the source of the duty, gives rise to the responsibility of the State and therefore to an obligation to make reparation.¹ This case is very strong evidence of the broadness of the source of the obligation.\nThe broadness of the source of the obligation is conducive to the regulation of cyberwarfare. First, for States parties to cyberwarfare-related treaties, such as the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, a violation of the content of the treaty can constitute a direct breach of the obligation. Second, for countries not participating in the treaty, if the relevant practice of maintaining network security has been generally recognized in the international community and can become a kind of habit, the habit can also be used as a source of obligation, and if it does not comply with the habit, it is also possible to find that a country violates the obligation, which undoubtedly enlarges the scope of the main body needing to comply with the obligation, and allows more countries to consciously comply with the obligation. What's more, the identification and formation of general principles are essential for maintaining international law as a coherent legal system (Shao 2021). Therefore, sometimes principles can also govern the behavior of States. It should be noted, however, that even if a State commits certain acts of cyberattack against another State and causes damage, if it does not constitute a breach of an international obligation, it will not give rise to the legal responsibility of the author State.\n¹ Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (New Zealand v. France) (“Rainbow Warrior”), Award of 30 April 1990, 20 UNRIAA 215, para.75.\nCorrespondingly, attributability is then analyzed. Theoretically, all acts of individuals, corporations, or other entities in the sense of domestic law may be attributed to a State (Government) based on nationality. In dealing with this issue, the Draft Articles adopt a narrow approach, namely, the “overall control test”, whereby the only conduct that can be attributed to a State is that of State organs or other entities acting under the direction, control, or instigation of a State organ, which becomes an agent of the State at the time of the conduct (Kanehara 2019). As far as the attributability of the state in cyber warfare is concerned, if a cyber attack is initiated or directed by the state as the main body, the corresponding responsibility is borne by the state. In simple cases, the attributability of state responsibility can be quickly recognized. However, since the development of cyberwarfare, identifying the source of cyber-attacks is crucial to ensuring cybersecurity (Swate et al. 2024), its technical means have become increasingly flexible, and many attribution problems are caused by anonymous attacks, and the attackers can often easily hide their identities, which has brought great challenges to the tracking of the source of the attack. Even if the source of the attack is identified, the subject needs to be further clarified. The subject of a cyberattack can avoid being targeted by hiding or forging his identity in many ways, so pinpointing the subject is also a major challenge.\nIn addition, when a country helps another country to engage in internationally wrongful acts, the former also to the extent of the support, helps to bear state responsibility, but the main state responsibility still belongs to the wrongdoing state (Aust 2011). But regardless of the size of state responsibility, by analogy, in the context of cyberwarfare, if a country provides technical means or financial support and other help to other countries, in principle, it should also bear the corresponding responsibility, and if that State has both wrongful acts and breaches of its obligations, it may also satisfy the constituent elements of State responsibility, and thus bear State responsibility in cyberwarfare to the extent of the damage caused by that State.\n### Hierarchical construction of standards of proof As a component of the constituent elements, whether it is the judgment of wrongfulness or the judgment of attributability, there is the problem of proof. In fact, for the legal field of the problem, the standard of proof has been extremely important, from the traditional theory of evidence, the standard of proof is the judge to consider and weigh the authenticity of the facts of the case to achieve the degree of proof, but also the burden of proof to provide the appropriate evidence to prove the facts of the case to achieve a certain standard (He and Wang 2017). The degree of standard of proof is directly related to the judge for the degree of conviction of the evidence, which naturally will affect the results of the judgment. Criminal law, civil law, and Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER other substantive areas of law, after a long period of development, in their litigation process also have their standard of proof, although different standards for the results of the judgment have a decisive impact, the litigant naturally needs to try to meet the standard of proof. On the other hand, for the facts that have occurred, no one has the ability to $100\\%$ reproduce the scene, they can only try to prove to maximize the proximity of the objective facts, thus providing judges with a good judgment environment so that judges as far as possible can make a reasonable judgment, and the standard of proof from this sense of understanding is also the embodiment of substantive justice.\nOutside the traditional field of substantive law, the standard of proof is also of great significance to the issue of international law. In international law, the composition of state responsibility needs to satisfy both illegal behavior and attributable elements, but the proof of the two elements is also a separate issue, whether the two standards of proof are consistent, and if not, what kind of standards should be used is an urgent discussion. As early as before the emergence of the problem of evidence in the field of networks, the International Court of Justice pointed out in the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua that the key to the solution to the problem lies not only in the process of attributing conduct to the law of a particular country but also in the search for substantial evidence before the process of legal attribution. It is thus clear that the question of the standard of proof is not simply an integral part of the question of the attribution of State responsibility, but is more relevant for independent discussion.\nAs far as the current situation is concerned, there is a lack of a uniform and clear standard of proof in international law. In the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice emphasized the principle of the free assessment of evidence, stating that within the limits of the Statute of the Court and the Rules of the Tribunal, the Court is free to assess the value of any evidence.3 While the persistent lack of uniform standards in international law has been detrimental to the development of proof, an analysis of the nature of the cases before the ICJ shows that there is a corresponding rationale for the absence of uniform standards of proof that the complexity and diversity of the cases before the ICJ make it difficult to arrive at a uniform standard that would be universally or primarily applicable to inter-State litigation (Watts 2000).\nIn addition, although the Court's deficiencies in the standard of proof may lead to subjective factors on the part of the judges affecting the decision of the case, in practice, the Court usually indicates in its judgments the standard of proof that it has adopted. Even if there is no expressly stated uniform standard, taking the standard of proof in a large number of judgments as a sample, it is still possible to analyze the issue of the standard of proof to one degree or another. Examining the decisions of ICJ, it can be found that the standard of proof adopted by ICJ basically draws on the system of standard of proof of the domestic courts of the common law system. According to different types of cases, the common law system of the standard of proof, according to the degree of strictness in descending order, can be divided into four types: (1) the criminal field is usually adopted with full certainty of “beyond a reasonable doubt”; (2) “clear and convincing proof”, which is highly probable but does not reach the level of incontrovertibility; (3) “preponderance of evidence”, which is usually adopted in civil proceedings and has a higher degree of reasonableness and probability; (4) prima facie evidence, which is merely required to prove indications of the correctness of an argument (Green 2009).\nThe standards of proof established for different types of cases are also of great significance in the context of cyberwarfare. Cyber-attacks are more covert and asymmetric than traditional attacks, and the degree of damage caused and the difficulty of investigation vary to different degrees, making evaluation more difficult than in traditional cases. Therefore, it is not practical to establish a uniform standard of proof, and a more reasonable approach should be to adopt different standards of proof according to the different degrees of impact brought about by cyberwarfare.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of cases have highlighted the intersection of cybercrime and cyberwarfare: operations with a clear cyberwarfare intent have incorporated tactical maneuvers normally associated with cybercrime. Cybercrime constitutes the criminal exploitation of digital systems to perpetrate unlawful activities through technological means (Hawdon 2021). Nowadays, the virtual nature, technological infrastructure, and limitless scalability of digital networks -- when combined with the misuse of big data analytics -- have paradoxically dissolved traditional national boundaries, transforming transnational criminal operations into borderless threats with globalized impact (Zhao and Cheng 2024). If the extent of cyberwarfare has reached the level of a criminal case, it should be strictly required to meet the standard of proof of a criminal case.\nTake the Shocknet virus, for example, which, in the course of cyberwarfare led to the damage of about 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz plant, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of Iranian centrifuges and delaying Iran's uranium enrichment program, in addition to the accidental spread of the Shocknet virus around the globe, which infected more than 100,000 computers. In terms of its impact, its nature has reached the seriousness of a criminal case. As Judge Higgins of the International Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER Court of Justice pointed out in his independent opinion in the Oil Platforms case, the more serious the allegations, the greater the degree of credibility of the evidence required.⁴ Therefore, in a case such as the Shocknet virus, which has already reached the standard of a criminal case, proof of the wrongfulness and attributability of the acts of the United States and Israel in the case will need to reach the level of beyond reasonable doubt.\nAs generative AI becomes widespread, the costs of creating and spreading viral false information, along with cross-border data storage, transfer, and processing expenses, are plummeting so that the frequency of cyber attacks is also on the rise (Cheng and Liu 2023). It is clearly unreasonable to apply the standards of cybercrime to all cyberattacks. A more rational approach would be to lower the burden of proof for cyberattacks that cause less damage and do not constitute a criminal case, similar to some of the standards of proof in civil litigation. But in any case, for the standard of proof of cyberwarfare is inappropriate to adopt the standard of prima facie evidence,\"prima facie evidence\"refers to\"sufficient to establish a fact or to establish a presumption, unless it is effectively rebutted\"evidence. A prima facie case can only mean that there is a possibility that the fact occurred, but it is not very convincing.\nMoreover, the application of that criterion to the determination of state responsibility would undoubtedly lead to a series of problems and increase the cost of dealing with cases because of its weak persuasiveness. For example, if a State was found to have committed a wrongful act merely because there was a possibility that it had done so, not only was there no basis in jurisprudence, but it would also be difficult for the international community to accept an assessment based on simple values. Additionally, the principle that the higher the gravity of the act, the higher the standard of proof is consistently reflected in academic discussions of international law, particularly concerning the International Court of Justice (Bills 2023). If a state is found to be liable for the high cost of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, it need only meet such a simple standard of proof, which clearly violates this principle.\n## 3.3 Normative boundaries of the deterrent factors of responsibility The wrongfulness of an act is one of the elements of the law of state responsibility, and the absence of wrongfulness does not entail the responsibility of the state, a situation that can also be referred to as a cause of impediment to state responsibility, with an emphasis on the analysis of two cases: self-defense and countermeasures.\n⁴ Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.S.), I.C.J. Judgment of 6 November 2003, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, para.33.\nDE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare Moreover, the International Court of Justice, in the Nicaragua case, held that all attacks of force belonged to the use of force, but not all uses of force constituted an attack of force, and that only those that were the most serious and had a significant scale and consequences could constitute an “armed attack” (Leigh 1984). According to the relevant judgment, there is a difference in intensity between the two. The significance of this distinction should also be reflected in cyberattacks. If a cyber-attack by a State only constitutes a use of force under Article 2(4) but does not constitute an armed attack under Article 51, it is certainly a serious internationally wrongful act in breach of an obligation under international law of jus cogens, but the injured State can only take non-forceful “countermeasures” as provided for in the Draft Articles. Once such measures are found to constitute an armed attack, the injured State may invoke Article 51 to legitimately exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defense, including the use of force.\nCountermeasures in international law are non-forcible measures taken by an injured State against a State responsible for committing an internationally wrongful act to induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations, with the intention of restoring reciprocity between the parties (Omura 2010). Accordingly, countermeasures do not normally involve the use of force (Jia 2022). They are lawful, provided that they meet the conditions set out in Part Three of the Draft Articles.5 Countermeasures are generally used in cases where the use of force does not rise to the level of an armed attack and, by analogy, in the field of cyberwarfare in cases where the level of the attack is not overly aggressive. Cases such as the SolarWinds supply chain attack and the Stuxnet virus attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities have reached the level of an armed attack in terms of both the means used and the damage Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER caused, and the right of self-defense can be triggered, no longer at the level of countermeasures.\nTraditional remedies such as compensation and restitution take some time to realize, and if one is only passively waiting for remedies there is a risk of further expanding losses, so as more timely remedies, both self-defense and countermeasures are necessary to avoid the expansion of losses to the maximum extent possible before traditional remedies can be obtained. Neither the right of self-defense nor the exercise of countermeasures is without limits. Customary law also limits the exercise of the right of self-defense, and the use of force in self-defense remains wrongful if it is accompanied by a violation of international humanitarian law or human rights since special provisions of international humanitarian law (such as the prohibition on retaliatory measures against civilians or prisoners of war) and certain human rights are non-derogable in all circumstances (Crawford 2002).\nSimilarly, the scope of countermeasures is limited, as draft article 50, Paragraph 1, provides that countermeasures shall not affect: (a) the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; (b) obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; (c) obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; (d) other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. In addition, Article 50, Paragraph 2, makes it clear that a State taking countermeasures is not relieved from fulfilling its obligations: (a) under any dispute settlement procedure applicable between it and the responsible State; (b) to respect the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents, premises, archives, and documents.\n## 3.4 The practical significance of the realization mechanism of state responsibility The state responsibility system is not only a rule implementation tool but also a carrier of the international community's value consensus. On this basis, once the state responsibility is recognized, it is necessary to fulfill the corresponding reality of the obligation. Attribution is not the ultimate goal; using attribution to further solve the problem is the significance of the state responsibility recognition. Under the background of cyber war, the significance of the reality is still worth paying attention to. State responsibility is assumed in various ways; here, we focus on analyzing the two main ways of restitution and compensation.\n ICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep. (1996) 226, para.41.\nFirst of all, we analyze restitution, as the content of the remedy system with the largest scope of remedies, because it can directly eliminate the consequences of wrongdoing, Article 35 of the Draft Articles lists Restitution as a priority remedy. The conditions for the application of restitution included the principles of physical possibility and proportionality, which also required that restitution should not impose a “disproportionate burden” on the responsible State, such as requiring a poor State to bear a large share of the cost of restoration, which was clearly impractical and might be exempted. While the elimination of wrongful consequences is well conceived, and in practice it has been implemented to a certain extent, resulting in more effective State responsibility, restitution also faces contemporary challenges, such as the creation of irreversible damage. While it is naturally clear that nuclear contamination, species extinction, and the like cannot be truly restored in the traditional sense, it is also possible to cause irreversible damage in the context of cyberattacks.\nTake the SolarWinds supply chain attack as an example, the Russian intelligence service hijacked the U.S. SolarWinds software update by implanting malicious code to infiltrate the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and nine other federal agencies and hundreds of enterprises. This case not only resulted in the long-term exposure of intelligence networks and the leakage of sensitive data but also called into question the credibility of global IT supply chain security standards and led to a shift to “zero-trust” architectures and a sharp increase in the cost of international cooperation. While the technical damage can be remedied through compensation, the erosion of democracy is likely to be irreversible, as the cyber-attack has largely eroded public trust in the government's cybersecurity capabilities, which will be difficult to rebuild in a short period, and difficult to fully restore through restitution. Therefore, although restitution can theoretically maximize the compensation for the damage caused, it is obvious that it cannot be fully compensated in practice, and other remedies are needed to supplement it.\nSecondly, as one of the mainstream remedies, Article 31 of the Draft Articles establishes the obligation of the responsible State to provide “full reparation” for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act, which covers both material and moral damages, reflecting the purpose of the elimination of all the consequences of the injury. The principle of the Chorzów Factory case of the Permanent Court of International Justice, of 1928, also provides evidence of this: it establishes that reparation is required to restore the injured State to the “state it would have been in had the wrongful act not been committed”. Further analysis of the types of reparation and the scope of application reveals that reparation can be very broad, ranging from material to moral damages, from direct, quantifiable property damage to indirect, reasonably foreseeable, consequential damages, such as loss of profits due to interruption of trade. Indirect damages, however, often require stricter proof of causation, and the calculation of compensation was controversial at the current stage. In any case, as the mainstream way of assuming state responsibility, the existence of compensation is also of practical significance to the realization of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, which requires less time cost and can more efficiently compensate for the interests of the victimized state than the institutional correction and other methods.\n## Core dilemmas in the determination of state responsibility The determination of state responsibility is of great significance, and can lead to real consequences such as restitution and compensation, but in the context of cyberwar, the core problems of the determination of state responsibility need to be paid attention to, mainly including the normative transformation obstacles of the technical attribution, the paradigm conflict of the application of the right of self-defense, and the systemic failure of the mechanism of responsibility assumption. Failure to analyze these dilemmas and propose solutions will make it difficult to trigger the consequences of state responsibility, which will not be conducive to the resolution of international disputes.\n### Normative transformation barriers to technical attribution The MITRE ATT&CK framework, a widely adopted knowledge base of attack behaviors in the current cybersecurity field, can provide technical references for cyber-attack traceability by standardizing the description of attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures (Al-Sada et al. 2024; Georgiadou et al. 2021). However, the transformation of its technical references to legal evidence is facing difficulties.\nPrimarily, the paradigm conflict between technical logic and legal logic hinders the transformation of technical indicators into legal evidence to a certain extent. ATT&CK framework is based on the identification of attack behavioral patterns, such as the “credential dump + lateral movement” mode of APT29, attackers often use the system's functions and tools to operate by modifying the system configuration or using legitimate tools and other methods to move laterally, ATT&CK framework for the identification of the attack behavior pattern to derive technical indicators. However, according to Article 8 of the Draft Articles: The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact, acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. It can be seen that a finding of State responsibility under international law requires proof of “effective control” of the attacking act in relation to the will of the State. For example, in the 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack, attackers injected malicious code called “Sunburst” into SolarWinds' flagship Orion software (Marelli 2022), even though security firms identified SUNBURST's TTPs through ATT&CK, such as T1059.001 command line interface abuse, but these technical characteristics can not directly prove that the Russian intelligence services of the main responsibility, the United States cited the ATT&CK report accusing Russia, but the international community in general to the “lack of direct chain of evidence” to question its legal effectiveness. In this case, even if it is recognized that there is indeed an attack, due to the inability to prove that the behavior is directed or controlled by a country, it is also difficult to use the technical indicators as evidence in the legal sense.\nSubsequently, the existence of intermediate nodes easily leads to a broken chain of evidence. Attackers commonly adopt the anonymizing technical architecture of “springboard server + virtual private network (VPN)”. Taking the 2016 Bangladesh central bank theft case as an example, although the C2 server IP of the SWIFT transaction instructions was traced to the Philippines, further investigation showed that the server was a puppet host controlled by the North Korean Lazarus group. This kind of multi-layer hopping leads to greater difficulty in technical traceability, and the result of traceability may also cause a break in the chain of evidence.\nAnother example is the attack on targets in China by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) through the QUANTUM attack platform, in which a number of modules are involved in concealing the identity of the attack, including QUANTUMBOT Module -- through the hijacking of the botnet command and control of network traffic, manipulating the botnet to launch attack activities and to hide the traces of the U.S. National Security Agency's hacking attacks.; QUANTUMBISCUIT Module -- builds a proxy springboard for quantum injection attacks against an attack target to prevent the attack from being detected retroactively; QUANTUMPHANTOM Module -- provides the technical ability to utilize network link intermediate node hijacking technology to achieve the hiding of the source of the attack, preventing the U.S. National Security Agency's cyberattacks against other countries from being traced back (Wei 2023). The use of multiple anonymization techniques undoubtedly creates a great obstacle to traceability work. Even if the source of the attack can be located accurately in the end, the identity of the operating subject behind the attack still needs to be further identified, and the attacker can be disguised as other countries/organizations or fake IP addresses, etc. to confuse the traceability (Schmitt 2017). The existence of intermediate nodes also makes it difficult to form a chain of evidence. The objective existence of obvious cyber attacks due to problems in the chain of evidence may not be able to carry out a trial in the end and even more accurately determine the responsibility of the state and solve the problem.\nIn addition, the “falsifiability” of technical indicators also weakens their probative value in practice. An important manifestation of this is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). It is widely recognized as the most sophisticated and powerful category of security threats (Ahmad et al. 2019). APTs are engineered by resourced, disciplined threat actors capable of sustained operations through systematic technology exploitation, blending expertise, funding, and structured coordination to maintain persistence (Maisey 2014; Mansfield-Devine 2014). APT organizations often falsify attack signatures through False Flag operations. The identification of false flags is inherently complex, primarily because attackers systematically conceal their actions while simultaneously framing innocent entities for malicious conduct (Rid and Buchanan 2015). Conducting a false flag operation in the cyber realm is fundamentally distinct and far simpler compared to its execution in the physical domain (Goodman 2010). For example, in the 2017 NotPetya ransomware incident, ATT&CK-based T1486 disk encryption analysis initially pointed to North Korea, but subsequent code homology analysis revealed a link to the Russian Sandworm organization. This type of technological misdirection makes the judicial application of the ATT&CK framework a “reasonable suspicion” challenge. As counterfeiting technologies evolve, the ATT&CK framework should also evolve with the times and develop more accurate techniques for identifying forgeries, or else the credibility of the technical indicators it produces may be further diminished in the face of the difficulty of transferring technical indicators to legal evidence.\n### Paradigm conflicts in the application of the right of self-defense Even in the face of cyberattacks, the exercise of the right of self-defense and countermeasures is not unlimited and still needs to comply with certain requirements, so it is still necessary to make a clearer discussion on the boundaries of the legality of the use of the right of self-defense and countermeasures in cyberwarfare.\nAs mentioned in the previous article, as to the question of whether cyber warfare constitutes the use of force under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, the “scale and consequence theory” proposed by Prof. Michael Schmit has the highest degree of acceptance at present. As long as the analysis is conducted according to the multiple indicators of scale and consequence, and the cyber-attack is considered to be a case of the use of force, then countermeasures or even the exercise of the right to self-defense can be taken. The most controversial issue at present is that the right to determine the use of force is in the hands of more developed countries, and the seemingly objective judgment criteria are to some extent mixed with subjective factors.\nAs is widely known, the Tallinn Manual edited by Prof. Michael Schmit, as a more authoritative and important reference document for the study of cyber warfare, has seven of the eight assessment criteria for determining whether the use of force constitutes a use of force, which are completely consistent with the criteria advocated by Prof. Michael Schmit himself. The criteria are somewhat arbitrary and subjective. For example, Professor Schmit himself, when applying these factors to analyze the 2007 cyberattack against Estonia, concluded that the attack constituted a use of force. Other scholars, however, have argued that the opposite conclusion that the cyberattack did not constitute a use of force can easily be reached by relying on these same factors, which can be easily manipulated in their application to reach conclusions that benefit the geostrategic objectives of the country being analyzed (Nguyen 2013).\nMoreover, when applied to cyberattacks, the “scale and consequence” standard has a fatal logical flaw: a given consequence of the same scale and severity can be produced by the use of force as well as by non-forceful means. The loss of life and the destruction of forests and land in a downstream country as a result of the discharge of toxic substances into a river by an upstream country or the starvation and economic turmoil of a country as a result of economic sanctions imposed by one country on another, are in themselves highly analogous to those that would normally result from the use of force. However, in general perception, these acts hardly constitute a use of force in international law or even an internationally wrongful act. In this way, such acts can escape legal sanction even if they have consequences comparable to those of the use of force. Cyberattacks, however, may be recognized as a use of force and subject to liability if they have the same legal consequences. This logical loophole exists partly because of the arbitrariness and subjectivity of the judgment standard. Western scholars with stronger discursive power often lower the threshold for the use of the right to self-defense through an expansive interpretation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, and in this regard, seemingly reasonable standards can often be interpreted to achieve political goals.\nIn addition to lowering the threshold of the right to self-defense through acts of interpretation, the United States has also put forward the “Defend Forward” strategy, which is an offensive defense strategy it has put forward in recent years in the field of cyberspace security, aiming to respond to cyber threats using proactive strikes and pre-emptive strikes. The United States Cyber Command has emphasized the need to adopt a “forward posture” in cyberspace by accessing non-Department of Defense networks or systems to weaken an adversary's cyber capabilities in advance and prevent it from taking action. Such an assertion should be relegated to the academic category of preventive self-defense, which is advocated by a few Western countries and Western scholars, but is not and should not be supported in existing international treaties and customary international law -- it means “granting the major powers an almost unrestricted license to use force” (Klabbers 2013). In summary, the definition of cyberwarfare and the various criteria for judging it, as well as the proposal of strategies such as “forward defense,” are undoubtedly suspected of serving political goals. Professor O'Connell also believes that “cyberwarfare” is a “wrong war”. It is essentially an “invented” problem in the context of the increasing militarization of cybersecurity policies of major Western countries (O'Connell 2012).\n### Systemic failure of responsibility mechanisms The decentralized nature of cyberspace forms a structural contradiction with the “state-centered” responsibility framework of traditional international law, resulting in an imbalance in the distribution of responsibility between states and non-state actors, rigid rules of evidence, and a lack of enforcement mechanisms.\nFirst, the traditional logic of attribution has loopholes that need to be filled in the context of cyberspace, and the traditional theoretical criterion of “effective control” has limitations. This criterion originated from the 1986 case of Nicaragua v. United States, in which the ICJ made it clear that to attribute the conduct of non-state actors to a state (the United States), it is necessary to prove that the state exercised “effective control” over the specific military operation. Not only does the state provide general support such as funding, weapons, or training, but it also needs to have actual command over the specific unlawful action, i.e. the state needs to directly direct or specifically instruct the attack. However, the “outsourcing of tools” in cyberattacks has led to a high degree of invisibility of the state-attacker nexus. For example, in the case of the Iranian APT34 attack on Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in 2021, although the technical traceability showed that the attack tools were linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, it was not possible to prove that their actions were “specifically directed” by the state. In the context of cyberwarfare, “effective control” has the risk of being too rigid, leading to the impossibility of attribution, and the choice of whether to include other judgment criteria in such cases has been widely discussed, among which the theory of “overall control” is of particular research value.\nThe theory of “Overall Control” originated from the judgment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the case of Prosecutor v. Tadić. The Tribunal held that the conduct of a state can be attributed DE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare In the context of cyberwarfare, the anonymity of cyberattacks, technology dependence, and the ambiguity of actors make the traditional standard of attribution challenging, and the “overall control” theory has potential advantages in some respects. The criterion is superior in terms of identification in response to the prevalence of indirect support models. States often support cyberattacks through technological enablement, infrastructure harboring, or strategic guidance. Such behavior is more consistent with the “strategic dominance” characteristic of “overall control” than with the “specific instruction” requirement of “effective control”. For example, Russia’s relationship with APT28 is alleged to be in line with “overall control” in that the Russians provide technical resources but do not directly direct specific attacks, and the international community generally believes that the organization is supported by the Russian government and that the motivation for its attacks is closely related to Russia’s national interests.\nAccording to “overall control”, it is possible to hold Russia responsible, but according to the traditional “effective control” standard, it is difficult to hold it accountable. In addition, while the technical traceability of cyberattacks often only proves a continuing connection between the attacker and the state, and it is difficult to obtain evidence of direct orders, the “overall control” standard eliminates the need to prove a control relationship between the state and the attacker, and allows for a more efficient allocation of responsibility. Although the “overall control” standard has its role in the context of cyberwarfare, it is still difficult to accept it as the standard for attribution of responsibility in the current mainstream view, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia Serbia and Montenegro, the ICJ explicitly rejected the standard of “overall control” and insisted on the strict interpretation of “effective control”,[9] which can provide a reference basis for the attribution of responsibility for cyber warfare. Moreover, there is a risk of political abuse if a more lenient standard is adopted, as when the U.S. sanctioned a Chinese technology company based on “overall control” in the absence of publicly available technical evidence to support it. While this standard is not appropriate in all cases, it is clear that the traditional standard is not fully applicable, and the international community [9] Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, General List No. 91.\nshould continue to explore new, more reasonable standards in practice to address the limitations of the traditional standard.\nSecondly, the traditional attribution criterion is also difficult in practice. The system of attribution of responsibility for non-state actors is not perfect, which leads to the failure of the mechanism for assuming responsibility to play a full role, potentially allowing non-state actors to avoid legal penalties, especially transnational science and technology enterprises to circumvent the responsibility of the behavior at this stage has not been effectively resolved. For example, Zero-Day Vulnerability, as a security flaw that has not yet been discovered or fixed by software vendors, has a unique “gray area” in the trading market due to the ambiguity of its participants, uses, and legal attributes. There are cases where private vulnerability brokers sell zero-day vulnerabilities to governments, but international law does not clarify whether such transactions constitute “assisting in the commission of cyber-attacks”. In terms of the actual situation at this stage, international legislation is undoubtedly lagging behind, and existing cybercrime conventions have not yet explicitly stipulated specific provisions directly targeting “vulnerability trading”.\nIn addition, the EU's “Network Resilience Act” only requires vendors to establish a vulnerability handling process, does not regulate third-party transactions. In China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Internet Information Office, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly issued the “Provisions on the Management of Security Vulnerabilities in Network Products”, which clearly states that no organization or individual shall illegally collect, sell or distribute information on security vulnerabilities in network products, but the standard of “illegality” lacks specific interpretation, and loopholes exist in the determination of “illegality”. The U.S. “Vulnerability Equity Program” is not binding, vendors can refuse to cooperate. It can be seen that the existing law for the actors did not make comprehensive provisions, so the use of zero-day vulnerabilities in cyber attacks on multinational technology enterprises has the possibility of circumventing legal responsibility, liability mechanism due to the lack of comprehensiveness, but also may be further dysfunctional.\n## Reconstructing the path of state responsibility in cyber warfare Under the increasingly complex background of cyber warfare, it is of great practical significance to find a more reasonable path of state responsibility. On the one hand, further improvement of the traditional attribution mechanism can enhance the persuasive power of the attribution; on the other hand, through the innovation of judicial procedures, the realization of state responsibility can be further refined to avoid the emergence of unreasonable responsibility which is too light or too heavy. State responsibility in cyberwarfare has room for improvement in both judgment standard and realization, and if it can be adjusted under the common recognition of the international community, it can to a certain extent avoid subjective factors affecting the judgment and assumption of state responsibility.\n### Improving the attribution mechanism One of the important reasons why the attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyber warfare has a certain subjective element is that there is no universally recognized technical attribution mechanism, which to a certain extent has led to the divergence of attribution standards among countries for cyber warfare. Although there is more authoritative literature such as the Tallinn Manual for reference, the nature of international law is, after all, soft law. While States can use soft law to solve the problem of coordinated gaming (Guzman and Meyer 2010), international law is not as binding as it could be if a State's political aspirations need to be realized urgently. In addition, if some countries do not sign an international treaty on cybersecurity, and the content of the treaty has not developed into a custom, a considerable number of countries can claim that they do not carry out activities in the cyber field in accordance with the rules in the treaty. Moreover, even for those countries that have signed such treaties, the cost of withdrawing from them is not high. Finally, although relevant documents are constantly being issued, how to deal with conflicts between them is a subjective process. From this point of view, the mere formulation of international law on cybersecurity is relatively limited in enhancing the rationality of attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nIn this context, promoting the international community to establish a technical attribution institution can be a better choice. First of all, compared with soft law, the institution established under the wide recognition of the international community is more persuasive and can avoid to a greater extent the situation that countries choose the judgment standard of state responsibility based on their own political opinions. Secondly, the establishment of a technical attribution body can help promote policy coordination and resource sharing among countries in the field of cybersecurity. Through multilateral cooperation, countries can fully express their demands, formulate unified international legal standards to deal with transnational cyber threats under the principle of pursuing the greatest common interests, conduct in-depth discussions on reasonable motions to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the attribution standards and reduce the troubles caused by the differences in the laws of different countries.\nFurthermore, technical attribution organizations can establish an information-sharing platform to share the latest information on cyberattacks and technological advances promptly, and such an information-sharing mechanism can improve the ability of countries to respond to cyber threats. For example, the Enhanced Attribution (EA) program initiated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is very informative. The goal of the EA program is to develop techniques to generate operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent and independent malicious cyber campaigns and to create a methodology by which this information can be shared with multiple parties without jeopardizing the intelligence sources and methodologies. By collecting, monitoring, and understanding adversary cyberattack operations in the red space, the program is expected to be divided into three technical areas (TAs) that will work in parallel with each other. They will span three 18-month phases, after which the agency will step in to obtain high-quality results. This activity will undoubtedly empower the attribution criteria with more precise technology, which is expected to target the subjects of wrongdoing with greater precision. Such meaningful criteria, if adopted by technical attribution agencies, would certainly contribute to the standardization of technical attribution.\nBased on the establishment of technical attribution institutions and the development of technical attribution criteria, the criterion of “effective control” in the traditional attribution criteria needs to be expanded. The obstacle to the normative transformation of technical attribution mentioned earlier is largely due to the rigid application of the criterion of “effective control”. In light of the complexity of cyberwarfare models, the concept of “material support” should be introduced, so that if a State systematically provides vulnerabilities, infrastructure, or funding to non-State actors that cause the same level of consequences as a direct direct order, it will be held liable even if there is no direct order. Although this approach has not become a common practice in the international community, the continued rigid application of the traditional criterion of proving a directive relationship will undoubtedly allow certain subjects to avoid the risk of assuming State responsibility, which is difficult to accept in terms of jurisprudence. Therefore, based on the principle of the “effective control” criterion, consideration should be given to the use of “substantial support” to make judgments when the act of support has a significant impact and is directly related to the acts or purposes of the supported party, thus constituting substantial support. The adoption of such a criterion is not only legally sound but also creates conditions for the application of technical attribution to a greater extent. The adoption of the “substantial support” criterion for attribution when the support provided by a State can be traced back to that State by technical means and it can be established that the State providing the assistance constitutes substantial support can avoid the rigid application of the traditional criterion, which would jeopardize the results obtained through technical tracing.\n### Adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism The establishment of an international attribution agency is certainly of great significance to the determination of state responsibility, but it only involves the work of attribution, and if we want to comprehensively reconstruct the responsibility of the state in cyberwarfare, it must be built on the basis of a broad consensus among all countries, and the blueprint for the establishment of an international attribution agency as mentioned in the previous section is also built on the basis of the consensus of all countries. Therefore, the consensus of all countries is a fundamental condition. It is obviously unrealistic for the international community to reach consensus in the short term, because the more vulnerable countries may consider that the adjustment of rules has nothing to do with them. In this case, the big countries are more important to play a pioneering role and set an example through concrete actions. The adjustment of the multilateral cooperation mechanism is conducive to the rationalization of the judgment of national responsibility in cyber warfare, and is also conducive to the regulation of the cyber offensive behavior of individual countries, so that all countries in the international community can benefit from it. The specific cooperation mechanism can be adjusted as follows: Foremost, regional confidence-building measures should be further developed. The most important is the establishment of a cyberspace “hotline mechanism”, which can reduce the information gap through effective communication and avoid the emergence of unnecessary cyberattacks. As early as during the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, this “hotline mechanism” demonstrated its important value. During the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, both sides in the nuclear arms race and military confrontation realized that the lack of direct communication channels could lead to miscalculation and escalation of the conflict. In 1963, the U.S. and the Soviet Union established the “hotline mechanism”, which allowed leaders to communicate quickly, directly, and privately in emergency situations, thereby eliminating the risk of nuclear war resulting from communication delays or misunderstandings of each other's actions. To this day, this mechanism is used as an important tool. In 2022, during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the U.S. and Russia established a military hotline to avoid miscalculations and military accidents. The “hotline mechanism” has gone a long way in avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings and remains indispensable in the context of cyberwarfare. 2020s attack on India's power grid could be a case in point. on October 12, 2020, Mumbai, India, experienced a massive blackout that affected critical infrastructure, including stock exchanges and healthcare facilities. The New York Times reported that the blackout may have been linked to China, claiming that “Chinese malware hacked into India's power supply control system” in order to pressure India in the India-China border standoff. Although this claim was later clarified by Recorded Future, a cybersecurity company mentioned in the report, and officially denied by Indian officials, it still caused a certain degree of damage to China's image, and if the “hotline mechanism” had been adopted at that time, it could have avoided the misleading public opinion and the waste of investigation resources. This shows that China, the United States, Russia and other countries have taken the lead in setting up real-time communication channels, clarifying in a timely manner in the event of miscalculation, and reducing unnecessary costs and expenditures, which is still necessary in the context of cyber warfare.\nConcomitantly, adjusting the public-private partnership. In the context of cyberwarfare, cooperation between countries is certainly important, but operators often also have a large amount of relevant information. To further reduce the cost of controlling the occurrence of cyberwarfare, it is indispensable for operators and governments to jointly build a threat intelligence-sharing platform. Adopting this model not only facilitates research between countries based on a large number of cases provided by operators to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the cases, but also reduces the effort of searching for cyberattacks from all over the world, saves time and cost, and efficiently builds identification and defense measures. This model has been reflected in the JCDC model in the U.S. JCDC participants that include organizations and operators from both the public and private sectors, covering service providers, infrastructure operators, cybersecurity companies, and companies in the critical infrastructure industry.\nIn addition, JCDC constituents include specific government agencies designated by Congress, such as the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It is through the operator-government co-built threat intelligence-sharing platform that the JCDC shares real-time information through multiple platforms, such as Slack, the Homeland Security Information Network HSIN, and the GovDelivery service, to ensure that there is continuous dialog and collaboration among the participants. This also sets the stage for the development of proactive cyber defense programs to mitigate the most serious risks before threats become visible. Moreover, “gatekeeper liability” for technology companies can be introduced, as Article 6 of The EU's Digital Services Act indicates that “where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, the service provider shall not be liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that the provider”. By analyzing the exemption from liability of the hosting service provider of the online platform and the relevant conditions, it can be seen that the online platform should have a certain degree of responsibility for reviewing the information provided by the service recipient (Lefouili and Madio 2022). For content that is clearly of a cyber-attack nature, the provider of the online service should exercise a certain degree of scrutiny, in particular, cloud computing giants are required to filter malicious traffic, or else they may be considered to bear the corresponding joint and several liability.\nFinally, a “digital ceasefire zone” system could be included in the scope of discussion. Healthcare, energy and other livelihood areas are of great importance, and if they are subjected to cyberattacks, they will often lead to more serious consequences, and should be categorized as no-attack zones, so that if certain countries carry out non-compliant cyberattacks, violators will be automatically triggered by the United Nations to sanction them. According to the context that cyber-peacekeeping has been suggested as a strategic framework to address the multifaceted challenges posed by diverse manifestations of cyber conflict (Dorn 2017), in order to support the implementation of the system, we can also consider the establishment of a “network peacekeeping force”, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to send technical teams to assist in the restoration of network services in conflict areas. The reason why it should be coordinated by the ITU is that, under its supervision, the technical teams will be able to use more reasonable means to respond to cyber attacks. Shortly after the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, controversy erupted over the way Ukraine set up the International Volunteer Team for Cyber Defense to carry out cyberattacks against Russian targets, and its development of tools, which allows any digital device to become part of a DDoS attack network, was deemed to be a violation of international cyber norms. The existence of a unified body for coordination would make it possible to bring the corresponding tools into line with the principle of proportionality.\n### Innovations in judicial procedures In addition to further clarifying the criteria for attribution of state responsibility and minimizing the frequency of cyberwar through multilateral cooperation mechanisms, there is also a need for innovation in the judicial process, because most cyberwars are ultimately handled through the judicial process, and therefore adopting a more feasible judicial process is conducive to a more reasonable distribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nFirstly, the International Court of Justice could create a panel of judges specialized in cyberspace cases, allowing for the submission of electronic evidence and anonymous witnesses. There is a precedent for such a special chamber, namely the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which is a special judicial procedure set up within the ITLOS to hear disputes between States arising from the exploration and exploitation of the international seabed area. In response to the increasingly complex cyberwarfare, which should be handled more rigorously, and the identification and allocation of State responsibility should be more reasonable, the traditional team of judges may not be able to make accurate judgments when faced with the special field of cyber. The idea that selecting judges with relevant backgrounds enhances efficiency is supported by academic research, which suggests that a judge's prior experience and characteristics can influence their decision-making (Basabe-Serrano 2019). At this time, the selection of judges with cyber background to form a team specializing in cyberspace cases is conducive to more efficiently identifying the nature of cyberattacks and, with the help of increasingly developed technological means, more reasonably allocating state responsibility on the basis of technical indicators.\nMeanwhile, through the leading role of the International Court of Justice, countries can also select judges with expertise in international law, cyber technology, data protection, and other fields through a special selection mechanism to form domestic teams specialized in handling cyber cases. From this, we can see that such a move can not only further solve the problem of cyber warfare among countries but also serve as an inspiration for the handling of cyber cases within countries. The team of judges can cooperate with other international organizations (such as Interpol and the United Nations Office on Cybercrime) to analyze the ever-emerging new forms and the constantly updating and iterative advanced technologies in order to formulate more reasonable judgment standards and solution measures, so as to jointly address the global challenges in cyberspace.\nIn addition, consideration could be given to legitimizing “preventive countermeasures” by allowing for pre-emptive defences against highly probable cyberattacks under the authority of the Security Council. Referring to Article 50 of the UN Charter on temporary measures against economic sanctions, UN Member States, in their actions for the maintenance of international peace and security, should refrain from any action that might widen a dispute or aggravate a situation. And the UN Security Council is tasked with resolving international disputes and can establish frameworks for peaceful settlements, aligning with Article 1 of the UN Charter so that Member States should take appropriate steps to prevent the extension or aggravation of the dispute in accordance with the recommendations of the UNSC (Alipour 2024). It was mentioned earlier that countermeasures must be a means to be taken only if there is a realistic attack. However, in the context of cyberwarfare, it is often too late to take countermeasures if one has to wait until there is an attack. Due to the intensity and scope of cyberattacks, a country's cyber system may not be able to function after an attack, let alone take defensive measures. Under such circumstances, it is particularly important to formulate “preventive countermeasures” with reference to Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations. This kind of prevention cannot be advanced indefinitely and should be judged according to the recommendations of the UN Security Council. However, the international community needs to discuss in depth what kind of preventive measures should be taken in order to arrive at a standard. In any case, even if this kind of advance measure is recognized, it still needs to be regulated by the corresponding standards, or else powerful countries can launch disproportionate “preventive countermeasures” against less dangerous cyberattacks in pursuit of their own national political demands, which is contrary to the original purpose of the measure.\nWhile considering innovations in the judicial process, there is also a need for flexibility in the use of various methods to solve the problems that arise in the process, such as the use of legal discourse. In addressing the dual imperatives of legislative innovation and jurisprudential reconceptualization, legal discourse analysis as a vital interdisciplinary instrument, offers multidimensional frameworks to decode evolving normative constructs within contemporary governance systems (Neuwirth 2023). The degree of formality in legal language mirrors the solemn nature of judicial proceedings, whereas the presence or absence of polite expressions can signal deference, confrontational intent, or calculated positioning. These deliberate language patterns fundamentally shape both the courtroom environment and participants' interpretations of interactions, ultimately guiding behavioral responses throughout legal exchanges (Mısır and Akın 2024). In addition, the refinement of legal discourse patterning can be enhanced by studying a large number of cases in the European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union issues its rulings in 23 legally binding linguistic versions, reflecting the mandate established under Article 217 of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. This foundational provision, originally enacted as the European Council's inaugural legislative instrument, constitutionally guarantees that every member state's national language maintains equal juridical standing as an official working language of the Union (Trklja 2024). Based on the breadth of these cases, summarizing them will undoubtedly be beneficial for a more accurate use of legal language.\nUltimately, in the process of optimization, the participation of artificial intelligence is an irreversible trend, and the various advantages of artificial intelligence can undoubtedly improve efficiency, but the existence of hidden loopholes in various aspects of technology, ethics and other aspects also need to be paid attention to. Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transnational challenge demanding coordinated governance architectures, necessitating the establishment of multilateral regulatory systems capable of ensuring operational synergy, policy harmonization, and adaptive scalability across jurisdictions (Neuwirth 2024). And transitioning to centralized regulatory frameworks proves indispensable for steering generative AI development along ethically aligned trajectories (Cheng and Liu 2024). To effectively address existential risks in artificial intelligence development, institutionalizing ethical guardrails through a “Digital Humanism” framework becomes imperative. This paradigm prioritizes human-centric imperatives by safeguarding species-wide wellbeing and systemic security, while strategically decoupling technological advancement from zero-sum competition. Such an approach ensures that technological evolution maintains symbiotic alignment with civilizational priorities (Cheng and Gong 2024). Today sanctions and anti-sanctions have evolved into a dominant strategic pattern within contemporary geopolitical interactions (Gu and Zhao 2023), which makes it all the more important that more rational judicial procedures be used to mitigate the growing conflict.\n## Conclusions The accelerated militarization of cyberspace has plunged the state responsibility system into a “triple normative dilemma”: first, the transformation of technical evidence into legal facts has led to the failure of the attribution mechanism; second, the hermeneutical controversy over the boundaries of the right to self-defense has triggered a crisis of the legitimacy of the countermeasures; and third, the vacuum in the allocation of responsibility due to the involvement of non-State actors has resulted in the systematic failure of the enforcement mechanism. These structural impediments not only undermine the deterrent effect of international law, but also contribute to the “low-cost-high-benefit” nature of cyberwarfare, which continues to induce opportunistic tactics by state actors.\nWhile existing governance frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0's “principle of equivalence of effects” and the Convention on Cybercrime's territoriality provision provide guidance on rules at the local level, they are not able to cope with complex cyberconflicts due to institutional fragmentation and technological adaptability deficiencies. For example, the Tallinn Manual's 2.0 Rule 69's eight-dimensional assessment model of the threshold for the use of force faces an attenuation of its explanatory power when dealing with generative AI-driven cognitive warfare; and the Budapest Convention's Mutual Legal Assistance Mechanism is in an implementation dilemma due to the anonymity of cryptocurrencies.\nTo solve the above dilemmas, it is urgent to build a three-in-one path of “technical verification, rule iteration, and mechanism synergy” to reconfigure the responsibility: (1) technical empowerment of attribution mechanism: building a verifiable attribution system, and realizing the transformation of MITRE ATT&CK framework into a judicial system; (2) adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism, building regional confidence measures, strengthening public-private partnership, and strengthening the DE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare This reconstruction path has dual normative value: at the level of substantive law, through the legalization of preventive responsibility and due diligence, the “risk spillover” behavior of the state in cyberspace is curbed; at the level of procedural law, with the help of technology-neutral third-party evidence collection mechanism, the cognitive gap between technological logic and judicial review can be bridged. Only by realizing the in-depth mutual embedding of technical governance and international law can the “tragedy of the commons” effect of cyberwar be suppressed, and the paradigm shift of the community of destiny in cyberspace from conceptual advocacy to institutional practice be promoted.\n**Research funding:** This work was supported by the project of National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 24BYY151) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhejiang University."

Due to the ambiguity of the object of regulation, the defect of attribution mechanism, and the lack of clarity of the constituent elements of responsibility, the existing international law framework has caused the state responsibility system in cyberspace to fall into the dilemma of normative failure. This paper takes the theory of international law subjectivity as the logical starting point and systematically deconstructs the normative attributes of cyberwar and the path of responsibility determination. This paper shows that the constitutive elements of state responsibility need to break through the rigid standard of traditional \"behavior-damage\" causality and build a dynamic attribution system combining technical verification and legal presumption. Through critical analysis of the use of force threshold doctrine, this paper, based on a comprehensive analysis of the core dilemma of the determination of state responsibility, proposes to appropriately introduce the concept of \"substantial support\", and when the traditional theory of comprehensive control fails to make effective attribution, the criterion of \"substantial support\" can be used to complete the attribution of state responsibility with the increasingly developed technological traceability means.\nKeywords: cyberwarfare; international law; state responsibility; attributability\n*Corresponding author: Haonan Li, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: lihaonan22402065@zju.edu.cn. https://orcid.org/0009-0005-0476-300X\nLe Cheng, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: chengle163@hotmail.com. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4423-8585\nThe militarized transformation of cyberspace has upended the cognitive architecture of the use of force under the Westphalian system. Traditional military theory faces challenges when applied to cyber conflict (Kallberg 2016). The evolution of cyberwarfare from a technological tool to a means of strategic deterrence has led to a blurring of the legal boundaries between peacetime and armed conflict. And the increasing effectiveness of cyberattacks further complicates the legal context of cyberwarfare (Gray 2024). The traditional state responsibility regime needs to be reconfigured due to a triple adaptive dilemma: first, technological anonymity triggers a break in the chain of attribution, which puts the “effective control” criterion in Article 8 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility in a difficult position to prove; second, the non-kinetic nature of cyber operations makes it difficult to quantify the threshold for the use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations; and third, the legitimacy boundary of countermeasures creates normative conflicts under the “forward defense” strategy.\nThis paper adopts a techno-legal cross-analysis approach to focus on the normative reconstruction path of state responsibility in cyber warfare. By deconstructing the dilemma of determining state responsibility at the current stage and proposing corresponding reconstruction paths, this paper attempts to discuss how the determination standard of the attribute of force in cyberwarfare can be coordinated with the “principle of equivalence of effect” of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the mode of assuming the indirect responsibility of the state in the context of the intervention of non-state actors. It is hoped that through the reconstruction of various paths, the issue of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare can be clarified as much as possible, and the diffuse damage caused by cyberwarfare can be curbed. This paper aims to provide theoretical support for the clear identification of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare and to promote the formation of a technologically empowered international law governance paradigm.\n## Deconstructing the normative attributes of cyberwarfare\n### The evolution of the conceptual genealogy of cyberwarfare\nThe generation of the normative concept of cyberwarfare has gone through the process of discourse migration from military science to jurisprudence. The concept of cyberwarfare first appeared in a research report by the RAND Corporation in 1993,\nwhich defined cyberwarfare as a military operation being implemented or prepared to be implemented according to information-related principles (John and Ronfeldt 1993). In the strategic dimension, the concept of cyberwarfare was accompanied by the completion of the ontological construction of the theory of the “Fifth Dimension”, which was recognized by Huang (2015), who argued that “the rapid development of the global Internet has been driven by the rapid advancement of information technology, and cyberspace has begun to take shape as the ‘fifth space' beyond the land, sea, airspace and outer space”. At the same time, a variety of problems and threats such as cyber-attacks and cybercrime have also arisen, and the concept of “cyber warfare” is put forward in this context. On the one hand, along with the development of science and technology, the scale of cyber warfare has reached an unprecedented level, such as the cyber attack and defense in the Russo-Georgian war, the Iranian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the Shocknet virus, the Syrian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the airstrikes, and other cases, all of which are the embodiment of the escalation of the intensity of modern cyber warfare. On the other hand, the relevant theoretical research has been optimized based on the endless cyber warfare.\nCompared with China's late start in cyberwarfare research, western countries have begun research on cyberwarfare earlier, with a larger scale and wider scope, and have also achieved rich results in the formulation of international rules in cyberspace. Since the development of relevant theories, the current mainstream scholars believe that the content of international law on jus ad bellum can be applied to cyber warfare. For example, Reese Nguyen (2013) believes that when a cyber attack is intended to cause irreversible damage or physical loss to the physical information system, it can be recognized as constituting an attack with force. The main argument in favor of this claim is based on Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, which states that “all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. There are different doctrinal understandings of how to argue that cyberwarfare is a use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, as will be presented in the next section.\n### 2.2 Doctrines of thresholds for use of force in cyberwarfare\nAt present, mainstream scholars believe that cyberwarfare constitutes the use of force, but there are different doctrines in understanding, mainly the theory of purpose, instrumental theory, scale, and consequence theory (Huang 2015). Walter Sharp (1999), a representative of the “purpose theory”, argues that computer\nnetwork attacks are a form of economic and political coercion, and although such coercion is traditionally considered not to be a “use of force”, in the light of the purpose of the Charter of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, and the territorial integrity and political independence of States guaranteed by Article 2(4), computer network attacks should also be subject to Article 2(4) since economic and political coercion would also threaten international peace and jeopardize the territorial integrity and political independence of a State, and would therefore be covered by the scope of the Article.\nMarco Roscini (2010), a representative of the “tools doctrine”, argues that the “military force” that Article 2(4) intends to regulate is mainly embodied in the use of specific weapons (or tools) and that cyber-attacks using “weapons” such as Trojan horses, worms, etc. can also constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) if they produce specific tangible or intangible damage. The most widely accepted theory is the “scale and consequences theory”, in which Professor Michael Schmitt (1999, 2011) argues that although the main purpose of Article 2(4) is to constrain a state's external use of traditional military force to coerce others, in practice what matters is not the means used but the consequences; if a cyber-attack directly causes or is likely to cause damage to persons or objects comparable to that caused by military means, it should undoubtedly constitute a “use of force”; even if it does not cause tangible damage to persons or objects, the victimized State can still determine whether a cyber-attack constitutes a “use of force” by assessing the following seven criteria: (a) severity, (b) immediacy, (c) directness, (d) invasiveness, (e) measurability of effects, (f) presumptive legality and (g) state involvement. Although there are strengths and weaknesses in each viewpoint, as far as the existing situation is analyzed, the scale and consequence theory is recognized by majority of researchers, and the proposition of Prof. Michael Schmit has had a greater impact in the Western academic community, not only in the Tallinn Manual, which is edited by him but also recognized by Western countries. It is worth mentioning that the Tallinn Manual, as a document developed with the participation of multinational subjects, contains seven out of eight assessment criteria for defining whether a cyberattack constitutes a use of force that are identical to those mentioned in the previous article, which indicates that the evaluation criteria advocated by the scale and consequences theory have their own rationality and can be generally accepted by the majority of countries.\nIt should be noted that the research on issues related to cyberwarfare in this paper is based on cases where cyberwarfare can trigger international responsibility, and cyber infringement and cybercrime activities, which are only regulated by the domestic laws of various countries as well as a small number of international treaties, obviously do not fall into the category of use of force as stipulated in the\nCharter of the United Nations 2(4), and they also cannot trigger the responsibility of the State, and therefore do not fall within the scope of this paper's analysis.\n## Normative elements and paths to attribution of state responsibility in cyberwarfare\n### Normative basis and constitutive elements of the state responsibility regime\nThe institutional framework of state responsibility in international law is rooted in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Articles). According to Chapter I and Chapter II of the Draft Articles, the establishment of state responsibility requires the fulfillment of two normative elements: wrongfulness and attributability. In the following, the two elements will be analyzed separately.\nInitially, the analysis of wrongfulness. In Article 2 of the Draft Articles, the International Law Commission defines that “there is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law, and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.” In the context of cyberwarfare, it is clear that most cases of wrongful acts are in the form of action, as exemplified by the Russo-Georgian war: the Georgian government website was attacked, the government web server was on the verge of collapsing due to the large number of access requests it received for more than 10 h, the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was completely dysfunctional, and the website of the presidential administration was paralyzed for 24 h. As the fighting deepened, the intensity and sophistication of the cyber-attacks increased, with Russia targeting Georgia's government and news media websites as the primary targets, disabling virtually all of Georgia's government offices. Second, it is worth noting that the article does not mention that subjective fault or intent to engage in a wrongful act is required to establish state responsibility; the mere existence of a violation of the law is sufficient to give rise to international responsibility, and, by extension, state responsibility should be an objective rather than a subjective responsibility. The normative logic of this objective responsibility paradigm, which rejects the subjective fault element, is that the unlawfulness of an internationally wrongful act arises from an objective breach of an international obligation rather than from the state of mind of the acting state (Crawford 2013).\nIn addition, the article requires that the wrongful act constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state, and for a further understanding of the\nCheng and Li\nDE GRUYTER\nobligation, one can refer to the definitions in Articles 12 and 13 of the Draft Articles. Article 12 provides that there is a breach of an international obligation by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. Article 13 provides that an act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs. In other words, the key feature of a breach of an international obligation is that the obligation should have been complied with, but in fact, the State in question did not take reasonable action to comply with the obligation.\nArticle 12 makes it clear that, regardless of the origin or character of the obligation, when analyzed in terms of the sources of international law, the source of the obligation is varied, and may be a customary one, or one based on a treaty, or even a legal principle generally recognized by the international community. In the Rainbow Warrior case, for example, the arbitral tribunal stated that there is no distinction in international law between contractual and tortious liability, so any breach by a State of a duty, regardless of the source of the duty, gives rise to the responsibility of the State and therefore to an obligation to make reparation.¹ This case is very strong evidence of the broadness of the source of the obligation.\nThe broadness of the source of the obligation is conducive to the regulation of cyberwarfare. First, for States parties to cyberwarfare-related treaties, such as the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, a violation of the content of the treaty can constitute a direct breach of the obligation. Second, for countries not participating in the treaty, if the relevant practice of maintaining network security has been generally recognized in the international community and can become a kind of habit, the habit can also be used as a source of obligation, and if it does not comply with the habit, it is also possible to find that a country violates the obligation, which undoubtedly enlarges the scope of the main body needing to comply with the obligation, and allows more countries to consciously comply with the obligation. What's more, the identification and formation of general principles are essential for maintaining international law as a coherent legal system (Shao 2021). Therefore, sometimes principles can also govern the behavior of States. It should be noted, however, that even if a State commits certain acts of cyberattack against another State and causes damage, if it does not constitute a breach of an international obligation, it will not give rise to the legal responsibility of the author State.\n¹ Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (New Zealand v. France) (“Rainbow Warrior”), Award of 30 April 1990, 20 UNRIAA 215, para.75.\nCorrespondingly, attributability is then analyzed. Theoretically, all acts of individuals, corporations, or other entities in the sense of domestic law may be attributed to a State (Government) based on nationality. In dealing with this issue, the Draft Articles adopt a narrow approach, namely, the “overall control test”, whereby the only conduct that can be attributed to a State is that of State organs or other entities acting under the direction, control, or instigation of a State organ, which becomes an agent of the State at the time of the conduct (Kanehara 2019). As far as the attributability of the state in cyber warfare is concerned, if a cyber attack is initiated or directed by the state as the main body, the corresponding responsibility is borne by the state. In simple cases, the attributability of state responsibility can be quickly recognized. However, since the development of cyberwarfare, identifying the source of cyber-attacks is crucial to ensuring cybersecurity (Swate et al. 2024), its technical means have become increasingly flexible, and many attribution problems are caused by anonymous attacks, and the attackers can often easily hide their identities, which has brought great challenges to the tracking of the source of the attack. Even if the source of the attack is identified, the subject needs to be further clarified. The subject of a cyberattack can avoid being targeted by hiding or forging his identity in many ways, so pinpointing the subject is also a major challenge.\nIn addition, when a country helps another country to engage in internationally wrongful acts, the former also to the extent of the support, helps to bear state responsibility, but the main state responsibility still belongs to the wrongdoing state (Aust 2011). But regardless of the size of state responsibility, by analogy, in the context of cyberwarfare, if a country provides technical means or financial support and other help to other countries, in principle, it should also bear the corresponding responsibility, and if that State has both wrongful acts and breaches of its obligations, it may also satisfy the constituent elements of State responsibility, and thus bear State responsibility in cyberwarfare to the extent of the damage caused by that State.\n### Hierarchical construction of standards of proof\nAs a component of the constituent elements, whether it is the judgment of wrongfulness or the judgment of attributability, there is the problem of proof. In fact, for the legal field of the problem, the standard of proof has been extremely important, from the traditional theory of evidence, the standard of proof is the judge to consider and weigh the authenticity of the facts of the case to achieve the degree of proof, but also the burden of proof to provide the appropriate evidence to prove the facts of the case to achieve a certain standard (He and Wang 2017). The degree of standard of proof is directly related to the judge for the degree of conviction of the evidence, which naturally will affect the results of the judgment. Criminal law, civil law, and\nCheng and Li\nDE GRUYTER\nother substantive areas of law, after a long period of development, in their litigation process also have their standard of proof, although different standards for the results of the judgment have a decisive impact, the litigant naturally needs to try to meet the standard of proof. On the other hand, for the facts that have occurred, no one has the ability to  $100\\%$  reproduce the scene, they can only try to prove to maximize the proximity of the objective facts, thus providing judges with a good judgment environment so that judges as far as possible can make a reasonable judgment, and the standard of proof from this sense of understanding is also the embodiment of substantive justice.\nOutside the traditional field of substantive law, the standard of proof is also of great significance to the issue of international law. In international law, the composition of state responsibility needs to satisfy both illegal behavior and attributable elements, but the proof of the two elements is also a separate issue, whether the two standards of proof are consistent, and if not, what kind of standards should be used is an urgent discussion. As early as before the emergence of the problem of evidence in the field of networks, the International Court of Justice pointed out in the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua that the key to the solution to the problem lies not only in the process of attributing conduct to the law of a particular country but also in the search for substantial evidence before the process of legal attribution. It is thus clear that the question of the standard of proof is not simply an integral part of the question of the attribution of State responsibility, but is more relevant for independent discussion.\nAs far as the current situation is concerned, there is a lack of a uniform and clear standard of proof in international law. In the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice emphasized the principle of the free assessment of evidence, stating that within the limits of the Statute of the Court and the Rules of the Tribunal, the Court is free to assess the value of any evidence.3 While the persistent lack of uniform standards in international law has been detrimental to the development of proof, an analysis of the nature of the cases before the ICJ shows that there is a corresponding rationale for the absence of uniform standards of proof that the complexity and diversity of the cases before the ICJ make it difficult to arrive at a uniform standard that would be universally or primarily applicable to inter-State litigation (Watts 2000).\nIn addition, although the Court's deficiencies in the standard of proof may lead to subjective factors on the part of the judges affecting the decision of the case, in practice, the Court usually indicates in its judgments the standard of proof that it has adopted. Even if there is no expressly stated uniform standard, taking the standard of proof in a large number of judgments as a sample, it is still possible to analyze the issue of the standard of proof to one degree or another. Examining the decisions of ICJ, it can be found that the standard of proof adopted by ICJ basically draws on the system of standard of proof of the domestic courts of the common law system. According to different types of cases, the common law system of the standard of proof, according to the degree of strictness in descending order, can be divided into four types: (1) the criminal field is usually adopted with full certainty of “beyond a reasonable doubt”; (2) “clear and convincing proof”, which is highly probable but does not reach the level of incontrovertibility; (3) “preponderance of evidence”, which is usually adopted in civil proceedings and has a higher degree of reasonableness and probability; (4) prima facie evidence, which is merely required to prove indications of the correctness of an argument (Green 2009).\nThe standards of proof established for different types of cases are also of great significance in the context of cyberwarfare. Cyber-attacks are more covert and asymmetric than traditional attacks, and the degree of damage caused and the difficulty of investigation vary to different degrees, making evaluation more difficult than in traditional cases. Therefore, it is not practical to establish a uniform standard of proof, and a more reasonable approach should be to adopt different standards of proof according to the different degrees of impact brought about by cyberwarfare.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of cases have highlighted the intersection of cybercrime and cyberwarfare: operations with a clear cyberwarfare intent have incorporated tactical maneuvers normally associated with cybercrime. Cybercrime constitutes the criminal exploitation of digital systems to perpetrate unlawful activities through technological means (Hawdon 2021). Nowadays, the virtual nature, technological infrastructure, and limitless scalability of digital networks -- when combined with the misuse of big data analytics -- have paradoxically dissolved traditional national boundaries, transforming transnational criminal operations into borderless threats with globalized impact (Zhao and Cheng 2024). If the extent of cyberwarfare has reached the level of a criminal case, it should be strictly required to meet the standard of proof of a criminal case.\nTake the Shocknet virus, for example, which, in the course of cyberwarfare led to the damage of about 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz plant, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of Iranian centrifuges and delaying Iran's uranium enrichment program, in addition to the accidental spread of the Shocknet virus around the globe, which infected more than 100,000 computers. In terms of its impact, its nature has reached the seriousness of a criminal case. As Judge Higgins of the International\nCheng and Li\nDE GRUYTER\nCourt of Justice pointed out in his independent opinion in the Oil Platforms case, the more serious the allegations, the greater the degree of credibility of the evidence required.⁴ Therefore, in a case such as the Shocknet virus, which has already reached the standard of a criminal case, proof of the wrongfulness and attributability of the acts of the United States and Israel in the case will need to reach the level of beyond reasonable doubt.\nAs generative AI becomes widespread, the costs of creating and spreading viral false information, along with cross-border data storage, transfer, and processing expenses, are plummeting so that the frequency of cyber attacks is also on the rise (Cheng and Liu 2023). It is clearly unreasonable to apply the standards of cybercrime to all cyberattacks. A more rational approach would be to lower the burden of proof for cyberattacks that cause less damage and do not constitute a criminal case, similar to some of the standards of proof in civil litigation. But in any case, for the standard of proof of cyberwarfare is inappropriate to adopt the standard of prima facie evidence, \"prima facie evidence\" refers to \"sufficient to establish a fact or to establish a presumption, unless it is effectively rebutted\" evidence. A prima facie case can only mean that there is a possibility that the fact occurred, but it is not very convincing.\nMoreover, the application of that criterion to the determination of state responsibility would undoubtedly lead to a series of problems and increase the cost of dealing with cases because of its weak persuasiveness. For example, if a State was found to have committed a wrongful act merely because there was a possibility that it had done so, not only was there no basis in jurisprudence, but it would also be difficult for the international community to accept an assessment based on simple values. Additionally, the principle that the higher the gravity of the act, the higher the standard of proof is consistently reflected in academic discussions of international law, particularly concerning the International Court of Justice (Bills 2023). If a state is found to be liable for the high cost of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, it need only meet such a simple standard of proof, which clearly violates this principle.\n## 3.3 Normative boundaries of the deterrent factors of responsibility\nThe wrongfulness of an act is one of the elements of the law of state responsibility, and the absence of wrongfulness does not entail the responsibility of the state, a situation that can also be referred to as a cause of impediment to state responsibility, with an emphasis on the analysis of two cases: self-defense and countermeasures.\n⁴ Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.S.), I.C.J. Judgment of 6 November 2003, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, para.33.\nDE GRUYTER\nState responsibility in cyberwarfare\n11\nArticle 51 of the Charter of the United Nations states: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security”. The expression “armed attack” should be distinguished from “use of force” in Article 2(4). When analyzed using textual interpretation, it is clear that the degree of “armed attack” is much stronger than that of “use of force”.\nMoreover, the International Court of Justice, in the Nicaragua case, held that all attacks of force belonged to the use of force, but not all uses of force constituted an attack of force, and that only those that were the most serious and had a significant scale and consequences could constitute an “armed attack” (Leigh 1984). According to the relevant judgment, there is a difference in intensity between the two. The significance of this distinction should also be reflected in cyberattacks. If a cyber-attack by a State only constitutes a use of force under Article 2(4) but does not constitute an armed attack under Article 51, it is certainly a serious internationally wrongful act in breach of an obligation under international law of jus cogens, but the injured State can only take non-forceful “countermeasures” as provided for in the Draft Articles. Once such measures are found to constitute an armed attack, the injured State may invoke Article 51 to legitimately exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defense, including the use of force.\nCountermeasures in international law are non-forcible measures taken by an injured State against a State responsible for committing an internationally wrongful act to induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations, with the intention of restoring reciprocity between the parties (Omura 2010). Accordingly, countermeasures do not normally involve the use of force (Jia 2022). They are lawful, provided that they meet the conditions set out in Part Three of the Draft Articles.5 Countermeasures are generally used in cases where the use of force does not rise to the level of an armed attack and, by analogy, in the field of cyberwarfare in cases where the level of the attack is not overly aggressive. Cases such as the SolarWinds supply chain attack and the Stuxnet virus attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities have reached the level of an armed attack in terms of both the means used and the damage\n5 ICJ, Application of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia v. Greece), Judgment of 5 December 2011, para.164.\nCheng and Li\nDE GRUYTER\ncaused, and the right of self-defense can be triggered, no longer at the level of countermeasures.\nTraditional remedies such as compensation and restitution take some time to realize, and if one is only passively waiting for remedies there is a risk of further expanding losses, so as more timely remedies, both self-defense and countermeasures are necessary to avoid the expansion of losses to the maximum extent possible before traditional remedies can be obtained. Neither the right of self-defense nor the exercise of countermeasures is without limits. Customary law also limits the exercise of the right of self-defense, $^{6}$ and the use of force in self-defense remains wrongful if it is accompanied by a violation of international humanitarian law or human rights since special provisions of international humanitarian law (such as the prohibition on retaliatory measures against civilians or prisoners of war) and certain human rights are non-derogable in all circumstances (Crawford 2002).\nSimilarly, the scope of countermeasures is limited, as draft article 50, Paragraph 1, provides that countermeasures shall not affect: (a) the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; (b) obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; (c) obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; (d) other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. In addition, Article 50, Paragraph 2, makes it clear that a State taking countermeasures is not relieved from fulfilling its obligations: (a) under any dispute settlement procedure applicable between it and the responsible State; (b) to respect the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents, premises, archives, and documents.\n## 3.4 The practical significance of the realization mechanism of state responsibility\nThe state responsibility system is not only a rule implementation tool but also a carrier of the international community's value consensus. On this basis, once the state responsibility is recognized, it is necessary to fulfill the corresponding reality of the obligation. Attribution is not the ultimate goal; using attribution to further solve the problem is the significance of the state responsibility recognition. Under the background of cyber war, the significance of the reality is still worth paying attention to. State responsibility is assumed in various ways; here, we focus on analyzing the two main ways of restitution and compensation.\n$^{6}$ ICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep. (1996) 226, para.41.\nFirst of all, we analyze restitution, as the content of the remedy system with the largest scope of remedies, because it can directly eliminate the consequences of wrongdoing, Article 35 of the Draft Articles lists Restitution as a priority remedy. The conditions for the application of restitution included the principles of physical possibility and proportionality, which also required that restitution should not impose a “disproportionate burden” on the responsible State, such as requiring a poor State to bear a large share of the cost of restoration, which was clearly impractical and might be exempted. While the elimination of wrongful consequences is well conceived, and in practice it has been implemented to a certain extent, resulting in more effective State responsibility, restitution also faces contemporary challenges, such as the creation of irreversible damage. While it is naturally clear that nuclear contamination, species extinction, and the like cannot be truly restored in the traditional sense, it is also possible to cause irreversible damage in the context of cyberattacks.\nTake the SolarWinds supply chain attack as an example, the Russian intelligence service hijacked the U.S. SolarWinds software update by implanting malicious code to infiltrate the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and nine other federal agencies and hundreds of enterprises. This case not only resulted in the long-term exposure of intelligence networks and the leakage of sensitive data but also called into question the credibility of global IT supply chain security standards and led to a shift to “zero-trust” architectures and a sharp increase in the cost of international cooperation. While the technical damage can be remedied through compensation, the erosion of democracy is likely to be irreversible, as the cyber-attack has largely eroded public trust in the government's cybersecurity capabilities, which will be difficult to rebuild in a short period, and difficult to fully restore through restitution. Therefore, although restitution can theoretically maximize the compensation for the damage caused, it is obvious that it cannot be fully compensated in practice, and other remedies are needed to supplement it.\nSecondly, as one of the mainstream remedies, Article 31 of the Draft Articles establishes the obligation of the responsible State to provide “full reparation” for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act, which covers both material and moral damages, reflecting the purpose of the elimination of all the consequences of the injury. The principle of the Chorzów Factory case of the Permanent Court of International Justice, of 1928, also provides evidence of this: it establishes that reparation is required to restore the injured State to the “state it would have been in had the wrongful act not been committed”. Further analysis of the types of reparation and the scope of application reveals that reparation can be very broad, ranging from material to moral damages, from direct, quantifiable property damage to\nindirect, reasonably foreseeable, consequential damages, such as loss of profits due to interruption of trade. Indirect damages, however, often require stricter proof of causation, and the calculation of compensation was controversial at the current stage. In any case, as the mainstream way of assuming state responsibility, the existence of compensation is also of practical significance to the realization of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, which requires less time cost and can more efficiently compensate for the interests of the victimized state than the institutional correction and other methods.\n## Core dilemmas in the determination of state responsibility\nThe determination of state responsibility is of great significance, and can lead to real consequences such as restitution and compensation, but in the context of cyberwar, the core problems of the determination of state responsibility need to be paid attention to, mainly including the normative transformation obstacles of the technical attribution, the paradigm conflict of the application of the right of self-defense, and the systemic failure of the mechanism of responsibility assumption. Failure to analyze these dilemmas and propose solutions will make it difficult to trigger the consequences of state responsibility, which will not be conducive to the resolution of international disputes.\n### Normative transformation barriers to technical attribution\nThe MITRE ATT&CK framework, a widely adopted knowledge base of attack behaviors in the current cybersecurity field, can provide technical references for cyber-attack traceability by standardizing the description of attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures (Al-Sada et al. 2024; Georgiadou et al. 2021). However, the transformation of its technical references to legal evidence is facing difficulties.\nPrimarily, the paradigm conflict between technical logic and legal logic hinders the transformation of technical indicators into legal evidence to a certain extent. ATT&CK framework is based on the identification of attack behavioral patterns, such as the “credential dump + lateral movement” mode of APT29, attackers often use the system's functions and tools to operate by modifying the system configuration or using legitimate tools and other methods to move laterally, ATT&CK framework for the identification of the attack behavior pattern to derive technical indicators. However, according to Article 8 of the Draft Articles: The conduct of a person or\ngroup of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact, acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. It can be seen that a finding of State responsibility under international law requires proof of “effective control” of the attacking act in relation to the will of the State. For example, in the 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack, attackers injected malicious code called “Sunburst” into SolarWinds' flagship Orion software (Marelli 2022), even though security firms identified SUNBURST's TTPs through ATT&CK, such as T1059.001 command line interface abuse, but these technical characteristics can not directly prove that the Russian intelligence services of the main responsibility, the United States cited the ATT&CK report accusing Russia, but the international community in general to the “lack of direct chain of evidence” to question its legal effectiveness. In this case, even if it is recognized that there is indeed an attack, due to the inability to prove that the behavior is directed or controlled by a country, it is also difficult to use the technical indicators as evidence in the legal sense.\nSubsequently, the existence of intermediate nodes easily leads to a broken chain of evidence. Attackers commonly adopt the anonymizing technical architecture of “springboard server + virtual private network (VPN)”. Taking the 2016 Bangladesh central bank theft case as an example, although the C2 server IP of the SWIFT transaction instructions was traced to the Philippines, further investigation showed that the server was a puppet host controlled by the North Korean Lazarus group. This kind of multi-layer hopping leads to greater difficulty in technical traceability, and the result of traceability may also cause a break in the chain of evidence.\nAnother example is the attack on targets in China by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) through the QUANTUM attack platform, in which a number of modules are involved in concealing the identity of the attack, including QUANTUMBOT Module -- through the hijacking of the botnet command and control of network traffic, manipulating the botnet to launch attack activities and to hide the traces of the U.S. National Security Agency's hacking attacks.; QUANTUMBISCUIT Module -- builds a proxy springboard for quantum injection attacks against an attack target to prevent the attack from being detected retroactively; QUANTUMPHANTOM Module -- provides the technical ability to utilize network link intermediate node hijacking technology to achieve the hiding of the source of the attack, preventing the U.S. National Security Agency's cyberattacks against other countries from being traced back (Wei 2023). The use of multiple anonymization techniques undoubtedly creates a great obstacle to traceability work. Even if the source of the attack can be located accurately in the end, the identity of the operating subject behind the attack still needs to be further identified, and the attacker can be disguised as other countries/organizations or fake IP addresses, etc. to confuse the traceability (Schmitt 2017). The existence of intermediate nodes also makes it difficult to form a\nchain of evidence. The objective existence of obvious cyber attacks due to problems in the chain of evidence may not be able to carry out a trial in the end and even more accurately determine the responsibility of the state and solve the problem.\nIn addition, the “falsifiability” of technical indicators also weakens their probative value in practice. An important manifestation of this is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). It is widely recognized as the most sophisticated and powerful category of security threats (Ahmad et al. 2019). APTs are engineered by resourced, disciplined threat actors capable of sustained operations through systematic technology exploitation, blending expertise, funding, and structured coordination to maintain persistence (Maisey 2014; Mansfield-Devine 2014). APT organizations often falsify attack signatures through False Flag operations. The identification of false flags is inherently complex, primarily because attackers systematically conceal their actions while simultaneously framing innocent entities for malicious conduct (Rid and Buchanan 2015). Conducting a false flag operation in the cyber realm is fundamentally distinct and far simpler compared to its execution in the physical domain (Goodman 2010). For example, in the 2017 NotPetya ransomware incident, ATT&CK-based T1486 disk encryption analysis initially pointed to North Korea, but subsequent code homology analysis revealed a link to the Russian Sandworm organization. This type of technological misdirection makes the judicial application of the ATT&CK framework a “reasonable suspicion” challenge. As counterfeiting technologies evolve, the ATT&CK framework should also evolve with the times and develop more accurate techniques for identifying forgeries, or else the credibility of the technical indicators it produces may be further diminished in the face of the difficulty of transferring technical indicators to legal evidence.\n### Paradigm conflicts in the application of the right of self-defense\nEven in the face of cyberattacks, the exercise of the right of self-defense and countermeasures is not unlimited and still needs to comply with certain requirements, so it is still necessary to make a clearer discussion on the boundaries of the legality of the use of the right of self-defense and countermeasures in cyberwarfare.\nAs mentioned in the previous article, as to the question of whether cyber warfare constitutes the use of force under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, the “scale and consequence theory” proposed by Prof. Michael Schmit has the highest degree of acceptance at present. As long as the analysis is conducted according to the multiple indicators of scale and consequence, and the cyber-attack is considered to be a case of the use of force, then countermeasures or even the exercise of the right to self-defense can be taken. The most controversial issue at present is that the\nright to determine the use of force is in the hands of more developed countries, and the seemingly objective judgment criteria are to some extent mixed with subjective factors.\nAs is widely known, the Tallinn Manual edited by Prof. Michael Schmit, as a more authoritative and important reference document for the study of cyber warfare, has seven of the eight assessment criteria for determining whether the use of force constitutes a use of force, which are completely consistent with the criteria advocated by Prof. Michael Schmit himself. The criteria are somewhat arbitrary and subjective. For example, Professor Schmit himself, when applying these factors to analyze the 2007 cyberattack against Estonia, concluded that the attack constituted a use of force. Other scholars, however, have argued that the opposite conclusion that the cyberattack did not constitute a use of force can easily be reached by relying on these same factors, which can be easily manipulated in their application to reach conclusions that benefit the geostrategic objectives of the country being analyzed (Nguyen 2013).\nMoreover, when applied to cyberattacks, the “scale and consequence” standard has a fatal logical flaw: a given consequence of the same scale and severity can be produced by the use of force as well as by non-forceful means. The loss of life and the destruction of forests and land in a downstream country as a result of the discharge of toxic substances into a river by an upstream country or the starvation and economic turmoil of a country as a result of economic sanctions imposed by one country on another, are in themselves highly analogous to those that would normally result from the use of force. However, in general perception, these acts hardly constitute a use of force in international law or even an internationally wrongful act. In this way, such acts can escape legal sanction even if they have consequences comparable to those of the use of force. Cyberattacks, however, may be recognized as a use of force and subject to liability if they have the same legal consequences. This logical loophole exists partly because of the arbitrariness and subjectivity of the judgment standard. Western scholars with stronger discursive power often lower the threshold for the use of the right to self-defense through an expansive interpretation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, and in this regard, seemingly reasonable standards can often be interpreted to achieve political goals.\nIn addition to lowering the threshold of the right to self-defense through acts of interpretation, the United States has also put forward the “Defend Forward” strategy, which is an offensive defense strategy it has put forward in recent years in the field of cyberspace security, aiming to respond to cyber threats using proactive strikes and pre-emptive strikes. The United States Cyber Command has emphasized the need to adopt a “forward posture” in cyberspace by accessing non-Department of Defense networks or systems to weaken an adversary's cyber capabilities in advance and prevent it from taking action. Such an assertion should be relegated to the academic\ncategory of preventive self-defense, which is advocated by a few Western countries and Western scholars, but is not and should not be supported in existing international treaties and customary international law -- it means “granting the major powers an almost unrestricted license to use force” (Klabbers 2013). In summary, the definition of cyberwarfare and the various criteria for judging it, as well as the proposal of strategies such as “forward defense,” are undoubtedly suspected of serving political goals. Professor O'Connell also believes that “cyberwarfare” is a “wrong war”. It is essentially an “invented” problem in the context of the increasing militarization of cybersecurity policies of major Western countries (O'Connell 2012).\n### Systemic failure of responsibility mechanisms\nThe decentralized nature of cyberspace forms a structural contradiction with the “state-centered” responsibility framework of traditional international law, resulting in an imbalance in the distribution of responsibility between states and non-state actors, rigid rules of evidence, and a lack of enforcement mechanisms.\nFirst, the traditional logic of attribution has loopholes that need to be filled in the context of cyberspace, and the traditional theoretical criterion of “effective control” has limitations. This criterion originated from the 1986 case of Nicaragua v. United States, in which the ICJ made it clear that to attribute the conduct of non-state actors to a state (the United States), it is necessary to prove that the state exercised “effective control” over the specific military operation. Not only does the state provide general support such as funding, weapons, or training, but it also needs to have actual command over the specific unlawful action, i.e. the state needs to directly direct or specifically instruct the attack. However, the “outsourcing of tools” in cyberattacks has led to a high degree of invisibility of the state-attacker nexus. For example, in the case of the Iranian APT34 attack on Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in 2021, although the technical traceability showed that the attack tools were linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, it was not possible to prove that their actions were “specifically directed” by the state. In the context of cyberwarfare, “effective control” has the risk of being too rigid, leading to the impossibility of attribution, and the choice of whether to include other judgment criteria in such cases has been widely discussed, among which the theory of “overall control” is of particular research value.\nThe theory of “Overall Control” originated from the judgment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the case of Prosecutor v. Tadić. The Tribunal held that the conduct of a state can be attributed\nDE GRUYTER\nState responsibility in cyberwarfare\n19\nto the state even if it does not directly direct a specific attack, if the state has a strategic level of domination over non-state actors, including the provision of funds, equipment, training, and coordination of operations. From a conceptual analysis, this standard is largely different from the “effective control” standard, which has a lower threshold for attribution, and if the case of Nicaragua v. United States mentioned above were to be handled according to this standard, the United States would likely be found liable.\nIn the context of cyberwarfare, the anonymity of cyberattacks, technology dependence, and the ambiguity of actors make the traditional standard of attribution challenging, and the “overall control” theory has potential advantages in some respects. The criterion is superior in terms of identification in response to the prevalence of indirect support models. States often support cyberattacks through technological enablement, infrastructure harboring, or strategic guidance. Such behavior is more consistent with the “strategic dominance” characteristic of “overall control” than with the “specific instruction” requirement of “effective control”. For example, Russia’s relationship with APT28 is alleged to be in line with “overall control” in that the Russians provide technical resources but do not directly direct specific attacks, and the international community generally believes that the organization is supported by the Russian government and that the motivation for its attacks is closely related to Russia’s national interests.\nAccording to “overall control”, it is possible to hold Russia responsible, but according to the traditional “effective control” standard, it is difficult to hold it accountable. In addition, while the technical traceability of cyberattacks often only proves a continuing connection between the attacker and the state, and it is difficult to obtain evidence of direct orders, the “overall control” standard eliminates the need to prove a control relationship between the state and the attacker, and allows for a more efficient allocation of responsibility. Although the “overall control” standard has its role in the context of cyberwarfare, it is still difficult to accept it as the standard for attribution of responsibility in the current mainstream view, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia Serbia and Montenegro, the ICJ explicitly rejected the standard of “overall control” and insisted on the strict interpretation of “effective control”, which can provide a reference basis for the attribution of responsibility for cyber warfare. Moreover, there is a risk of political abuse if a more lenient standard is adopted, as when the U.S. sanctioned a Chinese technology company based on “overall control” in the absence of publicly available technical evidence to support it. While this standard is not appropriate in all cases, it is clear that the traditional standard is not fully applicable, and the international community\n Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, General List No. 91.\nshould continue to explore new, more reasonable standards in practice to address the limitations of the traditional standard.\nSecondly, the traditional attribution criterion is also difficult in practice. The system of attribution of responsibility for non-state actors is not perfect, which leads to the failure of the mechanism for assuming responsibility to play a full role, potentially allowing non-state actors to avoid legal penalties, especially transnational science and technology enterprises to circumvent the responsibility of the behavior at this stage has not been effectively resolved. For example, Zero-Day Vulnerability, as a security flaw that has not yet been discovered or fixed by software vendors, has a unique “gray area” in the trading market due to the ambiguity of its participants, uses, and legal attributes. There are cases where private vulnerability brokers sell zero-day vulnerabilities to governments, but international law does not clarify whether such transactions constitute “assisting in the commission of cyber-attacks”. In terms of the actual situation at this stage, international legislation is undoubtedly lagging behind, and existing cybercrime conventions have not yet explicitly stipulated specific provisions directly targeting “vulnerability trading”.\nIn addition, the EU's “Network Resilience Act” only requires vendors to establish a vulnerability handling process, does not regulate third-party transactions. In China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Internet Information Office, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly issued the “Provisions on the Management of Security Vulnerabilities in Network Products”, which clearly states that no organization or individual shall illegally collect, sell or distribute information on security vulnerabilities in network products, but the standard of “illegality” lacks specific interpretation, and loopholes exist in the determination of “illegality”. The U.S. “Vulnerability Equity Program” is not binding, vendors can refuse to cooperate. It can be seen that the existing law for the actors did not make comprehensive provisions, so the use of zero-day vulnerabilities in cyber attacks on multinational technology enterprises has the possibility of circumventing legal responsibility, liability mechanism due to the lack of comprehensiveness, but also may be further dysfunctional.\n## Reconstructing the path of state responsibility in cyber warfare\nUnder the increasingly complex background of cyber warfare, it is of great practical significance to find a more reasonable path of state responsibility. On the one hand, further improvement of the traditional attribution mechanism can enhance the persuasive power of the attribution; on the other hand, through the innovation of\njudicial procedures, the realization of state responsibility can be further refined to avoid the emergence of unreasonable responsibility which is too light or too heavy. State responsibility in cyberwarfare has room for improvement in both judgment standard and realization, and if it can be adjusted under the common recognition of the international community, it can to a certain extent avoid subjective factors affecting the judgment and assumption of state responsibility.\n### Improving the attribution mechanism\nOne of the important reasons why the attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyber warfare has a certain subjective element is that there is no universally recognized technical attribution mechanism, which to a certain extent has led to the divergence of attribution standards among countries for cyber warfare. Although there is more authoritative literature such as the Tallinn Manual for reference, the nature of international law is, after all, soft law. While States can use soft law to solve the problem of coordinated gaming (Guzman and Meyer 2010), international law is not as binding as it could be if a State's political aspirations need to be realized urgently. In addition, if some countries do not sign an international treaty on cybersecurity, and the content of the treaty has not developed into a custom, a considerable number of countries can claim that they do not carry out activities in the cyber field in accordance with the rules in the treaty. Moreover, even for those countries that have signed such treaties, the cost of withdrawing from them is not high. Finally, although relevant documents are constantly being issued, how to deal with conflicts between them is a subjective process. From this point of view, the mere formulation of international law on cybersecurity is relatively limited in enhancing the rationality of attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nIn this context, promoting the international community to establish a technical attribution institution can be a better choice. First of all, compared with soft law, the institution established under the wide recognition of the international community is more persuasive and can avoid to a greater extent the situation that countries choose the judgment standard of state responsibility based on their own political opinions. Secondly, the establishment of a technical attribution body can help promote policy coordination and resource sharing among countries in the field of cybersecurity. Through multilateral cooperation, countries can fully express their demands, formulate unified international legal standards to deal with transnational cyber threats under the principle of pursuing the greatest common interests, conduct in-depth discussions on reasonable motions to ensure the comprehensiveness and\nextensiveness of the attribution standards and reduce the troubles caused by the differences in the laws of different countries.\nFurthermore, technical attribution organizations can establish an information-sharing platform to share the latest information on cyberattacks and technological advances promptly, and such an information-sharing mechanism can improve the ability of countries to respond to cyber threats. For example, the Enhanced Attribution (EA) program initiated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is very informative. The goal of the EA program is to develop techniques to generate operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent and independent malicious cyber campaigns and to create a methodology by which this information can be shared with multiple parties without jeopardizing the intelligence sources and methodologies. By collecting, monitoring, and understanding adversary cyberattack operations in the red space, the program is expected to be divided into three technical areas (TAs) that will work in parallel with each other. They will span three 18-month phases, after which the agency will step in to obtain high-quality results. This activity will undoubtedly empower the attribution criteria with more precise technology, which is expected to target the subjects of wrongdoing with greater precision. Such meaningful criteria, if adopted by technical attribution agencies, would certainly contribute to the standardization of technical attribution.\nBased on the establishment of technical attribution institutions and the development of technical attribution criteria, the criterion of “effective control” in the traditional attribution criteria needs to be expanded. The obstacle to the normative transformation of technical attribution mentioned earlier is largely due to the rigid application of the criterion of “effective control”. In light of the complexity of cyberwarfare models, the concept of “material support” should be introduced, so that if a State systematically provides vulnerabilities, infrastructure, or funding to non-State actors that cause the same level of consequences as a direct direct order, it will be held liable even if there is no direct order. Although this approach has not become a common practice in the international community, the continued rigid application of the traditional criterion of proving a directive relationship will undoubtedly allow certain subjects to avoid the risk of assuming State responsibility, which is difficult to accept in terms of jurisprudence. Therefore, based on the principle of the “effective control” criterion, consideration should be given to the use of “substantial support” to make judgments when the act of support has a significant impact and is directly related to the acts or purposes of the supported party, thus constituting substantial support. The adoption of such a criterion is not only legally sound but also creates conditions for the application of technical attribution to a greater extent. The adoption of the “substantial support” criterion for attribution when the support provided by a State can be traced back to that State by technical\nmeans and it can be established that the State providing the assistance constitutes substantial support can avoid the rigid application of the traditional criterion, which would jeopardize the results obtained through technical tracing.\n### Adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism\nThe establishment of an international attribution agency is certainly of great significance to the determination of state responsibility, but it only involves the work of attribution, and if we want to comprehensively reconstruct the responsibility of the state in cyberwarfare, it must be built on the basis of a broad consensus among all countries, and the blueprint for the establishment of an international attribution agency as mentioned in the previous section is also built on the basis of the consensus of all countries. Therefore, the consensus of all countries is a fundamental condition. It is obviously unrealistic for the international community to reach consensus in the short term, because the more vulnerable countries may consider that the adjustment of rules has nothing to do with them. In this case, the big countries are more important to play a pioneering role and set an example through concrete actions. The adjustment of the multilateral cooperation mechanism is conducive to the rationalization of the judgment of national responsibility in cyber warfare, and is also conducive to the regulation of the cyber offensive behavior of individual countries, so that all countries in the international community can benefit from it. The specific cooperation mechanism can be adjusted as follows:\nForemost, regional confidence-building measures should be further developed. The most important is the establishment of a cyberspace “hotline mechanism”, which can reduce the information gap through effective communication and avoid the emergence of unnecessary cyberattacks. As early as during the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, this “hotline mechanism” demonstrated its important value. During the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, both sides in the nuclear arms race and military confrontation realized that the lack of direct communication channels could lead to miscalculation and escalation of the conflict. In 1963, the U.S. and the Soviet Union established the “hotline mechanism”, which allowed leaders to communicate quickly, directly, and privately in emergency situations, thereby eliminating the risk of nuclear war resulting from communication delays or misunderstandings of each other's actions. To this day, this mechanism is used as an important tool. In 2022, during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the U.S. and Russia established a military hotline to avoid miscalculations and military accidents. The “hotline mechanism” has gone a long way in avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings and remains indispensable in the context of cyberwarfare. 2020s attack on India's power grid could be a case in point. on October 12, 2020, Mumbai, India, experienced a massive blackout that affected\ncritical infrastructure, including stock exchanges and healthcare facilities. The New York Times reported that the blackout may have been linked to China, claiming that “Chinese malware hacked into India's power supply control system” in order to pressure India in the India-China border standoff. Although this claim was later clarified by Recorded Future, a cybersecurity company mentioned in the report, and officially denied by Indian officials, it still caused a certain degree of damage to China's image, and if the “hotline mechanism” had been adopted at that time, it could have avoided the misleading public opinion and the waste of investigation resources. This shows that China, the United States, Russia and other countries have taken the lead in setting up real-time communication channels, clarifying in a timely manner in the event of miscalculation, and reducing unnecessary costs and expenditures, which is still necessary in the context of cyber warfare.\nConcomitantly, adjusting the public-private partnership. In the context of cyberwarfare, cooperation between countries is certainly important, but operators often also have a large amount of relevant information. To further reduce the cost of controlling the occurrence of cyberwarfare, it is indispensable for operators and governments to jointly build a threat intelligence-sharing platform. Adopting this model not only facilitates research between countries based on a large number of cases provided by operators to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the cases, but also reduces the effort of searching for cyberattacks from all over the world, saves time and cost, and efficiently builds identification and defense measures. This model has been reflected in the JCDC model in the U.S. JCDC participants that include organizations and operators from both the public and private sectors, covering service providers, infrastructure operators, cybersecurity companies, and companies in the critical infrastructure industry.\nIn addition, JCDC constituents include specific government agencies designated by Congress, such as the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It is through the operator-government co-built threat intelligence-sharing platform that the JCDC shares real-time information through multiple platforms, such as Slack, the Homeland Security Information Network HSIN, and the GovDelivery service, to ensure that there is continuous dialog and collaboration among the participants. This also sets the stage for the development of proactive cyber defense programs to mitigate the most serious risks before threats become visible. Moreover, “gatekeeper liability” for technology companies can be introduced, as Article 6 of The EU's Digital Services Act indicates that “where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, the service provider shall not be liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that the provider”. By analyzing the exemption\nfrom liability of the hosting service provider of the online platform and the relevant conditions, it can be seen that the online platform should have a certain degree of responsibility for reviewing the information provided by the service recipient (Lefouili and Madio 2022). For content that is clearly of a cyber-attack nature, the provider of the online service should exercise a certain degree of scrutiny, in particular, cloud computing giants are required to filter malicious traffic, or else they may be considered to bear the corresponding joint and several liability.\nFinally, a “digital ceasefire zone” system could be included in the scope of discussion. Healthcare, energy and other livelihood areas are of great importance, and if they are subjected to cyberattacks, they will often lead to more serious consequences, and should be categorized as no-attack zones, so that if certain countries carry out non-compliant cyberattacks, violators will be automatically triggered by the United Nations to sanction them. According to the context that cyber-peacekeeping has been suggested as a strategic framework to address the multifaceted challenges posed by diverse manifestations of cyber conflict (Dorn 2017), in order to support the implementation of the system, we can also consider the establishment of a “network peacekeeping force”, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to send technical teams to assist in the restoration of network services in conflict areas. The reason why it should be coordinated by the ITU is that, under its supervision, the technical teams will be able to use more reasonable means to respond to cyber attacks. Shortly after the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, controversy erupted over the way Ukraine set up the International Volunteer Team for Cyber Defense to carry out cyberattacks against Russian targets, and its development of tools, which allows any digital device to become part of a DDoS attack network, was deemed to be a violation of international cyber norms. The existence of a unified body for coordination would make it possible to bring the corresponding tools into line with the principle of proportionality.\n### Innovations in judicial procedures\nIn addition to further clarifying the criteria for attribution of state responsibility and minimizing the frequency of cyberwar through multilateral cooperation mechanisms, there is also a need for innovation in the judicial process, because most cyberwars are ultimately handled through the judicial process, and therefore adopting a more feasible judicial process is conducive to a more reasonable distribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nFirstly, the International Court of Justice could create a panel of judges specialized in cyberspace cases, allowing for the submission of electronic evidence and anonymous witnesses. There is a precedent for such a special chamber, namely\nthe Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which is a special judicial procedure set up within the ITLOS to hear disputes between States arising from the exploration and exploitation of the international seabed area. In response to the increasingly complex cyberwarfare, which should be handled more rigorously, and the identification and allocation of State responsibility should be more reasonable, the traditional team of judges may not be able to make accurate judgments when faced with the special field of cyber. The idea that selecting judges with relevant backgrounds enhances efficiency is supported by academic research, which suggests that a judge's prior experience and characteristics can influence their decision-making (Basabe-Serrano 2019). At this time, the selection of judges with cyber background to form a team specializing in cyberspace cases is conducive to more efficiently identifying the nature of cyberattacks and, with the help of increasingly developed technological means, more reasonably allocating state responsibility on the basis of technical indicators.\nMeanwhile, through the leading role of the International Court of Justice, countries can also select judges with expertise in international law, cyber technology, data protection, and other fields through a special selection mechanism to form domestic teams specialized in handling cyber cases. From this, we can see that such a move can not only further solve the problem of cyber warfare among countries but also serve as an inspiration for the handling of cyber cases within countries. The team of judges can cooperate with other international organizations (such as Interpol and the United Nations Office on Cybercrime) to analyze the ever-emerging new forms and the constantly updating and iterative advanced technologies in order to formulate more reasonable judgment standards and solution measures, so as to jointly address the global challenges in cyberspace.\nIn addition, consideration could be given to legitimizing “preventive countermeasures” by allowing for pre-emptive defences against highly probable cyberattacks under the authority of the Security Council. Referring to Article 50 of the UN Charter on temporary measures against economic sanctions, UN Member States, in their actions for the maintenance of international peace and security, should refrain from any action that might widen a dispute or aggravate a situation. And the UN Security Council is tasked with resolving international disputes and can establish frameworks for peaceful settlements, aligning with Article 1 of the UN Charter so that Member States should take appropriate steps to prevent the extension or aggravation of the dispute in accordance with the recommendations of the UNSC (Alipour 2024). It was mentioned earlier that countermeasures must be a means to be taken only if there is a realistic attack. However, in the context of cyberwarfare, it is often too late to take countermeasures if one has to wait until there is an attack. Due to the intensity and scope of cyberattacks, a country's cyber system may not be able to function after an attack, let alone take defensive measures. Under such\ncircumstances, it is particularly important to formulate “preventive countermeasures” with reference to Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations. This kind of prevention cannot be advanced indefinitely and should be judged according to the recommendations of the UN Security Council. However, the international community needs to discuss in depth what kind of preventive measures should be taken in order to arrive at a standard. In any case, even if this kind of advance measure is recognized, it still needs to be regulated by the corresponding standards, or else powerful countries can launch disproportionate “preventive countermeasures” against less dangerous cyberattacks in pursuit of their own national political demands, which is contrary to the original purpose of the measure.\nWhile considering innovations in the judicial process, there is also a need for flexibility in the use of various methods to solve the problems that arise in the process, such as the use of legal discourse. In addressing the dual imperatives of legislative innovation and jurisprudential reconceptualization, legal discourse analysis as a vital interdisciplinary instrument, offers multidimensional frameworks to decode evolving normative constructs within contemporary governance systems (Neuwirth 2023). The degree of formality in legal language mirrors the solemn nature of judicial proceedings, whereas the presence or absence of polite expressions can signal deference, confrontational intent, or calculated positioning. These deliberate language patterns fundamentally shape both the courtroom environment and participants' interpretations of interactions, ultimately guiding behavioral responses throughout legal exchanges (Mısır and Akın 2024). In addition, the refinement of legal discourse patterning can be enhanced by studying a large number of cases in the European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union issues its rulings in 23 legally binding linguistic versions, reflecting the mandate established under Article 217 of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. This foundational provision, originally enacted as the European Council's inaugural legislative instrument, constitutionally guarantees that every member state's national language maintains equal juridical standing as an official working language of the Union (Trklja 2024). Based on the breadth of these cases, summarizing them will undoubtedly be beneficial for a more accurate use of legal language.\nUltimately, in the process of optimization, the participation of artificial intelligence is an irreversible trend, and the various advantages of artificial intelligence can undoubtedly improve efficiency, but the existence of hidden loopholes in various aspects of technology, ethics and other aspects also need to be paid attention to. Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transnational challenge demanding coordinated governance architectures, necessitating the establishment of multilateral regulatory systems capable of ensuring operational synergy, policy harmonization, and adaptive scalability across jurisdictions (Neuwirth 2024). And transitioning to centralized regulatory frameworks proves indispensable for steering generative AI\ndevelopment along ethically aligned trajectories (Cheng and Liu 2024). To effectively address existential risks in artificial intelligence development, institutionalizing ethical guardrails through a “Digital Humanism” framework becomes imperative. This paradigm prioritizes human-centric imperatives by safeguarding species-wide wellbeing and systemic security, while strategically decoupling technological advancement from zero-sum competition. Such an approach ensures that technological evolution maintains symbiotic alignment with civilizational priorities (Cheng and Gong 2024). Today sanctions and anti-sanctions have evolved into a dominant strategic pattern within contemporary geopolitical interactions (Gu and Zhao 2023), which makes it all the more important that more rational judicial procedures be used to mitigate the growing conflict.\n## Conclusions\nThe accelerated militarization of cyberspace has plunged the state responsibility system into a “triple normative dilemma”: first, the transformation of technical evidence into legal facts has led to the failure of the attribution mechanism; second, the hermeneutical controversy over the boundaries of the right to self-defense has triggered a crisis of the legitimacy of the countermeasures; and third, the vacuum in the allocation of responsibility due to the involvement of non-State actors has resulted in the systematic failure of the enforcement mechanism. These structural impediments not only undermine the deterrent effect of international law, but also contribute to the “low-cost-high-benefit” nature of cyberwarfare, which continues to induce opportunistic tactics by state actors.\nWhile existing governance frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0's “principle of equivalence of effects” and the Convention on Cybercrime's territoriality provision provide guidance on rules at the local level, they are not able to cope with complex cyberconflicts due to institutional fragmentation and technological adaptability deficiencies. For example, the Tallinn Manual's 2.0 Rule 69's eight-dimensional assessment model of the threshold for the use of force faces an attenuation of its explanatory power when dealing with generative AI-driven cognitive warfare; and the Budapest Convention's Mutual Legal Assistance Mechanism is in an implementation dilemma due to the anonymity of cryptocurrencies.\nTo solve the above dilemmas, it is urgent to build a three-in-one path of “technical verification, rule iteration, and mechanism synergy” to reconfigure the responsibility: (1) technical empowerment of attribution mechanism: building a verifiable attribution system, and realizing the transformation of MITRE ATT&CK framework into a judicial system; (2) adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism, building regional confidence measures, strengthening public-private partnership, and strengthening the\nDE GRUYTER\nState responsibility in cyberwarfare\n29\ncooperation between the public and the private; (3) multi-layer governance for responsibility-sharing: establishment of an “international arbitration tribunal for cyberspace” on the basis of the United Nations platform, and design of corresponding cyber-peacekeeping forces to cooperate in governance.\nThis reconstruction path has dual normative value: at the level of substantive law, through the legalization of preventive responsibility and due diligence, the “risk spillover” behavior of the state in cyberspace is curbed; at the level of procedural law, with the help of technology-neutral third-party evidence collection mechanism, the cognitive gap between technological logic and judicial review can be bridged. Only by realizing the in-depth mutual embedding of technical governance and international law can the “tragedy of the commons” effect of cyberwar be suppressed, and the paradigm shift of the community of destiny in cyberspace from conceptual advocacy to institutional practice be promoted.\n**Research funding:** This work was supported by the project of National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 24BYY151) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhejiang University."

Due to the ambiguity of the object of regulation, the defect of attribution mechanism, and the lack of clarity of the constituent elements of responsibility, the existing international law framework has caused the state responsibility system in cyberspace to fall into the dilemma of normative failure. This paper takes the theory of international law subjectivity as the logical starting point and systematically deconstructs the normative attributes of cyberwar and the path of responsibility determination. This paper shows that the constitutive elements of state responsibility need to break through the rigid standard of traditional\"behavior-damage\"causality and build a dynamic attribution system combining technical verification and legal presumption. Through critical analysis of the use of force threshold doctrine, this paper, based on a comprehensive analysis of the core dilemma of the determination of state responsibility, proposes to appropriately introduce the concept of\"substantial support\", and when the traditional theory of comprehensive control fails to make effective attribution, the criterion of\"substantial support\"can be used to complete the attribution of state responsibility with the increasingly developed technological traceability means.\nKeywords: cyberwarfare; international law; state responsibility; attributability *Corresponding author: Haonan Li, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: lihaonan22402065@zju.edu.cn. https://orcid.org/0009-0005-0476-300X Le Cheng, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: chengle163@hotmail.com. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4423-8585 The militarized transformation of cyberspace has upended the cognitive architecture of the use of force under the Westphalian system. Traditional military theory faces challenges when applied to cyber conflict. The evolution of cyberwarfare from a technological tool to a means of strategic deterrence has led to a blurring of the legal boundaries between peacetime and armed conflict. And the increasing effectiveness of cyberattacks further complicates the legal context of cyberwarfare. The traditional state responsibility regime needs to be reconfigured due to a triple adaptive dilemma: first, technological anonymity triggers a break in the chain of attribution, which puts the “effective control” criterion in Article 8 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility in a difficult position to prove; second, the non-kinetic nature of cyber operations makes it difficult to quantify the threshold for the use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations; and third, the legitimacy boundary of countermeasures creates normative conflicts under the “forward defense” strategy.\nThis paper adopts a techno-legal cross-analysis approach to focus on the normative reconstruction path of state responsibility in cyber warfare. By deconstructing the dilemma of determining state responsibility at the current stage and proposing corresponding reconstruction paths, this paper attempts to discuss how the determination standard of the attribute of force in cyberwarfare can be coordinated with the “principle of equivalence of effect” of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the mode of assuming the indirect responsibility of the state in the context of the intervention of non-state actors. It is hoped that through the reconstruction of various paths, the issue of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare can be clarified as much as possible, and the diffuse damage caused by cyberwarfare can be curbed. This paper aims to provide theoretical support for the clear identification of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare and to promote the formation of a technologically empowered international law governance paradigm.\n## Deconstructing the normative attributes of cyberwarfare ### The evolution of the conceptual genealogy of cyberwarfare The generation of the normative concept of cyberwarfare has gone through the process of discourse migration from military science to jurisprudence. The concept of cyberwarfare first appeared in a research report by the RAND Corporation in 1993, which defined cyberwarfare as a military operation being implemented or prepared to be implemented according to information-related principles. In the strategic dimension, the concept of cyberwarfare was accompanied by the completion of the ontological construction of the theory of the “Fifth Dimension”, which was recognized by Huang (2015), who argued that “the rapid development of the global Internet has been driven by the rapid advancement of information technology, and cyberspace has begun to take shape as the ‘fifth space' beyond the land, sea, airspace and outer space”. At the same time, a variety of problems and threats such as cyber-attacks and cybercrime have also arisen, and the concept of “cyber warfare” is put forward in this context. On the one hand, along with the development of science and technology, the scale of cyber warfare has reached an unprecedented level, such as the cyber attack and defense in the Russo-Georgian war, the Iranian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the Shocknet virus, the Syrian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the airstrikes, and other cases, all of which are the embodiment of the escalation of the intensity of modern cyber warfare. On the other hand, the relevant theoretical research has been optimized based on the endless cyber warfare.\nCompared with China's late start in cyberwarfare research, western countries have begun research on cyberwarfare earlier, with a larger scale and wider scope, and have also achieved rich results in the formulation of international rules in cyberspace. Since the development of relevant theories, the current mainstream scholars believe that the content of international law on jus ad bellum can be applied to cyber warfare. For example, Reese Nguyen (2013) believes that when a cyber attack is intended to cause irreversible damage or physical loss to the physical information system, it can be recognized as constituting an attack with force. The main argument in favor of this claim is based on Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, which states that “all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. There are different doctrinal understandings of how to argue that cyberwarfare is a use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, as will be presented in the next section.\n### 2.2 Doctrines of thresholds for use of force in cyberwarfare At present, mainstream scholars believe that cyberwarfare constitutes the use of force, but there are different doctrines in understanding, mainly the theory of purpose, instrumental theory, scale, and consequence theory. Walter Sharp (1999), a representative of the “purpose theory”, argues that computer network attacks are a form of economic and political coercion, and although such coercion is traditionally considered not to be a “use of force”, in the light of the purpose of the Charter of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, and the territorial integrity and political independence of States guaranteed by Article 2(4), computer network attacks should also be subject to Article 2(4) since economic and political coercion would also threaten international peace and jeopardize the territorial integrity and political independence of a State, and would therefore be covered by the scope of the Article.\nMarco Roscini (2010), a representative of the “tools doctrine”, argues that the “military force” that Article 2(4) intends to regulate is mainly embodied in the use of specific weapons (or tools) and that cyber-attacks using “weapons” such as Trojan horses, worms, etc. can also constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) if they produce specific tangible or intangible damage. The most widely accepted theory is the “scale and consequences theory”, in which Professor Michael Schmitt (1999, 2011) argues that although the main purpose of Article 2(4) is to constrain a state's external use of traditional military force to coerce others, in practice what matters is not the means used but the consequences; if a cyber-attack directly causes or is likely to cause damage to persons or objects comparable to that caused by military means, it should undoubtedly constitute a “use of force”; even if it does not cause tangible damage to persons or objects, the victimized State can still determine whether a cyber-attack constitutes a “use of force” by assessing the following seven criteria: (a) severity, (b) immediacy, (c) directness, (d) invasiveness, (e) measurability of effects, (f) presumptive legality and (g) state involvement. Although there are strengths and weaknesses in each viewpoint, as far as the existing situation is analyzed, the scale and consequence theory is recognized by majority of researchers, and the proposition of Prof. Michael Schmit has had a greater impact in the Western academic community, not only in the Tallinn Manual, which is edited by him but also recognized by Western countries. It is worth mentioning that the Tallinn Manual, as a document developed with the participation of multinational subjects, contains seven out of eight assessment criteria for defining whether a cyberattack constitutes a use of force that are identical to those mentioned in the previous article, which indicates that the evaluation criteria advocated by the scale and consequences theory have their own rationality and can be generally accepted by the majority of countries.\nIt should be noted that the research on issues related to cyberwarfare in this paper is based on cases where cyberwarfare can trigger international responsibility, and cyber infringement and cybercrime activities, which are only regulated by the domestic laws of various countries as well as a small number of international treaties, obviously do not fall into the category of use of force as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations 2(4), and they also cannot trigger the responsibility of the State, and therefore do not fall within the scope of this paper's analysis.\n## Normative elements and paths to attribution of state responsibility in cyberwarfare ### Normative basis and constitutive elements of the state responsibility regime The institutional framework of state responsibility in international law is rooted in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Articles). According to Chapter I and Chapter II of the Draft Articles, the establishment of state responsibility requires the fulfillment of two normative elements: wrongfulness and attributability. In the following, the two elements will be analyzed separately.\nInitially, the analysis of wrongfulness. In Article 2 of the Draft Articles, the International Law Commission defines that “there is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law, and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.” In the context of cyberwarfare, it is clear that most cases of wrongful acts are in the form of action, as exemplified by the Russo-Georgian war: the Georgian government website was attacked, the government web server was on the verge of collapsing due to the large number of access requests it received for more than 10 h, the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was completely dysfunctional, and the website of the presidential administration was paralyzed for 24 h. As the fighting deepened, the intensity and sophistication of the cyber-attacks increased, with Russia targeting Georgia's government and news media websites as the primary targets, disabling virtually all of Georgia's government offices. Second, it is worth noting that the article does not mention that subjective fault or intent to engage in a wrongful act is required to establish state responsibility; the mere existence of a violation of the law is sufficient to give rise to international responsibility, and, by extension, state responsibility should be an objective rather than a subjective responsibility. The normative logic of this objective responsibility paradigm, which rejects the subjective fault element, is that the unlawfulness of an internationally wrongful act arises from an objective breach of an international obligation rather than from the state of mind of the acting state.\nIn addition, the article requires that the wrongful act constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state, and for a further understanding of the Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER obligation, one can refer to the definitions in Articles 12 and 13 of the Draft Articles. Article 12 provides that there is a breach of an international obligation by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. Article 13 provides that an act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs. In other words, the key feature of a breach of an international obligation is that the obligation should have been complied with, but in fact, the State in question did not take reasonable action to comply with the obligation.\nArticle 12 makes it clear that, regardless of the origin or character of the obligation, when analyzed in terms of the sources of international law, the source of the obligation is varied, and may be a customary one, or one based on a treaty, or even a legal principle generally recognized by the international community. In the Rainbow Warrior case, for example, the arbitral tribunal stated that there is no distinction in international law between contractual and tortious liability, so any breach by a State of a duty, regardless of the source of the duty, gives rise to the responsibility of the State and therefore to an obligation to make reparation.¹ This case is very strong evidence of the broadness of the source of the obligation.\nThe broadness of the source of the obligation is conducive to the regulation of cyberwarfare. First, for States parties to cyberwarfare-related treaties, such as the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, a violation of the content of the treaty can constitute a direct breach of the obligation. Second, for countries not participating in the treaty, if the relevant practice of maintaining network security has been generally recognized in the international community and can become a kind of habit, the habit can also be used as a source of obligation, and if it does not comply with the habit, it is also possible to find that a country violates the obligation, which undoubtedly enlarges the scope of the main body needing to comply with the obligation, and allows more countries to consciously comply with the obligation. What's more, the identification and formation of general principles are essential for maintaining international law as a coherent legal system. Therefore, sometimes principles can also govern the behavior of States. It should be noted, however, that even if a State commits certain acts of cyberattack against another State and causes damage, if it does not constitute a breach of an international obligation, it will not give rise to the legal responsibility of the author State.\n¹ Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (New Zealand v. France) (“Rainbow Warrior”), Award of 30 April 1990, 20 UNRIAA 215, para.75.\nCorrespondingly, attributability is then analyzed. Theoretically, all acts of individuals, corporations, or other entities in the sense of domestic law may be attributed to a State (Government) based on nationality. In dealing with this issue, the Draft Articles adopt a narrow approach, namely, the “overall control test”, whereby the only conduct that can be attributed to a State is that of State organs or other entities acting under the direction, control, or instigation of a State organ, which becomes an agent of the State at the time of the conduct. As far as the attributability of the state in cyber warfare is concerned, if a cyber attack is initiated or directed by the state as the main body, the corresponding responsibility is borne by the state. In simple cases, the attributability of state responsibility can be quickly recognized. However, since the development of cyberwarfare, identifying the source of cyber-attacks is crucial to ensuring cybersecurity, its technical means have become increasingly flexible, and many attribution problems are caused by anonymous attacks, and the attackers can often easily hide their identities, which has brought great challenges to the tracking of the source of the attack. Even if the source of the attack is identified, the subject needs to be further clarified. The subject of a cyberattack can avoid being targeted by hiding or forging his identity in many ways, so pinpointing the subject is also a major challenge.\nIn addition, when a country helps another country to engage in internationally wrongful acts, the former also to the extent of the support, helps to bear state responsibility, but the main state responsibility still belongs to the wrongdoing state. But regardless of the size of state responsibility, by analogy, in the context of cyberwarfare, if a country provides technical means or financial support and other help to other countries, in principle, it should also bear the corresponding responsibility, and if that State has both wrongful acts and breaches of its obligations, it may also satisfy the constituent elements of State responsibility, and thus bear State responsibility in cyberwarfare to the extent of the damage caused by that State.\n### Hierarchical construction of standards of proof As a component of the constituent elements, whether it is the judgment of wrongfulness or the judgment of attributability, there is the problem of proof. In fact, for the legal field of the problem, the standard of proof has been extremely important, from the traditional theory of evidence, the standard of proof is the judge to consider and weigh the authenticity of the facts of the case to achieve the degree of proof, but also the burden of proof to provide the appropriate evidence to prove the facts of the case to achieve a certain standard. The degree of standard of proof is directly related to the judge for the degree of conviction of the evidence, which naturally will affect the results of the judgment. Criminal law, civil law, and Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER other substantive areas of law, after a long period of development, in their litigation process also have their standard of proof, although different standards for the results of the judgment have a decisive impact, the litigant naturally needs to try to meet the standard of proof. On the other hand, for the facts that have occurred, no one has the ability to $100\\%$ reproduce the scene, they can only try to prove to maximize the proximity of the objective facts, thus providing judges with a good judgment environment so that judges as far as possible can make a reasonable judgment, and the standard of proof from this sense of understanding is also the embodiment of substantive justice.\nOutside the traditional field of substantive law, the standard of proof is also of great significance to the issue of international law. In international law, the composition of state responsibility needs to satisfy both illegal behavior and attributable elements, but the proof of the two elements is also a separate issue, whether the two standards of proof are consistent, and if not, what kind of standards should be used is an urgent discussion. As early as before the emergence of the problem of evidence in the field of networks, the International Court of Justice pointed out in the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua that the key to the solution to the problem lies not only in the process of attributing conduct to the law of a particular country but also in the search for substantial evidence before the process of legal attribution. It is thus clear that the question of the standard of proof is not simply an integral part of the question of the attribution of State responsibility, but is more relevant for independent discussion.\nAs far as the current situation is concerned, there is a lack of a uniform and clear standard of proof in international law. In the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice emphasized the principle of the free assessment of evidence, stating that within the limits of the Statute of the Court and the Rules of the Tribunal, the Court is free to assess the value of any evidence.3 While the persistent lack of uniform standards in international law has been detrimental to the development of proof, an analysis of the nature of the cases before the ICJ shows that there is a corresponding rationale for the absence of uniform standards of proof that the complexity and diversity of the cases before the ICJ make it difficult to arrive at a uniform standard that would be universally or primarily applicable to inter-State litigation.\nIn addition, although the Court's deficiencies in the standard of proof may lead to subjective factors on the part of the judges affecting the decision of the case, in practice, the Court usually indicates in its judgments the standard of proof that it has adopted. Even if there is no expressly stated uniform standard, taking the standard of proof in a large number of judgments as a sample, it is still possible to analyze the issue of the standard of proof to one degree or another. Examining the decisions of ICJ, it can be found that the standard of proof adopted by ICJ basically draws on the system of standard of proof of the domestic courts of the common law system. According to different types of cases, the common law system of the standard of proof, according to the degree of strictness in descending order, can be divided into four types: (1) the criminal field is usually adopted with full certainty of “beyond a reasonable doubt”; (2) “clear and convincing proof”, which is highly probable but does not reach the level of incontrovertibility; (3) “preponderance of evidence”, which is usually adopted in civil proceedings and has a higher degree of reasonableness and probability; (4) prima facie evidence, which is merely required to prove indications of the correctness of an argument.\nThe standards of proof established for different types of cases are also of great significance in the context of cyberwarfare. Cyber-attacks are more covert and asymmetric than traditional attacks, and the degree of damage caused and the difficulty of investigation vary to different degrees, making evaluation more difficult than in traditional cases. Therefore, it is not practical to establish a uniform standard of proof, and a more reasonable approach should be to adopt different standards of proof according to the different degrees of impact brought about by cyberwarfare.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of cases have highlighted the intersection of cybercrime and cyberwarfare: operations with a clear cyberwarfare intent have incorporated tactical maneuvers normally associated with cybercrime. Cybercrime constitutes the criminal exploitation of digital systems to perpetrate unlawful activities through technological means. Nowadays, the virtual nature, technological infrastructure, and limitless scalability of digital networks -- when combined with the misuse of big data analytics -- have paradoxically dissolved traditional national boundaries, transforming transnational criminal operations into borderless threats with globalized impact. If the extent of cyberwarfare has reached the level of a criminal case, it should be strictly required to meet the standard of proof of a criminal case.\nTake the Shocknet virus, for example, which, in the course of cyberwarfare led to the damage of about 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz plant, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of Iranian centrifuges and delaying Iran's uranium enrichment program, in addition to the accidental spread of the Shocknet virus around the globe, which infected more than 100,000 computers. In terms of its impact, its nature has reached the seriousness of a criminal case. As Judge Higgins of the International Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER Court of Justice pointed out in his independent opinion in the Oil Platforms case, the more serious the allegations, the greater the degree of credibility of the evidence required.⁴ Therefore, in a case such as the Shocknet virus, which has already reached the standard of a criminal case, proof of the wrongfulness and attributability of the acts of the United States and Israel in the case will need to reach the level of beyond reasonable doubt.\nAs generative AI becomes widespread, the costs of creating and spreading viral false information, along with cross-border data storage, transfer, and processing expenses, are plummeting so that the frequency of cyber attacks is also on the rise. It is clearly unreasonable to apply the standards of cybercrime to all cyberattacks. A more rational approach would be to lower the burden of proof for cyberattacks that cause less damage and do not constitute a criminal case, similar to some of the standards of proof in civil litigation. But in any case, for the standard of proof of cyberwarfare is inappropriate to adopt the standard of prima facie evidence,\"prima facie evidence\"refers to\"sufficient to establish a fact or to establish a presumption, unless it is effectively rebutted\"evidence. A prima facie case can only mean that there is a possibility that the fact occurred, but it is not very convincing.\nMoreover, the application of that criterion to the determination of state responsibility would undoubtedly lead to a series of problems and increase the cost of dealing with cases because of its weak persuasiveness. For example, if a State was found to have committed a wrongful act merely because there was a possibility that it had done so, not only was there no basis in jurisprudence, but it would also be difficult for the international community to accept an assessment based on simple values. Additionally, the principle that the higher the gravity of the act, the higher the standard of proof is consistently reflected in academic discussions of international law, particularly concerning the International Court of Justice. If a state is found to be liable for the high cost of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, it need only meet such a simple standard of proof, which clearly violates this principle.\n## 3.3 Normative boundaries of the deterrent factors of responsibility The wrongfulness of an act is one of the elements of the law of state responsibility, and the absence of wrongfulness does not entail the responsibility of the state, a situation that can also be referred to as a cause of impediment to state responsibility, with an emphasis on the analysis of two cases: self-defense and countermeasures.\n⁴ Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.S.), I.C.J. Judgment of 6 November 2003, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, para.33.\nDE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare Moreover, the International Court of Justice, in the Nicaragua case, held that all attacks of force belonged to the use of force, but not all uses of force constituted an attack of force, and that only those that were the most serious and had a significant scale and consequences could constitute an “armed attack”. According to the relevant judgment, there is a difference in intensity between the two. The significance of this distinction should also be reflected in cyberattacks. If a cyber-attack by a State only constitutes a use of force under Article 2(4) but does not constitute an armed attack under Article 51, it is certainly a serious internationally wrongful act in breach of an obligation under international law of jus cogens, but the injured State can only take non-forceful “countermeasures” as provided for in the Draft Articles. Once such measures are found to constitute an armed attack, the injured State may invoke Article 51 to legitimately exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defense, including the use of force.\nCountermeasures in international law are non-forcible measures taken by an injured State against a State responsible for committing an internationally wrongful act to induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations, with the intention of restoring reciprocity between the parties. Accordingly, countermeasures do not normally involve the use of force. They are lawful, provided that they meet the conditions set out in Part Three of the Draft Articles.5 Countermeasures are generally used in cases where the use of force does not rise to the level of an armed attack and, by analogy, in the field of cyberwarfare in cases where the level of the attack is not overly aggressive. Cases such as the SolarWinds supply chain attack and the Stuxnet virus attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities have reached the level of an armed attack in terms of both the means used and the damage Cheng and Li DE GRUYTER caused, and the right of self-defense can be triggered, no longer at the level of countermeasures.\nTraditional remedies such as compensation and restitution take some time to realize, and if one is only passively waiting for remedies there is a risk of further expanding losses, so as more timely remedies, both self-defense and countermeasures are necessary to avoid the expansion of losses to the maximum extent possible before traditional remedies can be obtained. Neither the right of self-defense nor the exercise of countermeasures is without limits. Customary law also limits the exercise of the right of self-defense, and the use of force in self-defense remains wrongful if it is accompanied by a violation of international humanitarian law or human rights since special provisions of international humanitarian law (such as the prohibition on retaliatory measures against civilians or prisoners of war) and certain human rights are non-derogable in all circumstances.\nSimilarly, the scope of countermeasures is limited, as draft article 50, Paragraph 1, provides that countermeasures shall not affect: (a) the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; (b) obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; (c) obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; (d) other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. In addition, Article 50, Paragraph 2, makes it clear that a State taking countermeasures is not relieved from fulfilling its obligations: (a) under any dispute settlement procedure applicable between it and the responsible State; (b) to respect the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents, premises, archives, and documents.\n## 3.4 The practical significance of the realization mechanism of state responsibility The state responsibility system is not only a rule implementation tool but also a carrier of the international community's value consensus. On this basis, once the state responsibility is recognized, it is necessary to fulfill the corresponding reality of the obligation. Attribution is not the ultimate goal; using attribution to further solve the problem is the significance of the state responsibility recognition. Under the background of cyber war, the significance of the reality is still worth paying attention to. State responsibility is assumed in various ways; here, we focus on analyzing the two main ways of restitution and compensation.\n ICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep. (1996) 226, para.41.\nFirst of all, we analyze restitution, as the content of the remedy system with the largest scope of remedies, because it can directly eliminate the consequences of wrongdoing, Article 35 of the Draft Articles lists Restitution as a priority remedy. The conditions for the application of restitution included the principles of physical possibility and proportionality, which also required that restitution should not impose a “disproportionate burden” on the responsible State, such as requiring a poor State to bear a large share of the cost of restoration, which was clearly impractical and might be exempted. While the elimination of wrongful consequences is well conceived, and in practice it has been implemented to a certain extent, resulting in more effective State responsibility, restitution also faces contemporary challenges, such as the creation of irreversible damage. While it is naturally clear that nuclear contamination, species extinction, and the like cannot be truly restored in the traditional sense, it is also possible to cause irreversible damage in the context of cyberattacks.\nTake the SolarWinds supply chain attack as an example, the Russian intelligence service hijacked the U.S. SolarWinds software update by implanting malicious code to infiltrate the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and nine other federal agencies and hundreds of enterprises. This case not only resulted in the long-term exposure of intelligence networks and the leakage of sensitive data but also called into question the credibility of global IT supply chain security standards and led to a shift to “zero-trust” architectures and a sharp increase in the cost of international cooperation. While the technical damage can be remedied through compensation, the erosion of democracy is likely to be irreversible, as the cyber-attack has largely eroded public trust in the government's cybersecurity capabilities, which will be difficult to rebuild in a short period, and difficult to fully restore through restitution. Therefore, although restitution can theoretically maximize the compensation for the damage caused, it is obvious that it cannot be fully compensated in practice, and other remedies are needed to supplement it.\nSecondly, as one of the mainstream remedies, Article 31 of the Draft Articles establishes the obligation of the responsible State to provide “full reparation” for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act, which covers both material and moral damages, reflecting the purpose of the elimination of all the consequences of the injury. The principle of the Chorzów Factory case of the Permanent Court of International Justice, of 1928, also provides evidence of this: it establishes that reparation is required to restore the injured State to the “state it would have been in had the wrongful act not been committed”. Further analysis of the types of reparation and the scope of application reveals that reparation can be very broad, ranging from material to moral damages, from direct, quantifiable property damage to indirect, reasonably foreseeable, consequential damages, such as loss of profits due to interruption of trade. Indirect damages, however, often require stricter proof of causation, and the calculation of compensation was controversial at the current stage. In any case, as the mainstream way of assuming state responsibility, the existence of compensation is also of practical significance to the realization of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, which requires less time cost and can more efficiently compensate for the interests of the victimized state than the institutional correction and other methods.\n## Core dilemmas in the determination of state responsibility The determination of state responsibility is of great significance, and can lead to real consequences such as restitution and compensation, but in the context of cyberwar, the core problems of the determination of state responsibility need to be paid attention to, mainly including the normative transformation obstacles of the technical attribution, the paradigm conflict of the application of the right of self-defense, and the systemic failure of the mechanism of responsibility assumption. Failure to analyze these dilemmas and propose solutions will make it difficult to trigger the consequences of state responsibility, which will not be conducive to the resolution of international disputes.\n### Normative transformation barriers to technical attribution The MITRE ATT&CK framework, a widely adopted knowledge base of attack behaviors in the current cybersecurity field, can provide technical references for cyber-attack traceability by standardizing the description of attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures. However, the transformation of its technical references to legal evidence is facing difficulties.\nPrimarily, the paradigm conflict between technical logic and legal logic hinders the transformation of technical indicators into legal evidence to a certain extent. ATT&CK framework is based on the identification of attack behavioral patterns, such as the “credential dump + lateral movement” mode of APT29, attackers often use the system's functions and tools to operate by modifying the system configuration or using legitimate tools and other methods to move laterally, ATT&CK framework for the identification of the attack behavior pattern to derive technical indicators. However, according to Article 8 of the Draft Articles: The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact, acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. It can be seen that a finding of State responsibility under international law requires proof of “effective control” of the attacking act in relation to the will of the State. For example, in the 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack, attackers injected malicious code called “Sunburst” into SolarWinds' flagship Orion software, even though security firms identified SUNBURST's TTPs through ATT&CK, such as T1059.001 command line interface abuse, but these technical characteristics can not directly prove that the Russian intelligence services of the main responsibility, the United States cited the ATT&CK report accusing Russia, but the international community in general to the “lack of direct chain of evidence” to question its legal effectiveness. In this case, even if it is recognized that there is indeed an attack, due to the inability to prove that the behavior is directed or controlled by a country, it is also difficult to use the technical indicators as evidence in the legal sense.\nSubsequently, the existence of intermediate nodes easily leads to a broken chain of evidence. Attackers commonly adopt the anonymizing technical architecture of “springboard server + virtual private network (VPN)”. Taking the 2016 Bangladesh central bank theft case as an example, although the C2 server IP of the SWIFT transaction instructions was traced to the Philippines, further investigation showed that the server was a puppet host controlled by the North Korean Lazarus group. This kind of multi-layer hopping leads to greater difficulty in technical traceability, and the result of traceability may also cause a break in the chain of evidence.\nAnother example is the attack on targets in China by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) through the QUANTUM attack platform, in which a number of modules are involved in concealing the identity of the attack, including QUANTUMBOT Module -- through the hijacking of the botnet command and control of network traffic, manipulating the botnet to launch attack activities and to hide the traces of the U.S. National Security Agency's hacking attacks.; QUANTUMBISCUIT Module -- builds a proxy springboard for quantum injection attacks against an attack target to prevent the attack from being detected retroactively; QUANTUMPHANTOM Module -- provides the technical ability to utilize network link intermediate node hijacking technology to achieve the hiding of the source of the attack, preventing the U.S. National Security Agency's cyberattacks against other countries from being traced back. The use of multiple anonymization techniques undoubtedly creates a great obstacle to traceability work. Even if the source of the attack can be located accurately in the end, the identity of the operating subject behind the attack still needs to be further identified, and the attacker can be disguised as other countries/organizations or fake IP addresses, etc. to confuse the traceability. The existence of intermediate nodes also makes it difficult to form a chain of evidence. The objective existence of obvious cyber attacks due to problems in the chain of evidence may not be able to carry out a trial in the end and even more accurately determine the responsibility of the state and solve the problem.\nIn addition, the “falsifiability” of technical indicators also weakens their probative value in practice. An important manifestation of this is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). It is widely recognized as the most sophisticated and powerful category of security threats. APTs are engineered by resourced, disciplined threat actors capable of sustained operations through systematic technology exploitation, blending expertise, funding, and structured coordination to maintain persistence. APT organizations often falsify attack signatures through False Flag operations. The identification of false flags is inherently complex, primarily because attackers systematically conceal their actions while simultaneously framing innocent entities for malicious conduct. Conducting a false flag operation in the cyber realm is fundamentally distinct and far simpler compared to its execution in the physical domain. For example, in the 2017 NotPetya ransomware incident, ATT&CK-based T1486 disk encryption analysis initially pointed to North Korea, but subsequent code homology analysis revealed a link to the Russian Sandworm organization. This type of technological misdirection makes the judicial application of the ATT&CK framework a “reasonable suspicion” challenge. As counterfeiting technologies evolve, the ATT&CK framework should also evolve with the times and develop more accurate techniques for identifying forgeries, or else the credibility of the technical indicators it produces may be further diminished in the face of the difficulty of transferring technical indicators to legal evidence.\n### Paradigm conflicts in the application of the right of self-defense Even in the face of cyberattacks, the exercise of the right of self-defense and countermeasures is not unlimited and still needs to comply with certain requirements, so it is still necessary to make a clearer discussion on the boundaries of the legality of the use of the right of self-defense and countermeasures in cyberwarfare.\nAs mentioned in the previous article, as to the question of whether cyber warfare constitutes the use of force under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, the “scale and consequence theory” proposed by Prof. Michael Schmit has the highest degree of acceptance at present. As long as the analysis is conducted according to the multiple indicators of scale and consequence, and the cyber-attack is considered to be a case of the use of force, then countermeasures or even the exercise of the right to self-defense can be taken. The most controversial issue at present is that the right to determine the use of force is in the hands of more developed countries, and the seemingly objective judgment criteria are to some extent mixed with subjective factors.\nAs is widely known, the Tallinn Manual edited by Prof. Michael Schmit, as a more authoritative and important reference document for the study of cyber warfare, has seven of the eight assessment criteria for determining whether the use of force constitutes a use of force, which are completely consistent with the criteria advocated by Prof. Michael Schmit himself. The criteria are somewhat arbitrary and subjective. For example, Professor Schmit himself, when applying these factors to analyze the 2007 cyberattack against Estonia, concluded that the attack constituted a use of force. Other scholars, however, have argued that the opposite conclusion that the cyberattack did not constitute a use of force can easily be reached by relying on these same factors, which can be easily manipulated in their application to reach conclusions that benefit the geostrategic objectives of the country being analyzed.\nMoreover, when applied to cyberattacks, the “scale and consequence” standard has a fatal logical flaw: a given consequence of the same scale and severity can be produced by the use of force as well as by non-forceful means. The loss of life and the destruction of forests and land in a downstream country as a result of the discharge of toxic substances into a river by an upstream country or the starvation and economic turmoil of a country as a result of economic sanctions imposed by one country on another, are in themselves highly analogous to those that would normally result from the use of force. However, in general perception, these acts hardly constitute a use of force in international law or even an internationally wrongful act. In this way, such acts can escape legal sanction even if they have consequences comparable to those of the use of force. Cyberattacks, however, may be recognized as a use of force and subject to liability if they have the same legal consequences. This logical loophole exists partly because of the arbitrariness and subjectivity of the judgment standard. Western scholars with stronger discursive power often lower the threshold for the use of the right to self-defense through an expansive interpretation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, and in this regard, seemingly reasonable standards can often be interpreted to achieve political goals.\nIn addition to lowering the threshold of the right to self-defense through acts of interpretation, the United States has also put forward the “Defend Forward” strategy, which is an offensive defense strategy it has put forward in recent years in the field of cyberspace security, aiming to respond to cyber threats using proactive strikes and pre-emptive strikes. The United States Cyber Command has emphasized the need to adopt a “forward posture” in cyberspace by accessing non-Department of Defense networks or systems to weaken an adversary's cyber capabilities in advance and prevent it from taking action. Such an assertion should be relegated to the academic category of preventive self-defense, which is advocated by a few Western countries and Western scholars, but is not and should not be supported in existing international treaties and customary international law -- it means “granting the major powers an almost unrestricted license to use force”. In summary, the definition of cyberwarfare and the various criteria for judging it, as well as the proposal of strategies such as “forward defense,” are undoubtedly suspected of serving political goals. Professor O'Connell also believes that “cyberwarfare” is a “wrong war”. It is essentially an “invented” problem in the context of the increasing militarization of cybersecurity policies of major Western countries.\n### Systemic failure of responsibility mechanisms The decentralized nature of cyberspace forms a structural contradiction with the “state-centered” responsibility framework of traditional international law, resulting in an imbalance in the distribution of responsibility between states and non-state actors, rigid rules of evidence, and a lack of enforcement mechanisms.\nFirst, the traditional logic of attribution has loopholes that need to be filled in the context of cyberspace, and the traditional theoretical criterion of “effective control” has limitations. This criterion originated from the 1986 case of Nicaragua v. United States, in which the ICJ made it clear that to attribute the conduct of non-state actors to a state (the United States), it is necessary to prove that the state exercised “effective control” over the specific military operation. Not only does the state provide general support such as funding, weapons, or training, but it also needs to have actual command over the specific unlawful action, i.e. the state needs to directly direct or specifically instruct the attack. However, the “outsourcing of tools” in cyberattacks has led to a high degree of invisibility of the state-attacker nexus. For example, in the case of the Iranian APT34 attack on Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in 2021, although the technical traceability showed that the attack tools were linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, it was not possible to prove that their actions were “specifically directed” by the state. In the context of cyberwarfare, “effective control” has the risk of being too rigid, leading to the impossibility of attribution, and the choice of whether to include other judgment criteria in such cases has been widely discussed, among which the theory of “overall control” is of particular research value.\nThe theory of “Overall Control” originated from the judgment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the case of Prosecutor v. Tadić. The Tribunal held that the conduct of a state can be attributed DE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare In the context of cyberwarfare, the anonymity of cyberattacks, technology dependence, and the ambiguity of actors make the traditional standard of attribution challenging, and the “overall control” theory has potential advantages in some respects. The criterion is superior in terms of identification in response to the prevalence of indirect support models. States often support cyberattacks through technological enablement, infrastructure harboring, or strategic guidance. Such behavior is more consistent with the “strategic dominance” characteristic of “overall control” than with the “specific instruction” requirement of “effective control”. For example, Russia’s relationship with APT28 is alleged to be in line with “overall control” in that the Russians provide technical resources but do not directly direct specific attacks, and the international community generally believes that the organization is supported by the Russian government and that the motivation for its attacks is closely related to Russia’s national interests.\nAccording to “overall control”, it is possible to hold Russia responsible, but according to the traditional “effective control” standard, it is difficult to hold it accountable. In addition, while the technical traceability of cyberattacks often only proves a continuing connection between the attacker and the state, and it is difficult to obtain evidence of direct orders, the “overall control” standard eliminates the need to prove a control relationship between the state and the attacker, and allows for a more efficient allocation of responsibility. Although the “overall control” standard has its role in the context of cyberwarfare, it is still difficult to accept it as the standard for attribution of responsibility in the current mainstream view, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia Serbia and Montenegro, the ICJ explicitly rejected the standard of “overall control” and insisted on the strict interpretation of “effective control”,[9] which can provide a reference basis for the attribution of responsibility for cyber warfare. Moreover, there is a risk of political abuse if a more lenient standard is adopted, as when the U.S. sanctioned a Chinese technology company based on “overall control” in the absence of publicly available technical evidence to support it. While this standard is not appropriate in all cases, it is clear that the traditional standard is not fully applicable, and the international community [9] Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, General List No. 91.\nshould continue to explore new, more reasonable standards in practice to address the limitations of the traditional standard.\nSecondly, the traditional attribution criterion is also difficult in practice. The system of attribution of responsibility for non-state actors is not perfect, which leads to the failure of the mechanism for assuming responsibility to play a full role, potentially allowing non-state actors to avoid legal penalties, especially transnational science and technology enterprises to circumvent the responsibility of the behavior at this stage has not been effectively resolved. For example, Zero-Day Vulnerability, as a security flaw that has not yet been discovered or fixed by software vendors, has a unique “gray area” in the trading market due to the ambiguity of its participants, uses, and legal attributes. There are cases where private vulnerability brokers sell zero-day vulnerabilities to governments, but international law does not clarify whether such transactions constitute “assisting in the commission of cyber-attacks”. In terms of the actual situation at this stage, international legislation is undoubtedly lagging behind, and existing cybercrime conventions have not yet explicitly stipulated specific provisions directly targeting “vulnerability trading”.\nIn addition, the EU's “Network Resilience Act” only requires vendors to establish a vulnerability handling process, does not regulate third-party transactions. In China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Internet Information Office, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly issued the “Provisions on the Management of Security Vulnerabilities in Network Products”, which clearly states that no organization or individual shall illegally collect, sell or distribute information on security vulnerabilities in network products, but the standard of “illegality” lacks specific interpretation, and loopholes exist in the determination of “illegality”. The U.S. “Vulnerability Equity Program” is not binding, vendors can refuse to cooperate. It can be seen that the existing law for the actors did not make comprehensive provisions, so the use of zero-day vulnerabilities in cyber attacks on multinational technology enterprises has the possibility of circumventing legal responsibility, liability mechanism due to the lack of comprehensiveness, but also may be further dysfunctional.\n## Reconstructing the path of state responsibility in cyber warfare Under the increasingly complex background of cyber warfare, it is of great practical significance to find a more reasonable path of state responsibility. On the one hand, further improvement of the traditional attribution mechanism can enhance the persuasive power of the attribution; on the other hand, through the innovation of judicial procedures, the realization of state responsibility can be further refined to avoid the emergence of unreasonable responsibility which is too light or too heavy. State responsibility in cyberwarfare has room for improvement in both judgment standard and realization, and if it can be adjusted under the common recognition of the international community, it can to a certain extent avoid subjective factors affecting the judgment and assumption of state responsibility.\n### Improving the attribution mechanism One of the important reasons why the attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyber warfare has a certain subjective element is that there is no universally recognized technical attribution mechanism, which to a certain extent has led to the divergence of attribution standards among countries for cyber warfare. Although there is more authoritative literature such as the Tallinn Manual for reference, the nature of international law is, after all, soft law. While States can use soft law to solve the problem of coordinated gaming, international law is not as binding as it could be if a State's political aspirations need to be realized urgently. In addition, if some countries do not sign an international treaty on cybersecurity, and the content of the treaty has not developed into a custom, a considerable number of countries can claim that they do not carry out activities in the cyber field in accordance with the rules in the treaty. Moreover, even for those countries that have signed such treaties, the cost of withdrawing from them is not high. Finally, although relevant documents are constantly being issued, how to deal with conflicts between them is a subjective process. From this point of view, the mere formulation of international law on cybersecurity is relatively limited in enhancing the rationality of attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nIn this context, promoting the international community to establish a technical attribution institution can be a better choice. First of all, compared with soft law, the institution established under the wide recognition of the international community is more persuasive and can avoid to a greater extent the situation that countries choose the judgment standard of state responsibility based on their own political opinions. Secondly, the establishment of a technical attribution body can help promote policy coordination and resource sharing among countries in the field of cybersecurity. Through multilateral cooperation, countries can fully express their demands, formulate unified international legal standards to deal with transnational cyber threats under the principle of pursuing the greatest common interests, conduct in-depth discussions on reasonable motions to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the attribution standards and reduce the troubles caused by the differences in the laws of different countries.\nFurthermore, technical attribution organizations can establish an information-sharing platform to share the latest information on cyberattacks and technological advances promptly, and such an information-sharing mechanism can improve the ability of countries to respond to cyber threats. For example, the Enhanced Attribution (EA) program initiated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is very informative. The goal of the EA program is to develop techniques to generate operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent and independent malicious cyber campaigns and to create a methodology by which this information can be shared with multiple parties without jeopardizing the intelligence sources and methodologies. By collecting, monitoring, and understanding adversary cyberattack operations in the red space, the program is expected to be divided into three technical areas (TAs) that will work in parallel with each other. They will span three 18-month phases, after which the agency will step in to obtain high-quality results. This activity will undoubtedly empower the attribution criteria with more precise technology, which is expected to target the subjects of wrongdoing with greater precision. Such meaningful criteria, if adopted by technical attribution agencies, would certainly contribute to the standardization of technical attribution.\nBased on the establishment of technical attribution institutions and the development of technical attribution criteria, the criterion of “effective control” in the traditional attribution criteria needs to be expanded. The obstacle to the normative transformation of technical attribution mentioned earlier is largely due to the rigid application of the criterion of “effective control”. In light of the complexity of cyberwarfare models, the concept of “material support” should be introduced, so that if a State systematically provides vulnerabilities, infrastructure, or funding to non-State actors that cause the same level of consequences as a direct direct order, it will be held liable even if there is no direct order. Although this approach has not become a common practice in the international community, the continued rigid application of the traditional criterion of proving a directive relationship will undoubtedly allow certain subjects to avoid the risk of assuming State responsibility, which is difficult to accept in terms of jurisprudence. Therefore, based on the principle of the “effective control” criterion, consideration should be given to the use of “substantial support” to make judgments when the act of support has a significant impact and is directly related to the acts or purposes of the supported party, thus constituting substantial support. The adoption of such a criterion is not only legally sound but also creates conditions for the application of technical attribution to a greater extent. The adoption of the “substantial support” criterion for attribution when the support provided by a State can be traced back to that State by technical means and it can be established that the State providing the assistance constitutes substantial support can avoid the rigid application of the traditional criterion, which would jeopardize the results obtained through technical tracing.\n### Adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism The establishment of an international attribution agency is certainly of great significance to the determination of state responsibility, but it only involves the work of attribution, and if we want to comprehensively reconstruct the responsibility of the state in cyberwarfare, it must be built on the basis of a broad consensus among all countries, and the blueprint for the establishment of an international attribution agency as mentioned in the previous section is also built on the basis of the consensus of all countries. Therefore, the consensus of all countries is a fundamental condition. It is obviously unrealistic for the international community to reach consensus in the short term, because the more vulnerable countries may consider that the adjustment of rules has nothing to do with them. In this case, the big countries are more important to play a pioneering role and set an example through concrete actions. The adjustment of the multilateral cooperation mechanism is conducive to the rationalization of the judgment of national responsibility in cyber warfare, and is also conducive to the regulation of the cyber offensive behavior of individual countries, so that all countries in the international community can benefit from it. The specific cooperation mechanism can be adjusted as follows: Foremost, regional confidence-building measures should be further developed. The most important is the establishment of a cyberspace “hotline mechanism”, which can reduce the information gap through effective communication and avoid the emergence of unnecessary cyberattacks. As early as during the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, this “hotline mechanism” demonstrated its important value. During the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, both sides in the nuclear arms race and military confrontation realized that the lack of direct communication channels could lead to miscalculation and escalation of the conflict. In 1963, the U.S. and the Soviet Union established the “hotline mechanism”, which allowed leaders to communicate quickly, directly, and privately in emergency situations, thereby eliminating the risk of nuclear war resulting from communication delays or misunderstandings of each other's actions. To this day, this mechanism is used as an important tool. In 2022, during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the U.S. and Russia established a military hotline to avoid miscalculations and military accidents. The “hotline mechanism” has gone a long way in avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings and remains indispensable in the context of cyberwarfare. 2020s attack on India's power grid could be a case in point. on October 12, 2020, Mumbai, India, experienced a massive blackout that affected critical infrastructure, including stock exchanges and healthcare facilities. The New York Times reported that the blackout may have been linked to China, claiming that “Chinese malware hacked into India's power supply control system” in order to pressure India in the India-China border standoff. Although this claim was later clarified by Recorded Future, a cybersecurity company mentioned in the report, and officially denied by Indian officials, it still caused a certain degree of damage to China's image, and if the “hotline mechanism” had been adopted at that time, it could have avoided the misleading public opinion and the waste of investigation resources. This shows that China, the United States, Russia and other countries have taken the lead in setting up real-time communication channels, clarifying in a timely manner in the event of miscalculation, and reducing unnecessary costs and expenditures, which is still necessary in the context of cyber warfare.\nConcomitantly, adjusting the public-private partnership. In the context of cyberwarfare, cooperation between countries is certainly important, but operators often also have a large amount of relevant information. To further reduce the cost of controlling the occurrence of cyberwarfare, it is indispensable for operators and governments to jointly build a threat intelligence-sharing platform. Adopting this model not only facilitates research between countries based on a large number of cases provided by operators to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the cases, but also reduces the effort of searching for cyberattacks from all over the world, saves time and cost, and efficiently builds identification and defense measures. This model has been reflected in the JCDC model in the U.S. JCDC participants that include organizations and operators from both the public and private sectors, covering service providers, infrastructure operators, cybersecurity companies, and companies in the critical infrastructure industry.\nIn addition, JCDC constituents include specific government agencies designated by Congress, such as the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It is through the operator-government co-built threat intelligence-sharing platform that the JCDC shares real-time information through multiple platforms, such as Slack, the Homeland Security Information Network HSIN, and the GovDelivery service, to ensure that there is continuous dialog and collaboration among the participants. This also sets the stage for the development of proactive cyber defense programs to mitigate the most serious risks before threats become visible. Moreover, “gatekeeper liability” for technology companies can be introduced, as Article 6 of The EU's Digital Services Act indicates that “where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, the service provider shall not be liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that the provider”. By analyzing the exemption from liability of the hosting service provider of the online platform and the relevant conditions, it can be seen that the online platform should have a certain degree of responsibility for reviewing the information provided by the service recipient. For content that is clearly of a cyber-attack nature, the provider of the online service should exercise a certain degree of scrutiny, in particular, cloud computing giants are required to filter malicious traffic, or else they may be considered to bear the corresponding joint and several liability.\nFinally, a “digital ceasefire zone” system could be included in the scope of discussion. Healthcare, energy and other livelihood areas are of great importance, and if they are subjected to cyberattacks, they will often lead to more serious consequences, and should be categorized as no-attack zones, so that if certain countries carry out non-compliant cyberattacks, violators will be automatically triggered by the United Nations to sanction them. According to the context that cyber-peacekeeping has been suggested as a strategic framework to address the multifaceted challenges posed by diverse manifestations of cyber conflict, in order to support the implementation of the system, we can also consider the establishment of a “network peacekeeping force”, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to send technical teams to assist in the restoration of network services in conflict areas. The reason why it should be coordinated by the ITU is that, under its supervision, the technical teams will be able to use more reasonable means to respond to cyber attacks. Shortly after the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, controversy erupted over the way Ukraine set up the International Volunteer Team for Cyber Defense to carry out cyberattacks against Russian targets, and its development of tools, which allows any digital device to become part of a DDoS attack network, was deemed to be a violation of international cyber norms. The existence of a unified body for coordination would make it possible to bring the corresponding tools into line with the principle of proportionality.\n### Innovations in judicial procedures In addition to further clarifying the criteria for attribution of state responsibility and minimizing the frequency of cyberwar through multilateral cooperation mechanisms, there is also a need for innovation in the judicial process, because most cyberwars are ultimately handled through the judicial process, and therefore adopting a more feasible judicial process is conducive to a more reasonable distribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\nFirstly, the International Court of Justice could create a panel of judges specialized in cyberspace cases, allowing for the submission of electronic evidence and anonymous witnesses. There is a precedent for such a special chamber, namely the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which is a special judicial procedure set up within the ITLOS to hear disputes between States arising from the exploration and exploitation of the international seabed area. In response to the increasingly complex cyberwarfare, which should be handled more rigorously, and the identification and allocation of State responsibility should be more reasonable, the traditional team of judges may not be able to make accurate judgments when faced with the special field of cyber. The idea that selecting judges with relevant backgrounds enhances efficiency is supported by academic research, which suggests that a judge's prior experience and characteristics can influence their decision-making. At this time, the selection of judges with cyber background to form a team specializing in cyberspace cases is conducive to more efficiently identifying the nature of cyberattacks and, with the help of increasingly developed technological means, more reasonably allocating state responsibility on the basis of technical indicators.\nMeanwhile, through the leading role of the International Court of Justice, countries can also select judges with expertise in international law, cyber technology, data protection, and other fields through a special selection mechanism to form domestic teams specialized in handling cyber cases. From this, we can see that such a move can not only further solve the problem of cyber warfare among countries but also serve as an inspiration for the handling of cyber cases within countries. The team of judges can cooperate with other international organizations (such as Interpol and the United Nations Office on Cybercrime) to analyze the ever-emerging new forms and the constantly updating and iterative advanced technologies in order to formulate more reasonable judgment standards and solution measures, so as to jointly address the global challenges in cyberspace.\nIn addition, consideration could be given to legitimizing “preventive countermeasures” by allowing for pre-emptive defences against highly probable cyberattacks under the authority of the Security Council. Referring to Article 50 of the UN Charter on temporary measures against economic sanctions, UN Member States, in their actions for the maintenance of international peace and security, should refrain from any action that might widen a dispute or aggravate a situation. And the UN Security Council is tasked with resolving international disputes and can establish frameworks for peaceful settlements, aligning with Article 1 of the UN Charter so that Member States should take appropriate steps to prevent the extension or aggravation of the dispute in accordance with the recommendations of the UNSC. It was mentioned earlier that countermeasures must be a means to be taken only if there is a realistic attack. However, in the context of cyberwarfare, it is often too late to take countermeasures if one has to wait until there is an attack. Due to the intensity and scope of cyberattacks, a country's cyber system may not be able to function after an attack, let alone take defensive measures. Under such circumstances, it is particularly important to formulate “preventive countermeasures” with reference to Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations. This kind of prevention cannot be advanced indefinitely and should be judged according to the recommendations of the UN Security Council. However, the international community needs to discuss in depth what kind of preventive measures should be taken in order to arrive at a standard. In any case, even if this kind of advance measure is recognized, it still needs to be regulated by the corresponding standards, or else powerful countries can launch disproportionate “preventive countermeasures” against less dangerous cyberattacks in pursuit of their own national political demands, which is contrary to the original purpose of the measure.\nWhile considering innovations in the judicial process, there is also a need for flexibility in the use of various methods to solve the problems that arise in the process, such as the use of legal discourse. In addressing the dual imperatives of legislative innovation and jurisprudential reconceptualization, legal discourse analysis as a vital interdisciplinary instrument, offers multidimensional frameworks to decode evolving normative constructs within contemporary governance systems. The degree of formality in legal language mirrors the solemn nature of judicial proceedings, whereas the presence or absence of polite expressions can signal deference, confrontational intent, or calculated positioning. These deliberate language patterns fundamentally shape both the courtroom environment and participants' interpretations of interactions, ultimately guiding behavioral responses throughout legal exchanges (Mısır and Akın 2024). In addition, the refinement of legal discourse patterning can be enhanced by studying a large number of cases in the European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union issues its rulings in 23 legally binding linguistic versions, reflecting the mandate established under Article 217 of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. This foundational provision, originally enacted as the European Council's inaugural legislative instrument, constitutionally guarantees that every member state's national language maintains equal juridical standing as an official working language of the Union. Based on the breadth of these cases, summarizing them will undoubtedly be beneficial for a more accurate use of legal language.\nUltimately, in the process of optimization, the participation of artificial intelligence is an irreversible trend, and the various advantages of artificial intelligence can undoubtedly improve efficiency, but the existence of hidden loopholes in various aspects of technology, ethics and other aspects also need to be paid attention to. Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transnational challenge demanding coordinated governance architectures, necessitating the establishment of multilateral regulatory systems capable of ensuring operational synergy, policy harmonization, and adaptive scalability across jurisdictions. And transitioning to centralized regulatory frameworks proves indispensable for steering generative AI development along ethically aligned trajectories. To effectively address existential risks in artificial intelligence development, institutionalizing ethical guardrails through a “Digital Humanism” framework becomes imperative. This paradigm prioritizes human-centric imperatives by safeguarding species-wide wellbeing and systemic security, while strategically decoupling technological advancement from zero-sum competition. Such an approach ensures that technological evolution maintains symbiotic alignment with civilizational priorities. Today sanctions and anti-sanctions have evolved into a dominant strategic pattern within contemporary geopolitical interactions, which makes it all the more important that more rational judicial procedures be used to mitigate the growing conflict.\n## Conclusions The accelerated militarization of cyberspace has plunged the state responsibility system into a “triple normative dilemma”: first, the transformation of technical evidence into legal facts has led to the failure of the attribution mechanism; second, the hermeneutical controversy over the boundaries of the right to self-defense has triggered a crisis of the legitimacy of the countermeasures; and third, the vacuum in the allocation of responsibility due to the involvement of non-State actors has resulted in the systematic failure of the enforcement mechanism. These structural impediments not only undermine the deterrent effect of international law, but also contribute to the “low-cost-high-benefit” nature of cyberwarfare, which continues to induce opportunistic tactics by state actors.\nWhile existing governance frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0's “principle of equivalence of effects” and the Convention on Cybercrime's territoriality provision provide guidance on rules at the local level, they are not able to cope with complex cyberconflicts due to institutional fragmentation and technological adaptability deficiencies. For example, the Tallinn Manual's 2.0 Rule 69's eight-dimensional assessment model of the threshold for the use of force faces an attenuation of its explanatory power when dealing with generative AI-driven cognitive warfare; and the Budapest Convention's Mutual Legal Assistance Mechanism is in an implementation dilemma due to the anonymity of cryptocurrencies.\nTo solve the above dilemmas, it is urgent to build a three-in-one path of “technical verification, rule iteration, and mechanism synergy” to reconfigure the responsibility: (1) technical empowerment of attribution mechanism: building a verifiable attribution system, and realizing the transformation of MITRE ATT&CK framework into a judicial system; (2) adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism, building regional confidence measures, strengthening public-private partnership, and strengthening the DE GRUYTER State responsibility in cyberwarfare This reconstruction path has dual normative value: at the level of substantive law, through the legalization of preventive responsibility and due diligence, the “risk spillover” behavior of the state in cyberspace is curbed; at the level of procedural law, with the help of technology-neutral third-party evidence collection mechanism, the cognitive gap between technological logic and judicial review can be bridged. Only by realizing the in-depth mutual embedding of technical governance and international law can the “tragedy of the commons” effect of cyberwar be suppressed, and the paradigm shift of the community of destiny in cyberspace from conceptual advocacy to institutional practice be promoted.\n**Research funding:** This work was supported by the project of National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 24BYY151) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhejiang University."

  "payload": "## ## 3.4 The practical significance of the realization mechanism of state responsibility The state responsibility system is not only a rule implementation tool but also a carrier of the international community's value consensus. On this basis, once the state responsibility is recognized, it is necessary to fulfill the corresponding reality of the obligation. Attribution is not the ultimate goal; using attribution to further solve the problem is the significance of the state responsibility recognition. Under the background of cyber war, the significance of the reality is still worth paying attention to. State responsibility is assumed in various ways; here, we focus on analyzing the two main ways of restitution and compensation.\n\nICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep. (1996) 226, para.41.\nFirst of all, we analyze restitution, as the content of the remedy system with the largest scope of remedies, because it can directly eliminate the consequences of wrongdoing, Article 35 of the Draft Articles lists Restitution as a priority remedy. The conditions for the application of restitution included the principles of physical possibility and proportionality, which also required that restitution should not impose a “disproportionate burden” on the responsible State, such as requiring a poor State to bear a large share of the cost of restoration, which was clearly impractical and might be exempted. While the elimination of wrongful consequences is well conceived, and in practice it has been implemented to a certain extent, resulting in more effective State responsibility, restitution also faces contemporary challenges, such as the creation of irreversible damage. While it is naturally clear that nuclear contamination, species extinction, and the like cannot be truly restored in the traditional sense, it is also possible to cause irreversible damage in the context of cyberattacks.\nTake the SolarWinds supply chain attack as an example, the Russian intelligence service hijacked the U.S. SolarWinds software update by implanting malicious code to infiltrate the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and nine other federal agencies and hundreds of enterprises. This case not only resulted in the long-term exposure of intelligence networks and the leakage of sensitive data but also called into question the credibility of global IT supply chain security standards and led to a shift to “zero-trust” architectures and a sharp increase in the cost of international cooperation. While the technical damage can be remedied through compensation, the erosion of democracy is likely to be irreversible, as the cyber-attack has largely eroded public trust in the government's cybersecurity capabilities, which will be difficult to rebuild in a short period, and difficult to fully restore through restitution. Therefore, although restitution can theoretically maximize the compensation for the damage caused, it is obvious that it cannot be fully compensated in practice, and other remedies are needed to supplement it.\nSecondly, as one of the mainstream remedies, Article 31 of the Draft Articles establishes the obligation of the responsible State to provide “full reparation” for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act, which covers both material and moral damages, reflecting the purpose of the elimination of all the consequences of the injury. The principle of the Chorzów Factory case of the Permanent Court of International Justice, of 1928, also provides evidence of this: it establishes that reparation is required to restore the injured State to the “state it would have been in had the wrongful act not been committed”. Further analysis of the types of reparation and the scope of application reveals that reparation can be very broad, ranging from material to moral damages, from direct, quantifiable property damage to indirect, reasonably foreseeable, consequential damages, such as loss of profits due to interruption of trade. Indirect damages, however, often require stricter proof of causation, and the calculation of compensation was controversial at the current stage. In any case, as the mainstream way of assuming state responsibility, the existence of compensation is also of practical significance to the realization of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, which requires less time cost and can more efficiently compensate for the interests of the victimized state than the institutional correction and other methods.\n\n---\n\n## ## Conclusions The accelerated militarization of cyberspace has plunged the state responsibility system into a “triple normative dilemma”: first, the transformation of technical evidence into legal facts has led to the failure of the attribution mechanism; second, the hermeneutical controversy over the boundaries of the right to self-defense has triggered a crisis of the legitimacy of the countermeasures; and third, the vacuum in the allocation of responsibility due to the involvement of non-State actors has resulted in the systematic failure of the enforcement mechanism.

Due to the ambiguity of the object of regulation, the defect of attribution mechanism, and the lack of clarity of the constituent elements of responsibility, the existing international law framework has caused the state responsibility system in cyberspace to fall into the dilemma of normative failure. This paper takes the theory of international law subjectivity as the logical starting point and systematically deconstructs the normative attributes of cyberwar and the path of responsibility determination. This paper shows that the constitutive elements of state responsibility need to break through the rigid standard of traditional \"behavior-damage\" causality and build a dynamic attribution system combining technical verification and legal presumption. Through critical analysis of the use of force threshold doctrine, this paper, based on a comprehensive analysis of the core dilemma of the determination of state responsibility, proposes to appropriately introduce the concept of \"substantial support\", and when the traditional theory of comprehensive control fails to make effective attribution, the criterion of \"substantial support\" can be used to complete the attribution of state responsibility with the increasingly developed technological traceability means.\n\nKeywords: cyberwarfare; international law; state responsibility; attributability\n\n*Corresponding author: Haonan Li, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: lihaonan22402065@zju.edu.cn. https://orcid.org/0009-0005-0476-300X\nLe Cheng, Guanghua Law School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, E-mail: chengle163@hotmail.com. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4423-8585",
    "The militarized transformation of cyberspace has upended the cognitive architecture of the use of force under the Westphalian system. Traditional military theory faces challenges when applied to cyber conflict (Kallberg 2016). The evolution of cyberwarfare from a technological tool to a means of strategic deterrence has led to a blurring of the legal boundaries between peacetime and armed conflict. And the increasing effectiveness of cyberattacks further complicates the legal context of cyberwarfare (Gray 2024). The traditional state responsibility regime needs to be reconfigured due to a triple adaptive dilemma: first, technological anonymity triggers a break in the chain of attribution, which puts the “effective control” criterion in Article 8 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility in a difficult position to prove; second, the non-kinetic nature of cyber operations makes it difficult to quantify the threshold for the use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations; and third, the legitimacy boundary of countermeasures creates normative conflicts under the “forward defense” strategy.\n\nThis paper adopts a techno-legal cross-analysis approach to focus on the normative reconstruction path of state responsibility in cyber warfare. By deconstructing the dilemma of determining state responsibility at the current stage and proposing corresponding reconstruction paths, this paper attempts to discuss how the determination standard of the attribute of force in cyberwarfare can be coordinated with the “principle of equivalence of effect” of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the mode of assuming the indirect responsibility of the state in the context of the intervention of non-state actors. It is hoped that through the reconstruction of various paths, the issue of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare can be clarified as much as possible, and the diffuse damage caused by cyberwarfare can be curbed. This paper aims to provide theoretical support for the clear identification of state responsibility in the context of cyberwarfare and to promote the formation of a technologically empowered international law governance paradigm.\n\n## Deconstructing the normative attributes of cyberwarfare\n\n### The evolution of the conceptual genealogy of cyberwarfare\n\nThe generation of the normative concept of cyberwarfare has gone through the process of discourse migration from military science to jurisprudence. The concept of cyberwarfare first appeared in a research report by the RAND Corporation in 1993,",
    "which defined cyberwarfare as a military operation being implemented or prepared to be implemented according to information-related principles (John and Ronfeldt 1993). In the strategic dimension, the concept of cyberwarfare was accompanied by the completion of the ontological construction of the theory of the “Fifth Dimension”, which was recognized by Huang (2015), who argued that “the rapid development of the global Internet has been driven by the rapid advancement of information technology, and cyberspace has begun to take shape as the ‘fifth space' beyond the land, sea, airspace and outer space”. At the same time, a variety of problems and threats such as cyber-attacks and cybercrime have also arisen, and the concept of “cyber warfare” is put forward in this context. On the one hand, along with the development of science and technology, the scale of cyber warfare has reached an unprecedented level, such as the cyber attack and defense in the Russo-Georgian war, the Iranian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the Shocknet virus, the Syrian nuclear facilities that were attacked by the airstrikes, and other cases, all of which are the embodiment of the escalation of the intensity of modern cyber warfare. On the other hand, the relevant theoretical research has been optimized based on the endless cyber warfare.\n\nCompared with China's late start in cyberwarfare research, western countries have begun research on cyberwarfare earlier, with a larger scale and wider scope, and have also achieved rich results in the formulation of international rules in cyberspace. Since the development of relevant theories, the current mainstream scholars believe that the content of international law on jus ad bellum can be applied to cyber warfare. For example, Reese Nguyen (2013) believes that when a cyber attack is intended to cause irreversible damage or physical loss to the physical information system, it can be recognized as constituting an attack with force. The main argument in favor of this claim is based on Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, which states that “all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. There are different doctrinal understandings of how to argue that cyberwarfare is a use of force under Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations, as will be presented in the next section.\n\n### 2.2 Doctrines of thresholds for use of force in cyberwarfare\n\nAt present, mainstream scholars believe that cyberwarfare constitutes the use of force, but there are different doctrines in understanding, mainly the theory of purpose, instrumental theory, scale, and consequence theory (Huang 2015). Walter Sharp (1999), a representative of the “purpose theory”, argues that computer",
    "network attacks are a form of economic and political coercion, and although such coercion is traditionally considered not to be a “use of force”, in the light of the purpose of the Charter of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, and the territorial integrity and political independence of States guaranteed by Article 2(4), computer network attacks should also be subject to Article 2(4) since economic and political coercion would also threaten international peace and jeopardize the territorial integrity and political independence of a State, and would therefore be covered by the scope of the Article.\n\nMarco Roscini (2010), a representative of the “tools doctrine”, argues that the “military force” that Article 2(4) intends to regulate is mainly embodied in the use of specific weapons (or tools) and that cyber-attacks using “weapons” such as Trojan horses, worms, etc. can also constitute a use of force prohibited by Article 2(4) if they produce specific tangible or intangible damage. The most widely accepted theory is the “scale and consequences theory”, in which Professor Michael Schmitt (1999, 2011) argues that although the main purpose of Article 2(4) is to constrain a state's external use of traditional military force to coerce others, in practice what matters is not the means used but the consequences; if a cyber-attack directly causes or is likely to cause damage to persons or objects comparable to that caused by military means, it should undoubtedly constitute a “use of force”; even if it does not cause tangible damage to persons or objects, the victimized State can still determine whether a cyber-attack constitutes a “use of force” by assessing the following seven criteria: (a) severity, (b) immediacy, (c) directness, (d) invasiveness, (e) measurability of effects, (f) presumptive legality and (g) state involvement. Although there are strengths and weaknesses in each viewpoint, as far as the existing situation is analyzed, the scale and consequence theory is recognized by majority of researchers, and the proposition of Prof. Michael Schmit has had a greater impact in the Western academic community, not only in the Tallinn Manual, which is edited by him but also recognized by Western countries. It is worth mentioning that the Tallinn Manual, as a document developed with the participation of multinational subjects, contains seven out of eight assessment criteria for defining whether a cyberattack constitutes a use of force that are identical to those mentioned in the previous article, which indicates that the evaluation criteria advocated by the scale and consequences theory have their own rationality and can be generally accepted by the majority of countries.\n\nIt should be noted that the research on issues related to cyberwarfare in this paper is based on cases where cyberwarfare can trigger international responsibility, and cyber infringement and cybercrime activities, which are only regulated by the domestic laws of various countries as well as a small number of international treaties, obviously do not fall into the category of use of force as stipulated in the",
    "Charter of the United Nations 2(4), and they also cannot trigger the responsibility of the State, and therefore do not fall within the scope of this paper's analysis.\n\n## Normative elements and paths to attribution of state responsibility in cyberwarfare\n\n### Normative basis and constitutive elements of the state responsibility regime\n\nThe institutional framework of state responsibility in international law is rooted in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Articles). According to Chapter I and Chapter II of the Draft Articles, the establishment of state responsibility requires the fulfillment of two normative elements: wrongfulness and attributability. In the following, the two elements will be analyzed separately.\n\nInitially, the analysis of wrongfulness. In Article 2 of the Draft Articles, the International Law Commission defines that “there is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: (a) is attributable to the State under international law, and (b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.” In the context of cyberwarfare, it is clear that most cases of wrongful acts are in the form of action, as exemplified by the Russo-Georgian war: the Georgian government website was attacked, the government web server was on the verge of collapsing due to the large number of access requests it received for more than 10 h, the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was completely dysfunctional, and the website of the presidential administration was paralyzed for 24 h. As the fighting deepened, the intensity and sophistication of the cyber-attacks increased, with Russia targeting Georgia's government and news media websites as the primary targets, disabling virtually all of Georgia's government offices. Second, it is worth noting that the article does not mention that subjective fault or intent to engage in a wrongful act is required to establish state responsibility; the mere existence of a violation of the law is sufficient to give rise to international responsibility, and, by extension, state responsibility should be an objective rather than a subjective responsibility. The normative logic of this objective responsibility paradigm, which rejects the subjective fault element, is that the unlawfulness of an internationally wrongful act arises from an objective breach of an international obligation rather than from the state of mind of the acting state (Crawford 2013).\n\nIn addition, the article requires that the wrongful act constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state, and for a further understanding of the",
    "Cheng and Li\n\nDE GRUYTER\n\nobligation, one can refer to the definitions in Articles 12 and 13 of the Draft Articles. Article 12 provides that there is a breach of an international obligation by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. Article 13 provides that an act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs. In other words, the key feature of a breach of an international obligation is that the obligation should have been complied with, but in fact, the State in question did not take reasonable action to comply with the obligation.\n\nArticle 12 makes it clear that, regardless of the origin or character of the obligation, when analyzed in terms of the sources of international law, the source of the obligation is varied, and may be a customary one, or one based on a treaty, or even a legal principle generally recognized by the international community. In the Rainbow Warrior case, for example, the arbitral tribunal stated that there is no distinction in international law between contractual and tortious liability, so any breach by a State of a duty, regardless of the source of the duty, gives rise to the responsibility of the State and therefore to an obligation to make reparation.¹ This case is very strong evidence of the broadness of the source of the obligation.\n\nThe broadness of the source of the obligation is conducive to the regulation of cyberwarfare. First, for States parties to cyberwarfare-related treaties, such as the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, a violation of the content of the treaty can constitute a direct breach of the obligation. Second, for countries not participating in the treaty, if the relevant practice of maintaining network security has been generally recognized in the international community and can become a kind of habit, the habit can also be used as a source of obligation, and if it does not comply with the habit, it is also possible to find that a country violates the obligation, which undoubtedly enlarges the scope of the main body needing to comply with the obligation, and allows more countries to consciously comply with the obligation. What's more, the identification and formation of general principles are essential for maintaining international law as a coherent legal system (Shao 2021). Therefore, sometimes principles can also govern the behavior of States. It should be noted, however, that even if a State commits certain acts of cyberattack against another State and causes damage, if it does not constitute a breach of an international obligation, it will not give rise to the legal responsibility of the author State.\n\n¹ Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (New Zealand v. France) (“Rainbow Warrior”), Award of 30 April 1990, 20 UNRIAA 215, para.75.",
    "Correspondingly, attributability is then analyzed. Theoretically, all acts of individuals, corporations, or other entities in the sense of domestic law may be attributed to a State (Government) based on nationality. In dealing with this issue, the Draft Articles adopt a narrow approach, namely, the “overall control test”, whereby the only conduct that can be attributed to a State is that of State organs or other entities acting under the direction, control, or instigation of a State organ, which becomes an agent of the State at the time of the conduct (Kanehara 2019). As far as the attributability of the state in cyber warfare is concerned, if a cyber attack is initiated or directed by the state as the main body, the corresponding responsibility is borne by the state. In simple cases, the attributability of state responsibility can be quickly recognized. However, since the development of cyberwarfare, identifying the source of cyber-attacks is crucial to ensuring cybersecurity (Swate et al. 2024), its technical means have become increasingly flexible, and many attribution problems are caused by anonymous attacks, and the attackers can often easily hide their identities, which has brought great challenges to the tracking of the source of the attack. Even if the source of the attack is identified, the subject needs to be further clarified. The subject of a cyberattack can avoid being targeted by hiding or forging his identity in many ways, so pinpointing the subject is also a major challenge.\n\nIn addition, when a country helps another country to engage in internationally wrongful acts, the former also to the extent of the support, helps to bear state responsibility, but the main state responsibility still belongs to the wrongdoing state (Aust 2011). But regardless of the size of state responsibility, by analogy, in the context of cyberwarfare, if a country provides technical means or financial support and other help to other countries, in principle, it should also bear the corresponding responsibility, and if that State has both wrongful acts and breaches of its obligations, it may also satisfy the constituent elements of State responsibility, and thus bear State responsibility in cyberwarfare to the extent of the damage caused by that State.\n\n### Hierarchical construction of standards of proof\n\nAs a component of the constituent elements, whether it is the judgment of wrongfulness or the judgment of attributability, there is the problem of proof. In fact, for the legal field of the problem, the standard of proof has been extremely important, from the traditional theory of evidence, the standard of proof is the judge to consider and weigh the authenticity of the facts of the case to achieve the degree of proof, but also the burden of proof to provide the appropriate evidence to prove the facts of the case to achieve a certain standard (He and Wang 2017). The degree of standard of proof is directly related to the judge for the degree of conviction of the evidence, which naturally will affect the results of the judgment. Criminal law, civil law, and",
    "Cheng and Li\n\nDE GRUYTER\n\nother substantive areas of law, after a long period of development, in their litigation process also have their standard of proof, although different standards for the results of the judgment have a decisive impact, the litigant naturally needs to try to meet the standard of proof. On the other hand, for the facts that have occurred, no one has the ability to  $100\\%$  reproduce the scene, they can only try to prove to maximize the proximity of the objective facts, thus providing judges with a good judgment environment so that judges as far as possible can make a reasonable judgment, and the standard of proof from this sense of understanding is also the embodiment of substantive justice.\n\nOutside the traditional field of substantive law, the standard of proof is also of great significance to the issue of international law. In international law, the composition of state responsibility needs to satisfy both illegal behavior and attributable elements, but the proof of the two elements is also a separate issue, whether the two standards of proof are consistent, and if not, what kind of standards should be used is an urgent discussion. As early as before the emergence of the problem of evidence in the field of networks, the International Court of Justice pointed out in the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua that the key to the solution to the problem lies not only in the process of attributing conduct to the law of a particular country but also in the search for substantial evidence before the process of legal attribution. It is thus clear that the question of the standard of proof is not simply an integral part of the question of the attribution of State responsibility, but is more relevant for independent discussion.\n\nAs far as the current situation is concerned, there is a lack of a uniform and clear standard of proof in international law. In the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice emphasized the principle of the free assessment of evidence, stating that within the limits of the Statute of the Court and the Rules of the Tribunal, the Court is free to assess the value of any evidence.3 While the persistent lack of uniform standards in international law has been detrimental to the development of proof, an analysis of the nature of the cases before the ICJ shows that there is a corresponding rationale for the absence of uniform standards of proof that the complexity and diversity of the cases before the ICJ make it difficult to arrive at a uniform standard that would be universally or primarily applicable to inter-State litigation (Watts 2000).",
    "In addition, although the Court's deficiencies in the standard of proof may lead to subjective factors on the part of the judges affecting the decision of the case, in practice, the Court usually indicates in its judgments the standard of proof that it has adopted. Even if there is no expressly stated uniform standard, taking the standard of proof in a large number of judgments as a sample, it is still possible to analyze the issue of the standard of proof to one degree or another. Examining the decisions of ICJ, it can be found that the standard of proof adopted by ICJ basically draws on the system of standard of proof of the domestic courts of the common law system. According to different types of cases, the common law system of the standard of proof, according to the degree of strictness in descending order, can be divided into four types: (1) the criminal field is usually adopted with full certainty of “beyond a reasonable doubt”; (2) “clear and convincing proof”, which is highly probable but does not reach the level of incontrovertibility; (3) “preponderance of evidence”, which is usually adopted in civil proceedings and has a higher degree of reasonableness and probability; (4) prima facie evidence, which is merely required to prove indications of the correctness of an argument (Green 2009).\n\nThe standards of proof established for different types of cases are also of great significance in the context of cyberwarfare. Cyber-attacks are more covert and asymmetric than traditional attacks, and the degree of damage caused and the difficulty of investigation vary to different degrees, making evaluation more difficult than in traditional cases. Therefore, it is not practical to establish a uniform standard of proof, and a more reasonable approach should be to adopt different standards of proof according to the different degrees of impact brought about by cyberwarfare.\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of cases have highlighted the intersection of cybercrime and cyberwarfare: operations with a clear cyberwarfare intent have incorporated tactical maneuvers normally associated with cybercrime. Cybercrime constitutes the criminal exploitation of digital systems to perpetrate unlawful activities through technological means (Hawdon 2021). Nowadays, the virtual nature, technological infrastructure, and limitless scalability of digital networks -- when combined with the misuse of big data analytics -- have paradoxically dissolved traditional national boundaries, transforming transnational criminal operations into borderless threats with globalized impact (Zhao and Cheng 2024). If the extent of cyberwarfare has reached the level of a criminal case, it should be strictly required to meet the standard of proof of a criminal case.\n\nTake the Shocknet virus, for example, which, in the course of cyberwarfare led to the damage of about 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz plant, accounting for one-fifth of the total number of Iranian centrifuges and delaying Iran's uranium enrichment program, in addition to the accidental spread of the Shocknet virus around the globe, which infected more than 100,000 computers. In terms of its impact, its nature has reached the seriousness of a criminal case. As Judge Higgins of the International",
    "Cheng and Li\n\nDE GRUYTER\n\nCourt of Justice pointed out in his independent opinion in the Oil Platforms case, the more serious the allegations, the greater the degree of credibility of the evidence required.⁴ Therefore, in a case such as the Shocknet virus, which has already reached the standard of a criminal case, proof of the wrongfulness and attributability of the acts of the United States and Israel in the case will need to reach the level of beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nAs generative AI becomes widespread, the costs of creating and spreading viral false information, along with cross-border data storage, transfer, and processing expenses, are plummeting so that the frequency of cyber attacks is also on the rise (Cheng and Liu 2023). It is clearly unreasonable to apply the standards of cybercrime to all cyberattacks. A more rational approach would be to lower the burden of proof for cyberattacks that cause less damage and do not constitute a criminal case, similar to some of the standards of proof in civil litigation. But in any case, for the standard of proof of cyberwarfare is inappropriate to adopt the standard of prima facie evidence, \"prima facie evidence\" refers to \"sufficient to establish a fact or to establish a presumption, unless it is effectively rebutted\" evidence. A prima facie case can only mean that there is a possibility that the fact occurred, but it is not very convincing.\n\nMoreover, the application of that criterion to the determination of state responsibility would undoubtedly lead to a series of problems and increase the cost of dealing with cases because of its weak persuasiveness. For example, if a State was found to have committed a wrongful act merely because there was a possibility that it had done so, not only was there no basis in jurisprudence, but it would also be difficult for the international community to accept an assessment based on simple values. Additionally, the principle that the higher the gravity of the act, the higher the standard of proof is consistently reflected in academic discussions of international law, particularly concerning the International Court of Justice (Bills 2023). If a state is found to be liable for the high cost of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, it need only meet such a simple standard of proof, which clearly violates this principle.\n\n## 3.3 Normative boundaries of the deterrent factors of responsibility\n\nThe wrongfulness of an act is one of the elements of the law of state responsibility, and the absence of wrongfulness does not entail the responsibility of the state, a situation that can also be referred to as a cause of impediment to state responsibility, with an emphasis on the analysis of two cases: self-defense and countermeasures.\n\n⁴ Oil Platforms (Iran v. U.S.), I.C.J. Judgment of 6 November 2003, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, para.33.",
    "DE GRUYTER\nState responsibility in cyberwarfare\n11\n\nArticle 51 of the Charter of the United Nations states: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security”. The expression “armed attack” should be distinguished from “use of force” in Article 2(4). When analyzed using textual interpretation, it is clear that the degree of “armed attack” is much stronger than that of “use of force”.\n\nMoreover, the International Court of Justice, in the Nicaragua case, held that all attacks of force belonged to the use of force, but not all uses of force constituted an attack of force, and that only those that were the most serious and had a significant scale and consequences could constitute an “armed attack” (Leigh 1984). According to the relevant judgment, there is a difference in intensity between the two. The significance of this distinction should also be reflected in cyberattacks. If a cyber-attack by a State only constitutes a use of force under Article 2(4) but does not constitute an armed attack under Article 51, it is certainly a serious internationally wrongful act in breach of an obligation under international law of jus cogens, but the injured State can only take non-forceful “countermeasures” as provided for in the Draft Articles. Once such measures are found to constitute an armed attack, the injured State may invoke Article 51 to legitimately exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defense, including the use of force.\n\nCountermeasures in international law are non-forcible measures taken by an injured State against a State responsible for committing an internationally wrongful act to induce the responsible State to comply with its international obligations, with the intention of restoring reciprocity between the parties (Omura 2010). Accordingly, countermeasures do not normally involve the use of force (Jia 2022). They are lawful, provided that they meet the conditions set out in Part Three of the Draft Articles.5 Countermeasures are generally used in cases where the use of force does not rise to the level of an armed attack and, by analogy, in the field of cyberwarfare in cases where the level of the attack is not overly aggressive. Cases such as the SolarWinds supply chain attack and the Stuxnet virus attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities have reached the level of an armed attack in terms of both the means used and the damage\n\n5 ICJ, Application of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia v. Greece), Judgment of 5 December 2011, para.164.",
    "Cheng and Li\n\nDE GRUYTER\n\ncaused, and the right of self-defense can be triggered, no longer at the level of countermeasures.\n\nTraditional remedies such as compensation and restitution take some time to realize, and if one is only passively waiting for remedies there is a risk of further expanding losses, so as more timely remedies, both self-defense and countermeasures are necessary to avoid the expansion of losses to the maximum extent possible before traditional remedies can be obtained. Neither the right of self-defense nor the exercise of countermeasures is without limits. Customary law also limits the exercise of the right of self-defense, $^{6}$ and the use of force in self-defense remains wrongful if it is accompanied by a violation of international humanitarian law or human rights since special provisions of international humanitarian law (such as the prohibition on retaliatory measures against civilians or prisoners of war) and certain human rights are non-derogable in all circumstances (Crawford 2002).\n\nSimilarly, the scope of countermeasures is limited, as draft article 50, Paragraph 1, provides that countermeasures shall not affect: (a) the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations; (b) obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights; (c) obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals; (d) other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. In addition, Article 50, Paragraph 2, makes it clear that a State taking countermeasures is not relieved from fulfilling its obligations: (a) under any dispute settlement procedure applicable between it and the responsible State; (b) to respect the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents, premises, archives, and documents.\n\n## 3.4 The practical significance of the realization mechanism of state responsibility\n\nThe state responsibility system is not only a rule implementation tool but also a carrier of the international community's value consensus. On this basis, once the state responsibility is recognized, it is necessary to fulfill the corresponding reality of the obligation. Attribution is not the ultimate goal; using attribution to further solve the problem is the significance of the state responsibility recognition. Under the background of cyber war, the significance of the reality is still worth paying attention to. State responsibility is assumed in various ways; here, we focus on analyzing the two main ways of restitution and compensation.\n\n$^{6}$ ICJ, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Rep. (1996) 226, para.41.",
    "First of all, we analyze restitution, as the content of the remedy system with the largest scope of remedies, because it can directly eliminate the consequences of wrongdoing, Article 35 of the Draft Articles lists Restitution as a priority remedy. The conditions for the application of restitution included the principles of physical possibility and proportionality, which also required that restitution should not impose a “disproportionate burden” on the responsible State, such as requiring a poor State to bear a large share of the cost of restoration, which was clearly impractical and might be exempted. While the elimination of wrongful consequences is well conceived, and in practice it has been implemented to a certain extent, resulting in more effective State responsibility, restitution also faces contemporary challenges, such as the creation of irreversible damage. While it is naturally clear that nuclear contamination, species extinction, and the like cannot be truly restored in the traditional sense, it is also possible to cause irreversible damage in the context of cyberattacks.\n\nTake the SolarWinds supply chain attack as an example, the Russian intelligence service hijacked the U.S. SolarWinds software update by implanting malicious code to infiltrate the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and nine other federal agencies and hundreds of enterprises. This case not only resulted in the long-term exposure of intelligence networks and the leakage of sensitive data but also called into question the credibility of global IT supply chain security standards and led to a shift to “zero-trust” architectures and a sharp increase in the cost of international cooperation. While the technical damage can be remedied through compensation, the erosion of democracy is likely to be irreversible, as the cyber-attack has largely eroded public trust in the government's cybersecurity capabilities, which will be difficult to rebuild in a short period, and difficult to fully restore through restitution. Therefore, although restitution can theoretically maximize the compensation for the damage caused, it is obvious that it cannot be fully compensated in practice, and other remedies are needed to supplement it.\n\nSecondly, as one of the mainstream remedies, Article 31 of the Draft Articles establishes the obligation of the responsible State to provide “full reparation” for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act, which covers both material and moral damages, reflecting the purpose of the elimination of all the consequences of the injury. The principle of the Chorzów Factory case of the Permanent Court of International Justice, of 1928, also provides evidence of this: it establishes that reparation is required to restore the injured State to the “state it would have been in had the wrongful act not been committed”. Further analysis of the types of reparation and the scope of application reveals that reparation can be very broad, ranging from material to moral damages, from direct, quantifiable property damage to",
    "indirect, reasonably foreseeable, consequential damages, such as loss of profits due to interruption of trade. Indirect damages, however, often require stricter proof of causation, and the calculation of compensation was controversial at the current stage. In any case, as the mainstream way of assuming state responsibility, the existence of compensation is also of practical significance to the realization of state responsibility in cyberwarfare, which requires less time cost and can more efficiently compensate for the interests of the victimized state than the institutional correction and other methods.\n\n## Core dilemmas in the determination of state responsibility\n\nThe determination of state responsibility is of great significance, and can lead to real consequences such as restitution and compensation, but in the context of cyberwar, the core problems of the determination of state responsibility need to be paid attention to, mainly including the normative transformation obstacles of the technical attribution, the paradigm conflict of the application of the right of self-defense, and the systemic failure of the mechanism of responsibility assumption. Failure to analyze these dilemmas and propose solutions will make it difficult to trigger the consequences of state responsibility, which will not be conducive to the resolution of international disputes.\n\n### Normative transformation barriers to technical attribution\n\nThe MITRE ATT&CK framework, a widely adopted knowledge base of attack behaviors in the current cybersecurity field, can provide technical references for cyber-attack traceability by standardizing the description of attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures (Al-Sada et al. 2024; Georgiadou et al. 2021). However, the transformation of its technical references to legal evidence is facing difficulties.\n\nPrimarily, the paradigm conflict between technical logic and legal logic hinders the transformation of technical indicators into legal evidence to a certain extent. ATT&CK framework is based on the identification of attack behavioral patterns, such as the “credential dump + lateral movement” mode of APT29, attackers often use the system's functions and tools to operate by modifying the system configuration or using legitimate tools and other methods to move laterally, ATT&CK framework for the identification of the attack behavior pattern to derive technical indicators. However, according to Article 8 of the Draft Articles: The conduct of a person or",
    "group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact, acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. It can be seen that a finding of State responsibility under international law requires proof of “effective control” of the attacking act in relation to the will of the State. For example, in the 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack, attackers injected malicious code called “Sunburst” into SolarWinds' flagship Orion software (Marelli 2022), even though security firms identified SUNBURST's TTPs through ATT&CK, such as T1059.001 command line interface abuse, but these technical characteristics can not directly prove that the Russian intelligence services of the main responsibility, the United States cited the ATT&CK report accusing Russia, but the international community in general to the “lack of direct chain of evidence” to question its legal effectiveness. In this case, even if it is recognized that there is indeed an attack, due to the inability to prove that the behavior is directed or controlled by a country, it is also difficult to use the technical indicators as evidence in the legal sense.\n\nSubsequently, the existence of intermediate nodes easily leads to a broken chain of evidence. Attackers commonly adopt the anonymizing technical architecture of “springboard server + virtual private network (VPN)”. Taking the 2016 Bangladesh central bank theft case as an example, although the C2 server IP of the SWIFT transaction instructions was traced to the Philippines, further investigation showed that the server was a puppet host controlled by the North Korean Lazarus group. This kind of multi-layer hopping leads to greater difficulty in technical traceability, and the result of traceability may also cause a break in the chain of evidence.\n\nAnother example is the attack on targets in China by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) through the QUANTUM attack platform, in which a number of modules are involved in concealing the identity of the attack, including QUANTUMBOT Module -- through the hijacking of the botnet command and control of network traffic, manipulating the botnet to launch attack activities and to hide the traces of the U.S. National Security Agency's hacking attacks.; QUANTUMBISCUIT Module -- builds a proxy springboard for quantum injection attacks against an attack target to prevent the attack from being detected retroactively; QUANTUMPHANTOM Module -- provides the technical ability to utilize network link intermediate node hijacking technology to achieve the hiding of the source of the attack, preventing the U.S. National Security Agency's cyberattacks against other countries from being traced back (Wei 2023). The use of multiple anonymization techniques undoubtedly creates a great obstacle to traceability work. Even if the source of the attack can be located accurately in the end, the identity of the operating subject behind the attack still needs to be further identified, and the attacker can be disguised as other countries/organizations or fake IP addresses, etc. to confuse the traceability (Schmitt 2017). The existence of intermediate nodes also makes it difficult to form a",
    "chain of evidence. The objective existence of obvious cyber attacks due to problems in the chain of evidence may not be able to carry out a trial in the end and even more accurately determine the responsibility of the state and solve the problem.\n\nIn addition, the “falsifiability” of technical indicators also weakens their probative value in practice. An important manifestation of this is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). It is widely recognized as the most sophisticated and powerful category of security threats (Ahmad et al. 2019). APTs are engineered by resourced, disciplined threat actors capable of sustained operations through systematic technology exploitation, blending expertise, funding, and structured coordination to maintain persistence (Maisey 2014; Mansfield-Devine 2014). APT organizations often falsify attack signatures through False Flag operations. The identification of false flags is inherently complex, primarily because attackers systematically conceal their actions while simultaneously framing innocent entities for malicious conduct (Rid and Buchanan 2015). Conducting a false flag operation in the cyber realm is fundamentally distinct and far simpler compared to its execution in the physical domain (Goodman 2010). For example, in the 2017 NotPetya ransomware incident, ATT&CK-based T1486 disk encryption analysis initially pointed to North Korea, but subsequent code homology analysis revealed a link to the Russian Sandworm organization. This type of technological misdirection makes the judicial application of the ATT&CK framework a “reasonable suspicion” challenge. As counterfeiting technologies evolve, the ATT&CK framework should also evolve with the times and develop more accurate techniques for identifying forgeries, or else the credibility of the technical indicators it produces may be further diminished in the face of the difficulty of transferring technical indicators to legal evidence.\n\n### Paradigm conflicts in the application of the right of self-defense\n\nEven in the face of cyberattacks, the exercise of the right of self-defense and countermeasures is not unlimited and still needs to comply with certain requirements, so it is still necessary to make a clearer discussion on the boundaries of the legality of the use of the right of self-defense and countermeasures in cyberwarfare.\n\nAs mentioned in the previous article, as to the question of whether cyber warfare constitutes the use of force under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, the “scale and consequence theory” proposed by Prof. Michael Schmit has the highest degree of acceptance at present. As long as the analysis is conducted according to the multiple indicators of scale and consequence, and the cyber-attack is considered to be a case of the use of force, then countermeasures or even the exercise of the right to self-defense can be taken. The most controversial issue at present is that the",
    "right to determine the use of force is in the hands of more developed countries, and the seemingly objective judgment criteria are to some extent mixed with subjective factors.\n\nAs is widely known, the Tallinn Manual edited by Prof. Michael Schmit, as a more authoritative and important reference document for the study of cyber warfare, has seven of the eight assessment criteria for determining whether the use of force constitutes a use of force, which are completely consistent with the criteria advocated by Prof. Michael Schmit himself. The criteria are somewhat arbitrary and subjective. For example, Professor Schmit himself, when applying these factors to analyze the 2007 cyberattack against Estonia, concluded that the attack constituted a use of force. Other scholars, however, have argued that the opposite conclusion that the cyberattack did not constitute a use of force can easily be reached by relying on these same factors, which can be easily manipulated in their application to reach conclusions that benefit the geostrategic objectives of the country being analyzed (Nguyen 2013).\n\nMoreover, when applied to cyberattacks, the “scale and consequence” standard has a fatal logical flaw: a given consequence of the same scale and severity can be produced by the use of force as well as by non-forceful means. The loss of life and the destruction of forests and land in a downstream country as a result of the discharge of toxic substances into a river by an upstream country or the starvation and economic turmoil of a country as a result of economic sanctions imposed by one country on another, are in themselves highly analogous to those that would normally result from the use of force. However, in general perception, these acts hardly constitute a use of force in international law or even an internationally wrongful act. In this way, such acts can escape legal sanction even if they have consequences comparable to those of the use of force. Cyberattacks, however, may be recognized as a use of force and subject to liability if they have the same legal consequences. This logical loophole exists partly because of the arbitrariness and subjectivity of the judgment standard. Western scholars with stronger discursive power often lower the threshold for the use of the right to self-defense through an expansive interpretation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, and in this regard, seemingly reasonable standards can often be interpreted to achieve political goals.\n\nIn addition to lowering the threshold of the right to self-defense through acts of interpretation, the United States has also put forward the “Defend Forward” strategy, which is an offensive defense strategy it has put forward in recent years in the field of cyberspace security, aiming to respond to cyber threats using proactive strikes and pre-emptive strikes. The United States Cyber Command has emphasized the need to adopt a “forward posture” in cyberspace by accessing non-Department of Defense networks or systems to weaken an adversary's cyber capabilities in advance and prevent it from taking action. Such an assertion should be relegated to the academic",
    "category of preventive self-defense, which is advocated by a few Western countries and Western scholars, but is not and should not be supported in existing international treaties and customary international law -- it means “granting the major powers an almost unrestricted license to use force” (Klabbers 2013). In summary, the definition of cyberwarfare and the various criteria for judging it, as well as the proposal of strategies such as “forward defense,” are undoubtedly suspected of serving political goals. Professor O'Connell also believes that “cyberwarfare” is a “wrong war”. It is essentially an “invented” problem in the context of the increasing militarization of cybersecurity policies of major Western countries (O'Connell 2012).\n\n### Systemic failure of responsibility mechanisms\n\nThe decentralized nature of cyberspace forms a structural contradiction with the “state-centered” responsibility framework of traditional international law, resulting in an imbalance in the distribution of responsibility between states and non-state actors, rigid rules of evidence, and a lack of enforcement mechanisms.\n\nFirst, the traditional logic of attribution has loopholes that need to be filled in the context of cyberspace, and the traditional theoretical criterion of “effective control” has limitations. This criterion originated from the 1986 case of Nicaragua v. United States, in which the ICJ made it clear that to attribute the conduct of non-state actors to a state (the United States), it is necessary to prove that the state exercised “effective control” over the specific military operation. Not only does the state provide general support such as funding, weapons, or training, but it also needs to have actual command over the specific unlawful action, i.e. the state needs to directly direct or specifically instruct the attack. However, the “outsourcing of tools” in cyberattacks has led to a high degree of invisibility of the state-attacker nexus. For example, in the case of the Iranian APT34 attack on Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in 2021, although the technical traceability showed that the attack tools were linked to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, it was not possible to prove that their actions were “specifically directed” by the state. In the context of cyberwarfare, “effective control” has the risk of being too rigid, leading to the impossibility of attribution, and the choice of whether to include other judgment criteria in such cases has been widely discussed, among which the theory of “overall control” is of particular research value.\n\nThe theory of “Overall Control” originated from the judgment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the case of Prosecutor v. Tadić. The Tribunal held that the conduct of a state can be attributed",
    "DE GRUYTER\nState responsibility in cyberwarfare\n19\n\nto the state even if it does not directly direct a specific attack, if the state has a strategic level of domination over non-state actors, including the provision of funds, equipment, training, and coordination of operations. From a conceptual analysis, this standard is largely different from the “effective control” standard, which has a lower threshold for attribution, and if the case of Nicaragua v. United States mentioned above were to be handled according to this standard, the United States would likely be found liable.\n\nIn the context of cyberwarfare, the anonymity of cyberattacks, technology dependence, and the ambiguity of actors make the traditional standard of attribution challenging, and the “overall control” theory has potential advantages in some respects. The criterion is superior in terms of identification in response to the prevalence of indirect support models. States often support cyberattacks through technological enablement, infrastructure harboring, or strategic guidance. Such behavior is more consistent with the “strategic dominance” characteristic of “overall control” than with the “specific instruction” requirement of “effective control”. For example, Russia’s relationship with APT28 is alleged to be in line with “overall control” in that the Russians provide technical resources but do not directly direct specific attacks, and the international community generally believes that the organization is supported by the Russian government and that the motivation for its attacks is closely related to Russia’s national interests.\n\nAccording to “overall control”, it is possible to hold Russia responsible, but according to the traditional “effective control” standard, it is difficult to hold it accountable. In addition, while the technical traceability of cyberattacks often only proves a continuing connection between the attacker and the state, and it is difficult to obtain evidence of direct orders, the “overall control” standard eliminates the need to prove a control relationship between the state and the attacker, and allows for a more efficient allocation of responsibility. Although the “overall control” standard has its role in the context of cyberwarfare, it is still difficult to accept it as the standard for attribution of responsibility in the current mainstream view, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia Serbia and Montenegro, the ICJ explicitly rejected the standard of “overall control” and insisted on the strict interpretation of “effective control”,[9] which can provide a reference basis for the attribution of responsibility for cyber warfare. Moreover, there is a risk of political abuse if a more lenient standard is adopted, as when the U.S. sanctioned a Chinese technology company based on “overall control” in the absence of publicly available technical evidence to support it. While this standard is not appropriate in all cases, it is clear that the traditional standard is not fully applicable, and the international community\n\n[9] Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 February 2007, General List No. 91.",
    "should continue to explore new, more reasonable standards in practice to address the limitations of the traditional standard.\n\nSecondly, the traditional attribution criterion is also difficult in practice. The system of attribution of responsibility for non-state actors is not perfect, which leads to the failure of the mechanism for assuming responsibility to play a full role, potentially allowing non-state actors to avoid legal penalties, especially transnational science and technology enterprises to circumvent the responsibility of the behavior at this stage has not been effectively resolved. For example, Zero-Day Vulnerability, as a security flaw that has not yet been discovered or fixed by software vendors, has a unique “gray area” in the trading market due to the ambiguity of its participants, uses, and legal attributes. There are cases where private vulnerability brokers sell zero-day vulnerabilities to governments, but international law does not clarify whether such transactions constitute “assisting in the commission of cyber-attacks”. In terms of the actual situation at this stage, international legislation is undoubtedly lagging behind, and existing cybercrime conventions have not yet explicitly stipulated specific provisions directly targeting “vulnerability trading”.\n\nIn addition, the EU's “Network Resilience Act” only requires vendors to establish a vulnerability handling process, does not regulate third-party transactions. In China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Internet Information Office, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly issued the “Provisions on the Management of Security Vulnerabilities in Network Products”, which clearly states that no organization or individual shall illegally collect, sell or distribute information on security vulnerabilities in network products, but the standard of “illegality” lacks specific interpretation, and loopholes exist in the determination of “illegality”. The U.S. “Vulnerability Equity Program” is not binding, vendors can refuse to cooperate. It can be seen that the existing law for the actors did not make comprehensive provisions, so the use of zero-day vulnerabilities in cyber attacks on multinational technology enterprises has the possibility of circumventing legal responsibility, liability mechanism due to the lack of comprehensiveness, but also may be further dysfunctional.\n\n## Reconstructing the path of state responsibility in cyber warfare\n\nUnder the increasingly complex background of cyber warfare, it is of great practical significance to find a more reasonable path of state responsibility. On the one hand, further improvement of the traditional attribution mechanism can enhance the persuasive power of the attribution; on the other hand, through the innovation of",
    "judicial procedures, the realization of state responsibility can be further refined to avoid the emergence of unreasonable responsibility which is too light or too heavy. State responsibility in cyberwarfare has room for improvement in both judgment standard and realization, and if it can be adjusted under the common recognition of the international community, it can to a certain extent avoid subjective factors affecting the judgment and assumption of state responsibility.\n\n### Improving the attribution mechanism\n\nOne of the important reasons why the attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyber warfare has a certain subjective element is that there is no universally recognized technical attribution mechanism, which to a certain extent has led to the divergence of attribution standards among countries for cyber warfare. Although there is more authoritative literature such as the Tallinn Manual for reference, the nature of international law is, after all, soft law. While States can use soft law to solve the problem of coordinated gaming (Guzman and Meyer 2010), international law is not as binding as it could be if a State's political aspirations need to be realized urgently. In addition, if some countries do not sign an international treaty on cybersecurity, and the content of the treaty has not developed into a custom, a considerable number of countries can claim that they do not carry out activities in the cyber field in accordance with the rules in the treaty. Moreover, even for those countries that have signed such treaties, the cost of withdrawing from them is not high. Finally, although relevant documents are constantly being issued, how to deal with conflicts between them is a subjective process. From this point of view, the mere formulation of international law on cybersecurity is relatively limited in enhancing the rationality of attribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\n\nIn this context, promoting the international community to establish a technical attribution institution can be a better choice. First of all, compared with soft law, the institution established under the wide recognition of the international community is more persuasive and can avoid to a greater extent the situation that countries choose the judgment standard of state responsibility based on their own political opinions. Secondly, the establishment of a technical attribution body can help promote policy coordination and resource sharing among countries in the field of cybersecurity. Through multilateral cooperation, countries can fully express their demands, formulate unified international legal standards to deal with transnational cyber threats under the principle of pursuing the greatest common interests, conduct in-depth discussions on reasonable motions to ensure the comprehensiveness and",
    "extensiveness of the attribution standards and reduce the troubles caused by the differences in the laws of different countries.\n\nFurthermore, technical attribution organizations can establish an information-sharing platform to share the latest information on cyberattacks and technological advances promptly, and such an information-sharing mechanism can improve the ability of countries to respond to cyber threats. For example, the Enhanced Attribution (EA) program initiated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is very informative. The goal of the EA program is to develop techniques to generate operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent and independent malicious cyber campaigns and to create a methodology by which this information can be shared with multiple parties without jeopardizing the intelligence sources and methodologies. By collecting, monitoring, and understanding adversary cyberattack operations in the red space, the program is expected to be divided into three technical areas (TAs) that will work in parallel with each other. They will span three 18-month phases, after which the agency will step in to obtain high-quality results. This activity will undoubtedly empower the attribution criteria with more precise technology, which is expected to target the subjects of wrongdoing with greater precision. Such meaningful criteria, if adopted by technical attribution agencies, would certainly contribute to the standardization of technical attribution.\n\nBased on the establishment of technical attribution institutions and the development of technical attribution criteria, the criterion of “effective control” in the traditional attribution criteria needs to be expanded. The obstacle to the normative transformation of technical attribution mentioned earlier is largely due to the rigid application of the criterion of “effective control”. In light of the complexity of cyberwarfare models, the concept of “material support” should be introduced, so that if a State systematically provides vulnerabilities, infrastructure, or funding to non-State actors that cause the same level of consequences as a direct direct order, it will be held liable even if there is no direct order. Although this approach has not become a common practice in the international community, the continued rigid application of the traditional criterion of proving a directive relationship will undoubtedly allow certain subjects to avoid the risk of assuming State responsibility, which is difficult to accept in terms of jurisprudence. Therefore, based on the principle of the “effective control” criterion, consideration should be given to the use of “substantial support” to make judgments when the act of support has a significant impact and is directly related to the acts or purposes of the supported party, thus constituting substantial support. The adoption of such a criterion is not only legally sound but also creates conditions for the application of technical attribution to a greater extent. The adoption of the “substantial support” criterion for attribution when the support provided by a State can be traced back to that State by technical",
    "means and it can be established that the State providing the assistance constitutes substantial support can avoid the rigid application of the traditional criterion, which would jeopardize the results obtained through technical tracing.\n\n### Adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism\n\nThe establishment of an international attribution agency is certainly of great significance to the determination of state responsibility, but it only involves the work of attribution, and if we want to comprehensively reconstruct the responsibility of the state in cyberwarfare, it must be built on the basis of a broad consensus among all countries, and the blueprint for the establishment of an international attribution agency as mentioned in the previous section is also built on the basis of the consensus of all countries. Therefore, the consensus of all countries is a fundamental condition. It is obviously unrealistic for the international community to reach consensus in the short term, because the more vulnerable countries may consider that the adjustment of rules has nothing to do with them. In this case, the big countries are more important to play a pioneering role and set an example through concrete actions. The adjustment of the multilateral cooperation mechanism is conducive to the rationalization of the judgment of national responsibility in cyber warfare, and is also conducive to the regulation of the cyber offensive behavior of individual countries, so that all countries in the international community can benefit from it. The specific cooperation mechanism can be adjusted as follows:\n\nForemost, regional confidence-building measures should be further developed. The most important is the establishment of a cyberspace “hotline mechanism”, which can reduce the information gap through effective communication and avoid the emergence of unnecessary cyberattacks. As early as during the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, this “hotline mechanism” demonstrated its important value. During the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, both sides in the nuclear arms race and military confrontation realized that the lack of direct communication channels could lead to miscalculation and escalation of the conflict. In 1963, the U.S. and the Soviet Union established the “hotline mechanism”, which allowed leaders to communicate quickly, directly, and privately in emergency situations, thereby eliminating the risk of nuclear war resulting from communication delays or misunderstandings of each other's actions. To this day, this mechanism is used as an important tool. In 2022, during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the U.S. and Russia established a military hotline to avoid miscalculations and military accidents. The “hotline mechanism” has gone a long way in avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings and remains indispensable in the context of cyberwarfare. 2020s attack on India's power grid could be a case in point. on October 12, 2020, Mumbai, India, experienced a massive blackout that affected",
    "critical infrastructure, including stock exchanges and healthcare facilities. The New York Times reported that the blackout may have been linked to China, claiming that “Chinese malware hacked into India's power supply control system” in order to pressure India in the India-China border standoff. Although this claim was later clarified by Recorded Future, a cybersecurity company mentioned in the report, and officially denied by Indian officials, it still caused a certain degree of damage to China's image, and if the “hotline mechanism” had been adopted at that time, it could have avoided the misleading public opinion and the waste of investigation resources. This shows that China, the United States, Russia and other countries have taken the lead in setting up real-time communication channels, clarifying in a timely manner in the event of miscalculation, and reducing unnecessary costs and expenditures, which is still necessary in the context of cyber warfare.\n\nConcomitantly, adjusting the public-private partnership. In the context of cyberwarfare, cooperation between countries is certainly important, but operators often also have a large amount of relevant information. To further reduce the cost of controlling the occurrence of cyberwarfare, it is indispensable for operators and governments to jointly build a threat intelligence-sharing platform. Adopting this model not only facilitates research between countries based on a large number of cases provided by operators to ensure the comprehensiveness and extensiveness of the cases, but also reduces the effort of searching for cyberattacks from all over the world, saves time and cost, and efficiently builds identification and defense measures. This model has been reflected in the JCDC model in the U.S. JCDC participants that include organizations and operators from both the public and private sectors, covering service providers, infrastructure operators, cybersecurity companies, and companies in the critical infrastructure industry.\n\nIn addition, JCDC constituents include specific government agencies designated by Congress, such as the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It is through the operator-government co-built threat intelligence-sharing platform that the JCDC shares real-time information through multiple platforms, such as Slack, the Homeland Security Information Network HSIN, and the GovDelivery service, to ensure that there is continuous dialog and collaboration among the participants. This also sets the stage for the development of proactive cyber defense programs to mitigate the most serious risks before threats become visible. Moreover, “gatekeeper liability” for technology companies can be introduced, as Article 6 of The EU's Digital Services Act indicates that “where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, the service provider shall not be liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that the provider”. By analyzing the exemption",
    "from liability of the hosting service provider of the online platform and the relevant conditions, it can be seen that the online platform should have a certain degree of responsibility for reviewing the information provided by the service recipient (Lefouili and Madio 2022). For content that is clearly of a cyber-attack nature, the provider of the online service should exercise a certain degree of scrutiny, in particular, cloud computing giants are required to filter malicious traffic, or else they may be considered to bear the corresponding joint and several liability.\n\nFinally, a “digital ceasefire zone” system could be included in the scope of discussion. Healthcare, energy and other livelihood areas are of great importance, and if they are subjected to cyberattacks, they will often lead to more serious consequences, and should be categorized as no-attack zones, so that if certain countries carry out non-compliant cyberattacks, violators will be automatically triggered by the United Nations to sanction them. According to the context that cyber-peacekeeping has been suggested as a strategic framework to address the multifaceted challenges posed by diverse manifestations of cyber conflict (Dorn 2017), in order to support the implementation of the system, we can also consider the establishment of a “network peacekeeping force”, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to send technical teams to assist in the restoration of network services in conflict areas. The reason why it should be coordinated by the ITU is that, under its supervision, the technical teams will be able to use more reasonable means to respond to cyber attacks. Shortly after the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, controversy erupted over the way Ukraine set up the International Volunteer Team for Cyber Defense to carry out cyberattacks against Russian targets, and its development of tools, which allows any digital device to become part of a DDoS attack network, was deemed to be a violation of international cyber norms. The existence of a unified body for coordination would make it possible to bring the corresponding tools into line with the principle of proportionality.\n\n### Innovations in judicial procedures\n\nIn addition to further clarifying the criteria for attribution of state responsibility and minimizing the frequency of cyberwar through multilateral cooperation mechanisms, there is also a need for innovation in the judicial process, because most cyberwars are ultimately handled through the judicial process, and therefore adopting a more feasible judicial process is conducive to a more reasonable distribution of state responsibility in the context of cyberwar.\n\nFirstly, the International Court of Justice could create a panel of judges specialized in cyberspace cases, allowing for the submission of electronic evidence and anonymous witnesses. There is a precedent for such a special chamber, namely",
    "the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which is a special judicial procedure set up within the ITLOS to hear disputes between States arising from the exploration and exploitation of the international seabed area. In response to the increasingly complex cyberwarfare, which should be handled more rigorously, and the identification and allocation of State responsibility should be more reasonable, the traditional team of judges may not be able to make accurate judgments when faced with the special field of cyber. The idea that selecting judges with relevant backgrounds enhances efficiency is supported by academic research, which suggests that a judge's prior experience and characteristics can influence their decision-making (Basabe-Serrano 2019). At this time, the selection of judges with cyber background to form a team specializing in cyberspace cases is conducive to more efficiently identifying the nature of cyberattacks and, with the help of increasingly developed technological means, more reasonably allocating state responsibility on the basis of technical indicators.\n\nMeanwhile, through the leading role of the International Court of Justice, countries can also select judges with expertise in international law, cyber technology, data protection, and other fields through a special selection mechanism to form domestic teams specialized in handling cyber cases. From this, we can see that such a move can not only further solve the problem of cyber warfare among countries but also serve as an inspiration for the handling of cyber cases within countries. The team of judges can cooperate with other international organizations (such as Interpol and the United Nations Office on Cybercrime) to analyze the ever-emerging new forms and the constantly updating and iterative advanced technologies in order to formulate more reasonable judgment standards and solution measures, so as to jointly address the global challenges in cyberspace.\n\nIn addition, consideration could be given to legitimizing “preventive countermeasures” by allowing for pre-emptive defences against highly probable cyberattacks under the authority of the Security Council. Referring to Article 50 of the UN Charter on temporary measures against economic sanctions, UN Member States, in their actions for the maintenance of international peace and security, should refrain from any action that might widen a dispute or aggravate a situation. And the UN Security Council is tasked with resolving international disputes and can establish frameworks for peaceful settlements, aligning with Article 1 of the UN Charter so that Member States should take appropriate steps to prevent the extension or aggravation of the dispute in accordance with the recommendations of the UNSC (Alipour 2024). It was mentioned earlier that countermeasures must be a means to be taken only if there is a realistic attack. However, in the context of cyberwarfare, it is often too late to take countermeasures if one has to wait until there is an attack. Due to the intensity and scope of cyberattacks, a country's cyber system may not be able to function after an attack, let alone take defensive measures. Under such",
    "circumstances, it is particularly important to formulate “preventive countermeasures” with reference to Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations. This kind of prevention cannot be advanced indefinitely and should be judged according to the recommendations of the UN Security Council. However, the international community needs to discuss in depth what kind of preventive measures should be taken in order to arrive at a standard. In any case, even if this kind of advance measure is recognized, it still needs to be regulated by the corresponding standards, or else powerful countries can launch disproportionate “preventive countermeasures” against less dangerous cyberattacks in pursuit of their own national political demands, which is contrary to the original purpose of the measure.\n\nWhile considering innovations in the judicial process, there is also a need for flexibility in the use of various methods to solve the problems that arise in the process, such as the use of legal discourse. In addressing the dual imperatives of legislative innovation and jurisprudential reconceptualization, legal discourse analysis as a vital interdisciplinary instrument, offers multidimensional frameworks to decode evolving normative constructs within contemporary governance systems (Neuwirth 2023). The degree of formality in legal language mirrors the solemn nature of judicial proceedings, whereas the presence or absence of polite expressions can signal deference, confrontational intent, or calculated positioning. These deliberate language patterns fundamentally shape both the courtroom environment and participants' interpretations of interactions, ultimately guiding behavioral responses throughout legal exchanges (Mısır and Akın 2024). In addition, the refinement of legal discourse patterning can be enhanced by studying a large number of cases in the European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union issues its rulings in 23 legally binding linguistic versions, reflecting the mandate established under Article 217 of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. This foundational provision, originally enacted as the European Council's inaugural legislative instrument, constitutionally guarantees that every member state's national language maintains equal juridical standing as an official working language of the Union (Trklja 2024). Based on the breadth of these cases, summarizing them will undoubtedly be beneficial for a more accurate use of legal language.\n\nUltimately, in the process of optimization, the participation of artificial intelligence is an irreversible trend, and the various advantages of artificial intelligence can undoubtedly improve efficiency, but the existence of hidden loopholes in various aspects of technology, ethics and other aspects also need to be paid attention to. Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transnational challenge demanding coordinated governance architectures, necessitating the establishment of multilateral regulatory systems capable of ensuring operational synergy, policy harmonization, and adaptive scalability across jurisdictions (Neuwirth 2024). And transitioning to centralized regulatory frameworks proves indispensable for steering generative AI",
    "development along ethically aligned trajectories (Cheng and Liu 2024). To effectively address existential risks in artificial intelligence development, institutionalizing ethical guardrails through a “Digital Humanism” framework becomes imperative. This paradigm prioritizes human-centric imperatives by safeguarding species-wide wellbeing and systemic security, while strategically decoupling technological advancement from zero-sum competition. Such an approach ensures that technological evolution maintains symbiotic alignment with civilizational priorities (Cheng and Gong 2024). Today sanctions and anti-sanctions have evolved into a dominant strategic pattern within contemporary geopolitical interactions (Gu and Zhao 2023), which makes it all the more important that more rational judicial procedures be used to mitigate the growing conflict.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe accelerated militarization of cyberspace has plunged the state responsibility system into a “triple normative dilemma”: first, the transformation of technical evidence into legal facts has led to the failure of the attribution mechanism; second, the hermeneutical controversy over the boundaries of the right to self-defense has triggered a crisis of the legitimacy of the countermeasures; and third, the vacuum in the allocation of responsibility due to the involvement of non-State actors has resulted in the systematic failure of the enforcement mechanism. These structural impediments not only undermine the deterrent effect of international law, but also contribute to the “low-cost-high-benefit” nature of cyberwarfare, which continues to induce opportunistic tactics by state actors.\n\nWhile existing governance frameworks such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0's “principle of equivalence of effects” and the Convention on Cybercrime's territoriality provision provide guidance on rules at the local level, they are not able to cope with complex cyberconflicts due to institutional fragmentation and technological adaptability deficiencies. For example, the Tallinn Manual's 2.0 Rule 69's eight-dimensional assessment model of the threshold for the use of force faces an attenuation of its explanatory power when dealing with generative AI-driven cognitive warfare; and the Budapest Convention's Mutual Legal Assistance Mechanism is in an implementation dilemma due to the anonymity of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo solve the above dilemmas, it is urgent to build a three-in-one path of “technical verification, rule iteration, and mechanism synergy” to reconfigure the responsibility: (1) technical empowerment of attribution mechanism: building a verifiable attribution system, and realizing the transformation of MITRE ATT&CK framework into a judicial system; (2) adjustment of multilateral cooperation mechanism, building regional confidence measures, strengthening public-private partnership, and strengthening the",
    "DE GRUYTER\nState responsibility in cyberwarfare\n29\n\ncooperation between the public and the private; (3) multi-layer governance for responsibility-sharing: establishment of an “international arbitration tribunal for cyberspace” on the basis of the United Nations platform, and design of corresponding cyber-peacekeeping forces to cooperate in governance.\n\nThis reconstruction path has dual normative value: at the level of substantive law, through the legalization of preventive responsibility and due diligence, the “risk spillover” behavior of the state in cyberspace is curbed; at the level of procedural law, with the help of technology-neutral third-party evidence collection mechanism, the cognitive gap between technological logic and judicial review can be bridged. Only by realizing the in-depth mutual embedding of technical governance and international law can the “tragedy of the commons” effect of cyberwar be suppressed, and the paradigm shift of the community of destiny in cyberspace from conceptual advocacy to institutional practice be promoted.\n\n**Research funding:** This work was supported by the project of National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 24BYY151) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Zhejiang University.\n\n## References\n\nAhmad, Atif, Jeb Webb, Kevin C.

    "abstract": "As a new type of military confrontation in the era of informationization, cyber warfare has broken through the physical boundaries of the traditional war paradigm in terms of its technical characteristics and strategic effectiveness. Due to the ambiguity of the object of regulation, the defect of attribution mechanism, and the lack of clarity of the constituent elements of responsibility, the existing international law framework has caused the state responsibility system in cyberspace to fall into the dilemma of normative failure. This paper takes the theory of international law subjectivity as the logical starting point and systematically deconstructs the normative attributes of cyberwar and the path of responsibility determination. This paper shows that the constitutive elements of state responsibility need to break through the rigid standard of traditional \"behavior-damage\" causality and build a dynamic attribution system combining technical verification and legal presumption. Through critical analysis of the use of force threshold doctrine, this paper, based on a comprehensive analysis of the core dilemma of the determination of state responsibility, proposes to appropriately introduce the concept of \"substantial support\", and when the traditional theory of comprehensive control fails to make effective attribution, the criterion of \"substantial support\" can be used to complete the attribution of state responsibility with the increasingly developed technological traceability means.",
