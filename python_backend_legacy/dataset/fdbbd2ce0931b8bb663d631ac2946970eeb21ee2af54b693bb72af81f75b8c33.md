Brown\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\nOne of the challenges in addressing the law applicable to cyberwarfare is apparent from a statement in the introduction to the Department of Defense (DoD) Law of War Manual (the Manual). Stephen Preston, who was at the time serving as DoD General Counsel, wrote that the manual “reflects the experience of this Department in applying the law of war in actual military operations, and it will help us remember the hard learned lessons from the past.”¹ Indeed, one indisputable advantage DoD brings to law of war discussions is concrete operational experience. No other organization is as practiced in actually applying the law of war in combat as well as a whole range of other operations. DoD has been involved in combat operations during most of its existence since its founding in 1947. There is no organization more experienced in kinetic warfare, and none better positioned to capture lessons learned.\nThat is not the case with regard to cyberwarfare, however, and the lack of lessons learned from operations is evident in the Manual’s treatment of cyberwarfare. Chapter XVI of the Manual, “Cyber Operations,” provides little in the way of useful guidance for cyber operations lawyers. Although they will be required to provide real-time legal advice on cyber operations, operations lawyers have no definitive sources and few references with sufficient depth to guide their endeavors. In that sense, the cyber operations chapter represents the most substantial shortfall between the Manual’s aspiration in support of US forces and its actuality. In any event, Chapter XVI is by far the shortest chapter of the Manual at only sixteen pages (one of which has only two words of text along with a footnote).\n¹ DoD Law of War Manual, ii.\n337\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nBefore discussing the text, a reflection on the underpinnings of Chapter XVI is in order. As noted above, acknowledged State-sponsored cyber operations are rare to non-existent, so there are few legal lessons to be gleaned from practice between contesting States. That leaves only government policy and academic study as starting points for the construction of a specific body of cyber operations law. In a choice starkly contrasting with the rest of the DoD Manual, the cyber operations chapter relies almost exclusively on two sources: a 1999 DoD Office of General Counsel legal assessment of \"information operations\" and a 2012 speech at the US Cyber Command Legal Conference delivered by the State Department Legal Advisor. Chapter XVI of the Manual has only 44 percent as many footnotes when compared to the next most lightly footnoted chapter. Even more striking, 98.8 percent of the footnotes cite either to the Manual itself or to internal US policy documents and speeches.\nOf particular note, the Manual avoids any mention of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which has been well-received by academics and governments since its original publication in 2013.³ As the Manual's footnotes are meant \"to help practitioners research particular topics discussed in the main text,\" references to at least some of the literature in the field would have been appropriate.⁴ That one of two foundational references dates from the last century and the other is a State Department speech considerably undermines the credibility of the chapter.\n## 2 OVERVIEW\nThe broad scope of the DoD Manual is reflected in the statement of purpose, which is \"to provide information on the law of war to DoD personnel responsible for implementing the law of war and executing military operations.\"⁵ With that in mind, this commentary on the chapter \"Cyber Operations\" is organized according to the four most pressing issues that legal practitioners must address to provide proper legal advice to decision-makers:\n³ DoD, Office of the General Counsel, \"An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations\" (2nd ed., Nov. 1999), repr. in 76 US Naval War College International Law Studies (2002); and H. H. Koh, Legal Advisor, Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace, \"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference\" (Sept. 18, 2012), repr. in 54 Harvard International Law Journal Online (Dec. 2012), 3, www.harvardilj.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Koh-Speech-to-Publish1.pdf. About half of the footnotes are to other portions of the DoD Manual.\n³ Since the publication of the DoD Manual, the Tallinn Manual has been updated to version 2.0, published in 2017.

What is cyberwar?\n2. What is cyberspying?\n3. What is a cyberattack?\n4. What is a cyberweapon?\nSet out below is a discussion of why these questions are critical, and how well the Manual does as a reference for those who will be providing legal advice on military and other government cyber operations.\n## 2.1 What Is Cyberwar?\nOne of the key answers legal advisors must provide is whether proposed cyber operations would cross the threshold from peace to war. Although it may be outside the normal area of expertise of an operations legal advisor, they still must be prepared to grapple with the thorny issues of how cyber operations might contribute to, or even drive, a transition from peace to war. Because cyberspace by its nature is global, even those operations meant to be collecting tactical information or focused on a specific region can have far-reaching consequences. The intent of cyberspace operators is often difficult to discern, and internet-based operations cross many jurisdictions in making their way to the intended target. That means information-gathering might appear to be something more aggressive. In addition, States might feel compelled to defend their \"cyber-sovereignty\" even from incursions falling short of aggression. Either of these could motivate hostile actions in response, so discerning the distinction between normal cyber operations and those that might be interpreted as aggressive (or transgressive) is of critical importance.\nIn examining that decision space, national decision-makers often ask the question, \"Is this an act of war?\"⁶ This is a consideration of both States considering the wisdom of cyberspace activities, and States who are the victims of unfriendly cyber-acts. The term \"act of war\" is generally meant to be \"any act by a State that would effectively terminate the normal international law of peacetime and activate the international law\n⁶ Although the phrase \"act of war\" is not a legal term, given the difficulties in determining what cyber-events cross the threshold of armed attack, it may be appropriate for States to note the importance of political considerations in their assessments of whether aggressive cyber-activities trigger the right of self-defense. As one cyber-expert puts it, \"calling something an act of war is not a conclusion; it is a decision.\" M. Libicki, \"An Act of War, Even Cyberwar, Is a Decision,\" New York Times (Feb. 28, 2013), www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/02/28/what-is-an-act-of-cyberwar/an-act-of-war-even-cyberwar-is-a-decision.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nof war.”7 In modern usage, an act of war may be considered the equivalent of armed attack or, for the United States, a use of force.8 For cyber operations lawyers advising decision-makers it is appropriate to ask, as the DoD Manual does, whether a certain cyber-act is an unlawful use of force or an international armed attack.\nThe ultimate goal is determining which activity rises to a level that would justify a State’s use of force in self-defense.9 For most States, that would mean the cyber-activity would have to be an armed attack, which would trigger Article 51 of the UN Charter. The United States, however, has consistently asserted that the right of self-defense may be exercised based on a lower threshold: that of a use of force.10 Whichever standard is used, sorting out which cyber-activities would push States to armed conflict is difficult to describe in an abstract ex ante manner.\nThe Manual concludes that if a cyber-activity has kinetic results, it may lawfully be treated the same as if it were caused by non-cyber means. Thus, “if cyber operations cause effects that, if caused by traditional physical means, would be regarded as a use of force . . . then such cyber operations would likely also be regarded as a use of force.”11 The caveat of “likely” in the statement is critical. Cyber-means of warfare are not exempt from the application of international law, but the Manual suggests the application of the law is unsettled. In the kinetic realm, decades of history and precedent are available to study what States consider adequate to support armed self-defense. If the aggressor uses cyber-means, however, the US position is that the legal question cannot be answered merely based on the effects of the attack. States “must evaluate factors including the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action . . ., the target and location, effects and intent, among other possible issues” before determining whether the action constitutes a use of force.12\n7 D.

Norton, 1999), 24, www.crimesofwar.org/a-z-guide/act-of-war-2/.\n8 A proposed bill, H.R.5220 – 114th Congress (2015–2016), was titled The Cyber Act of War Act, yet it would have tasked the President to “develop a policy for determining when an action carried out in cyberspace constitutes a use of force against the United States.” (emphasis added). www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5220/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Cyber+Act+of+War+Act+of+2016%22%5D%7D&amp;resultIndex=1. Some provisions of the Act were included in the Fiscal Year 2017 (National Defense Authorization Act).\n9 The DoD Manual asserts that self-defense is available against non-State actors as well as other States (¶ 16.3.3.4), a position supported by a majority of the Tallinn experts, as well. See Tallinn Manual 2.0, rule 71(19).\n10 See DoD Law of War Manual, Chapter I fn. 230.

For examples of cyber-events that would trigger a resort to war, the Manual lists: using cyber-capabilities to trigger a nuclear plant meltdown, open a dam above a populated area, or disable air traffic control services resulting in airplane crashes. According to the Manual, these instances would \"likely\" be regarded as cyberattacks.¹³ These clear examples are very similar to the ones used in the extensively referenced 1999 paper, but there are subtle differences that may reflect a new understanding of the law in the area. The 1999 paper did not mention the possibility of a nuclear plant meltdown; that may be an understandable sensitivity that creates a clear red-line in the opinion of US legal experts. Somewhat more curiously, the Manual dropped the references to cyber operations that shut down banking systems, financial systems, and public utilities. All of these systems have been the target of cyber operations and, although they were not shut down on a large scale, the exclusion of them from the list of operations that could drive States to war may be a reflection of modern State practice.\nStates have not engaged in armed conflict premised only on cyber-aggression against financial institutions.¹⁴ Similarly, they will not, it seems, wage war over foreign actors establishing a persistent presence on industrial control systems controlling public utilities.¹⁵ State practice seems to be tilting in favor of negotiated agreements between States to refrain from such actions rather than recognizing the resort of armed retaliation. It is possible the non-response from States is because they lack good evidence connecting the actors to States, or even non-State armed groups.¹⁶ State norms and practice regarding cyberspace operations are rapidly forming and being refined. If the US position is that these activities would engender armed self-defense given\n¹³ Ibid., ¶ 16.3.1.\n¹⁴ D. Volz and J.

Brown\nsufficient evidence of the actor, the DoD Manual would have offered an ideal opportunity to state and support that perspective. More likely, the US position is that many activities in this arena fall under the broad rubric of \"espionage,\" activities at which the US excels and does not wish to limit through the international legal structure.[17] Even stating that clearly would have been helpful to the practitioners who will rely on the Manual to form legal opinions in support of cyber operations.\nAnother weakness with the examples the Manual uses is that they are far too facile. A legal advisor with no previous experience in cyber operations could surely have determined that activities causing dams to fail and planes to crash would be international acts of aggression. These obvious examples provide little guidance to practitioners who must advise on where the line is drawn between cyberattacks and lesser cyber-insults. A single example, also from the 1999 paper, may provide more information about where the line between peace and war is drawn, but it is unclear exactly how it fits with the message of the chapter. \"[C]yber operations that cripple a military's logistics systems, and thus its ability to conduct and sustain military operations, might also be considered a use of force under jus ad bellum.\"[18] Compared to a nuclear meltdown and plane crashes, this type of operation seems almost benign.\nAlthough it is not clear what \"crippling\" a military logistics system means, the type of disruptive cyber-action that could be taken against an unclassified logistics system seems similar to the events in Estonia in 2007. In that case, government and economic websites, as well as internet infrastructure sites, were targeted with denial of service attacks that significantly impaired their functioning for three weeks.[19] The events in Estonia were not considered sufficient to support a claim of international self-defense.[20] This interpretation also seems to be a departure from US practice as stated in the Manual. In addition to the failure to react publicly to operations carried out against public utilities and financial systems, the US characterized the 2014 Sony hack, which stole massive amounts of data and was designed to corrupt or destroy more, as \"cyber-vandalism,\" explicitly characterizing it as an activity\n17 K.

The notion of cyber-countermeasures to respond to aggressive but sub-use of force cyber-actions has received significant attention in the international legal community, although it rates little more than a footnote in the chapter.²² Other than in the cyber chapter, the Manual refers to countermeasures as reprisals, which it defines as “acts taken against a party: (1) that would otherwise be unlawful; (2) in order to persuade that party to cease violating the law.”²³ In other words, if undertaken as a countermeasure, unlawful responsive cyber-measures are rendered legal if they remain below the level of a use of force, and are conducted for the purpose of ending the original unlawful activity.\nParagraph 16.3.3.3 of the Manual discusses countermeasures and retorsion together, emphasizing the availability of retorsive responses to cyber-insults, such as diplomatic measures.²⁴ Both are important concepts for cyber operations, but they are distinct. Retorsion in general is defined in paragraph 18.17 of the DoD Manual: “unfriendly conduct, (1) which is not inconsistent with any international obligation of the State engaging in it, and (2) which is done in response to an internationally wrongful act.” An understanding of both in the cyber context is especially critical because it is not always clear when an action in cyberspace is unlawful. When the law on the original action is unclear, responses may be phrased as equivalent; that is, if the initial action was lawful,\n²¹ K.

Brown\nthen the same thing done in return would be retorsion.²⁵ If the triggering action was unlawful, then the response would be a countermeasure, rendered lawful by its status.²⁶\n## 2.2 What Is Cyber-Spying?\nDetermining whether cyber-activities would cross the line from operations to espionage remains a difficult issue for cyber legal advisors. Espionage is generally unregulated under international law but, unlike in the physical world, espionage in cyberspace can be quite difficult to distinguish from the preparation for and conduct of more aggressive military operations.²⁷ The Manual notes that to the extent “cyber operations resemble traditional intelligence and counterintelligence activities, such as unauthorized intrusions into computer networks solely to acquire information, then such cyber operations would likely be treated similarly under international law.”²⁸ This would be more helpful if there were an easy way to ascertain the nature of the cyber-activity in the first place.\nWhether a cyber operation is undertaken for the purpose of espionage or military operations, it normally will require some penetration of the targeted system to gain access. Once access to the system is established, the aggressor might engage in espionage or attack. Even if the mission is espionage, the operator might leave behind malware to facilitate future access to the system, and that future event might be either an attack or spying. How should system penetrations be treated under the law when the actor's intent is unknown? How should pre-implanted capabilities be treated when they are discovered, especially on critical infrastructure or sensitive national security systems? If an espionage event goes wrong and results in accidental damage to a system, does it become an attack at that point? There may be no way for the victim of the event to determine the actor's intent, especially in a timely fashion.\n²⁵ For a discussion on the level of attribution required, see section 3.1 of this chapter.\n²⁶ Not discussed in the Manual is the plea of necessity, which term “is used to denote those exceptional cases where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency.” Draft Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 25, http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf.\n²⁷ “[T]he international legal system generally imposes no sanctions upon nations for acts of espionage except for the political costs of public denunciation.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 18.21.2 fn. 305.

The Manual suggests that the intent of the actor controls, which is perhaps the worst model to choose, because intent is notoriously difficult to discover. The natural anonymity of the internet and the nature of cyber operations makes intent that much more difficult to ascertain. A better reflection of international law is to characterize operations by their effects. For example, espionage is not prohibited by international law, but activities enabling or supporting it may be, depending on their effects. Effects are relatively clear, but misapprehending intent is common and could completely alter the legal range of options available in response.\n## 2.3 What Is a Cyberattack?\nAlthough it is not immediately apparent, the issue of what cyber-activity constitutes an attack in the context of armed conflict is a critical one. US military legal advisors take for granted that the principles of the law of war – distinction, proportionality, humanity, and military necessity – all apply during armed conflict.²⁹ With regard to kinetic attacks, of course, these principles do apply. The challenge with wartime cyber operations is that they can be quite disruptive without being destructive. Legal advisors must be able to distinguish operations that must refrain from targeting civilian objects, for example, and those that fall below the attack threshold.\nThe cyber operations chapter takes note of the issue in a general way, pointing to paragraph 5.4 for details on how attacks are covered by the law of armed conflict (LOAC). That paragraph iterates that attacks must be carried out in compliance with the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions, but paragraph 16.5.2 notes with some circularity that “[a] cyber operation that does not constitute an attack is not restricted by the rules that apply to attacks.” It goes on to give examples of operations that would not constitute attacks: defacing government web pages; briefly disrupting internet service in a minor way; briefly disrupting, disabling, or interfering with communications; or disseminating propaganda. Unfortunately, these examples do little to draw the line between aggressive, non-attack cyber-activity and activity that would qualify as an attack. For example, do the qualifications in the examples mean that DoD would label a brief disruption of internet service in\n²⁹ See Ray Murphy’s contribution to this book in Chapter 7. Chapter II of the DoD Manual lists the principles of the law of war as military necessity, humanity, proportionality, distinction, and honor. The principle of honor seems particularly attenuated from cyberwarfare; it is not discussed in the Manual with reference to cyberwarfare, and will be omitted here, as well.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\na major way an attack? Further, it is unclear that the principles of LOAC apply to any cyber-activity that stops short of causing damage, destruction, or injury. This gap in the law has led some experts to suggest that LOAC ought to apply to cyber operations that affect the functionality of computer systems without actually damaging them.³⁰\nThe Manual states “[i]f a cyber operation constitutes an attack, then the law of war rules on conducting attacks must be applied to those cyber operations.”³¹ Of course, this invites the question of what constitutes an attack. Operational legal advisors who consult the manual for guidance on this question will learn that wartime operations that destroy computers are attacks.³² While this is true, it is also the simplest case – kinetic effects directly caused by cyber operations clearly are attacks. On the more difficult questions of whether loss of functionality of a computer system, without damage to it, is an attack, or whether harm significantly attenuated from the original event, would similarly constitute an attack, the Manual is silent.³³\nAfter identifying the way cyberwarfare techniques might not be governed by the principles of the law of war, the Manual suggests that the case is not closed. “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.”³⁴ This seems to contradict an earlier statement in the Manual, and may be read as *lex ferenda* rather than an articulation of the law.³⁵ Legal advisors who rely on the Manual for guidance would be better served if the Manual made clear this is a US policy rather than the law. The United States might well put such policy restrictions in its own rules of engagement, but if it is meant to be read as a restriction grounded in law, the Manual should have provided some affirmative authority for this belief.\nIn a legal advisor’s analysis of whether a cyber-activity constitutes an attack, the Manual notes the importance of considering whether the effects created\n³⁰ See M. N. Schmitt, “Rewired Warfare: Rethinking the Law of Cyber Attack” (2014) 96(893) *International Review of the Red Cross* 189, www.icrc.org/en/international-review/article/rewired-warfare-rethinking-law-cyber-attack; and C.

Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014), 221. “[T]he crux of the matter is whether the effect is a reasonably likely or foreseeable consequence of the operation on the basis of the information available at the time of the attack.”\n³⁴ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.2. ³⁵ *Ibid.*, ¶ 5.12.1.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n347\nare temporary or reversible, but it is unclear why this would be important under the law. Neither is that distinction explained in the text. The terms are not relevant with reference to kinetic methods of warfare and, as there are no cyber-specific agreements governing cyberwarfare, there should be no additional restrictions on operations in the law – though the United States is free to limit its own operations by policy. One problem with this particular provision is that there is no agreed concept of “reversible” effects, and even “temporary” has no set meaning in this context. Presumably, temporary means something other than merely non-permanent, or else it would be synonymous with reversible. Reversible is similarly ambiguous, as a reversible cyber-effect could either prohibit the deletion of data or permit the deletion of data if a backup exists that could be used to return the targeted system to its original state. Without more detail, it is not clear that these terms add much meaning to the section.\nIn this section of the chapter, DoD reveals a deep unease with the use of cyber-capabilities in war. The cautious approach regarding cyber-capabilities is perhaps not what one would expect when cyberwarfare seems less likely than kinetic means to cause civilian casualties and damage. Nevertheless, when the Manual assesses the application of the principle of proportionality to kinetic attacks, it specifically excludes any inconvenience to civilians from consideration, noting that such ancillary aspects of a military attack “need not be considered.”³⁶ In contrast, the Manual mandates consideration of “civilian inconvenience” even in cyber operations that are too minor to be considered attacks under the law of war. It is logically inconsistent – and not a reflection of international law – to require no consideration of inconvenience before conducting a lethal attack, but to require that higher standard before a non-lethal cyber-action aiming to achieve the same result, such as disrupting military communications over a dual-use network node.³⁷ If this is US policy, it ought to be set out as policy, and could be reflected in rules of engagement, but it is potentially confusing to cyber operators who refer to the Manual as a source of law.\nAlthough not listed as one of the distinctive principles of the law of war in the Manual, the cyber operations chapter discusses the obligation of precautions. There are two precautions-related requirements under generalized LOAC. The first is precautions in the attack, which requires States, when engaging in an attack, to take all feasible steps to minimize harm to the civilian\n³⁶ Ibid., ¶ 5.12.1.2.\n³⁷ “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack,’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.” Ibid., ¶ 16.5.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\npopulation.³⁸ The second is precautions against the effects of attacks, which requires States to “take other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.”³⁹ This second might be thought of as an obligation of defenders to ensure that military and strategic objects are not commingled with civilian objects in a way that would make it impossible for attackers to distinguish between the two.\nFor the reasons discussed above, precautions in the attack is not a particularly intriguing topic in a cyber-specific context. Cyber-events not qualifying as attacks are not covered by this provision of law, and those that are attacks present the same issues as traditional kinetic warfare. While it is true that destructive cyberattacks could result in the loss of civilian access to internet-based services, for example, so might kinetic attacks. Bombing or destroying bridges and electrical power infrastructure, often part of traditional military campaigns, also frequently results in loss of connectivity due to broken communications lines and lack of power. The consideration of these ancillary civilian effects is the same whether the instrumentality is cyber or kinetic.\nBy contrast, cyberspace operations present a unique opportunity to apply the principle obligating defenders to avoid commingling civilian and military objects. The cyber-infrastructure States use for military and national security missions is the same as that used for civilian activities from personal communications to providing essential utilities such as electricity and water. It might be argued that in choosing to commingle civilian and military capabilities on a single infrastructure, States all violated the defensive application of precautions, leaving the internet more susceptible to attack as a dual-use target.\nIn the cyber context, Manual paragraph 16.5.3 proclaims that “[p]arties to a conflict must take feasible precautions to reduce the risk of incidental harm to the civilian population and other protected persons and objects.” It is unclear why the two aspects of precautions would be conflated in the cyber chapter. For clarity, the cyber-precautions provisions should track the language in AP I and in the other provisions of the Manual.\n³⁸ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of Aug. 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 (AP I), Art. 57. “Combatants must take feasible precautions in planning and conducting attacks to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and other persons and objects protected from being made the object of attack.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.11.\n³⁹ AP I, Art. 58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n349\n## 2.4 What Is the Definition of a Cyberweapon?\nBoth international and US law require that weapons be reviewed for legal compliance before they may be acquired or used. AP I codifies the requirement to conduct legal reviews of weapons.⁴⁰ The United States is not a party to AP I, but its practice of conducting legal reviews of weapons is consistent with the requirement, and predated AP I.⁴¹ DoD requires that weapons reviews determine whether a proposed weapon's intended use is calculated to cause superfluous injury, whether it is inherently indiscriminate, and whether it is specifically prohibited, for example by treaty.⁴²\nCyberspace operations have introduced new challenges in complying with what is ordinarily a straightforward provision of law. Recognizing that cyberweapons must be subjected to a legal review before acquisition or use does not answer the question of what, exactly, a cyberweapon is. In the case of more traditional weapons, it is generally straightforward to recognize that something is a weapon. Defining \"cyberweapon,\" on the other hand, can be quite tricky. It is difficult to know how to define cyberweapons, as the Manual recognizes: \"Not all cyber capabilities ... constitute a weapon or weapons system.\"⁴³ Nearly every function of a modern military is at least supported by cyber capabilities. Logistics, medical processes, communications, etc. are all highly dependent on computers and networks, yet those particular capabilities would not be classified as weapons. In the case of offensive capabilities, computers, networks, and servers might all be considered part of a cyberweapons system, and legal reviews of the hardware would be straightforward (and pointless, because the same equipment can be used to support civilian and defensive functions). The heart of a cyber-capability is the code on which it is based, and the Manual offers little practical guidance on the proper classification of malware or other commonly encountered cyber techniques.\nRather than take on the difficult task of providing a basis for determining whether a cyber-capability is a weapon, the Manual punts, noting that the military services address which cyber-capabilities require legal reviews. This would be more helpful if the services actually did address the issue. The pertinent Army regulation is dated 1979, and the Navy's 2011 regulation lacks cyber-specific language. Only the Air Force has addressed the issues\n⁴⁰ AP I, Art. 36.\n⁴¹ The Defense Acquisition System, DoD Directive 5000.1, ¶ E1.1.15 (certified current Nov. 20, 2007); DoD Manual, ¶ 6.2.3.\n⁴² DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 6.2.2. ⁴³ Ibid., ¶ 16.6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nsurrounding cyberweapons specifically, so its instruction provides the DoD guidance by default.⁴⁴\nThe Air Force defines “weapons” as “devices designed to kill, injure, disable or temporarily incapacitate people, or destroy, damage or temporarily incapacitate property or materiel.”⁴⁵ The Air Force instruction also defines a “cyber capability” as “any device or software payload intended to disrupt, deny, degrade, negate, impair or destroy adversarial computer systems, data, activities or capabilities,” but excludes “a device or software that is solely intended to provide access to an adversarial computer system for data exploitation.”⁴⁶\nThe Air Force directs that “all cyber capabilities being developed, bought, built, modified or otherwise acquired by the Air Force . . . are reviewed for legality under LOAC, domestic law and international law prior to their acquisition for use in a conflict or other military operation.”⁴⁷ Unlike kinetic means of warfare, cyber means largely consist of intellectual property in the form of computer code. Physical weapons must be designed and manufactured, so changes tend to be infrequent. In contrast, computer code may be changed instantly and easily. It is often altered multiple times in the course of an operation.⁴⁸ The practical problem created is that it appears dozens or hundreds of legal reviews might be required for a single cyber capability.\nAn alternate view of the problem is provided in the Tallinn Manual, which addresses the question of what constitutes a cyberweapon in rule 103. “[C]yber weapons are ‘cyber means of warfare’ that are used, designed, or intended to be used to cause injury to, or death of, persons or damage to, or destruction of, objects, that is, that result in the consequences required for qualification of a cyber operation as an attack.”⁴⁹ In the Tallinn Manual cyberattack is defined as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁰ DoD could consider adopting a modified version of this definition, making a simple change: “design, use, or intended use reasonably capable of causing.” This change would exclude imaginable but remote possibilities of harm that exist with every computer program, but would continue to create\n⁴⁴ Whether weapons reviews are controlled by international law or by US policy, it would be preferable to have a single interpretation from DoD, rather than potentially conflicting interpretations provided by individual services.\n⁴⁵ AFI 51-402, Legal Reviews of Weapons and Cyber Capabilities (July 27, 2011), 6.\n⁴⁶ Ibid., 5. ⁴⁷ Ibid., para 1.1.2.\n⁴⁸ See discussion in G.

However, the Air Force definition described above may provide an indication that leaving aside the subjective element of intent might be unacceptable to the United States because the definition would then capture cyber-espionage tools under the definition of weapon.⁵¹\nEven a workable definition of cyberweapons does not answer all the challenges. The Manual provides no guidance to help determine what “inherently indiscriminate” means with regard to a cyber-capability. Malware is often spread indiscriminately but may by design have no significant negative effect on untargeted computer systems. Malware may use untargeted systems as vectors to reach its intended target, where it might have great effect. This was the case, for example, in the Stuxnet incident, where malware was spread to over 100,000 computers, but had no significant effects until it reached the computer system at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, where it destroyed over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges.⁵² The Manual takes no position on whether inert code copied indiscriminately and without permission to the hard drives of thousands of computers makes use of that malware unlawful. Based on the extant State practice to date, the answer is probably “no,” but the Manual would be a good vehicle for putting the issue to rest.\nCyber “weaponry” is a controversial issue in the larger national security community, as well. The tools and vulnerabilities necessary to conduct computer- and network-based operations for national security missions can also be used against civilian systems in support of intelligence and criminal activity. The US Government has a process to determine whether cyber-vulnerabilities should be disclosed in order to protect the public or held as part of the cyberarsenal to be used in support of national security.⁵³ Some citizen groups argue that States have an obligation to disclose cyber-vulnerabilities they discover so the public can protect themselves from exploitation.⁵⁴ States have been less keen to recognize that there is such an obligation, as it would essentially\n⁵¹ One way to handle the espionage/operations overlap on this issue is to simply exclude espionage tools by intent. Another way would be to accept that weapons can be used in espionage in ways that are not attacks, such as using a machete to cut through vegetation on a fence line. The operation should be analyzed by its effects rather than by its means.\n⁵² K. Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day (New York: Broadway Books, 2014), 96, 175.\n⁵³ A. Schwartz and R. Knake, “Government’s Role in Vulnerability Disclosure,” The Cyber Security Project, Discussion Paper 2016-04 (June 2016), http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/Vulnerability%20Disclosure%20Web-Final4.pdf.\n⁵⁴ D.

Brown\nrequire them to render obsolete many of the cyber-capabilities they acquire or develop.\nAn inability to define what computer code constitutes a weapon also affects arms trade agreements. For example, the Wassenaar Arrangement, developed to control the transfer of arms and dual-use technologies, was amended in 2013 to include some cyber-capabilities.⁵⁵ One of the new prohibited categories is intrusion software, which is software “specially designed or modified to avoid detection by ‘monitoring tools’, or to defeat ‘protective countermeasures’, of a computer or network capable device, and performing [data extraction, data modification, or installation of malware].” The intent of the language was to keep powerful computer tools out of the hands of repressive regimes, but the additions also prevented university researchers and law-abiding cyber-intrusion specialists from properly conducting research, because they were unable to share code across national borders.⁵⁶\nGiven the range of complex issues surrounding cyberweapons, some indication of the appropriate direction here would have been useful not just to US practitioners, but also to other States that look to the United States for leadership in international law, and particularly value the DoD role in clarifying LOAC. DoD has more experience than any organization in the world at assessing weapons for compliance with international law. It may be as befuddled as everyone about how to define and assess cyber weapons, but setting a single DoD policy, even an imperfect one, would have been a superior course than leaving the issue to be determined by individuals across the US services and the international community, perhaps in very different ways.\n## 3 OTHER ISSUES\nThe major issues cyber operations law advisors must be equipped to field are discussed above. The other commonly recurring issues are attribution, neutrality, perfidy, and the role of civilians. All of these are noted in the Manual and are discussed below.\n2013), www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/01/zero_day_exploits_should_the_hacker_gray_market_be_regulated.html.\n⁵⁵ C.

Because of the internet's architecture and operation, concealing the identity and location of actors is relatively simple, while discovering the same can be an expensive and time-consuming process that often fails to deliver a certain answer.⁵⁷ The Manual says but little about attribution, merely noting that it is difficult. If the goal of the Manual is to be useful to practitioners, this is a section that could be more complete. For example, there is no indication of what level of proof should be required for various responses.\nThe Tallinn Manual offers the guidance that, while pinpointing the origin of an attack does not mean the State owner of the infrastructure is responsible for the attack, it does provide a sort of rebuttable presumption that the host State is responsible.⁵⁸ And, although there is no set standard of proof necessary to engage in countermeasures, the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility notes that the standard for attribution in such cases is \"reasonable certainty.\"⁵⁹ Legal advisors are not starting from scratch when determining the appropriate standard to apply; international law does provide guidance that is helpful, even in the new area of cyber operations. It would be useful for this standard, at least, to be referenced in the Manual.\n## 3.2 Neutrality\nNeutrality plays a limited role in the cyberspace context. Neutrality under the law of war only applies during international armed conflict and conflicts between States have become very much the exception. Non-international armed conflict (NIAC) is common, however, and aggressive cyber-activities in support of NIAC, and in support of sub-armed conflict State activity, is common.⁶⁰ The Manual's discussion of when neutrality principles apply is\n⁵⁷ Even in two high-profile instances where the US Government asserted attribution was certain, controversy about the identity of the culprits continued for months.

Brown\nbased on both the 1907 Hague Convention and on the opinion of international legal experts.⁶¹ Of particular note, the chapter in the Manual addressing the law of neutrality is silent with respect to cyber operations. In DoD’s interpretation, some principles of neutrality apply in NIACs, although beyond respecting sovereignty, which is a principle of international law independent of neutrality, it is unclear which specific principles apply to belligerents in such conflicts.⁶²\nWith regard to non-participating States in NIACs, the Manual cites the UN General Assembly: “Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.”⁶³ At some point, such activities would result in the offending State becoming a party to the conflict, converting it to an international armed conflict (IAC), so the Manual is apparently citing the language to capture relatively low-level, indirect assistance.⁶⁴ In any event, the Manual suggests that nonbelligerent States in NIACs should refrain from “acquiescing in organized activities” within their territories when the activities are directed to acts of civil strife or terrorism.\nThe Manual suggests a contrasting approach in the cyber context, asserting that a State’s neutrality (a term that appears to be used in this chapter to refer to both neutral States and, unconventionally, to nonparticipating States in NIACs) is not dependent on whether it polices its cyber-infrastructure, as long as it does not take steps to discriminate among users of its infrastructure. The Manual explicitly notes that even if data could be characterized as a cyber weapon or otherwise could cause destructive effects in a belligerent State, relaying it would not impact a State’s status as a neutral.\nThe disconnect here is probably more about trying to govern cyberspace with a treaty over a hundred years old than it is about neutrality. The Manual fails to take into account that aggressive computer code, in the form of data packets transmitted over the internet, can be the actual means of waging war, not merely communications about waging war, which is what Hague V was meant to address. There is little logical distinction between allowing the transmission of a virtual attack across neutral infrastructure and allowing the\n⁶¹ DoD Law of War Manual, § 15.2.1 and Chapter XVII fn. 211. ⁶² Ibid., § 15.2.1.3.\n⁶³ Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, annex to UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV), UN Doc.

If States do have sovereign rights over code passing through internet infrastructure located in their territory, they ought to have the responsibility to ensure the code they host is doing no harm. Otherwise, the host State is essentially protecting cyber-aggressors from effective action by victim States, which is inconsistent with the application of neutrality in the physical world.⁶⁶ The ultimate conclusion may be left to whether States decide packets of information making up cyber-means of warfare are more akin to communications or to weapons.⁶⁷\n## 3.3 Perfidy and Protective Emblems\nThe issue of perfidy has limited practical application in cyberwarfare, but it frequently comes up in conversations with cyber operators. The issue is briefly discussed in the Manual under “Improper Use of Signs.”⁶⁸ International law prohibits using perfidy to kill, injure, or capture an adversary.⁶⁹ Perfidy is widely understood as “[a]cts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to receive, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the\n⁶⁵ Tallinn Manual, rule 152.\n⁶⁶ “These sources make clear that neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent.” A. S. Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense” (2012) 52(3) Virginia Journal of International Law 499, www.vjil.org%2Fassets%2Fpdfs%2Fvol52%2Fissue3%2FDeeks_Post_Production.pdf.\n⁶⁷ On the other hand, States could also have determined that military aircraft crossing neutral territory are permitted, as long as they are only delivering messages. Instead, the mission of the aircraft appears to be irrelevant.\n⁶⁸ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.24. Misuse of protective emblems, treachery, and perfidy are often discussed together, and often (if inaccurately) grouped together as perfidy. As perfidy is the most common of the terms in the operations community, it is used as the section title here.\n⁶⁹ AP I, Art. 37(1). The United States asserts that customary international law prohibits only killing or injuring by means of perfidy, a position shared by the Tallinn experts. DoD Manual, para. 5.22; Tallinn Manual, rule 60(2).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nintent to betray that confidence.”⁷⁰ To be perfidious, a cyber operation would have to both rely on feigning legal protection and proximately result in death or injury (or capture under the international formulation).⁷¹ For example, an email falsely claiming to be from the International Committee of the Red Cross that successfully lured enemy troops to an armed ambush that resulted in their deaths would constitute perfidy.⁷² One might also imagine a similar false email that escaped electronic scrutiny because of its purported protected sender that, when opened, introduced malware into the adversary network. If that malware directly led to death or injury – by causing a catastrophic failure of a military installation’s power plant, for example – it would be an example of perfidy. If death or injury did not result, it would still be an example of a misuse of a protective emblem.\nThe Manual also states it would be inappropriate to use “communications that initiate non-hostile relations, such as prisoner exchanges or ceasefires” to gain entry into an enemy’s computer network.⁷³ The Manual’s support for this proposition is limited to cross-referencing other provisions in the Manual. While the United States may determine this is a good practice, such ruses are not prohibited under LOAC.⁷⁴\nSimilarly, the DoD Manual asserts “it would be prohibited to fabricate messages from an enemy’s Head of State falsely informing that State’s forces that an armistice or cease-fire had been signed.”⁷⁵ This, like the prior paragraph’s suggestion that perfidy prohibits false communications that initiate non-hostile relations, is inconsistent with established international law. Such practices may not be good policy, but they are not illegal. According to the 1977 International Red Cross (ICRC) Commentary on Additional Protocol I “the central element of the definition of perfidy is the deliberate claim to legal protection for hostile purposes,” which these lack.⁷⁶ There are arguments to the contrary but, as unchivalrous as these situations may be, they do not meet the definition of perfidy.⁷⁷\nCyber operations can be the most effective method of disseminating and obtaining information, so the portions of LOAC related to information are\n⁷⁰ AP I, Art. 37(1). ⁷¹ Tallinn Manual, rule 122(3).\n⁷² This is an adaptation of an example from the Tallinn Manual, rule 122(5).\n⁷³ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.4. ⁷⁴ Ibid., ¶¶ 12.2, 5.21. ⁷⁵ Ibid., ¶ 16.5.4.\n⁷⁶ ICRC, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 (7), 429, www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/RC_commentary-1977.html.\n⁷⁷ See S.

Protective emblems, such as the Red Cross (and other protected emblems), enemy prisoners of war (EPW) protections, and the blue shield that protects cultural property publicly note that certain facilities or individuals are protected from direct attack. Determining how best to translate the requirement of and respect for physical signage to virtual demarcation is still underway.\nAn area that is insufficiently addressed in the law is medical information. AP I requires that medical units and transports be marked as such.78 The Tallinn Manual opined that the marking and protection obligations extend to “[c]omputers, computer networks, and data that form an integral part of the operations or administration of medical units and transports.”79 The DoD Manual is silent on the issue, but it is one that merits consideration and decision so that it can be uniformly implemented. This would help ensure the protection of medical data and protect against accidental misuse of the protective emblem.\n## 3.4 Civilians as Combatants\nThe DoD Manual succinctly summarizes the law on civilian employees’ involvement in cyberwarfare. Civilian employees are permitted to directly participate in hostilities (DPH), but they forfeit any protection they would receive as civilians during the participation. There may be political or other policy rationales for preventing civilians from acting as cyber “trigger-pullers,” but it is permissible under LOAC. One reason DoD is comfortable with this broad reading of appropriate civilian conduct may be that cyberwarfare tends to be conducted from a distance, so there is less concern about increasing the chance that other, non-participating civilians could be mistaken for lawful targets.\n## 4 CONCLUSION\nThis chapter of the Commentary has focused more on developments of the law and shortcomings in the Manual than some other chapters. That is because, despite the lessons learned over many years of armed conflict about how the law of war should apply to best protect civilians and prevent unnecessary suffering, there are gaps in its practical application to cyberwarfare. As noted above, many questions remain about exactly how the law should apply to operations in cyberspace, yet the disruptive and destructive\n78 AP I, Art. 18. 79 Tallinn Manual, rule 132.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\ncapabilities and vulnerabilities available to cyber-actors are increasingly being acknowledged. State custom, practice, and norms are being created rapidly, as well, more through inaction than action. The cyber operations chapter in the Manual offered an opportunity for the United States to guide both the present and the future of cyber operations law, but DoD chose not to grasp it.\nAlthough DoD minimizes the role of military manuals in the development of international law, noting specifically in the DoD Manual that the views \"do not necessarily reflect the views of [other federal agencies] or the US Government as a whole,\" any information the United States provides will carry great weight.80 States are hungry for guidance on how the law of war applies to cyberwarfare, and the US owns the most important voice in the field. This may be why DoD was reluctant to take a bolder stand on the key issues that matter to coalition partners and experts in the field, but it also carries the risk that others, who may not share the interests of the United States with respect to ensuring freedoms of expression and association, may succeed in filling in the gaps.81 In the absence of official guidance, academic works carry more than their usual weight, as well, and the musings of academics are less likely to be constrained by practicality. It would be in DoD's selfish interest to encourage a practical body of law that supports military operations, rather than an idealistic set of pronouncements that will be ignored.\nThe most critical failing of the cyber operations chapter is that it offers no useful ideas on how to apply international law, or even US policy, to the most likely cyber-scenarios. Although military cyberspace operations are in their infancy, useful examples could have been drawn from a short list of real-world events. Cyber-incidents in Estonia (2007), the Republic of Georgia (2008), Iran (2009), and Saudi Arabia (2012) are just a few examples that might have been used to walk through various issues in a way relevant for operations lawyers.82 More recently, Russia's alleged use of cyber-methods to disseminate\n80 DoD Law of War Manual, iv.

The brevity and lack of specificity in the chapter may be an indication that DoD believes the law is insufficiently developed for it to provide guidance. Unfortunately, discomfort with the state of the law does not remove the responsibility of government legal advisors, who are the target audience of the Manual and must provide advice on cyber operations with or without legal direction from the manual. Even if the area is changing rapidly, it would be useful for DoD to provide more complete guidance to the field that would also suggest a framework for the international community. Even providing complete footnotes (as opposed to mostly internal references) would be a great help to practitioners; it would give them a jumping-off point for filling in the substantive gaps left by the Manual.\nDoD seems to be committed to making online changes to the Manual, and has demonstrated some alacrity in doing so. The cyber operations chapter is a likely candidate for significant development in the near future, and we can hope that future revisions will provide more specific guidance on how the law applies, or does not apply, to the emerging area of cyberwarfare.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
  "flat_text": "Gary D. Brown\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\nOne of the challenges in addressing the law applicable to cyberwarfare is apparent from a statement in the introduction to the Department of Defense (DoD) Law of War Manual (the Manual). Stephen Preston, who was at the time serving as DoD General Counsel, wrote that the manual “reflects the experience of this Department in applying the law of war in actual military operations, and it will help us remember the hard learned lessons from the past.” Indeed, one indisputable advantage DoD brings to law of war discussions is concrete operational experience. No other organization is as practiced in actually applying the law of war in combat as well as a whole range of other operations. DoD has been involved in combat operations during most of its existence since its founding in 1947. There is no organization more experienced in kinetic warfare, and none better positioned to capture lessons learned.\nThat is not the case with regard to cyberwarfare, however, and the lack of lessons learned from operations is evident in the Manual’s treatment of cyberwarfare. Chapter XVI of the Manual, “Cyber Operations,” provides little in the way of useful guidance for cyber operations lawyers. Although they will be required to provide real-time legal advice on cyber operations, operations lawyers have no definitive sources and few references with sufficient depth to guide their endeavors. In that sense, the cyber operations chapter represents the most substantial shortfall between the Manual’s aspiration in support of US forces and its actuality. In any event, Chapter XVI is by far the shortest chapter of the Manual at only sixteen pages (one of which has only two words of text along with a footnote).\n DoD Law of War Manual, ii.\n\nGary D. Brown\nBefore discussing the text, a reflection on the underpinnings of Chapter XVI is in order. As noted above, acknowledged State-sponsored cyber operations are rare to non-existent, so there are few legal lessons to be gleaned from practice between contesting States. That leaves only government policy and academic study as starting points for the construction of a specific body of cyber operations law. In a choice starkly contrasting with the rest of the DoD Manual, the cyber operations chapter relies almost exclusively on two sources: a 1999 DoD Office of General Counsel legal assessment of \"information operations\" and a 2012 speech at the US Cyber Command Legal Conference delivered by the State Department Legal Advisor. Chapter XVI of the Manual has only 44 percent as many footnotes when compared to the next most lightly footnoted chapter. Even more striking, 98.8 percent of the footnotes cite either to the Manual itself or to internal US policy documents and speeches.\nOf particular note, the Manual avoids any mention of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which has been well-received by academics and governments since its original publication in 2013. As the Manual's footnotes are meant \"to help practitioners research particular topics discussed in the main text,\" references to at least some of the literature in the field would have been appropriate. That one of two foundational references dates from the last century and the other is a State Department speech considerably undermines the credibility of the chapter.\n## 2 OVERVIEW\nThe broad scope of the DoD Manual is reflected in the statement of purpose, which is \"to provide information on the law of war to DoD personnel responsible for implementing the law of war and executing military operations.\" With that in mind, this commentary on the chapter \"Cyber Operations\" is organized according to the four most pressing issues that legal practitioners must address to provide proper legal advice to decision-makers:\n DoD, Office of the General Counsel, \"An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations\" (2nd ed., Nov. 1999), repr. in 76 US Naval War College International Law Studies (2002); and H.

About half of the footnotes are to other portions of the DoD Manual.\n Since the publication of the DoD Manual, the Tallinn Manual has been updated to version 2.0, published in 2017.

What is a cyberattack?\n4. What is a cyberweapon?\nSet out below is a discussion of why these questions are critical, and how well the Manual does as a reference for those who will be providing legal advice on military and other government cyber operations.\n## 2.1 What Is Cyberwar?\nOne of the key answers legal advisors must provide is whether proposed cyber operations would cross the threshold from peace to war. Although it may be outside the normal area of expertise of an operations legal advisor, they still must be prepared to grapple with the thorny issues of how cyber operations might contribute to, or even drive, a transition from peace to war. Because cyberspace by its nature is global, even those operations meant to be collecting tactical information or focused on a specific region can have far-reaching consequences. The intent of cyberspace operators is often difficult to discern, and internet-based operations cross many jurisdictions in making their way to the intended target. That means information-gathering might appear to be something more aggressive. In addition, States might feel compelled to defend their \"cyber-sovereignty\" even from incursions falling short of aggression. Either of these could motivate hostile actions in response, so discerning the distinction between normal cyber operations and those that might be interpreted as aggressive (or transgressive) is of critical importance.\nIn examining that decision space, national decision-makers often ask the question, \"Is this an act of war?\" This is a consideration of both States considering the wisdom of cyberspace activities, and States who are the victims of unfriendly cyber-acts. The term \"act of war\" is generally meant to be \"any act by a State that would effectively terminate the normal international law of peacetime and activate the international law\n Although the phrase \"act of war\" is not a legal term, given the difficulties in determining what cyber-events cross the threshold of armed attack, it may be appropriate for States to note the importance of political considerations in their assessments of whether aggressive cyber-activities trigger the right of self-defense. As one cyber-expert puts it, \"calling something an act of war is not a conclusion; it is a decision.\" M. Libicki, \"An Act of War, Even Cyberwar, Is a Decision,\" New York Times (Feb. 28, 2013), www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/02/28/what-is-an-act-of-cyberwar/an-act-of-war-even-cyberwar-is-a-decision.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nof war.”7 In modern usage, an act of war may be considered the equivalent of armed attack or, for the United States, a use of force.8 For cyber operations lawyers advising decision-makers it is appropriate to ask, as the DoD Manual does, whether a certain cyber-act is an unlawful use of force or an international armed attack.\nThe ultimate goal is determining which activity rises to a level that would justify a State’s use of force in self-defense.9 For most States, that would mean the cyber-activity would have to be an armed attack, which would trigger Article 51 of the UN Charter. The United States, however, has consistently asserted that the right of self-defense may be exercised based on a lower threshold: that of a use of force.10 Whichever standard is used, sorting out which cyber-activities would push States to armed conflict is difficult to describe in an abstract ex ante manner.\nThe Manual concludes that if a cyber-activity has kinetic results, it may lawfully be treated the same as if it were caused by non-cyber means. Thus, “if cyber operations cause effects that, if caused by traditional physical means, would be regarded as a use of force . . . then such cyber operations would likely also be regarded as a use of force.”11 The caveat of “likely” in the statement is critical. Cyber-means of warfare are not exempt from the application of international law, but the Manual suggests the application of the law is unsettled. In the kinetic realm, decades of history and precedent are available to study what States consider adequate to support armed self-defense. If the aggressor uses cyber-means, however, the US position is that the legal question cannot be answered merely based on the effects of the attack. States “must evaluate factors including the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action . . ., the target and location, effects and intent, among other possible issues” before determining whether the action constitutes a use of force.12\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nStates have not engaged in armed conflict premised only on cyber-aggression against financial institutions. Similarly, they will not, it seems, wage war over foreign actors establishing a persistent presence on industrial control systems controlling public utilities. State practice seems to be tilting in favor of negotiated agreements between States to refrain from such actions rather than recognizing the resort of armed retaliation. It is possible the non-response from States is because they lack good evidence connecting the actors to States, or even non-State armed groups. State norms and practice regarding cyberspace operations are rapidly forming and being refined. If the US position is that these activities would engender armed self-defense given\n Ibid., ¶ 16.3.1.\n D. Volz and J.

Brown\nsufficient evidence of the actor, the DoD Manual would have offered an ideal opportunity to state and support that perspective. More likely, the US position is that many activities in this arena fall under the broad rubric of \"espionage,\" activities at which the US excels and does not wish to limit through the international legal structure.[17] Even stating that clearly would have been helpful to the practitioners who will rely on the Manual to form legal opinions in support of cyber operations.\nAnother weakness with the examples the Manual uses is that they are far too facile. A legal advisor with no previous experience in cyber operations could surely have determined that activities causing dams to fail and planes to crash would be international acts of aggression. These obvious examples provide little guidance to practitioners who must advise on where the line is drawn between cyberattacks and lesser cyber-insults. A single example, also from the 1999 paper, may provide more information about where the line between peace and war is drawn, but it is unclear exactly how it fits with the message of the chapter. \"[C]yber operations that cripple a military's logistics systems, and thus its ability to conduct and sustain military operations, might also be considered a use of force under jus ad bellum.\"[18] Compared to a nuclear meltdown and plane crashes, this type of operation seems almost benign.\nAlthough it is not clear what \"crippling\" a military logistics system means, the type of disruptive cyber-action that could be taken against an unclassified logistics system seems similar to the events in Estonia in 2007. In that case, government and economic websites, as well as internet infrastructure sites, were targeted with denial of service attacks that significantly impaired their functioning for three weeks.[19] The events in Estonia were not considered sufficient to support a claim of international self-defense.[20] This interpretation also seems to be a departure from US practice as stated in the Manual. In addition to the failure to react publicly to operations carried out against public utilities and financial systems, the US characterized the 2014 Sony hack, which stole massive amounts of data and was designed to corrupt or destroy more, as \"cyber-vandalism,\" explicitly characterizing it as an activity\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nEven if a cyber-activity is determined not to cross the armed attack/use of force threshold, victims are not without military recourse. The notion of cyber-countermeasures to respond to aggressive but sub-use of force cyber-actions has received significant attention in the international legal community, although it rates little more than a footnote in the chapter. Other than in the cyber chapter, the Manual refers to countermeasures as reprisals, which it defines as “acts taken against a party: (1) that would otherwise be unlawful; (2) in order to persuade that party to cease violating the law.” In other words, if undertaken as a countermeasure, unlawful responsive cyber-measures are rendered legal if they remain below the level of a use of force, and are conducted for the purpose of ending the original unlawful activity.\nParagraph 16.3.3.3 of the Manual discusses countermeasures and retorsion together, emphasizing the availability of retorsive responses to cyber-insults, such as diplomatic measures. Both are important concepts for cyber operations, but they are distinct. Retorsion in general is defined in paragraph 18.17 of the DoD Manual: “unfriendly conduct, (1) which is not inconsistent with any international obligation of the State engaging in it, and (2) which is done in response to an internationally wrongful act.” An understanding of both in the cyber context is especially critical because it is not always clear when an action in cyberspace is unlawful. When the law on the original action is unclear, responses may be phrased as equivalent; that is, if the initial action was lawful,\n K.

Brown\nthen the same thing done in return would be retorsion. If the triggering action was unlawful, then the response would be a countermeasure, rendered lawful by its status.\n## 2.2 What Is Cyber-Spying?\nDetermining whether cyber-activities would cross the line from operations to espionage remains a difficult issue for cyber legal advisors. Espionage is generally unregulated under international law but, unlike in the physical world, espionage in cyberspace can be quite difficult to distinguish from the preparation for and conduct of more aggressive military operations. The Manual notes that to the extent “cyber operations resemble traditional intelligence and counterintelligence activities, such as unauthorized intrusions into computer networks solely to acquire information, then such cyber operations would likely be treated similarly under international law.” This would be more helpful if there were an easy way to ascertain the nature of the cyber-activity in the first place.\nWhether a cyber operation is undertaken for the purpose of espionage or military operations, it normally will require some penetration of the targeted system to gain access. Once access to the system is established, the aggressor might engage in espionage or attack. Even if the mission is espionage, the operator might leave behind malware to facilitate future access to the system, and that future event might be either an attack or spying. How should system penetrations be treated under the law when the actor's intent is unknown? How should pre-implanted capabilities be treated when they are discovered, especially on critical infrastructure or sensitive national security systems? If an espionage event goes wrong and results in accidental damage to a system, does it become an attack at that point? There may be no way for the victim of the event to determine the actor's intent, especially in a timely fashion.\n For a discussion on the level of attribution required, see section 3.1 of this chapter.\n Not discussed in the Manual is the plea of necessity, which term “is used to denote those exceptional cases where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency.” Draft Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 25, http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf.\n “[T]he international legal system generally imposes no sanctions upon nations for acts of espionage except for the political costs of public denunciation.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 18.21.2 fn. 305.

US military legal advisors take for granted that the principles of the law of war – distinction, proportionality, humanity, and military necessity – all apply during armed conflict. With regard to kinetic attacks, of course, these principles do apply. The challenge with wartime cyber operations is that they can be quite disruptive without being destructive. Legal advisors must be able to distinguish operations that must refrain from targeting civilian objects, for example, and those that fall below the attack threshold.\nThe cyber operations chapter takes note of the issue in a general way, pointing to paragraph 5.4 for details on how attacks are covered by the law of armed conflict (LOAC). That paragraph iterates that attacks must be carried out in compliance with the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions, but paragraph 16.5.2 notes with some circularity that “[a] cyber operation that does not constitute an attack is not restricted by the rules that apply to attacks.” It goes on to give examples of operations that would not constitute attacks: defacing government web pages; briefly disrupting internet service in a minor way; briefly disrupting, disabling, or interfering with communications; or disseminating propaganda. Unfortunately, these examples do little to draw the line between aggressive, non-attack cyber-activity and activity that would qualify as an attack. For example, do the qualifications in the examples mean that DoD would label a brief disruption of internet service in\n See Ray Murphy’s contribution to this book in Chapter 7. Chapter II of the DoD Manual lists the principles of the law of war as military necessity, humanity, proportionality, distinction, and honor. The principle of honor seems particularly attenuated from cyberwarfare; it is not discussed in the Manual with reference to cyberwarfare, and will be omitted here, as well.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\na major way an attack? Further, it is unclear that the principles of LOAC apply to any cyber-activity that stops short of causing damage, destruction, or injury. This gap in the law has led some experts to suggest that LOAC ought to apply to cyber operations that affect the functionality of computer systems without actually damaging them.\nThe Manual states “[i]f a cyber operation constitutes an attack, then the law of war rules on conducting attacks must be applied to those cyber operations.” Of course, this invites the question of what constitutes an attack. Operational legal advisors who consult the manual for guidance on this question will learn that wartime operations that destroy computers are attacks. While this is true, it is also the simplest case – kinetic effects directly caused by cyber operations clearly are attacks. On the more difficult questions of whether loss of functionality of a computer system, without damage to it, is an attack, or whether harm significantly attenuated from the original event, would similarly constitute an attack, the Manual is silent.\nAfter identifying the way cyberwarfare techniques might not be governed by the principles of the law of war, the Manual suggests that the case is not closed. “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.” This seems to contradict an earlier statement in the Manual, and may be read as *lex ferenda* rather than an articulation of the law. Legal advisors who rely on the Manual for guidance would be better served if the Manual made clear this is a US policy rather than the law. The United States might well put such policy restrictions in its own rules of engagement, but if it is meant to be read as a restriction grounded in law, the Manual should have provided some affirmative authority for this belief.\nIn a legal advisor’s analysis of whether a cyber-activity constitutes an attack, the Manual notes the importance of considering whether the effects created\n See M. N. Schmitt, “Rewired Warfare: Rethinking the Law of Cyber Attack” (2014) 96(893) *International Review of the Red Cross* 189, www.icrc.org/en/international-review/article/rewired-warfare-rethinking-law-cyber-attack; and C.

Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014), 221. “[T]he crux of the matter is whether the effect is a reasonably likely or foreseeable consequence of the operation on the basis of the information available at the time of the attack.”\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.2.  *Ibid.*, ¶ 5.12.1.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nIn this section of the chapter, DoD reveals a deep unease with the use of cyber-capabilities in war. The cautious approach regarding cyber-capabilities is perhaps not what one would expect when cyberwarfare seems less likely than kinetic means to cause civilian casualties and damage. Nevertheless, when the Manual assesses the application of the principle of proportionality to kinetic attacks, it specifically excludes any inconvenience to civilians from consideration, noting that such ancillary aspects of a military attack “need not be considered.” In contrast, the Manual mandates consideration of “civilian inconvenience” even in cyber operations that are too minor to be considered attacks under the law of war. It is logically inconsistent – and not a reflection of international law – to require no consideration of inconvenience before conducting a lethal attack, but to require that higher standard before a non-lethal cyber-action aiming to achieve the same result, such as disrupting military communications over a dual-use network node. If this is US policy, it ought to be set out as policy, and could be reflected in rules of engagement, but it is potentially confusing to cyber operators who refer to the Manual as a source of law.\nAlthough not listed as one of the distinctive principles of the law of war in the Manual, the cyber operations chapter discusses the obligation of precautions. There are two precautions-related requirements under generalized LOAC. The first is precautions in the attack, which requires States, when engaging in an attack, to take all feasible steps to minimize harm to the civilian\n Ibid., ¶ 5.12.1.2.\n “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack,’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.” Ibid., ¶ 16.5.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\npopulation. The second is precautions against the effects of attacks, which requires States to “take other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.” This second might be thought of as an obligation of defenders to ensure that military and strategic objects are not commingled with civilian objects in a way that would make it impossible for attackers to distinguish between the two.\nFor the reasons discussed above, precautions in the attack is not a particularly intriguing topic in a cyber-specific context. Cyber-events not qualifying as attacks are not covered by this provision of law, and those that are attacks present the same issues as traditional kinetic warfare. While it is true that destructive cyberattacks could result in the loss of civilian access to internet-based services, for example, so might kinetic attacks. Bombing or destroying bridges and electrical power infrastructure, often part of traditional military campaigns, also frequently results in loss of connectivity due to broken communications lines and lack of power. The consideration of these ancillary civilian effects is the same whether the instrumentality is cyber or kinetic.\nBy contrast, cyberspace operations present a unique opportunity to apply the principle obligating defenders to avoid commingling civilian and military objects. The cyber-infrastructure States use for military and national security missions is the same as that used for civilian activities from personal communications to providing essential utilities such as electricity and water. It might be argued that in choosing to commingle civilian and military capabilities on a single infrastructure, States all violated the defensive application of precautions, leaving the internet more susceptible to attack as a dual-use target.\nIn the cyber context, Manual paragraph 16.5.3 proclaims that “[p]arties to a conflict must take feasible precautions to reduce the risk of incidental harm to the civilian population and other protected persons and objects.” It is unclear why the two aspects of precautions would be conflated in the cyber chapter. For clarity, the cyber-precautions provisions should track the language in AP I and in the other provisions of the Manual.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of Aug. 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 (AP I), Art. 57. “Combatants must take feasible precautions in planning and conducting attacks to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and other persons and objects protected from being made the object of attack.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.11.\n AP I, Art. 58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nBoth international and US law require that weapons be reviewed for legal compliance before they may be acquired or used. AP I codifies the requirement to conduct legal reviews of weapons. The United States is not a party to AP I, but its practice of conducting legal reviews of weapons is consistent with the requirement, and predated AP I. DoD requires that weapons reviews determine whether a proposed weapon's intended use is calculated to cause superfluous injury, whether it is inherently indiscriminate, and whether it is specifically prohibited, for example by treaty.\nCyberspace operations have introduced new challenges in complying with what is ordinarily a straightforward provision of law. Recognizing that cyberweapons must be subjected to a legal review before acquisition or use does not answer the question of what, exactly, a cyberweapon is. In the case of more traditional weapons, it is generally straightforward to recognize that something is a weapon. Defining \"cyberweapon,\" on the other hand, can be quite tricky. It is difficult to know how to define cyberweapons, as the Manual recognizes: \"Not all cyber capabilities ... constitute a weapon or weapons system.\" Nearly every function of a modern military is at least supported by cyber capabilities. Logistics, medical processes, communications, etc. are all highly dependent on computers and networks, yet those particular capabilities would not be classified as weapons. In the case of offensive capabilities, computers, networks, and servers might all be considered part of a cyberweapons system, and legal reviews of the hardware would be straightforward (and pointless, because the same equipment can be used to support civilian and defensive functions). The heart of a cyber-capability is the code on which it is based, and the Manual offers little practical guidance on the proper classification of malware or other commonly encountered cyber techniques.\nRather than take on the difficult task of providing a basis for determining whether a cyber-capability is a weapon, the Manual punts, noting that the military services address which cyber-capabilities require legal reviews. This would be more helpful if the services actually did address the issue. The pertinent Army regulation is dated 1979, and the Navy's 2011 regulation lacks cyber-specific language. Only the Air Force has addressed the issues\n AP I, Art. 36.\n The Defense Acquisition System, DoD Directive 5000.1, ¶ E1.1.15 (certified current Nov. 20, 2007); DoD Manual, ¶ 6.2.3.\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 6.2.2.

Brown\nsurrounding cyberweapons specifically, so its instruction provides the DoD guidance by default.\nThe Air Force defines “weapons” as “devices designed to kill, injure, disable or temporarily incapacitate people, or destroy, damage or temporarily incapacitate property or materiel.” The Air Force instruction also defines a “cyber capability” as “any device or software payload intended to disrupt, deny, degrade, negate, impair or destroy adversarial computer systems, data, activities or capabilities,” but excludes “a device or software that is solely intended to provide access to an adversarial computer system for data exploitation.”\nThe Air Force directs that “all cyber capabilities being developed, bought, built, modified or otherwise acquired by the Air Force . . . are reviewed for legality under LOAC, domestic law and international law prior to their acquisition for use in a conflict or other military operation.” Unlike kinetic means of warfare, cyber means largely consist of intellectual property in the form of computer code. Physical weapons must be designed and manufactured, so changes tend to be infrequent. In contrast, computer code may be changed instantly and easily. It is often altered multiple times in the course of an operation. The practical problem created is that it appears dozens or hundreds of legal reviews might be required for a single cyber capability.\nAn alternate view of the problem is provided in the Tallinn Manual, which addresses the question of what constitutes a cyberweapon in rule 103. “[C]yber weapons are ‘cyber means of warfare’ that are used, designed, or intended to be used to cause injury to, or death of, persons or damage to, or destruction of, objects, that is, that result in the consequences required for qualification of a cyber operation as an attack.” In the Tallinn Manual cyberattack is defined as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.” DoD could consider adopting a modified version of this definition, making a simple change: “design, use, or intended use reasonably capable of causing.” This change would exclude imaginable but remote possibilities of harm that exist with every computer program, but would continue to create\n Whether weapons reviews are controlled by international law or by US policy, it would be preferable to have a single interpretation from DoD, rather than potentially conflicting interpretations provided by individual services.\n AFI 51-402, Legal Reviews of Weapons and Cyber Capabilities (July 27, 2011), 6.\n Ibid., 5.

Ibid., rule 92.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nEven a workable definition of cyberweapons does not answer all the challenges. The Manual provides no guidance to help determine what “inherently indiscriminate” means with regard to a cyber-capability. Malware is often spread indiscriminately but may by design have no significant negative effect on untargeted computer systems. Malware may use untargeted systems as vectors to reach its intended target, where it might have great effect. This was the case, for example, in the Stuxnet incident, where malware was spread to over 100,000 computers, but had no significant effects until it reached the computer system at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, where it destroyed over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges. The Manual takes no position on whether inert code copied indiscriminately and without permission to the hard drives of thousands of computers makes use of that malware unlawful. Based on the extant State practice to date, the answer is probably “no,” but the Manual would be a good vehicle for putting the issue to rest.\nCyber “weaponry” is a controversial issue in the larger national security community, as well. The tools and vulnerabilities necessary to conduct computer- and network-based operations for national security missions can also be used against civilian systems in support of intelligence and criminal activity. The US Government has a process to determine whether cyber-vulnerabilities should be disclosed in order to protect the public or held as part of the cyberarsenal to be used in support of national security. Some citizen groups argue that States have an obligation to disclose cyber-vulnerabilities they discover so the public can protect themselves from exploitation. States have been less keen to recognize that there is such an obligation, as it would essentially\n One way to handle the espionage/operations overlap on this issue is to simply exclude espionage tools by intent. Another way would be to accept that weapons can be used in espionage in ways that are not attacks, such as using a machete to cut through vegetation on a fence line. The operation should be analyzed by its effects rather than by its means.\n K. Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day (New York: Broadway Books, 2014), 96, 175.\n A. Schwartz and R. Knake, “Government’s Role in Vulnerability Disclosure,” The Cyber Security Project, Discussion Paper 2016-04 (June 2016), http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/Vulnerability%20Disclosure%20Web-Final4.pdf.\n D.

Brown\nrequire them to render obsolete many of the cyber-capabilities they acquire or develop.\nAn inability to define what computer code constitutes a weapon also affects arms trade agreements. For example, the Wassenaar Arrangement, developed to control the transfer of arms and dual-use technologies, was amended in 2013 to include some cyber-capabilities. One of the new prohibited categories is intrusion software, which is software “specially designed or modified to avoid detection by ‘monitoring tools’, or to defeat ‘protective countermeasures’, of a computer or network capable device, and performing [data extraction, data modification, or installation of malware].” The intent of the language was to keep powerful computer tools out of the hands of repressive regimes, but the additions also prevented university researchers and law-abiding cyber-intrusion specialists from properly conducting research, because they were unable to share code across national borders.\nGiven the range of complex issues surrounding cyberweapons, some indication of the appropriate direction here would have been useful not just to US practitioners, but also to other States that look to the United States for leadership in international law, and particularly value the DoD role in clarifying LOAC. DoD has more experience than any organization in the world at assessing weapons for compliance with international law. It may be as befuddled as everyone about how to define and assess cyber weapons, but setting a single DoD policy, even an imperfect one, would have been a superior course than leaving the issue to be determined by individuals across the US services and the international community, perhaps in very different ways.\n## 3 OTHER ISSUES\nThe major issues cyber operations law advisors must be equipped to field are discussed above. The other commonly recurring issues are attribution, neutrality, perfidy, and the role of civilians. All of these are noted in the Manual and are discussed below.\n2013), www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/01/zero_day_exploits_should_the_hacker_gray_market_be_regulated.html.\n C. Anderson, “Considerations on Wassenaar Arrangement Control List Additions for Surveillance Technologies,” https://cda.io/r/ConsiderationsonWassenaarArrangementProposalsforSurveillanceTechnologies.pdf.\n Ibid.; T.

Rosenzweig, “Cyber Weapons and Export Control: Incorporating Dual Use with the PrEP Model” (2016) 8 Journal of Law and National Security Policy 301-9, http://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Cyber-Weapons-and-Export-Control_2.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nAttribution is one of the most commonly discussed aspects of cyber operations. Because of the internet's architecture and operation, concealing the identity and location of actors is relatively simple, while discovering the same can be an expensive and time-consuming process that often fails to deliver a certain answer. The Manual says but little about attribution, merely noting that it is difficult. If the goal of the Manual is to be useful to practitioners, this is a section that could be more complete. For example, there is no indication of what level of proof should be required for various responses.\nThe Tallinn Manual offers the guidance that, while pinpointing the origin of an attack does not mean the State owner of the infrastructure is responsible for the attack, it does provide a sort of rebuttable presumption that the host State is responsible. And, although there is no set standard of proof necessary to engage in countermeasures, the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility notes that the standard for attribution in such cases is \"reasonable certainty.\" Legal advisors are not starting from scratch when determining the appropriate standard to apply; international law does provide guidance that is helpful, even in the new area of cyber operations. It would be useful for this standard, at least, to be referenced in the Manual.\n## 3.2 Neutrality\nNeutrality plays a limited role in the cyberspace context. Neutrality under the law of war only applies during international armed conflict and conflicts between States have become very much the exception. Non-international armed conflict (NIAC) is common, however, and aggressive cyber-activities in support of NIAC, and in support of sub-armed conflict State activity, is common. The Manual's discussion of when neutrality principles apply is\n Even in two high-profile instances where the US Government asserted attribution was certain, controversy about the identity of the culprits continued for months. Cybersecurity experts seem to have as many different opinions as lawyers. \"FBI Still Believes North Korea Is Responsible for Sony Hack,\" CBS News (Dec. 30, 2014), www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-still-believes-north-korea-is-responsible-for-sony-hack/; S.

Brown\nbased on both the 1907 Hague Convention and on the opinion of international legal experts. Of particular note, the chapter in the Manual addressing the law of neutrality is silent with respect to cyber operations. In DoD’s interpretation, some principles of neutrality apply in NIACs, although beyond respecting sovereignty, which is a principle of international law independent of neutrality, it is unclear which specific principles apply to belligerents in such conflicts.\nWith regard to non-participating States in NIACs, the Manual cites the UN General Assembly: “Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.” At some point, such activities would result in the offending State becoming a party to the conflict, converting it to an international armed conflict (IAC), so the Manual is apparently citing the language to capture relatively low-level, indirect assistance. In any event, the Manual suggests that nonbelligerent States in NIACs should refrain from “acquiescing in organized activities” within their territories when the activities are directed to acts of civil strife or terrorism.\nThe Manual suggests a contrasting approach in the cyber context, asserting that a State’s neutrality (a term that appears to be used in this chapter to refer to both neutral States and, unconventionally, to nonparticipating States in NIACs) is not dependent on whether it polices its cyber-infrastructure, as long as it does not take steps to discriminate among users of its infrastructure. The Manual explicitly notes that even if data could be characterized as a cyber weapon or otherwise could cause destructive effects in a belligerent State, relaying it would not impact a State’s status as a neutral.\nThe disconnect here is probably more about trying to govern cyberspace with a treaty over a hundred years old than it is about neutrality. The Manual fails to take into account that aggressive computer code, in the form of data packets transmitted over the internet, can be the actual means of waging war, not merely communications about waging war, which is what Hague V was meant to address. There is little logical distinction between allowing the transmission of a virtual attack across neutral infrastructure and allowing the\n DoD Law of War Manual, § 15.2.1 and Chapter XVII fn. 211.

U.S. (ICJ, 1986).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nThe Tallinn Manual takes a different approach to cyber-neutrality, with most of the experts opining that a State would violate its status as a neutral if it knowingly allowed the transmission of a cyberweapon across infrastructure it controlled.\nThe application of neutrality in cyberspace as set out in the DoD Manual is problematic because the United States appears to support the assertion of the rights of national sovereignty by States hosting internet infrastructure, but not the normal responsibilities of a sovereign. If States do have sovereign rights over code passing through internet infrastructure located in their territory, they ought to have the responsibility to ensure the code they host is doing no harm. Otherwise, the host State is essentially protecting cyber-aggressors from effective action by victim States, which is inconsistent with the application of neutrality in the physical world. The ultimate conclusion may be left to whether States decide packets of information making up cyber-means of warfare are more akin to communications or to weapons.\n## 3.3 Perfidy and Protective Emblems\nThe issue of perfidy has limited practical application in cyberwarfare, but it frequently comes up in conversations with cyber operators. The issue is briefly discussed in the Manual under “Improper Use of Signs.” International law prohibits using perfidy to kill, injure, or capture an adversary. Perfidy is widely understood as “[a]cts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to receive, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the\n Tallinn Manual, rule 152.\n “These sources make clear that neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent.” A. S. Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense” (2012) 52(3) Virginia Journal of International Law 499, www.vjil.org%2Fassets%2Fpdfs%2Fvol52%2Fissue3%2FDeeks_Post_Production.pdf.\n On the other hand, States could also have determined that military aircraft crossing neutral territory are permitted, as long as they are only delivering messages. Instead, the mission of the aircraft appears to be irrelevant.\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.24. Misuse of protective emblems, treachery, and perfidy are often discussed together, and often (if inaccurately) grouped together as perfidy. As perfidy is the most common of the terms in the operations community, it is used as the section title here.\n AP I, Art. 37(1). The United States asserts that customary international law prohibits only killing or injuring by means of perfidy, a position shared by the Tallinn experts. DoD Manual, para. 5.22; Tallinn Manual, rule 60(2).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nintent to betray that confidence.” To be perfidious, a cyber operation would have to both rely on feigning legal protection and proximately result in death or injury (or capture under the international formulation). For example, an email falsely claiming to be from the International Committee of the Red Cross that successfully lured enemy troops to an armed ambush that resulted in their deaths would constitute perfidy. One might also imagine a similar false email that escaped electronic scrutiny because of its purported protected sender that, when opened, introduced malware into the adversary network. If that malware directly led to death or injury – by causing a catastrophic failure of a military installation’s power plant, for example – it would be an example of perfidy. If death or injury did not result, it would still be an example of a misuse of a protective emblem.\nThe Manual also states it would be inappropriate to use “communications that initiate non-hostile relations, such as prisoner exchanges or ceasefires” to gain entry into an enemy’s computer network. The Manual’s support for this proposition is limited to cross-referencing other provisions in the Manual. While the United States may determine this is a good practice, such ruses are not prohibited under LOAC.\nSimilarly, the DoD Manual asserts “it would be prohibited to fabricate messages from an enemy’s Head of State falsely informing that State’s forces that an armistice or cease-fire had been signed.” This, like the prior paragraph’s suggestion that perfidy prohibits false communications that initiate non-hostile relations, is inconsistent with established international law. Such practices may not be good policy, but they are not illegal. According to the 1977 International Red Cross (ICRC) Commentary on Additional Protocol I “the central element of the definition of perfidy is the deliberate claim to legal protection for hostile purposes,” which these lack. There are arguments to the contrary but, as unchivalrous as these situations may be, they do not meet the definition of perfidy.\nCyber operations can be the most effective method of disseminating and obtaining information, so the portions of LOAC related to information are\n AP I, Art. 37(1).  Tallinn Manual, rule 122(3).\n This is an adaptation of an example from the Tallinn Manual, rule 122(5).\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.4.  Ibid., ¶¶ 12.2, 5.21.

Watts, “Law of War Perfidy” (2014) 219 Military Law Review 172, www.jagcnet.army.mil /DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/0/02eb1ceb45ec8dd285257cf9004f63cf/$FILE/By%20Sean%20Watts.pdf; and M. J.

AP I requires that medical units and transports be marked as such.78 The Tallinn Manual opined that the marking and protection obligations extend to “[c]omputers, computer networks, and data that form an integral part of the operations or administration of medical units and transports.”79 The DoD Manual is silent on the issue, but it is one that merits consideration and decision so that it can be uniformly implemented. This would help ensure the protection of medical data and protect against accidental misuse of the protective emblem.\n## 3.4 Civilians as Combatants\nThe DoD Manual succinctly summarizes the law on civilian employees’ involvement in cyberwarfare. Civilian employees are permitted to directly participate in hostilities (DPH), but they forfeit any protection they would receive as civilians during the participation. There may be political or other policy rationales for preventing civilians from acting as cyber “trigger-pullers,” but it is permissible under LOAC. One reason DoD is comfortable with this broad reading of appropriate civilian conduct may be that cyberwarfare tends to be conducted from a distance, so there is less concern about increasing the chance that other, non-participating civilians could be mistaken for lawful targets.\n## 4 CONCLUSION\nThis chapter of the Commentary has focused more on developments of the law and shortcomings in the Manual than some other chapters. That is because, despite the lessons learned over many years of armed conflict about how the law of war should apply to best protect civilians and prevent unnecessary suffering, there are gaps in its practical application to cyberwarfare. As noted above, many questions remain about exactly how the law should apply to operations in cyberspace, yet the disruptive and destructive\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\ncapabilities and vulnerabilities available to cyber-actors are increasingly being acknowledged. State custom, practice, and norms are being created rapidly, as well, more through inaction than action. The cyber operations chapter in the Manual offered an opportunity for the United States to guide both the present and the future of cyber operations law, but DoD chose not to grasp it.\nAlthough DoD minimizes the role of military manuals in the development of international law, noting specifically in the DoD Manual that the views \"do not necessarily reflect the views of [other federal agencies] or the US Government as a whole,\" any information the United States provides will carry great weight.80 States are hungry for guidance on how the law of war applies to cyberwarfare, and the US owns the most important voice in the field. This may be why DoD was reluctant to take a bolder stand on the key issues that matter to coalition partners and experts in the field, but it also carries the risk that others, who may not share the interests of the United States with respect to ensuring freedoms of expression and association, may succeed in filling in the gaps.81 In the absence of official guidance, academic works carry more than their usual weight, as well, and the musings of academics are less likely to be constrained by practicality. It would be in DoD's selfish interest to encourage a practical body of law that supports military operations, rather than an idealistic set of pronouncements that will be ignored.\nThe most critical failing of the cyber operations chapter is that it offers no useful ideas on how to apply international law, or even US policy, to the most likely cyber-scenarios. Although military cyberspace operations are in their infancy, useful examples could have been drawn from a short list of real-world events. Cyber-incidents in Estonia (2007), the Republic of Georgia (2008), Iran (2009), and Saudi Arabia (2012) are just a few examples that might have been used to walk through various issues in a way relevant for operations lawyers.82 More recently, Russia's alleged use of cyber-methods to disseminate\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nThere remain many unanswered questions regarding the law governing cyberwarfare. The brevity and lack of specificity in the chapter may be an indication that DoD believes the law is insufficiently developed for it to provide guidance. Unfortunately, discomfort with the state of the law does not remove the responsibility of government legal advisors, who are the target audience of the Manual and must provide advice on cyber operations with or without legal direction from the manual. Even if the area is changing rapidly, it would be useful for DoD to provide more complete guidance to the field that would also suggest a framework for the international community. Even providing complete footnotes (as opposed to mostly internal references) would be a great help to practitioners; it would give them a jumping-off point for filling in the substantive gaps left by the Manual.\nDoD seems to be committed to making online changes to the Manual, and has demonstrated some alacrity in doing so. The cyber operations chapter is a likely candidate for significant development in the near future, and we can hope that future revisions will provide more specific guidance on how the law applies, or does not apply, to the emerging area of cyberwarfare.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

    "__preamble__": "Gary D. Brown ## 1 INTRODUCTION One of the challenges in addressing the law applicable to cyberwarfare is apparent from a statement in the introduction to the Department of Defense (DoD) Law of War Manual (the Manual). Stephen Preston, who was at the time serving as DoD General Counsel, wrote that the manual “reflects the experience of this Department in applying the law of war in actual military operations, and it will help us remember the hard learned lessons from the past.”¹ Indeed, one indisputable advantage DoD brings to law of war discussions is concrete operational experience. No other organization is as practiced in actually applying the law of war in combat as well as a whole range of other operations. DoD has been involved in combat operations during most of its existence since its founding in 1947. There is no organization more experienced in kinetic warfare, and none better positioned to capture lessons learned.\nThat is not the case with regard to cyberwarfare, however, and the lack of lessons learned from operations is evident in the Manual’s treatment of cyberwarfare. Chapter XVI of the Manual, “Cyber Operations,” provides little in the way of useful guidance for cyber operations lawyers. Although they will be required to provide real-time legal advice on cyber operations, operations lawyers have no definitive sources and few references with sufficient depth to guide their endeavors. In that sense, the cyber operations chapter represents the most substantial shortfall between the Manual’s aspiration in support of US forces and its actuality. In any event, Chapter XVI is by far the shortest chapter of the Manual at only sixteen pages (one of which has only two words of text along with a footnote).\n¹ DoD Law of War Manual, ii.\nGary D. Brown Before discussing the text, a reflection on the underpinnings of Chapter XVI is in order. As noted above, acknowledged State-sponsored cyber operations are rare to non-existent, so there are few legal lessons to be gleaned from practice between contesting States. That leaves only government policy and academic study as starting points for the construction of a specific body of cyber operations law. In a choice starkly contrasting with the rest of the DoD Manual, the cyber operations chapter relies almost exclusively on two sources: a 1999 DoD Office of General Counsel legal assessment of\"information operations\"and a 2012 speech at the US Cyber Command Legal Conference delivered by the State Department Legal Advisor. Chapter XVI of the Manual has only 44 percent as many footnotes when compared to the next most lightly footnoted chapter. Even more striking, 98.8 percent of the footnotes cite either to the Manual itself or to internal US policy documents and speeches.\nOf particular note, the Manual avoids any mention of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which has been well-received by academics and governments since its original publication in 2013.³ As the Manual's footnotes are meant\"to help practitioners research particular topics discussed in the main text,\"references to at least some of the literature in the field would have been appropriate.⁴ That one of two foundational references dates from the last century and the other is a State Department speech considerably undermines the credibility of the chapter.",
    "## 2 OVERVIEW The broad scope of the DoD Manual is reflected in the statement of purpose, which is\"to provide information on the law of war to DoD personnel responsible for implementing the law of war and executing military operations.\"⁵ With that in mind, this commentary on the chapter\"Cyber Operations\"is organized according to the four most pressing issues that legal practitioners must address to provide proper legal advice to decision-makers: ³ DoD, Office of the General Counsel,\"An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations\"(2nd ed., Nov. 1999), repr. in 76 US Naval War College International Law Studies (2002); and H.

    "## 2.1 What Is Cyberwar?": "One of the key answers legal advisors must provide is whether proposed cyber operations would cross the threshold from peace to war. Although it may be outside the normal area of expertise of an operations legal advisor, they still must be prepared to grapple with the thorny issues of how cyber operations might contribute to, or even drive, a transition from peace to war. Because cyberspace by its nature is global, even those operations meant to be collecting tactical information or focused on a specific region can have far-reaching consequences. The intent of cyberspace operators is often difficult to discern, and internet-based operations cross many jurisdictions in making their way to the intended target. That means information-gathering might appear to be something more aggressive. In addition, States might feel compelled to defend their\"cyber-sovereignty\"even from incursions falling short of aggression. Either of these could motivate hostile actions in response, so discerning the distinction between normal cyber operations and those that might be interpreted as aggressive (or transgressive) is of critical importance.\nIn examining that decision space, national decision-makers often ask the question,\"Is this an act of war?\"⁶ This is a consideration of both States considering the wisdom of cyberspace activities, and States who are the victims of unfriendly cyber-acts. The term\"act of war\"is generally meant to be\"any act by a State that would effectively terminate the normal international law of peacetime and activate the international law ⁶ Although the phrase\"act of war\"is not a legal term, given the difficulties in determining what cyber-events cross the threshold of armed attack, it may be appropriate for States to note the importance of political considerations in their assessments of whether aggressive cyber-activities trigger the right of self-defense. As one cyber-expert puts it,\"calling something an act of war is not a conclusion; it is a decision.\"M. Libicki,\"An Act of War, Even Cyberwar, Is a Decision,\"New York Times (Feb. 28, 2013), www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/02/28/what-is-an-act-of-cyberwar/an-act-of-war-even-cyberwar-is-a-decision.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Gary D. Brown of war.”7 In modern usage, an act of war may be considered the equivalent of armed attack or, for the United States, a use of force.8 For cyber operations lawyers advising decision-makers it is appropriate to ask, as the DoD Manual does, whether a certain cyber-act is an unlawful use of force or an international armed attack.\nThe ultimate goal is determining which activity rises to a level that would justify a State’s use of force in self-defense.9 For most States, that would mean the cyber-activity would have to be an armed attack, which would trigger Article 51 of the UN Charter. The United States, however, has consistently asserted that the right of self-defense may be exercised based on a lower threshold: that of a use of force.10 Whichever standard is used, sorting out which cyber-activities would push States to armed conflict is difficult to describe in an abstract ex ante manner.\nThe Manual concludes that if a cyber-activity has kinetic results, it may lawfully be treated the same as if it were caused by non-cyber means. Thus, “if cyber operations cause effects that, if caused by traditional physical means, would be regarded as a use of force... then such cyber operations would likely also be regarded as a use of force.”11 The caveat of “likely” in the statement is critical. Cyber-means of warfare are not exempt from the application of international law, but the Manual suggests the application of the law is unsettled. In the kinetic realm, decades of history and precedent are available to study what States consider adequate to support armed self-defense. If the aggressor uses cyber-means, however, the US position is that the legal question cannot be answered merely based on the effects of the attack. States “must evaluate factors including the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action..., the target and location, effects and intent, among other possible issues” before determining whether the action constitutes a use of force.12 https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations States have not engaged in armed conflict premised only on cyber-aggression against financial institutions.¹⁴ Similarly, they will not, it seems, wage war over foreign actors establishing a persistent presence on industrial control systems controlling public utilities.¹⁵ State practice seems to be tilting in favor of negotiated agreements between States to refrain from such actions rather than recognizing the resort of armed retaliation. It is possible the non-response from States is because they lack good evidence connecting the actors to States, or even non-State armed groups.¹⁶ State norms and practice regarding cyberspace operations are rapidly forming and being refined. If the US position is that these activities would engender armed self-defense given ¹³ Ibid., ¶ 16.3.1.\n¹⁴ D. Volz and J.

Brown sufficient evidence of the actor, the DoD Manual would have offered an ideal opportunity to state and support that perspective. More likely, the US position is that many activities in this arena fall under the broad rubric of\"espionage,\"activities at which the US excels and does not wish to limit through the international legal structure.[17] Even stating that clearly would have been helpful to the practitioners who will rely on the Manual to form legal opinions in support of cyber operations.\nAnother weakness with the examples the Manual uses is that they are far too facile. A legal advisor with no previous experience in cyber operations could surely have determined that activities causing dams to fail and planes to crash would be international acts of aggression. These obvious examples provide little guidance to practitioners who must advise on where the line is drawn between cyberattacks and lesser cyber-insults. A single example, also from the 1999 paper, may provide more information about where the line between peace and war is drawn, but it is unclear exactly how it fits with the message of the chapter.\"[C]yber operations that cripple a military's logistics systems, and thus its ability to conduct and sustain military operations, might also be considered a use of force under jus ad bellum.\"[18] Compared to a nuclear meltdown and plane crashes, this type of operation seems almost benign.\nAlthough it is not clear what\"crippling\"a military logistics system means, the type of disruptive cyber-action that could be taken against an unclassified logistics system seems similar to the events in Estonia in 2007. In that case, government and economic websites, as well as internet infrastructure sites, were targeted with denial of service attacks that significantly impaired their functioning for three weeks.[19] The events in Estonia were not considered sufficient to support a claim of international self-defense.[20] This interpretation also seems to be a departure from US practice as stated in the Manual. In addition to the failure to react publicly to operations carried out against public utilities and financial systems, the US characterized the 2014 Sony hack, which stole massive amounts of data and was designed to corrupt or destroy more, as\"cyber-vandalism,\"explicitly characterizing it as an activity https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations Even if a cyber-activity is determined not to cross the armed attack/use of force threshold, victims are not without military recourse. The notion of cyber-countermeasures to respond to aggressive but sub-use of force cyber-actions has received significant attention in the international legal community, although it rates little more than a footnote in the chapter.²² Other than in the cyber chapter, the Manual refers to countermeasures as reprisals, which it defines as “acts taken against a party: (1) that would otherwise be unlawful; (2) in order to persuade that party to cease violating the law.”²³ In other words, if undertaken as a countermeasure, unlawful responsive cyber-measures are rendered legal if they remain below the level of a use of force, and are conducted for the purpose of ending the original unlawful activity.\nParagraph 16.3.3.3 of the Manual discusses countermeasures and retorsion together, emphasizing the availability of retorsive responses to cyber-insults, such as diplomatic measures.²⁴ Both are important concepts for cyber operations, but they are distinct. Retorsion in general is defined in paragraph 18.17 of the DoD Manual: “unfriendly conduct, (1) which is not inconsistent with any international obligation of the State engaging in it, and (2) which is done in response to an internationally wrongful act.” An understanding of both in the cyber context is especially critical because it is not always clear when an action in cyberspace is unlawful. When the law on the original action is unclear, responses may be phrased as equivalent; that is, if the initial action was lawful, ²¹ K.

Brown then the same thing done in return would be retorsion.²⁵ If the triggering action was unlawful, then the response would be a countermeasure, rendered lawful by its status.²⁶ ## 2.2 What Is Cyber-Spying?\nDetermining whether cyber-activities would cross the line from operations to espionage remains a difficult issue for cyber legal advisors. Espionage is generally unregulated under international law but, unlike in the physical world, espionage in cyberspace can be quite difficult to distinguish from the preparation for and conduct of more aggressive military operations.²⁷ The Manual notes that to the extent “cyber operations resemble traditional intelligence and counterintelligence activities, such as unauthorized intrusions into computer networks solely to acquire information, then such cyber operations would likely be treated similarly under international law.”²⁸ This would be more helpful if there were an easy way to ascertain the nature of the cyber-activity in the first place.\nWhether a cyber operation is undertaken for the purpose of espionage or military operations, it normally will require some penetration of the targeted system to gain access. Once access to the system is established, the aggressor might engage in espionage or attack. Even if the mission is espionage, the operator might leave behind malware to facilitate future access to the system, and that future event might be either an attack or spying. How should system penetrations be treated under the law when the actor's intent is unknown? How should pre-implanted capabilities be treated when they are discovered, especially on critical infrastructure or sensitive national security systems? If an espionage event goes wrong and results in accidental damage to a system, does it become an attack at that point? There may be no way for the victim of the event to determine the actor's intent, especially in a timely fashion.\n²⁵ For a discussion on the level of attribution required, see section 3.1 of this chapter.\n²⁶ Not discussed in the Manual is the plea of necessity, which term “is used to denote those exceptional cases where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency.” Draft Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 25, http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf.\n²⁷ “[T]he international legal system generally imposes no sanctions upon nations for acts of espionage except for the political costs of public denunciation.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 18.21.2 fn. 305.

    "## 2.3 What Is a Cyberattack?": "Although it is not immediately apparent, the issue of what cyber-activity constitutes an attack in the context of armed conflict is a critical one. US military legal advisors take for granted that the principles of the law of war – distinction, proportionality, humanity, and military necessity – all apply during armed conflict.²⁹ With regard to kinetic attacks, of course, these principles do apply. The challenge with wartime cyber operations is that they can be quite disruptive without being destructive. Legal advisors must be able to distinguish operations that must refrain from targeting civilian objects, for example, and those that fall below the attack threshold.\nThe cyber operations chapter takes note of the issue in a general way, pointing to paragraph 5.4 for details on how attacks are covered by the law of armed conflict (LOAC). That paragraph iterates that attacks must be carried out in compliance with the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions, but paragraph 16.5.2 notes with some circularity that “[a] cyber operation that does not constitute an attack is not restricted by the rules that apply to attacks.” It goes on to give examples of operations that would not constitute attacks: defacing government web pages; briefly disrupting internet service in a minor way; briefly disrupting, disabling, or interfering with communications; or disseminating propaganda. Unfortunately, these examples do little to draw the line between aggressive, non-attack cyber-activity and activity that would qualify as an attack. For example, do the qualifications in the examples mean that DoD would label a brief disruption of internet service in\n²⁹ See Ray Murphy’s contribution to this book in Chapter 7. Chapter II of the DoD Manual lists the principles of the law of war as military necessity, humanity, proportionality, distinction, and honor. The principle of honor seems particularly attenuated from cyberwarfare; it is not discussed in the Manual with reference to cyberwarfare, and will be omitted here, as well.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\na major way an attack? Further, it is unclear that the principles of LOAC apply to any cyber-activity that stops short of causing damage, destruction, or injury. This gap in the law has led some experts to suggest that LOAC ought to apply to cyber operations that affect the functionality of computer systems without actually damaging them.³⁰\nThe Manual states “[i]f a cyber operation constitutes an attack, then the law of war rules on conducting attacks must be applied to those cyber operations.”³¹ Of course, this invites the question of what constitutes an attack. Operational legal advisors who consult the manual for guidance on this question will learn that wartime operations that destroy computers are attacks.³² While this is true, it is also the simplest case – kinetic effects directly caused by cyber operations clearly are attacks. On the more difficult questions of whether loss of functionality of a computer system, without damage to it, is an attack, or whether harm significantly attenuated from the original event, would similarly constitute an attack, the Manual is silent.³³\nAfter identifying the way cyberwarfare techniques might not be governed by the principles of the law of war, the Manual suggests that the case is not closed. “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.”³⁴ This seems to contradict an earlier statement in the Manual, and may be read as *lex ferenda* rather than an articulation of the law.³⁵ Legal advisors who rely on the Manual for guidance would be better served if the Manual made clear this is a US policy rather than the law. The United States might well put such policy restrictions in its own rules of engagement, but if it is meant to be read as a restriction grounded in law, the Manual should have provided some affirmative authority for this belief.\nIn a legal advisor’s analysis of whether a cyber-activity constitutes an attack, the Manual notes the importance of considering whether the effects created\n³⁰ See M. N. Schmitt, “Rewired Warfare: Rethinking the Law of Cyber Attack” (2014) 96(893) *International Review of the Red Cross* 189, www.icrc.org/en/international-review/article/rewired-warfare-rethinking-law-cyber-attack; and C.

The cautious approach regarding cyber-capabilities is perhaps not what one would expect when cyberwarfare seems less likely than kinetic means to cause civilian casualties and damage. Nevertheless, when the Manual assesses the application of the principle of proportionality to kinetic attacks, it specifically excludes any inconvenience to civilians from consideration, noting that such ancillary aspects of a military attack “need not be considered.”³⁶ In contrast, the Manual mandates consideration of “civilian inconvenience” even in cyber operations that are too minor to be considered attacks under the law of war. It is logically inconsistent – and not a reflection of international law – to require no consideration of inconvenience before conducting a lethal attack, but to require that higher standard before a non-lethal cyber-action aiming to achieve the same result, such as disrupting military communications over a dual-use network node.³⁷ If this is US policy, it ought to be set out as policy, and could be reflected in rules of engagement, but it is potentially confusing to cyber operators who refer to the Manual as a source of law.\nAlthough not listed as one of the distinctive principles of the law of war in the Manual, the cyber operations chapter discusses the obligation of precautions. There are two precautions-related requirements under generalized LOAC. The first is precautions in the attack, which requires States, when engaging in an attack, to take all feasible steps to minimize harm to the civilian ³⁶ Ibid., ¶ 5.12.1.2.\n³⁷ “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack,’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.” Ibid., ¶ 16.5.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Gary D. Brown population.³⁸ The second is precautions against the effects of attacks, which requires States to “take other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.”³⁹ This second might be thought of as an obligation of defenders to ensure that military and strategic objects are not commingled with civilian objects in a way that would make it impossible for attackers to distinguish between the two.\nFor the reasons discussed above, precautions in the attack is not a particularly intriguing topic in a cyber-specific context. Cyber-events not qualifying as attacks are not covered by this provision of law, and those that are attacks present the same issues as traditional kinetic warfare. While it is true that destructive cyberattacks could result in the loss of civilian access to internet-based services, for example, so might kinetic attacks. Bombing or destroying bridges and electrical power infrastructure, often part of traditional military campaigns, also frequently results in loss of connectivity due to broken communications lines and lack of power. The consideration of these ancillary civilian effects is the same whether the instrumentality is cyber or kinetic.\nBy contrast, cyberspace operations present a unique opportunity to apply the principle obligating defenders to avoid commingling civilian and military objects. The cyber-infrastructure States use for military and national security missions is the same as that used for civilian activities from personal communications to providing essential utilities such as electricity and water. It might be argued that in choosing to commingle civilian and military capabilities on a single infrastructure, States all violated the defensive application of precautions, leaving the internet more susceptible to attack as a dual-use target.\nIn the cyber context, Manual paragraph 16.5.3 proclaims that “[p]arties to a conflict must take feasible precautions to reduce the risk of incidental harm to the civilian population and other protected persons and objects.” It is unclear why the two aspects of precautions would be conflated in the cyber chapter. For clarity, the cyber-precautions provisions should track the language in AP I and in the other provisions of the Manual.\n³⁸ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of Aug. 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 (AP I), Art. 57. “Combatants must take feasible precautions in planning and conducting attacks to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and other persons and objects protected from being made the object of attack.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.11.\n³⁹ AP I, Art. 58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations Both international and US law require that weapons be reviewed for legal compliance before they may be acquired or used. AP I codifies the requirement to conduct legal reviews of weapons.⁴⁰ The United States is not a party to AP I, but its practice of conducting legal reviews of weapons is consistent with the requirement, and predated AP I.⁴¹ DoD requires that weapons reviews determine whether a proposed weapon's intended use is calculated to cause superfluous injury, whether it is inherently indiscriminate, and whether it is specifically prohibited, for example by treaty.⁴² Cyberspace operations have introduced new challenges in complying with what is ordinarily a straightforward provision of law. Recognizing that cyberweapons must be subjected to a legal review before acquisition or use does not answer the question of what, exactly, a cyberweapon is. In the case of more traditional weapons, it is generally straightforward to recognize that something is a weapon. Defining\"cyberweapon,\"on the other hand, can be quite tricky. It is difficult to know how to define cyberweapons, as the Manual recognizes:\"Not all cyber capabilities... constitute a weapon or weapons system.\"⁴³ Nearly every function of a modern military is at least supported by cyber capabilities. Logistics, medical processes, communications, etc. are all highly dependent on computers and networks, yet those particular capabilities would not be classified as weapons. In the case of offensive capabilities, computers, networks, and servers might all be considered part of a cyberweapons system, and legal reviews of the hardware would be straightforward (and pointless, because the same equipment can be used to support civilian and defensive functions). The heart of a cyber-capability is the code on which it is based, and the Manual offers little practical guidance on the proper classification of malware or other commonly encountered cyber techniques.\nRather than take on the difficult task of providing a basis for determining whether a cyber-capability is a weapon, the Manual punts, noting that the military services address which cyber-capabilities require legal reviews. This would be more helpful if the services actually did address the issue. The pertinent Army regulation is dated 1979, and the Navy's 2011 regulation lacks cyber-specific language. Only the Air Force has addressed the issues ⁴⁰ AP I, Art. 36.\n⁴¹ The Defense Acquisition System, DoD Directive 5000.1, ¶ E1.1.15 (certified current Nov. 20, 2007); DoD Manual, ¶ 6.2.3.\n⁴² DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 6.2.2. ⁴³ Ibid., ¶ 16.6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Gary D. Brown surrounding cyberweapons specifically, so its instruction provides the DoD guidance by default.⁴⁴ The Air Force defines “weapons” as “devices designed to kill, injure, disable or temporarily incapacitate people, or destroy, damage or temporarily incapacitate property or materiel.”⁴⁵ The Air Force instruction also defines a “cyber capability” as “any device or software payload intended to disrupt, deny, degrade, negate, impair or destroy adversarial computer systems, data, activities or capabilities,” but excludes “a device or software that is solely intended to provide access to an adversarial computer system for data exploitation.”⁴⁶ The Air Force directs that “all cyber capabilities being developed, bought, built, modified or otherwise acquired by the Air Force... are reviewed for legality under LOAC, domestic law and international law prior to their acquisition for use in a conflict or other military operation.”⁴⁷ Unlike kinetic means of warfare, cyber means largely consist of intellectual property in the form of computer code. Physical weapons must be designed and manufactured, so changes tend to be infrequent. In contrast, computer code may be changed instantly and easily. It is often altered multiple times in the course of an operation.⁴⁸ The practical problem created is that it appears dozens or hundreds of legal reviews might be required for a single cyber capability.\nAn alternate view of the problem is provided in the Tallinn Manual, which addresses the question of what constitutes a cyberweapon in rule 103. “[C]yber weapons are ‘cyber means of warfare’ that are used, designed, or intended to be used to cause injury to, or death of, persons or damage to, or destruction of, objects, that is, that result in the consequences required for qualification of a cyber operation as an attack.”⁴⁹ In the Tallinn Manual cyberattack is defined as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁰ DoD could consider adopting a modified version of this definition, making a simple change: “design, use, or intended use reasonably capable of causing.” This change would exclude imaginable but remote possibilities of harm that exist with every computer program, but would continue to create ⁴⁴ Whether weapons reviews are controlled by international law or by US policy, it would be preferable to have a single interpretation from DoD, rather than potentially conflicting interpretations provided by individual services.\n⁴⁵ AFI 51-402, Legal Reviews of Weapons and Cyber Capabilities (July 27, 2011), 6.\n⁴⁶ Ibid., 5. ⁴⁷ Ibid., para 1.1.2.\n⁴⁸ See discussion in G.

The Manual provides no guidance to help determine what “inherently indiscriminate” means with regard to a cyber-capability. Malware is often spread indiscriminately but may by design have no significant negative effect on untargeted computer systems. Malware may use untargeted systems as vectors to reach its intended target, where it might have great effect. This was the case, for example, in the Stuxnet incident, where malware was spread to over 100,000 computers, but had no significant effects until it reached the computer system at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, where it destroyed over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges.⁵² The Manual takes no position on whether inert code copied indiscriminately and without permission to the hard drives of thousands of computers makes use of that malware unlawful. Based on the extant State practice to date, the answer is probably “no,” but the Manual would be a good vehicle for putting the issue to rest.\nCyber “weaponry” is a controversial issue in the larger national security community, as well. The tools and vulnerabilities necessary to conduct computer- and network-based operations for national security missions can also be used against civilian systems in support of intelligence and criminal activity. The US Government has a process to determine whether cyber-vulnerabilities should be disclosed in order to protect the public or held as part of the cyberarsenal to be used in support of national security.⁵³ Some citizen groups argue that States have an obligation to disclose cyber-vulnerabilities they discover so the public can protect themselves from exploitation.⁵⁴ States have been less keen to recognize that there is such an obligation, as it would essentially ⁵¹ One way to handle the espionage/operations overlap on this issue is to simply exclude espionage tools by intent. Another way would be to accept that weapons can be used in espionage in ways that are not attacks, such as using a machete to cut through vegetation on a fence line. The operation should be analyzed by its effects rather than by its means.\n⁵² K. Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day (New York: Broadway Books, 2014), 96, 175.\n⁵³ A. Schwartz and R.

For example, the Wassenaar Arrangement, developed to control the transfer of arms and dual-use technologies, was amended in 2013 to include some cyber-capabilities.⁵⁵ One of the new prohibited categories is intrusion software, which is software “specially designed or modified to avoid detection by ‘monitoring tools’, or to defeat ‘protective countermeasures’, of a computer or network capable device, and performing [data extraction, data modification, or installation of malware].” The intent of the language was to keep powerful computer tools out of the hands of repressive regimes, but the additions also prevented university researchers and law-abiding cyber-intrusion specialists from properly conducting research, because they were unable to share code across national borders.⁵⁶ Given the range of complex issues surrounding cyberweapons, some indication of the appropriate direction here would have been useful not just to US practitioners, but also to other States that look to the United States for leadership in international law, and particularly value the DoD role in clarifying LOAC. DoD has more experience than any organization in the world at assessing weapons for compliance with international law. It may be as befuddled as everyone about how to define and assess cyber weapons, but setting a single DoD policy, even an imperfect one, would have been a superior course than leaving the issue to be determined by individuals across the US services and the international community, perhaps in very different ways.",

Because of the internet's architecture and operation, concealing the identity and location of actors is relatively simple, while discovering the same can be an expensive and time-consuming process that often fails to deliver a certain answer.⁵⁷ The Manual says but little about attribution, merely noting that it is difficult. If the goal of the Manual is to be useful to practitioners, this is a section that could be more complete. For example, there is no indication of what level of proof should be required for various responses.\nThe Tallinn Manual offers the guidance that, while pinpointing the origin of an attack does not mean the State owner of the infrastructure is responsible for the attack, it does provide a sort of rebuttable presumption that the host State is responsible.⁵⁸ And, although there is no set standard of proof necessary to engage in countermeasures, the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility notes that the standard for attribution in such cases is\"reasonable certainty.\"⁵⁹ Legal advisors are not starting from scratch when determining the appropriate standard to apply; international law does provide guidance that is helpful, even in the new area of cyber operations. It would be useful for this standard, at least, to be referenced in the Manual.",
    "## 3.2 Neutrality Neutrality plays a limited role in the cyberspace context. Neutrality under the law of war only applies during international armed conflict and conflicts between States have become very much the exception. Non-international armed conflict (NIAC) is common, however, and aggressive cyber-activities in support of NIAC, and in support of sub-armed conflict State activity, is common.⁶⁰ The Manual's discussion of when neutrality principles apply is ⁵⁷ Even in two high-profile instances where the US Government asserted attribution was certain, controversy about the identity of the culprits continued for months.

Brown based on both the 1907 Hague Convention and on the opinion of international legal experts.⁶¹ Of particular note, the chapter in the Manual addressing the law of neutrality is silent with respect to cyber operations. In DoD’s interpretation, some principles of neutrality apply in NIACs, although beyond respecting sovereignty, which is a principle of international law independent of neutrality, it is unclear which specific principles apply to belligerents in such conflicts.⁶² With regard to non-participating States in NIACs, the Manual cites the UN General Assembly: “Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.”⁶³ At some point, such activities would result in the offending State becoming a party to the conflict, converting it to an international armed conflict (IAC), so the Manual is apparently citing the language to capture relatively low-level, indirect assistance.⁶⁴ In any event, the Manual suggests that nonbelligerent States in NIACs should refrain from “acquiescing in organized activities” within their territories when the activities are directed to acts of civil strife or terrorism.\nThe Manual suggests a contrasting approach in the cyber context, asserting that a State’s neutrality (a term that appears to be used in this chapter to refer to both neutral States and, unconventionally, to nonparticipating States in NIACs) is not dependent on whether it polices its cyber-infrastructure, as long as it does not take steps to discriminate among users of its infrastructure. The Manual explicitly notes that even if data could be characterized as a cyber weapon or otherwise could cause destructive effects in a belligerent State, relaying it would not impact a State’s status as a neutral.\nThe disconnect here is probably more about trying to govern cyberspace with a treaty over a hundred years old than it is about neutrality. The Manual fails to take into account that aggressive computer code, in the form of data packets transmitted over the internet, can be the actual means of waging war, not merely communications about waging war, which is what Hague V was meant to address. There is little logical distinction between allowing the transmission of a virtual attack across neutral infrastructure and allowing the ⁶¹ DoD Law of War Manual, § 15.2.1 and Chapter XVII fn. 211. ⁶² Ibid., § 15.2.1.3.\n⁶³ Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, annex to UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV), UN Doc.

U.S. (ICJ, 1986).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations The Tallinn Manual takes a different approach to cyber-neutrality, with most of the experts opining that a State would violate its status as a neutral if it knowingly allowed the transmission of a cyberweapon across infrastructure it controlled.⁶⁵ The application of neutrality in cyberspace as set out in the DoD Manual is problematic because the United States appears to support the assertion of the rights of national sovereignty by States hosting internet infrastructure, but not the normal responsibilities of a sovereign. If States do have sovereign rights over code passing through internet infrastructure located in their territory, they ought to have the responsibility to ensure the code they host is doing no harm. Otherwise, the host State is essentially protecting cyber-aggressors from effective action by victim States, which is inconsistent with the application of neutrality in the physical world.⁶⁶ The ultimate conclusion may be left to whether States decide packets of information making up cyber-means of warfare are more akin to communications or to weapons.⁶⁷ ## 3.3 Perfidy and Protective Emblems The issue of perfidy has limited practical application in cyberwarfare, but it frequently comes up in conversations with cyber operators. The issue is briefly discussed in the Manual under “Improper Use of Signs.”⁶⁸ International law prohibits using perfidy to kill, injure, or capture an adversary.⁶⁹ Perfidy is widely understood as “[a]cts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to receive, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the ⁶⁵ Tallinn Manual, rule 152.\n⁶⁶ “These sources make clear that neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent.” A. S. Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense” (2012) 52(3) Virginia Journal of International Law 499, www.vjil.org%2Fassets%2Fpdfs%2Fvol52%2Fissue3%2FDeeks_Post_Production.pdf.\n⁶⁷ On the other hand, States could also have determined that military aircraft crossing neutral territory are permitted, as long as they are only delivering messages. Instead, the mission of the aircraft appears to be irrelevant.\n⁶⁸ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.24. Misuse of protective emblems, treachery, and perfidy are often discussed together, and often (if inaccurately) grouped together as perfidy. As perfidy is the most common of the terms in the operations community, it is used as the section title here.\n⁶⁹ AP I, Art. 37(1). The United States asserts that customary international law prohibits only killing or injuring by means of perfidy, a position shared by the Tallinn experts. DoD Manual, para. 5.22; Tallinn Manual, rule 60(2).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Gary D. Brown intent to betray that confidence.”⁷⁰ To be perfidious, a cyber operation would have to both rely on feigning legal protection and proximately result in death or injury (or capture under the international formulation).⁷¹ For example, an email falsely claiming to be from the International Committee of the Red Cross that successfully lured enemy troops to an armed ambush that resulted in their deaths would constitute perfidy.⁷² One might also imagine a similar false email that escaped electronic scrutiny because of its purported protected sender that, when opened, introduced malware into the adversary network. If that malware directly led to death or injury – by causing a catastrophic failure of a military installation’s power plant, for example – it would be an example of perfidy. If death or injury did not result, it would still be an example of a misuse of a protective emblem.\nThe Manual also states it would be inappropriate to use “communications that initiate non-hostile relations, such as prisoner exchanges or ceasefires” to gain entry into an enemy’s computer network.⁷³ The Manual’s support for this proposition is limited to cross-referencing other provisions in the Manual. While the United States may determine this is a good practice, such ruses are not prohibited under LOAC.⁷⁴ Similarly, the DoD Manual asserts “it would be prohibited to fabricate messages from an enemy’s Head of State falsely informing that State’s forces that an armistice or cease-fire had been signed.”⁷⁵ This, like the prior paragraph’s suggestion that perfidy prohibits false communications that initiate non-hostile relations, is inconsistent with established international law. Such practices may not be good policy, but they are not illegal. According to the 1977 International Red Cross (ICRC) Commentary on Additional Protocol I “the central element of the definition of perfidy is the deliberate claim to legal protection for hostile purposes,” which these lack.⁷⁶ There are arguments to the contrary but, as unchivalrous as these situations may be, they do not meet the definition of perfidy.⁷⁷ Cyber operations can be the most effective method of disseminating and obtaining information, so the portions of LOAC related to information are ⁷⁰ AP I, Art. 37(1). ⁷¹ Tallinn Manual, rule 122(3).\n⁷² This is an adaptation of an example from the Tallinn Manual, rule 122(5).\n⁷³ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.4. ⁷⁴ Ibid., ¶¶ 12.2, 5.21. ⁷⁵ Ibid., ¶ 16.5.4.\n⁷⁶ ICRC, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 (7), 429, www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/RC_commentary-1977.html.\n⁷⁷ See S.

AP I requires that medical units and transports be marked as such.78 The Tallinn Manual opined that the marking and protection obligations extend to “[c]omputers, computer networks, and data that form an integral part of the operations or administration of medical units and transports.”79 The DoD Manual is silent on the issue, but it is one that merits consideration and decision so that it can be uniformly implemented. This would help ensure the protection of medical data and protect against accidental misuse of the protective emblem.",
    "## 3.4 Civilians as Combatants The DoD Manual succinctly summarizes the law on civilian employees’ involvement in cyberwarfare. Civilian employees are permitted to directly participate in hostilities (DPH), but they forfeit any protection they would receive as civilians during the participation. There may be political or other policy rationales for preventing civilians from acting as cyber “trigger-pullers,” but it is permissible under LOAC. One reason DoD is comfortable with this broad reading of appropriate civilian conduct may be that cyberwarfare tends to be conducted from a distance, so there is less concern about increasing the chance that other, non-participating civilians could be mistaken for lawful targets.": "",
    "## 4 CONCLUSION This chapter of the Commentary has focused more on developments of the law and shortcomings in the Manual than some other chapters. That is because, despite the lessons learned over many years of armed conflict about how the law of war should apply to best protect civilians and prevent unnecessary suffering, there are gaps in its practical application to cyberwarfare. As noted above, many questions remain about exactly how the law should apply to operations in cyberspace, yet the disruptive and destructive https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Gary D. Brown capabilities and vulnerabilities available to cyber-actors are increasingly being acknowledged. State custom, practice, and norms are being created rapidly, as well, more through inaction than action. The cyber operations chapter in the Manual offered an opportunity for the United States to guide both the present and the future of cyber operations law, but DoD chose not to grasp it.": "Although DoD minimizes the role of military manuals in the development of international law, noting specifically in the DoD Manual that the views\"do not necessarily reflect the views of [other federal agencies] or the US Government as a whole,\"any information the United States provides will carry great weight.80 States are hungry for guidance on how the law of war applies to cyberwarfare, and the US owns the most important voice in the field. This may be why DoD was reluctant to take a bolder stand on the key issues that matter to coalition partners and experts in the field, but it also carries the risk that others, who may not share the interests of the United States with respect to ensuring freedoms of expression and association, may succeed in filling in the gaps.81 In the absence of official guidance, academic works carry more than their usual weight, as well, and the musings of academics are less likely to be constrained by practicality. It would be in DoD's selfish interest to encourage a practical body of law that supports military operations, rather than an idealistic set of pronouncements that will be ignored.\nThe most critical failing of the cyber operations chapter is that it offers no useful ideas on how to apply international law, or even US policy, to the most likely cyber-scenarios. Although military cyberspace operations are in their infancy, useful examples could have been drawn from a short list of real-world events. Cyber-incidents in Estonia (2007), the Republic of Georgia (2008), Iran (2009), and Saudi Arabia (2012) are just a few examples that might have been used to walk through various issues in a way relevant for operations lawyers.82 More recently, Russia's alleged use of cyber-methods to disseminate https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations There remain many unanswered questions regarding the law governing cyberwarfare. The brevity and lack of specificity in the chapter may be an indication that DoD believes the law is insufficiently developed for it to provide guidance. Unfortunately, discomfort with the state of the law does not remove the responsibility of government legal advisors, who are the target audience of the Manual and must provide advice on cyber operations with or without legal direction from the manual. Even if the area is changing rapidly, it would be useful for DoD to provide more complete guidance to the field that would also suggest a framework for the international community. Even providing complete footnotes (as opposed to mostly internal references) would be a great help to practitioners; it would give them a jumping-off point for filling in the substantive gaps left by the Manual.\nDoD seems to be committed to making online changes to the Manual, and has demonstrated some alacrity in doing so. The cyber operations chapter is a likely candidate for significant development in the near future, and we can hope that future revisions will provide more specific guidance on how the law applies, or does not apply, to the emerging area of cyberwarfare.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

Brown\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\nOne of the challenges in addressing the law applicable to cyberwarfare is apparent from a statement in the introduction to the Department of Defense (DoD) Law of War Manual (the Manual). Stephen Preston, who was at the time serving as DoD General Counsel, wrote that the manual “reflects the experience of this Department in applying the law of war in actual military operations, and it will help us remember the hard learned lessons from the past.” Indeed, one indisputable advantage DoD brings to law of war discussions is concrete operational experience. No other organization is as practiced in actually applying the law of war in combat as well as a whole range of other operations. DoD has been involved in combat operations during most of its existence since its founding in 1947. There is no organization more experienced in kinetic warfare, and none better positioned to capture lessons learned.\nThat is not the case with regard to cyberwarfare, however, and the lack of lessons learned from operations is evident in the Manual’s treatment of cyberwarfare. Chapter XVI of the Manual, “Cyber Operations,” provides little in the way of useful guidance for cyber operations lawyers. Although they will be required to provide real-time legal advice on cyber operations, operations lawyers have no definitive sources and few references with sufficient depth to guide their endeavors. In that sense, the cyber operations chapter represents the most substantial shortfall between the Manual’s aspiration in support of US forces and its actuality. In any event, Chapter XVI is by far the shortest chapter of the Manual at only sixteen pages (one of which has only two words of text along with a footnote).\n DoD Law of War Manual, ii.\n\nGary D. Brown\nBefore discussing the text, a reflection on the underpinnings of Chapter XVI is in order. As noted above, acknowledged State-sponsored cyber operations are rare to non-existent, so there are few legal lessons to be gleaned from practice between contesting States. That leaves only government policy and academic study as starting points for the construction of a specific body of cyber operations law. In a choice starkly contrasting with the rest of the DoD Manual, the cyber operations chapter relies almost exclusively on two sources: a 1999 DoD Office of General Counsel legal assessment of \"information operations\" and a 2012 speech at the US Cyber Command Legal Conference delivered by the State Department Legal Advisor. Chapter XVI of the Manual has only 44 percent as many footnotes when compared to the next most lightly footnoted chapter. Even more striking, 98.8 percent of the footnotes cite either to the Manual itself or to internal US policy documents and speeches.\nOf particular note, the Manual avoids any mention of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which has been well-received by academics and governments since its original publication in 2013. As the Manual's footnotes are meant \"to help practitioners research particular topics discussed in the main text,\" references to at least some of the literature in the field would have been appropriate. That one of two foundational references dates from the last century and the other is a State Department speech considerably undermines the credibility of the chapter.\n## 2 OVERVIEW\nThe broad scope of the DoD Manual is reflected in the statement of purpose, which is \"to provide information on the law of war to DoD personnel responsible for implementing the law of war and executing military operations.\" With that in mind, this commentary on the chapter \"Cyber Operations\" is organized according to the four most pressing issues that legal practitioners must address to provide proper legal advice to decision-makers:\n DoD, Office of the General Counsel, \"An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations\" (2nd ed., Nov. 1999), repr. in 76 US Naval War College International Law Studies (2002); and H. H. Koh, Legal Advisor, Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace, \"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference\" (Sept. 18, 2012), repr. in 54 Harvard International Law Journal Online (Dec. 2012), 3, www.harvardilj.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Koh-Speech-to-Publish1.pdf. About half of the footnotes are to other portions of the DoD Manual.\n Since the publication of the DoD Manual, the Tallinn Manual has been updated to version 2.0, published in 2017. The references in the remainder of this chapter as to the 2017 edition.\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 1.2.2.  Ibid., ¶ 1.2.1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\n2. What is cyberspying?\n3. What is a cyberattack?\n4. What is a cyberweapon?\nSet out below is a discussion of why these questions are critical, and how well the Manual does as a reference for those who will be providing legal advice on military and other government cyber operations.\n## 2.1 What Is Cyberwar?\nOne of the key answers legal advisors must provide is whether proposed cyber operations would cross the threshold from peace to war. Although it may be outside the normal area of expertise of an operations legal advisor, they still must be prepared to grapple with the thorny issues of how cyber operations might contribute to, or even drive, a transition from peace to war. Because cyberspace by its nature is global, even those operations meant to be collecting tactical information or focused on a specific region can have far-reaching consequences. The intent of cyberspace operators is often difficult to discern, and internet-based operations cross many jurisdictions in making their way to the intended target. That means information-gathering might appear to be something more aggressive. In addition, States might feel compelled to defend their \"cyber-sovereignty\" even from incursions falling short of aggression. Either of these could motivate hostile actions in response, so discerning the distinction between normal cyber operations and those that might be interpreted as aggressive (or transgressive) is of critical importance.\nIn examining that decision space, national decision-makers often ask the question, \"Is this an act of war?\" This is a consideration of both States considering the wisdom of cyberspace activities, and States who are the victims of unfriendly cyber-acts. The term \"act of war\" is generally meant to be \"any act by a State that would effectively terminate the normal international law of peacetime and activate the international law\n Although the phrase \"act of war\" is not a legal term, given the difficulties in determining what cyber-events cross the threshold of armed attack, it may be appropriate for States to note the importance of political considerations in their assessments of whether aggressive cyber-activities trigger the right of self-defense. As one cyber-expert puts it, \"calling something an act of war is not a conclusion; it is a decision.\" M. Libicki, \"An Act of War, Even Cyberwar, Is a Decision,\" New York Times (Feb. 28, 2013), www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/02/28/what-is-an-act-of-cyberwar/an-act-of-war-even-cyberwar-is-a-decision.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nof war.”7 In modern usage, an act of war may be considered the equivalent of armed attack or, for the United States, a use of force.8 For cyber operations lawyers advising decision-makers it is appropriate to ask, as the DoD Manual does, whether a certain cyber-act is an unlawful use of force or an international armed attack.\nThe ultimate goal is determining which activity rises to a level that would justify a State’s use of force in self-defense.9 For most States, that would mean the cyber-activity would have to be an armed attack, which would trigger Article 51 of the UN Charter. The United States, however, has consistently asserted that the right of self-defense may be exercised based on a lower threshold: that of a use of force.10 Whichever standard is used, sorting out which cyber-activities would push States to armed conflict is difficult to describe in an abstract ex ante manner.\nThe Manual concludes that if a cyber-activity has kinetic results, it may lawfully be treated the same as if it were caused by non-cyber means. Thus, “if cyber operations cause effects that, if caused by traditional physical means, would be regarded as a use of force . . . then such cyber operations would likely also be regarded as a use of force.”11 The caveat of “likely” in the statement is critical. Cyber-means of warfare are not exempt from the application of international law, but the Manual suggests the application of the law is unsettled. In the kinetic realm, decades of history and precedent are available to study what States consider adequate to support armed self-defense. If the aggressor uses cyber-means, however, the US position is that the legal question cannot be answered merely based on the effects of the attack. States “must evaluate factors including the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action . . ., the target and location, effects and intent, among other possible issues” before determining whether the action constitutes a use of force.12\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nStates have not engaged in armed conflict premised only on cyber-aggression against financial institutions. Similarly, they will not, it seems, wage war over foreign actors establishing a persistent presence on industrial control systems controlling public utilities. State practice seems to be tilting in favor of negotiated agreements between States to refrain from such actions rather than recognizing the resort of armed retaliation. It is possible the non-response from States is because they lack good evidence connecting the actors to States, or even non-State armed groups. State norms and practice regarding cyberspace operations are rapidly forming and being refined. If the US position is that these activities would engender armed self-defense given\n Ibid., ¶ 16.3.1.\n D. Volz and J.

Brown\nsufficient evidence of the actor, the DoD Manual would have offered an ideal opportunity to state and support that perspective. More likely, the US position is that many activities in this arena fall under the broad rubric of \"espionage,\" activities at which the US excels and does not wish to limit through the international legal structure.[17] Even stating that clearly would have been helpful to the practitioners who will rely on the Manual to form legal opinions in support of cyber operations.\nAnother weakness with the examples the Manual uses is that they are far too facile. A legal advisor with no previous experience in cyber operations could surely have determined that activities causing dams to fail and planes to crash would be international acts of aggression. These obvious examples provide little guidance to practitioners who must advise on where the line is drawn between cyberattacks and lesser cyber-insults. A single example, also from the 1999 paper, may provide more information about where the line between peace and war is drawn, but it is unclear exactly how it fits with the message of the chapter. \"[C]yber operations that cripple a military's logistics systems, and thus its ability to conduct and sustain military operations, might also be considered a use of force under jus ad bellum.\"[18] Compared to a nuclear meltdown and plane crashes, this type of operation seems almost benign.\nAlthough it is not clear what \"crippling\" a military logistics system means, the type of disruptive cyber-action that could be taken against an unclassified logistics system seems similar to the events in Estonia in 2007. In that case, government and economic websites, as well as internet infrastructure sites, were targeted with denial of service attacks that significantly impaired their functioning for three weeks.[19] The events in Estonia were not considered sufficient to support a claim of international self-defense.[20] This interpretation also seems to be a departure from US practice as stated in the Manual. In addition to the failure to react publicly to operations carried out against public utilities and financial systems, the US characterized the 2014 Sony hack, which stole massive amounts of data and was designed to corrupt or destroy more, as \"cyber-vandalism,\" explicitly characterizing it as an activity\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nEven if a cyber-activity is determined not to cross the armed attack/use of force threshold, victims are not without military recourse. The notion of cyber-countermeasures to respond to aggressive but sub-use of force cyber-actions has received significant attention in the international legal community, although it rates little more than a footnote in the chapter. Other than in the cyber chapter, the Manual refers to countermeasures as reprisals, which it defines as “acts taken against a party: (1) that would otherwise be unlawful; (2) in order to persuade that party to cease violating the law.” In other words, if undertaken as a countermeasure, unlawful responsive cyber-measures are rendered legal if they remain below the level of a use of force, and are conducted for the purpose of ending the original unlawful activity.\nParagraph 16.3.3.3 of the Manual discusses countermeasures and retorsion together, emphasizing the availability of retorsive responses to cyber-insults, such as diplomatic measures. Both are important concepts for cyber operations, but they are distinct. Retorsion in general is defined in paragraph 18.17 of the DoD Manual: “unfriendly conduct, (1) which is not inconsistent with any international obligation of the State engaging in it, and (2) which is done in response to an internationally wrongful act.” An understanding of both in the cyber context is especially critical because it is not always clear when an action in cyberspace is unlawful. When the law on the original action is unclear, responses may be phrased as equivalent; that is, if the initial action was lawful,\n K.

If the triggering action was unlawful, then the response would be a countermeasure, rendered lawful by its status.\n## 2.2 What Is Cyber-Spying?\nDetermining whether cyber-activities would cross the line from operations to espionage remains a difficult issue for cyber legal advisors. Espionage is generally unregulated under international law but, unlike in the physical world, espionage in cyberspace can be quite difficult to distinguish from the preparation for and conduct of more aggressive military operations. The Manual notes that to the extent “cyber operations resemble traditional intelligence and counterintelligence activities, such as unauthorized intrusions into computer networks solely to acquire information, then such cyber operations would likely be treated similarly under international law.” This would be more helpful if there were an easy way to ascertain the nature of the cyber-activity in the first place.\nWhether a cyber operation is undertaken for the purpose of espionage or military operations, it normally will require some penetration of the targeted system to gain access. Once access to the system is established, the aggressor might engage in espionage or attack. Even if the mission is espionage, the operator might leave behind malware to facilitate future access to the system, and that future event might be either an attack or spying. How should system penetrations be treated under the law when the actor's intent is unknown? How should pre-implanted capabilities be treated when they are discovered, especially on critical infrastructure or sensitive national security systems? If an espionage event goes wrong and results in accidental damage to a system, does it become an attack at that point? There may be no way for the victim of the event to determine the actor's intent, especially in a timely fashion.\n For a discussion on the level of attribution required, see section 3.1 of this chapter.\n Not discussed in the Manual is the plea of necessity, which term “is used to denote those exceptional cases where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency.” Draft Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 25, http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf.\n “[T]he international legal system generally imposes no sanctions upon nations for acts of espionage except for the political costs of public denunciation.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 18.21.2 fn. 305.

US military legal advisors take for granted that the principles of the law of war – distinction, proportionality, humanity, and military necessity – all apply during armed conflict. With regard to kinetic attacks, of course, these principles do apply. The challenge with wartime cyber operations is that they can be quite disruptive without being destructive. Legal advisors must be able to distinguish operations that must refrain from targeting civilian objects, for example, and those that fall below the attack threshold.\nThe cyber operations chapter takes note of the issue in a general way, pointing to paragraph 5.4 for details on how attacks are covered by the law of armed conflict (LOAC). That paragraph iterates that attacks must be carried out in compliance with the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions, but paragraph 16.5.2 notes with some circularity that “[a] cyber operation that does not constitute an attack is not restricted by the rules that apply to attacks.” It goes on to give examples of operations that would not constitute attacks: defacing government web pages; briefly disrupting internet service in a minor way; briefly disrupting, disabling, or interfering with communications; or disseminating propaganda. Unfortunately, these examples do little to draw the line between aggressive, non-attack cyber-activity and activity that would qualify as an attack. For example, do the qualifications in the examples mean that DoD would label a brief disruption of internet service in\n See Ray Murphy’s contribution to this book in Chapter 7. Chapter II of the DoD Manual lists the principles of the law of war as military necessity, humanity, proportionality, distinction, and honor. The principle of honor seems particularly attenuated from cyberwarfare; it is not discussed in the Manual with reference to cyberwarfare, and will be omitted here, as well.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\na major way an attack? Further, it is unclear that the principles of LOAC apply to any cyber-activity that stops short of causing damage, destruction, or injury. This gap in the law has led some experts to suggest that LOAC ought to apply to cyber operations that affect the functionality of computer systems without actually damaging them.\nThe Manual states “[i]f a cyber operation constitutes an attack, then the law of war rules on conducting attacks must be applied to those cyber operations.” Of course, this invites the question of what constitutes an attack. Operational legal advisors who consult the manual for guidance on this question will learn that wartime operations that destroy computers are attacks. While this is true, it is also the simplest case – kinetic effects directly caused by cyber operations clearly are attacks. On the more difficult questions of whether loss of functionality of a computer system, without damage to it, is an attack, or whether harm significantly attenuated from the original event, would similarly constitute an attack, the Manual is silent.\nAfter identifying the way cyberwarfare techniques might not be governed by the principles of the law of war, the Manual suggests that the case is not closed. “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.” This seems to contradict an earlier statement in the Manual, and may be read as *lex ferenda* rather than an articulation of the law. Legal advisors who rely on the Manual for guidance would be better served if the Manual made clear this is a US policy rather than the law. The United States might well put such policy restrictions in its own rules of engagement, but if it is meant to be read as a restriction grounded in law, the Manual should have provided some affirmative authority for this belief.\nIn a legal advisor’s analysis of whether a cyber-activity constitutes an attack, the Manual notes the importance of considering whether the effects created\n See M. N. Schmitt, “Rewired Warfare: Rethinking the Law of Cyber Attack” (2014) 96(893) *International Review of the Red Cross* 189, www.icrc.org/en/international-review/article/rewired-warfare-rethinking-law-cyber-attack; and C.

Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014), 221. “[T]he crux of the matter is whether the effect is a reasonably likely or foreseeable consequence of the operation on the basis of the information available at the time of the attack.”\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.2.  *Ibid.*, ¶ 5.12.1.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nIn this section of the chapter, DoD reveals a deep unease with the use of cyber-capabilities in war. The cautious approach regarding cyber-capabilities is perhaps not what one would expect when cyberwarfare seems less likely than kinetic means to cause civilian casualties and damage. Nevertheless, when the Manual assesses the application of the principle of proportionality to kinetic attacks, it specifically excludes any inconvenience to civilians from consideration, noting that such ancillary aspects of a military attack “need not be considered.” In contrast, the Manual mandates consideration of “civilian inconvenience” even in cyber operations that are too minor to be considered attacks under the law of war. It is logically inconsistent – and not a reflection of international law – to require no consideration of inconvenience before conducting a lethal attack, but to require that higher standard before a non-lethal cyber-action aiming to achieve the same result, such as disrupting military communications over a dual-use network node. If this is US policy, it ought to be set out as policy, and could be reflected in rules of engagement, but it is potentially confusing to cyber operators who refer to the Manual as a source of law.\nAlthough not listed as one of the distinctive principles of the law of war in the Manual, the cyber operations chapter discusses the obligation of precautions. There are two precautions-related requirements under generalized LOAC. The first is precautions in the attack, which requires States, when engaging in an attack, to take all feasible steps to minimize harm to the civilian\n Ibid., ¶ 5.12.1.2.\n “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack,’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.” Ibid., ¶ 16.5.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\npopulation. The second is precautions against the effects of attacks, which requires States to “take other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.” This second might be thought of as an obligation of defenders to ensure that military and strategic objects are not commingled with civilian objects in a way that would make it impossible for attackers to distinguish between the two.\nFor the reasons discussed above, precautions in the attack is not a particularly intriguing topic in a cyber-specific context. Cyber-events not qualifying as attacks are not covered by this provision of law, and those that are attacks present the same issues as traditional kinetic warfare. While it is true that destructive cyberattacks could result in the loss of civilian access to internet-based services, for example, so might kinetic attacks. Bombing or destroying bridges and electrical power infrastructure, often part of traditional military campaigns, also frequently results in loss of connectivity due to broken communications lines and lack of power. The consideration of these ancillary civilian effects is the same whether the instrumentality is cyber or kinetic.\nBy contrast, cyberspace operations present a unique opportunity to apply the principle obligating defenders to avoid commingling civilian and military objects. The cyber-infrastructure States use for military and national security missions is the same as that used for civilian activities from personal communications to providing essential utilities such as electricity and water. It might be argued that in choosing to commingle civilian and military capabilities on a single infrastructure, States all violated the defensive application of precautions, leaving the internet more susceptible to attack as a dual-use target.\nIn the cyber context, Manual paragraph 16.5.3 proclaims that “[p]arties to a conflict must take feasible precautions to reduce the risk of incidental harm to the civilian population and other protected persons and objects.” It is unclear why the two aspects of precautions would be conflated in the cyber chapter. For clarity, the cyber-precautions provisions should track the language in AP I and in the other provisions of the Manual.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of Aug. 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 (AP I), Art. 57. “Combatants must take feasible precautions in planning and conducting attacks to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and other persons and objects protected from being made the object of attack.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.11.\n AP I, Art. 58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nBoth international and US law require that weapons be reviewed for legal compliance before they may be acquired or used. AP I codifies the requirement to conduct legal reviews of weapons. The United States is not a party to AP I, but its practice of conducting legal reviews of weapons is consistent with the requirement, and predated AP I. DoD requires that weapons reviews determine whether a proposed weapon's intended use is calculated to cause superfluous injury, whether it is inherently indiscriminate, and whether it is specifically prohibited, for example by treaty.\nCyberspace operations have introduced new challenges in complying with what is ordinarily a straightforward provision of law. Recognizing that cyberweapons must be subjected to a legal review before acquisition or use does not answer the question of what, exactly, a cyberweapon is. In the case of more traditional weapons, it is generally straightforward to recognize that something is a weapon. Defining \"cyberweapon,\" on the other hand, can be quite tricky. It is difficult to know how to define cyberweapons, as the Manual recognizes: \"Not all cyber capabilities ... constitute a weapon or weapons system.\" Nearly every function of a modern military is at least supported by cyber capabilities. Logistics, medical processes, communications, etc. are all highly dependent on computers and networks, yet those particular capabilities would not be classified as weapons. In the case of offensive capabilities, computers, networks, and servers might all be considered part of a cyberweapons system, and legal reviews of the hardware would be straightforward (and pointless, because the same equipment can be used to support civilian and defensive functions). The heart of a cyber-capability is the code on which it is based, and the Manual offers little practical guidance on the proper classification of malware or other commonly encountered cyber techniques.\nRather than take on the difficult task of providing a basis for determining whether a cyber-capability is a weapon, the Manual punts, noting that the military services address which cyber-capabilities require legal reviews. This would be more helpful if the services actually did address the issue. The pertinent Army regulation is dated 1979, and the Navy's 2011 regulation lacks cyber-specific language. Only the Air Force has addressed the issues\n AP I, Art. 36.\n The Defense Acquisition System, DoD Directive 5000.1, ¶ E1.1.15 (certified current Nov. 20, 2007); DoD Manual, ¶ 6.2.3.\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 6.2.2.  Ibid., ¶ 16.6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nsurrounding cyberweapons specifically, so its instruction provides the DoD guidance by default.\nThe Air Force defines “weapons” as “devices designed to kill, injure, disable or temporarily incapacitate people, or destroy, damage or temporarily incapacitate property or materiel.” The Air Force instruction also defines a “cyber capability” as “any device or software payload intended to disrupt, deny, degrade, negate, impair or destroy adversarial computer systems, data, activities or capabilities,” but excludes “a device or software that is solely intended to provide access to an adversarial computer system for data exploitation.”\nThe Air Force directs that “all cyber capabilities being developed, bought, built, modified or otherwise acquired by the Air Force . . . are reviewed for legality under LOAC, domestic law and international law prior to their acquisition for use in a conflict or other military operation.” Unlike kinetic means of warfare, cyber means largely consist of intellectual property in the form of computer code. Physical weapons must be designed and manufactured, so changes tend to be infrequent. In contrast, computer code may be changed instantly and easily. It is often altered multiple times in the course of an operation. The practical problem created is that it appears dozens or hundreds of legal reviews might be required for a single cyber capability.\nAn alternate view of the problem is provided in the Tallinn Manual, which addresses the question of what constitutes a cyberweapon in rule 103. “[C]yber weapons are ‘cyber means of warfare’ that are used, designed, or intended to be used to cause injury to, or death of, persons or damage to, or destruction of, objects, that is, that result in the consequences required for qualification of a cyber operation as an attack.” In the Tallinn Manual cyberattack is defined as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.” DoD could consider adopting a modified version of this definition, making a simple change: “design, use, or intended use reasonably capable of causing.” This change would exclude imaginable but remote possibilities of harm that exist with every computer program, but would continue to create\n Whether weapons reviews are controlled by international law or by US policy, it would be preferable to have a single interpretation from DoD, rather than potentially conflicting interpretations provided by individual services.\n AFI 51-402, Legal Reviews of Weapons and Cyber Capabilities (July 27, 2011), 6.\n Ibid., 5.

The Manual provides no guidance to help determine what “inherently indiscriminate” means with regard to a cyber-capability. Malware is often spread indiscriminately but may by design have no significant negative effect on untargeted computer systems. Malware may use untargeted systems as vectors to reach its intended target, where it might have great effect. This was the case, for example, in the Stuxnet incident, where malware was spread to over 100,000 computers, but had no significant effects until it reached the computer system at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, where it destroyed over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges. The Manual takes no position on whether inert code copied indiscriminately and without permission to the hard drives of thousands of computers makes use of that malware unlawful. Based on the extant State practice to date, the answer is probably “no,” but the Manual would be a good vehicle for putting the issue to rest.\nCyber “weaponry” is a controversial issue in the larger national security community, as well. The tools and vulnerabilities necessary to conduct computer- and network-based operations for national security missions can also be used against civilian systems in support of intelligence and criminal activity. The US Government has a process to determine whether cyber-vulnerabilities should be disclosed in order to protect the public or held as part of the cyberarsenal to be used in support of national security. Some citizen groups argue that States have an obligation to disclose cyber-vulnerabilities they discover so the public can protect themselves from exploitation. States have been less keen to recognize that there is such an obligation, as it would essentially\n One way to handle the espionage/operations overlap on this issue is to simply exclude espionage tools by intent. Another way would be to accept that weapons can be used in espionage in ways that are not attacks, such as using a machete to cut through vegetation on a fence line. The operation should be analyzed by its effects rather than by its means.\n K. Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day (New York: Broadway Books, 2014), 96, 175.\n A. Schwartz and R.

Brown\nrequire them to render obsolete many of the cyber-capabilities they acquire or develop.\nAn inability to define what computer code constitutes a weapon also affects arms trade agreements. For example, the Wassenaar Arrangement, developed to control the transfer of arms and dual-use technologies, was amended in 2013 to include some cyber-capabilities. One of the new prohibited categories is intrusion software, which is software “specially designed or modified to avoid detection by ‘monitoring tools’, or to defeat ‘protective countermeasures’, of a computer or network capable device, and performing [data extraction, data modification, or installation of malware].” The intent of the language was to keep powerful computer tools out of the hands of repressive regimes, but the additions also prevented university researchers and law-abiding cyber-intrusion specialists from properly conducting research, because they were unable to share code across national borders.\nGiven the range of complex issues surrounding cyberweapons, some indication of the appropriate direction here would have been useful not just to US practitioners, but also to other States that look to the United States for leadership in international law, and particularly value the DoD role in clarifying LOAC. DoD has more experience than any organization in the world at assessing weapons for compliance with international law. It may be as befuddled as everyone about how to define and assess cyber weapons, but setting a single DoD policy, even an imperfect one, would have been a superior course than leaving the issue to be determined by individuals across the US services and the international community, perhaps in very different ways.\n## 3 OTHER ISSUES\nThe major issues cyber operations law advisors must be equipped to field are discussed above. The other commonly recurring issues are attribution, neutrality, perfidy, and the role of civilians. All of these are noted in the Manual and are discussed below.\n2013), www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/01/zero_day_exploits_should_the_hacker_gray_market_be_regulated.html.\n C.

Because of the internet's architecture and operation, concealing the identity and location of actors is relatively simple, while discovering the same can be an expensive and time-consuming process that often fails to deliver a certain answer. The Manual says but little about attribution, merely noting that it is difficult. If the goal of the Manual is to be useful to practitioners, this is a section that could be more complete. For example, there is no indication of what level of proof should be required for various responses.\nThe Tallinn Manual offers the guidance that, while pinpointing the origin of an attack does not mean the State owner of the infrastructure is responsible for the attack, it does provide a sort of rebuttable presumption that the host State is responsible. And, although there is no set standard of proof necessary to engage in countermeasures, the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility notes that the standard for attribution in such cases is \"reasonable certainty.\" Legal advisors are not starting from scratch when determining the appropriate standard to apply; international law does provide guidance that is helpful, even in the new area of cyber operations. It would be useful for this standard, at least, to be referenced in the Manual.\n## 3.2 Neutrality\nNeutrality plays a limited role in the cyberspace context. Neutrality under the law of war only applies during international armed conflict and conflicts between States have become very much the exception. Non-international armed conflict (NIAC) is common, however, and aggressive cyber-activities in support of NIAC, and in support of sub-armed conflict State activity, is common. The Manual's discussion of when neutrality principles apply is\n Even in two high-profile instances where the US Government asserted attribution was certain, controversy about the identity of the culprits continued for months.

Brown\nbased on both the 1907 Hague Convention and on the opinion of international legal experts. Of particular note, the chapter in the Manual addressing the law of neutrality is silent with respect to cyber operations. In DoD’s interpretation, some principles of neutrality apply in NIACs, although beyond respecting sovereignty, which is a principle of international law independent of neutrality, it is unclear which specific principles apply to belligerents in such conflicts.\nWith regard to non-participating States in NIACs, the Manual cites the UN General Assembly: “Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.” At some point, such activities would result in the offending State becoming a party to the conflict, converting it to an international armed conflict (IAC), so the Manual is apparently citing the language to capture relatively low-level, indirect assistance. In any event, the Manual suggests that nonbelligerent States in NIACs should refrain from “acquiescing in organized activities” within their territories when the activities are directed to acts of civil strife or terrorism.\nThe Manual suggests a contrasting approach in the cyber context, asserting that a State’s neutrality (a term that appears to be used in this chapter to refer to both neutral States and, unconventionally, to nonparticipating States in NIACs) is not dependent on whether it polices its cyber-infrastructure, as long as it does not take steps to discriminate among users of its infrastructure. The Manual explicitly notes that even if data could be characterized as a cyber weapon or otherwise could cause destructive effects in a belligerent State, relaying it would not impact a State’s status as a neutral.\nThe disconnect here is probably more about trying to govern cyberspace with a treaty over a hundred years old than it is about neutrality. The Manual fails to take into account that aggressive computer code, in the form of data packets transmitted over the internet, can be the actual means of waging war, not merely communications about waging war, which is what Hague V was meant to address.

U.S. (ICJ, 1986).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nThe Tallinn Manual takes a different approach to cyber-neutrality, with most of the experts opining that a State would violate its status as a neutral if it knowingly allowed the transmission of a cyberweapon across infrastructure it controlled.\nThe application of neutrality in cyberspace as set out in the DoD Manual is problematic because the United States appears to support the assertion of the rights of national sovereignty by States hosting internet infrastructure, but not the normal responsibilities of a sovereign. If States do have sovereign rights over code passing through internet infrastructure located in their territory, they ought to have the responsibility to ensure the code they host is doing no harm. Otherwise, the host State is essentially protecting cyber-aggressors from effective action by victim States, which is inconsistent with the application of neutrality in the physical world. The ultimate conclusion may be left to whether States decide packets of information making up cyber-means of warfare are more akin to communications or to weapons.\n## 3.3 Perfidy and Protective Emblems\nThe issue of perfidy has limited practical application in cyberwarfare, but it frequently comes up in conversations with cyber operators. The issue is briefly discussed in the Manual under “Improper Use of Signs.” International law prohibits using perfidy to kill, injure, or capture an adversary. Perfidy is widely understood as “[a]cts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to receive, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the\n Tallinn Manual, rule 152.\n “These sources make clear that neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent.” A. S. Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense” (2012) 52(3) Virginia Journal of International Law 499, www.vjil.org%2Fassets%2Fpdfs%2Fvol52%2Fissue3%2FDeeks_Post_Production.pdf.\n On the other hand, States could also have determined that military aircraft crossing neutral territory are permitted, as long as they are only delivering messages. Instead, the mission of the aircraft appears to be irrelevant.\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.24. Misuse of protective emblems, treachery, and perfidy are often discussed together, and often (if inaccurately) grouped together as perfidy. As perfidy is the most common of the terms in the operations community, it is used as the section title here.\n AP I, Art. 37(1). The United States asserts that customary international law prohibits only killing or injuring by means of perfidy, a position shared by the Tallinn experts. DoD Manual, para. 5.22; Tallinn Manual, rule 60(2).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nintent to betray that confidence.” To be perfidious, a cyber operation would have to both rely on feigning legal protection and proximately result in death or injury (or capture under the international formulation). For example, an email falsely claiming to be from the International Committee of the Red Cross that successfully lured enemy troops to an armed ambush that resulted in their deaths would constitute perfidy. One might also imagine a similar false email that escaped electronic scrutiny because of its purported protected sender that, when opened, introduced malware into the adversary network. If that malware directly led to death or injury – by causing a catastrophic failure of a military installation’s power plant, for example – it would be an example of perfidy. If death or injury did not result, it would still be an example of a misuse of a protective emblem.\nThe Manual also states it would be inappropriate to use “communications that initiate non-hostile relations, such as prisoner exchanges or ceasefires” to gain entry into an enemy’s computer network. The Manual’s support for this proposition is limited to cross-referencing other provisions in the Manual. While the United States may determine this is a good practice, such ruses are not prohibited under LOAC.\nSimilarly, the DoD Manual asserts “it would be prohibited to fabricate messages from an enemy’s Head of State falsely informing that State’s forces that an armistice or cease-fire had been signed.” This, like the prior paragraph’s suggestion that perfidy prohibits false communications that initiate non-hostile relations, is inconsistent with established international law. Such practices may not be good policy, but they are not illegal. According to the 1977 International Red Cross (ICRC) Commentary on Additional Protocol I “the central element of the definition of perfidy is the deliberate claim to legal protection for hostile purposes,” which these lack. There are arguments to the contrary but, as unchivalrous as these situations may be, they do not meet the definition of perfidy.\nCyber operations can be the most effective method of disseminating and obtaining information, so the portions of LOAC related to information are\n AP I, Art. 37(1).  Tallinn Manual, rule 122(3).\n This is an adaptation of an example from the Tallinn Manual, rule 122(5).\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.4.  Ibid., ¶¶ 12.2, 5.21.

AP I requires that medical units and transports be marked as such.78 The Tallinn Manual opined that the marking and protection obligations extend to “[c]omputers, computer networks, and data that form an integral part of the operations or administration of medical units and transports.”79 The DoD Manual is silent on the issue, but it is one that merits consideration and decision so that it can be uniformly implemented. This would help ensure the protection of medical data and protect against accidental misuse of the protective emblem.\n## 3.4 Civilians as Combatants\nThe DoD Manual succinctly summarizes the law on civilian employees’ involvement in cyberwarfare. Civilian employees are permitted to directly participate in hostilities (DPH), but they forfeit any protection they would receive as civilians during the participation. There may be political or other policy rationales for preventing civilians from acting as cyber “trigger-pullers,” but it is permissible under LOAC. One reason DoD is comfortable with this broad reading of appropriate civilian conduct may be that cyberwarfare tends to be conducted from a distance, so there is less concern about increasing the chance that other, non-participating civilians could be mistaken for lawful targets.\n## 4 CONCLUSION\nThis chapter of the Commentary has focused more on developments of the law and shortcomings in the Manual than some other chapters. That is because, despite the lessons learned over many years of armed conflict about how the law of war should apply to best protect civilians and prevent unnecessary suffering, there are gaps in its practical application to cyberwarfare. As noted above, many questions remain about exactly how the law should apply to operations in cyberspace, yet the disruptive and destructive\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\ncapabilities and vulnerabilities available to cyber-actors are increasingly being acknowledged. State custom, practice, and norms are being created rapidly, as well, more through inaction than action. The cyber operations chapter in the Manual offered an opportunity for the United States to guide both the present and the future of cyber operations law, but DoD chose not to grasp it.\nAlthough DoD minimizes the role of military manuals in the development of international law, noting specifically in the DoD Manual that the views \"do not necessarily reflect the views of [other federal agencies] or the US Government as a whole,\" any information the United States provides will carry great weight.80 States are hungry for guidance on how the law of war applies to cyberwarfare, and the US owns the most important voice in the field. This may be why DoD was reluctant to take a bolder stand on the key issues that matter to coalition partners and experts in the field, but it also carries the risk that others, who may not share the interests of the United States with respect to ensuring freedoms of expression and association, may succeed in filling in the gaps.81 In the absence of official guidance, academic works carry more than their usual weight, as well, and the musings of academics are less likely to be constrained by practicality. It would be in DoD's selfish interest to encourage a practical body of law that supports military operations, rather than an idealistic set of pronouncements that will be ignored.\nThe most critical failing of the cyber operations chapter is that it offers no useful ideas on how to apply international law, or even US policy, to the most likely cyber-scenarios. Although military cyberspace operations are in their infancy, useful examples could have been drawn from a short list of real-world events. Cyber-incidents in Estonia (2007), the Republic of Georgia (2008), Iran (2009), and Saudi Arabia (2012) are just a few examples that might have been used to walk through various issues in a way relevant for operations lawyers.82 More recently, Russia's alleged use of cyber-methods to disseminate\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nThere remain many unanswered questions regarding the law governing cyberwarfare. The brevity and lack of specificity in the chapter may be an indication that DoD believes the law is insufficiently developed for it to provide guidance. Unfortunately, discomfort with the state of the law does not remove the responsibility of government legal advisors, who are the target audience of the Manual and must provide advice on cyber operations with or without legal direction from the manual. Even if the area is changing rapidly, it would be useful for DoD to provide more complete guidance to the field that would also suggest a framework for the international community. Even providing complete footnotes (as opposed to mostly internal references) would be a great help to practitioners; it would give them a jumping-off point for filling in the substantive gaps left by the Manual.\nDoD seems to be committed to making online changes to the Manual, and has demonstrated some alacrity in doing so. The cyber operations chapter is a likely candidate for significant development in the near future, and we can hope that future revisions will provide more specific guidance on how the law applies, or does not apply, to the emerging area of cyberwarfare.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Brown\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\nOne of the challenges in addressing the law applicable to cyberwarfare is apparent from a statement in the introduction to the Department of Defense (DoD) Law of War Manual (the Manual). Stephen Preston, who was at the time serving as DoD General Counsel, wrote that the manual “reflects the experience of this Department in applying the law of war in actual military operations, and it will help us remember the hard learned lessons from the past.” Indeed, one indisputable advantage DoD brings to law of war discussions is concrete operational experience. No other organization is as practiced in actually applying the law of war in combat as well as a whole range of other operations. DoD has been involved in combat operations during most of its existence since its founding in 1947. There is no organization more experienced in kinetic warfare, and none better positioned to capture lessons learned.\nThat is not the case with regard to cyberwarfare, however, and the lack of lessons learned from operations is evident in the Manual’s treatment of cyberwarfare. Chapter XVI of the Manual, “Cyber Operations,” provides little in the way of useful guidance for cyber operations lawyers. Although they will be required to provide real-time legal advice on cyber operations, operations lawyers have no definitive sources and few references with sufficient depth to guide their endeavors. In that sense, the cyber operations chapter represents the most substantial shortfall between the Manual’s aspiration in support of US forces and its actuality. In any event, Chapter XVI is by far the shortest chapter of the Manual at only sixteen pages (one of which has only two words of text along with a footnote).\n DoD Law of War Manual, ii.\n\nGary D. Brown\nBefore discussing the text, a reflection on the underpinnings of Chapter XVI is in order. As noted above, acknowledged State-sponsored cyber operations are rare to non-existent, so there are few legal lessons to be gleaned from practice between contesting States. That leaves only government policy and academic study as starting points for the construction of a specific body of cyber operations law. In a choice starkly contrasting with the rest of the DoD Manual, the cyber operations chapter relies almost exclusively on two sources: a 1999 DoD Office of General Counsel legal assessment of \"information operations\" and a 2012 speech at the US Cyber Command Legal Conference delivered by the State Department Legal Advisor. Chapter XVI of the Manual has only 44 percent as many footnotes when compared to the next most lightly footnoted chapter. Even more striking, 98.8 percent of the footnotes cite either to the Manual itself or to internal US policy documents and speeches.\nOf particular note, the Manual avoids any mention of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which has been well-received by academics and governments since its original publication in 2013. As the Manual's footnotes are meant \"to help practitioners research particular topics discussed in the main text,\" references to at least some of the literature in the field would have been appropriate. That one of two foundational references dates from the last century and the other is a State Department speech considerably undermines the credibility of the chapter.\n## 2 OVERVIEW\nThe broad scope of the DoD Manual is reflected in the statement of purpose, which is \"to provide information on the law of war to DoD personnel responsible for implementing the law of war and executing military operations.\" With that in mind, this commentary on the chapter \"Cyber Operations\" is organized according to the four most pressing issues that legal practitioners must address to provide proper legal advice to decision-makers:\n DoD, Office of the General Counsel, \"An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations\" (2nd ed., Nov. 1999), repr. in 76 US Naval War College International Law Studies (2002); and H. H. Koh, Legal Advisor, Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace, \"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference\" (Sept. 18, 2012), repr. in 54 Harvard International Law Journal Online (Dec. 2012), 3, www.harvardilj.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Koh-Speech-to-Publish1.pdf. About half of the footnotes are to other portions of the DoD Manual.\n Since the publication of the DoD Manual, the Tallinn Manual has been updated to version 2.0, published in 2017. The references in the remainder of this chapter as to the 2017 edition.\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 1.2.2.  Ibid., ¶ 1.2.1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\n2. What is cyberspying?\n3. What is a cyberattack?\n4. What is a cyberweapon?\nSet out below is a discussion of why these questions are critical, and how well the Manual does as a reference for those who will be providing legal advice on military and other government cyber operations.\n## 2.1 What Is Cyberwar?\nOne of the key answers legal advisors must provide is whether proposed cyber operations would cross the threshold from peace to war. Although it may be outside the normal area of expertise of an operations legal advisor, they still must be prepared to grapple with the thorny issues of how cyber operations might contribute to, or even drive, a transition from peace to war. Because cyberspace by its nature is global, even those operations meant to be collecting tactical information or focused on a specific region can have far-reaching consequences. The intent of cyberspace operators is often difficult to discern, and internet-based operations cross many jurisdictions in making their way to the intended target. That means information-gathering might appear to be something more aggressive. In addition, States might feel compelled to defend their \"cyber-sovereignty\" even from incursions falling short of aggression. Either of these could motivate hostile actions in response, so discerning the distinction between normal cyber operations and those that might be interpreted as aggressive (or transgressive) is of critical importance.\nIn examining that decision space, national decision-makers often ask the question, \"Is this an act of war?\" This is a consideration of both States considering the wisdom of cyberspace activities, and States who are the victims of unfriendly cyber-acts. The term \"act of war\" is generally meant to be \"any act by a State that would effectively terminate the normal international law of peacetime and activate the international law\n Although the phrase \"act of war\" is not a legal term, given the difficulties in determining what cyber-events cross the threshold of armed attack, it may be appropriate for States to note the importance of political considerations in their assessments of whether aggressive cyber-activities trigger the right of self-defense. As one cyber-expert puts it, \"calling something an act of war is not a conclusion; it is a decision.\" M. Libicki, \"An Act of War, Even Cyberwar, Is a Decision,\" New York Times (Feb. 28, 2013), www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/02/28/what-is-an-act-of-cyberwar/an-act-of-war-even-cyberwar-is-a-decision.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nof war.”7 In modern usage, an act of war may be considered the equivalent of armed attack or, for the United States, a use of force.8 For cyber operations lawyers advising decision-makers it is appropriate to ask, as the DoD Manual does, whether a certain cyber-act is an unlawful use of force or an international armed attack.\nThe ultimate goal is determining which activity rises to a level that would justify a State’s use of force in self-defense.9 For most States, that would mean the cyber-activity would have to be an armed attack, which would trigger Article 51 of the UN Charter. The United States, however, has consistently asserted that the right of self-defense may be exercised based on a lower threshold: that of a use of force.10 Whichever standard is used, sorting out which cyber-activities would push States to armed conflict is difficult to describe in an abstract ex ante manner.\nThe Manual concludes that if a cyber-activity has kinetic results, it may lawfully be treated the same as if it were caused by non-cyber means. Thus, “if cyber operations cause effects that, if caused by traditional physical means, would be regarded as a use of force . . . then such cyber operations would likely also be regarded as a use of force.”11 The caveat of “likely” in the statement is critical. Cyber-means of warfare are not exempt from the application of international law, but the Manual suggests the application of the law is unsettled. In the kinetic realm, decades of history and precedent are available to study what States consider adequate to support armed self-defense. If the aggressor uses cyber-means, however, the US position is that the legal question cannot be answered merely based on the effects of the attack. States “must evaluate factors including the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action . . ., the target and location, effects and intent, among other possible issues” before determining whether the action constitutes a use of force.12\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nStates have not engaged in armed conflict premised only on cyber-aggression against financial institutions. Similarly, they will not, it seems, wage war over foreign actors establishing a persistent presence on industrial control systems controlling public utilities. State practice seems to be tilting in favor of negotiated agreements between States to refrain from such actions rather than recognizing the resort of armed retaliation. It is possible the non-response from States is because they lack good evidence connecting the actors to States, or even non-State armed groups. State norms and practice regarding cyberspace operations are rapidly forming and being refined. If the US position is that these activities would engender armed self-defense given\n Ibid., ¶ 16.3.1.\n D. Volz and J.

Brown\nsufficient evidence of the actor, the DoD Manual would have offered an ideal opportunity to state and support that perspective. More likely, the US position is that many activities in this arena fall under the broad rubric of \"espionage,\" activities at which the US excels and does not wish to limit through the international legal structure.[17] Even stating that clearly would have been helpful to the practitioners who will rely on the Manual to form legal opinions in support of cyber operations.\nAnother weakness with the examples the Manual uses is that they are far too facile. A legal advisor with no previous experience in cyber operations could surely have determined that activities causing dams to fail and planes to crash would be international acts of aggression. These obvious examples provide little guidance to practitioners who must advise on where the line is drawn between cyberattacks and lesser cyber-insults. A single example, also from the 1999 paper, may provide more information about where the line between peace and war is drawn, but it is unclear exactly how it fits with the message of the chapter. \"[C]yber operations that cripple a military's logistics systems, and thus its ability to conduct and sustain military operations, might also be considered a use of force under jus ad bellum.\"[18] Compared to a nuclear meltdown and plane crashes, this type of operation seems almost benign.\nAlthough it is not clear what \"crippling\" a military logistics system means, the type of disruptive cyber-action that could be taken against an unclassified logistics system seems similar to the events in Estonia in 2007. In that case, government and economic websites, as well as internet infrastructure sites, were targeted with denial of service attacks that significantly impaired their functioning for three weeks.[19] The events in Estonia were not considered sufficient to support a claim of international self-defense.[20] This interpretation also seems to be a departure from US practice as stated in the Manual. In addition to the failure to react publicly to operations carried out against public utilities and financial systems, the US characterized the 2014 Sony hack, which stole massive amounts of data and was designed to corrupt or destroy more, as \"cyber-vandalism,\" explicitly characterizing it as an activity\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nEven if a cyber-activity is determined not to cross the armed attack/use of force threshold, victims are not without military recourse. The notion of cyber-countermeasures to respond to aggressive but sub-use of force cyber-actions has received significant attention in the international legal community, although it rates little more than a footnote in the chapter. Other than in the cyber chapter, the Manual refers to countermeasures as reprisals, which it defines as “acts taken against a party: (1) that would otherwise be unlawful; (2) in order to persuade that party to cease violating the law.” In other words, if undertaken as a countermeasure, unlawful responsive cyber-measures are rendered legal if they remain below the level of a use of force, and are conducted for the purpose of ending the original unlawful activity.\nParagraph 16.3.3.3 of the Manual discusses countermeasures and retorsion together, emphasizing the availability of retorsive responses to cyber-insults, such as diplomatic measures. Both are important concepts for cyber operations, but they are distinct. Retorsion in general is defined in paragraph 18.17 of the DoD Manual: “unfriendly conduct, (1) which is not inconsistent with any international obligation of the State engaging in it, and (2) which is done in response to an internationally wrongful act.” An understanding of both in the cyber context is especially critical because it is not always clear when an action in cyberspace is unlawful. When the law on the original action is unclear, responses may be phrased as equivalent; that is, if the initial action was lawful,\n K.

Brown\nthen the same thing done in return would be retorsion. If the triggering action was unlawful, then the response would be a countermeasure, rendered lawful by its status.\n## 2.2 What Is Cyber-Spying?\nDetermining whether cyber-activities would cross the line from operations to espionage remains a difficult issue for cyber legal advisors. Espionage is generally unregulated under international law but, unlike in the physical world, espionage in cyberspace can be quite difficult to distinguish from the preparation for and conduct of more aggressive military operations. The Manual notes that to the extent “cyber operations resemble traditional intelligence and counterintelligence activities, such as unauthorized intrusions into computer networks solely to acquire information, then such cyber operations would likely be treated similarly under international law.” This would be more helpful if there were an easy way to ascertain the nature of the cyber-activity in the first place.\nWhether a cyber operation is undertaken for the purpose of espionage or military operations, it normally will require some penetration of the targeted system to gain access. Once access to the system is established, the aggressor might engage in espionage or attack. Even if the mission is espionage, the operator might leave behind malware to facilitate future access to the system, and that future event might be either an attack or spying. How should system penetrations be treated under the law when the actor's intent is unknown? How should pre-implanted capabilities be treated when they are discovered, especially on critical infrastructure or sensitive national security systems? If an espionage event goes wrong and results in accidental damage to a system, does it become an attack at that point? There may be no way for the victim of the event to determine the actor's intent, especially in a timely fashion.\n For a discussion on the level of attribution required, see section 3.1 of this chapter.\n Not discussed in the Manual is the plea of necessity, which term “is used to denote those exceptional cases where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency.” Draft Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 25, http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf.\n “[T]he international legal system generally imposes no sanctions upon nations for acts of espionage except for the political costs of public denunciation.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 18.21.2 fn. 305.

US military legal advisors take for granted that the principles of the law of war – distinction, proportionality, humanity, and military necessity – all apply during armed conflict. With regard to kinetic attacks, of course, these principles do apply. The challenge with wartime cyber operations is that they can be quite disruptive without being destructive. Legal advisors must be able to distinguish operations that must refrain from targeting civilian objects, for example, and those that fall below the attack threshold.\nThe cyber operations chapter takes note of the issue in a general way, pointing to paragraph 5.4 for details on how attacks are covered by the law of armed conflict (LOAC). That paragraph iterates that attacks must be carried out in compliance with the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions, but paragraph 16.5.2 notes with some circularity that “[a] cyber operation that does not constitute an attack is not restricted by the rules that apply to attacks.” It goes on to give examples of operations that would not constitute attacks: defacing government web pages; briefly disrupting internet service in a minor way; briefly disrupting, disabling, or interfering with communications; or disseminating propaganda. Unfortunately, these examples do little to draw the line between aggressive, non-attack cyber-activity and activity that would qualify as an attack. For example, do the qualifications in the examples mean that DoD would label a brief disruption of internet service in\n See Ray Murphy’s contribution to this book in Chapter 7. Chapter II of the DoD Manual lists the principles of the law of war as military necessity, humanity, proportionality, distinction, and honor. The principle of honor seems particularly attenuated from cyberwarfare; it is not discussed in the Manual with reference to cyberwarfare, and will be omitted here, as well.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\na major way an attack? Further, it is unclear that the principles of LOAC apply to any cyber-activity that stops short of causing damage, destruction, or injury. This gap in the law has led some experts to suggest that LOAC ought to apply to cyber operations that affect the functionality of computer systems without actually damaging them.\nThe Manual states “[i]f a cyber operation constitutes an attack, then the law of war rules on conducting attacks must be applied to those cyber operations.” Of course, this invites the question of what constitutes an attack. Operational legal advisors who consult the manual for guidance on this question will learn that wartime operations that destroy computers are attacks. While this is true, it is also the simplest case – kinetic effects directly caused by cyber operations clearly are attacks. On the more difficult questions of whether loss of functionality of a computer system, without damage to it, is an attack, or whether harm significantly attenuated from the original event, would similarly constitute an attack, the Manual is silent.\nAfter identifying the way cyberwarfare techniques might not be governed by the principles of the law of war, the Manual suggests that the case is not closed. “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.” This seems to contradict an earlier statement in the Manual, and may be read as *lex ferenda* rather than an articulation of the law. Legal advisors who rely on the Manual for guidance would be better served if the Manual made clear this is a US policy rather than the law. The United States might well put such policy restrictions in its own rules of engagement, but if it is meant to be read as a restriction grounded in law, the Manual should have provided some affirmative authority for this belief.\nIn a legal advisor’s analysis of whether a cyber-activity constitutes an attack, the Manual notes the importance of considering whether the effects created\n See M. N. Schmitt, “Rewired Warfare: Rethinking the Law of Cyber Attack” (2014) 96(893) *International Review of the Red Cross* 189, www.icrc.org/en/international-review/article/rewired-warfare-rethinking-law-cyber-attack; and C. Droege, “Get Off My Cloud: Cyber Warfare, International Humanitarian Law, and the Protection of Civilians” (2012) 94(886) *International Review of the Red Cross* 533.\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.1.  *Ibid.*\n On the issue of attenuation, see M. Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014), 221. “[T]he crux of the matter is whether the effect is a reasonably likely or foreseeable consequence of the operation on the basis of the information available at the time of the attack.”\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.2.  *Ibid.*, ¶ 5.12.1.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nIn this section of the chapter, DoD reveals a deep unease with the use of cyber-capabilities in war. The cautious approach regarding cyber-capabilities is perhaps not what one would expect when cyberwarfare seems less likely than kinetic means to cause civilian casualties and damage. Nevertheless, when the Manual assesses the application of the principle of proportionality to kinetic attacks, it specifically excludes any inconvenience to civilians from consideration, noting that such ancillary aspects of a military attack “need not be considered.” In contrast, the Manual mandates consideration of “civilian inconvenience” even in cyber operations that are too minor to be considered attacks under the law of war. It is logically inconsistent – and not a reflection of international law – to require no consideration of inconvenience before conducting a lethal attack, but to require that higher standard before a non-lethal cyber-action aiming to achieve the same result, such as disrupting military communications over a dual-use network node. If this is US policy, it ought to be set out as policy, and could be reflected in rules of engagement, but it is potentially confusing to cyber operators who refer to the Manual as a source of law.\nAlthough not listed as one of the distinctive principles of the law of war in the Manual, the cyber operations chapter discusses the obligation of precautions. There are two precautions-related requirements under generalized LOAC. The first is precautions in the attack, which requires States, when engaging in an attack, to take all feasible steps to minimize harm to the civilian\n Ibid., ¶ 5.12.1.2.\n “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack,’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.” Ibid., ¶ 16.5.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\npopulation. The second is precautions against the effects of attacks, which requires States to “take other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.” This second might be thought of as an obligation of defenders to ensure that military and strategic objects are not commingled with civilian objects in a way that would make it impossible for attackers to distinguish between the two.\nFor the reasons discussed above, precautions in the attack is not a particularly intriguing topic in a cyber-specific context. Cyber-events not qualifying as attacks are not covered by this provision of law, and those that are attacks present the same issues as traditional kinetic warfare. While it is true that destructive cyberattacks could result in the loss of civilian access to internet-based services, for example, so might kinetic attacks. Bombing or destroying bridges and electrical power infrastructure, often part of traditional military campaigns, also frequently results in loss of connectivity due to broken communications lines and lack of power. The consideration of these ancillary civilian effects is the same whether the instrumentality is cyber or kinetic.\nBy contrast, cyberspace operations present a unique opportunity to apply the principle obligating defenders to avoid commingling civilian and military objects. The cyber-infrastructure States use for military and national security missions is the same as that used for civilian activities from personal communications to providing essential utilities such as electricity and water. It might be argued that in choosing to commingle civilian and military capabilities on a single infrastructure, States all violated the defensive application of precautions, leaving the internet more susceptible to attack as a dual-use target.\nIn the cyber context, Manual paragraph 16.5.3 proclaims that “[p]arties to a conflict must take feasible precautions to reduce the risk of incidental harm to the civilian population and other protected persons and objects.” It is unclear why the two aspects of precautions would be conflated in the cyber chapter. For clarity, the cyber-precautions provisions should track the language in AP I and in the other provisions of the Manual.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of Aug. 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 (AP I), Art. 57. “Combatants must take feasible precautions in planning and conducting attacks to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and other persons and objects protected from being made the object of attack.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.11.\n AP I, Art. 58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nBoth international and US law require that weapons be reviewed for legal compliance before they may be acquired or used. AP I codifies the requirement to conduct legal reviews of weapons. The United States is not a party to AP I, but its practice of conducting legal reviews of weapons is consistent with the requirement, and predated AP I. DoD requires that weapons reviews determine whether a proposed weapon's intended use is calculated to cause superfluous injury, whether it is inherently indiscriminate, and whether it is specifically prohibited, for example by treaty.\nCyberspace operations have introduced new challenges in complying with what is ordinarily a straightforward provision of law. Recognizing that cyberweapons must be subjected to a legal review before acquisition or use does not answer the question of what, exactly, a cyberweapon is. In the case of more traditional weapons, it is generally straightforward to recognize that something is a weapon. Defining \"cyberweapon,\" on the other hand, can be quite tricky. It is difficult to know how to define cyberweapons, as the Manual recognizes: \"Not all cyber capabilities ... constitute a weapon or weapons system.\" Nearly every function of a modern military is at least supported by cyber capabilities. Logistics, medical processes, communications, etc. are all highly dependent on computers and networks, yet those particular capabilities would not be classified as weapons. In the case of offensive capabilities, computers, networks, and servers might all be considered part of a cyberweapons system, and legal reviews of the hardware would be straightforward (and pointless, because the same equipment can be used to support civilian and defensive functions). The heart of a cyber-capability is the code on which it is based, and the Manual offers little practical guidance on the proper classification of malware or other commonly encountered cyber techniques.\nRather than take on the difficult task of providing a basis for determining whether a cyber-capability is a weapon, the Manual punts, noting that the military services address which cyber-capabilities require legal reviews. This would be more helpful if the services actually did address the issue. The pertinent Army regulation is dated 1979, and the Navy's 2011 regulation lacks cyber-specific language. Only the Air Force has addressed the issues\n AP I, Art. 36.\n The Defense Acquisition System, DoD Directive 5000.1, ¶ E1.1.15 (certified current Nov. 20, 2007); DoD Manual, ¶ 6.2.3.\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 6.2.2.  Ibid., ¶ 16.6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nsurrounding cyberweapons specifically, so its instruction provides the DoD guidance by default.\nThe Air Force defines “weapons” as “devices designed to kill, injure, disable or temporarily incapacitate people, or destroy, damage or temporarily incapacitate property or materiel.” The Air Force instruction also defines a “cyber capability” as “any device or software payload intended to disrupt, deny, degrade, negate, impair or destroy adversarial computer systems, data, activities or capabilities,” but excludes “a device or software that is solely intended to provide access to an adversarial computer system for data exploitation.”\nThe Air Force directs that “all cyber capabilities being developed, bought, built, modified or otherwise acquired by the Air Force . . . are reviewed for legality under LOAC, domestic law and international law prior to their acquisition for use in a conflict or other military operation.” Unlike kinetic means of warfare, cyber means largely consist of intellectual property in the form of computer code. Physical weapons must be designed and manufactured, so changes tend to be infrequent. In contrast, computer code may be changed instantly and easily. It is often altered multiple times in the course of an operation. The practical problem created is that it appears dozens or hundreds of legal reviews might be required for a single cyber capability.\nAn alternate view of the problem is provided in the Tallinn Manual, which addresses the question of what constitutes a cyberweapon in rule 103. “[C]yber weapons are ‘cyber means of warfare’ that are used, designed, or intended to be used to cause injury to, or death of, persons or damage to, or destruction of, objects, that is, that result in the consequences required for qualification of a cyber operation as an attack.” In the Tallinn Manual cyberattack is defined as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.” DoD could consider adopting a modified version of this definition, making a simple change: “design, use, or intended use reasonably capable of causing.” This change would exclude imaginable but remote possibilities of harm that exist with every computer program, but would continue to create\n Whether weapons reviews are controlled by international law or by US policy, it would be preferable to have a single interpretation from DoD, rather than potentially conflicting interpretations provided by individual services.\n AFI 51-402, Legal Reviews of Weapons and Cyber Capabilities (July 27, 2011), 6.\n Ibid., 5.

The Manual provides no guidance to help determine what “inherently indiscriminate” means with regard to a cyber-capability. Malware is often spread indiscriminately but may by design have no significant negative effect on untargeted computer systems. Malware may use untargeted systems as vectors to reach its intended target, where it might have great effect. This was the case, for example, in the Stuxnet incident, where malware was spread to over 100,000 computers, but had no significant effects until it reached the computer system at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, where it destroyed over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges. The Manual takes no position on whether inert code copied indiscriminately and without permission to the hard drives of thousands of computers makes use of that malware unlawful. Based on the extant State practice to date, the answer is probably “no,” but the Manual would be a good vehicle for putting the issue to rest.\nCyber “weaponry” is a controversial issue in the larger national security community, as well. The tools and vulnerabilities necessary to conduct computer- and network-based operations for national security missions can also be used against civilian systems in support of intelligence and criminal activity. The US Government has a process to determine whether cyber-vulnerabilities should be disclosed in order to protect the public or held as part of the cyberarsenal to be used in support of national security. Some citizen groups argue that States have an obligation to disclose cyber-vulnerabilities they discover so the public can protect themselves from exploitation. States have been less keen to recognize that there is such an obligation, as it would essentially\n One way to handle the espionage/operations overlap on this issue is to simply exclude espionage tools by intent. Another way would be to accept that weapons can be used in espionage in ways that are not attacks, such as using a machete to cut through vegetation on a fence line. The operation should be analyzed by its effects rather than by its means.\n K. Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day (New York: Broadway Books, 2014), 96, 175.\n A. Schwartz and R. Knake, “Government’s Role in Vulnerability Disclosure,” The Cyber Security Project, Discussion Paper 2016-04 (June 2016), http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/Vulnerability%20Disclosure%20Web-Final4.pdf.\n D.

Brown\nrequire them to render obsolete many of the cyber-capabilities they acquire or develop.\nAn inability to define what computer code constitutes a weapon also affects arms trade agreements. For example, the Wassenaar Arrangement, developed to control the transfer of arms and dual-use technologies, was amended in 2013 to include some cyber-capabilities. One of the new prohibited categories is intrusion software, which is software “specially designed or modified to avoid detection by ‘monitoring tools’, or to defeat ‘protective countermeasures’, of a computer or network capable device, and performing [data extraction, data modification, or installation of malware].” The intent of the language was to keep powerful computer tools out of the hands of repressive regimes, but the additions also prevented university researchers and law-abiding cyber-intrusion specialists from properly conducting research, because they were unable to share code across national borders.\nGiven the range of complex issues surrounding cyberweapons, some indication of the appropriate direction here would have been useful not just to US practitioners, but also to other States that look to the United States for leadership in international law, and particularly value the DoD role in clarifying LOAC. DoD has more experience than any organization in the world at assessing weapons for compliance with international law. It may be as befuddled as everyone about how to define and assess cyber weapons, but setting a single DoD policy, even an imperfect one, would have been a superior course than leaving the issue to be determined by individuals across the US services and the international community, perhaps in very different ways.\n## 3 OTHER ISSUES\nThe major issues cyber operations law advisors must be equipped to field are discussed above. The other commonly recurring issues are attribution, neutrality, perfidy, and the role of civilians. All of these are noted in the Manual and are discussed below.\n2013), www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/01/zero_day_exploits_should_the_hacker_gray_market_be_regulated.html.\n C.

Because of the internet's architecture and operation, concealing the identity and location of actors is relatively simple, while discovering the same can be an expensive and time-consuming process that often fails to deliver a certain answer. The Manual says but little about attribution, merely noting that it is difficult. If the goal of the Manual is to be useful to practitioners, this is a section that could be more complete. For example, there is no indication of what level of proof should be required for various responses.\nThe Tallinn Manual offers the guidance that, while pinpointing the origin of an attack does not mean the State owner of the infrastructure is responsible for the attack, it does provide a sort of rebuttable presumption that the host State is responsible. And, although there is no set standard of proof necessary to engage in countermeasures, the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility notes that the standard for attribution in such cases is \"reasonable certainty.\" Legal advisors are not starting from scratch when determining the appropriate standard to apply; international law does provide guidance that is helpful, even in the new area of cyber operations. It would be useful for this standard, at least, to be referenced in the Manual.\n## 3.2 Neutrality\nNeutrality plays a limited role in the cyberspace context. Neutrality under the law of war only applies during international armed conflict and conflicts between States have become very much the exception. Non-international armed conflict (NIAC) is common, however, and aggressive cyber-activities in support of NIAC, and in support of sub-armed conflict State activity, is common. The Manual's discussion of when neutrality principles apply is\n Even in two high-profile instances where the US Government asserted attribution was certain, controversy about the identity of the culprits continued for months. Cybersecurity experts seem to have as many different opinions as lawyers. \"FBI Still Believes North Korea Is Responsible for Sony Hack,\" CBS News (Dec. 30, 2014), www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-still-believes-north-korea-is-responsible-for-sony-hack/; S.

Brown\nbased on both the 1907 Hague Convention and on the opinion of international legal experts. Of particular note, the chapter in the Manual addressing the law of neutrality is silent with respect to cyber operations. In DoD’s interpretation, some principles of neutrality apply in NIACs, although beyond respecting sovereignty, which is a principle of international law independent of neutrality, it is unclear which specific principles apply to belligerents in such conflicts.\nWith regard to non-participating States in NIACs, the Manual cites the UN General Assembly: “Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.” At some point, such activities would result in the offending State becoming a party to the conflict, converting it to an international armed conflict (IAC), so the Manual is apparently citing the language to capture relatively low-level, indirect assistance. In any event, the Manual suggests that nonbelligerent States in NIACs should refrain from “acquiescing in organized activities” within their territories when the activities are directed to acts of civil strife or terrorism.\nThe Manual suggests a contrasting approach in the cyber context, asserting that a State’s neutrality (a term that appears to be used in this chapter to refer to both neutral States and, unconventionally, to nonparticipating States in NIACs) is not dependent on whether it polices its cyber-infrastructure, as long as it does not take steps to discriminate among users of its infrastructure. The Manual explicitly notes that even if data could be characterized as a cyber weapon or otherwise could cause destructive effects in a belligerent State, relaying it would not impact a State’s status as a neutral.\nThe disconnect here is probably more about trying to govern cyberspace with a treaty over a hundred years old than it is about neutrality. The Manual fails to take into account that aggressive computer code, in the form of data packets transmitted over the internet, can be the actual means of waging war, not merely communications about waging war, which is what Hague V was meant to address. There is little logical distinction between allowing the transmission of a virtual attack across neutral infrastructure and allowing the\n DoD Law of War Manual, § 15.2.1 and Chapter XVII fn. 211.

U.S. (ICJ, 1986).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nThe Tallinn Manual takes a different approach to cyber-neutrality, with most of the experts opining that a State would violate its status as a neutral if it knowingly allowed the transmission of a cyberweapon across infrastructure it controlled.\nThe application of neutrality in cyberspace as set out in the DoD Manual is problematic because the United States appears to support the assertion of the rights of national sovereignty by States hosting internet infrastructure, but not the normal responsibilities of a sovereign. If States do have sovereign rights over code passing through internet infrastructure located in their territory, they ought to have the responsibility to ensure the code they host is doing no harm. Otherwise, the host State is essentially protecting cyber-aggressors from effective action by victim States, which is inconsistent with the application of neutrality in the physical world. The ultimate conclusion may be left to whether States decide packets of information making up cyber-means of warfare are more akin to communications or to weapons.\n## 3.3 Perfidy and Protective Emblems\nThe issue of perfidy has limited practical application in cyberwarfare, but it frequently comes up in conversations with cyber operators. The issue is briefly discussed in the Manual under “Improper Use of Signs.” International law prohibits using perfidy to kill, injure, or capture an adversary. Perfidy is widely understood as “[a]cts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to receive, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the\n Tallinn Manual, rule 152.\n “These sources make clear that neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent.” A. S. Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense” (2012) 52(3) Virginia Journal of International Law 499, www.vjil.org%2Fassets%2Fpdfs%2Fvol52%2Fissue3%2FDeeks_Post_Production.pdf.\n On the other hand, States could also have determined that military aircraft crossing neutral territory are permitted, as long as they are only delivering messages. Instead, the mission of the aircraft appears to be irrelevant.\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.24. Misuse of protective emblems, treachery, and perfidy are often discussed together, and often (if inaccurately) grouped together as perfidy. As perfidy is the most common of the terms in the operations community, it is used as the section title here.\n AP I, Art. 37(1). The United States asserts that customary international law prohibits only killing or injuring by means of perfidy, a position shared by the Tallinn experts. DoD Manual, para. 5.22; Tallinn Manual, rule 60(2).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nintent to betray that confidence.” To be perfidious, a cyber operation would have to both rely on feigning legal protection and proximately result in death or injury (or capture under the international formulation). For example, an email falsely claiming to be from the International Committee of the Red Cross that successfully lured enemy troops to an armed ambush that resulted in their deaths would constitute perfidy. One might also imagine a similar false email that escaped electronic scrutiny because of its purported protected sender that, when opened, introduced malware into the adversary network. If that malware directly led to death or injury – by causing a catastrophic failure of a military installation’s power plant, for example – it would be an example of perfidy. If death or injury did not result, it would still be an example of a misuse of a protective emblem.\nThe Manual also states it would be inappropriate to use “communications that initiate non-hostile relations, such as prisoner exchanges or ceasefires” to gain entry into an enemy’s computer network. The Manual’s support for this proposition is limited to cross-referencing other provisions in the Manual. While the United States may determine this is a good practice, such ruses are not prohibited under LOAC.\nSimilarly, the DoD Manual asserts “it would be prohibited to fabricate messages from an enemy’s Head of State falsely informing that State’s forces that an armistice or cease-fire had been signed.” This, like the prior paragraph’s suggestion that perfidy prohibits false communications that initiate non-hostile relations, is inconsistent with established international law. Such practices may not be good policy, but they are not illegal. According to the 1977 International Red Cross (ICRC) Commentary on Additional Protocol I “the central element of the definition of perfidy is the deliberate claim to legal protection for hostile purposes,” which these lack. There are arguments to the contrary but, as unchivalrous as these situations may be, they do not meet the definition of perfidy.\nCyber operations can be the most effective method of disseminating and obtaining information, so the portions of LOAC related to information are\n AP I, Art. 37(1).  Tallinn Manual, rule 122(3).\n This is an adaptation of an example from the Tallinn Manual, rule 122(5).\n DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.4.  Ibid., ¶¶ 12.2, 5.21.  Ibid., ¶ 16.5.4.\n ICRC, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 (7), 429, www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/RC_commentary-1977.html.\n See S. Watts, “Law of War Perfidy” (2014) 219 Military Law Review 172, www.jagcnet.army.mil /DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/0/02eb1ceb45ec8dd285257cf9004f63cf/$FILE/By%20Sean%20Watts.pdf; and M. J.

AP I requires that medical units and transports be marked as such.78 The Tallinn Manual opined that the marking and protection obligations extend to “[c]omputers, computer networks, and data that form an integral part of the operations or administration of medical units and transports.”79 The DoD Manual is silent on the issue, but it is one that merits consideration and decision so that it can be uniformly implemented. This would help ensure the protection of medical data and protect against accidental misuse of the protective emblem.\n## 3.4 Civilians as Combatants\nThe DoD Manual succinctly summarizes the law on civilian employees’ involvement in cyberwarfare. Civilian employees are permitted to directly participate in hostilities (DPH), but they forfeit any protection they would receive as civilians during the participation. There may be political or other policy rationales for preventing civilians from acting as cyber “trigger-pullers,” but it is permissible under LOAC. One reason DoD is comfortable with this broad reading of appropriate civilian conduct may be that cyberwarfare tends to be conducted from a distance, so there is less concern about increasing the chance that other, non-participating civilians could be mistaken for lawful targets.\n## 4 CONCLUSION\nThis chapter of the Commentary has focused more on developments of the law and shortcomings in the Manual than some other chapters. That is because, despite the lessons learned over many years of armed conflict about how the law of war should apply to best protect civilians and prevent unnecessary suffering, there are gaps in its practical application to cyberwarfare. As noted above, many questions remain about exactly how the law should apply to operations in cyberspace, yet the disruptive and destructive\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\ncapabilities and vulnerabilities available to cyber-actors are increasingly being acknowledged. State custom, practice, and norms are being created rapidly, as well, more through inaction than action. The cyber operations chapter in the Manual offered an opportunity for the United States to guide both the present and the future of cyber operations law, but DoD chose not to grasp it.\nAlthough DoD minimizes the role of military manuals in the development of international law, noting specifically in the DoD Manual that the views \"do not necessarily reflect the views of [other federal agencies] or the US Government as a whole,\" any information the United States provides will carry great weight.80 States are hungry for guidance on how the law of war applies to cyberwarfare, and the US owns the most important voice in the field. This may be why DoD was reluctant to take a bolder stand on the key issues that matter to coalition partners and experts in the field, but it also carries the risk that others, who may not share the interests of the United States with respect to ensuring freedoms of expression and association, may succeed in filling in the gaps.81 In the absence of official guidance, academic works carry more than their usual weight, as well, and the musings of academics are less likely to be constrained by practicality. It would be in DoD's selfish interest to encourage a practical body of law that supports military operations, rather than an idealistic set of pronouncements that will be ignored.\nThe most critical failing of the cyber operations chapter is that it offers no useful ideas on how to apply international law, or even US policy, to the most likely cyber-scenarios. Although military cyberspace operations are in their infancy, useful examples could have been drawn from a short list of real-world events. Cyber-incidents in Estonia (2007), the Republic of Georgia (2008), Iran (2009), and Saudi Arabia (2012) are just a few examples that might have been used to walk through various issues in a way relevant for operations lawyers.82 More recently, Russia's alleged use of cyber-methods to disseminate\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n\nThere remain many unanswered questions regarding the law governing cyberwarfare. The brevity and lack of specificity in the chapter may be an indication that DoD believes the law is insufficiently developed for it to provide guidance. Unfortunately, discomfort with the state of the law does not remove the responsibility of government legal advisors, who are the target audience of the Manual and must provide advice on cyber operations with or without legal direction from the manual. Even if the area is changing rapidly, it would be useful for DoD to provide more complete guidance to the field that would also suggest a framework for the international community. Even providing complete footnotes (as opposed to mostly internal references) would be a great help to practitioners; it would give them a jumping-off point for filling in the substantive gaps left by the Manual.\nDoD seems to be committed to making online changes to the Manual, and has demonstrated some alacrity in doing so. The cyber operations chapter is a likely candidate for significant development in the near future, and we can hope that future revisions will provide more specific guidance on how the law applies, or does not apply, to the emerging area of cyberwarfare.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

Brown\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\nOne of the challenges in addressing the law applicable to cyberwarfare is apparent from a statement in the introduction to the Department of Defense (DoD) Law of War Manual (the Manual). Stephen Preston, who was at the time serving as DoD General Counsel, wrote that the manual “reflects the experience of this Department in applying the law of war in actual military operations, and it will help us remember the hard learned lessons from the past.”¹ Indeed, one indisputable advantage DoD brings to law of war discussions is concrete operational experience. No other organization is as practiced in actually applying the law of war in combat as well as a whole range of other operations. DoD has been involved in combat operations during most of its existence since its founding in 1947. There is no organization more experienced in kinetic warfare, and none better positioned to capture lessons learned.\nThat is not the case with regard to cyberwarfare, however, and the lack of lessons learned from operations is evident in the Manual’s treatment of cyberwarfare. Chapter XVI of the Manual, “Cyber Operations,” provides little in the way of useful guidance for cyber operations lawyers. Although they will be required to provide real-time legal advice on cyber operations, operations lawyers have no definitive sources and few references with sufficient depth to guide their endeavors. In that sense, the cyber operations chapter represents the most substantial shortfall between the Manual’s aspiration in support of US forces and its actuality. In any event, Chapter XVI is by far the shortest chapter of the Manual at only sixteen pages (one of which has only two words of text along with a footnote).\n¹ DoD Law of War Manual, ii.\n337\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nBefore discussing the text, a reflection on the underpinnings of Chapter XVI is in order. As noted above, acknowledged State-sponsored cyber operations are rare to non-existent, so there are few legal lessons to be gleaned from practice between contesting States. That leaves only government policy and academic study as starting points for the construction of a specific body of cyber operations law. In a choice starkly contrasting with the rest of the DoD Manual, the cyber operations chapter relies almost exclusively on two sources: a 1999 DoD Office of General Counsel legal assessment of \"information operations\" and a 2012 speech at the US Cyber Command Legal Conference delivered by the State Department Legal Advisor. Chapter XVI of the Manual has only 44 percent as many footnotes when compared to the next most lightly footnoted chapter. Even more striking, 98.8 percent of the footnotes cite either to the Manual itself or to internal US policy documents and speeches.\nOf particular note, the Manual avoids any mention of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which has been well-received by academics and governments since its original publication in 2013.³ As the Manual's footnotes are meant \"to help practitioners research particular topics discussed in the main text,\" references to at least some of the literature in the field would have been appropriate.⁴ That one of two foundational references dates from the last century and the other is a State Department speech considerably undermines the credibility of the chapter.\n## 2 OVERVIEW\nThe broad scope of the DoD Manual is reflected in the statement of purpose, which is \"to provide information on the law of war to DoD personnel responsible for implementing the law of war and executing military operations.\"⁵ With that in mind, this commentary on the chapter \"Cyber Operations\" is organized according to the four most pressing issues that legal practitioners must address to provide proper legal advice to decision-makers:\n³ DoD, Office of the General Counsel, \"An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations\" (2nd ed., Nov. 1999), repr. in 76 US Naval War College International Law Studies (2002); and H.

What is cyberwar?\n2. What is cyberspying?\n3. What is a cyberattack?\n4. What is a cyberweapon?\nSet out below is a discussion of why these questions are critical, and how well the Manual does as a reference for those who will be providing legal advice on military and other government cyber operations.\n## 2.1 What Is Cyberwar?\nOne of the key answers legal advisors must provide is whether proposed cyber operations would cross the threshold from peace to war. Although it may be outside the normal area of expertise of an operations legal advisor, they still must be prepared to grapple with the thorny issues of how cyber operations might contribute to, or even drive, a transition from peace to war. Because cyberspace by its nature is global, even those operations meant to be collecting tactical information or focused on a specific region can have far-reaching consequences. The intent of cyberspace operators is often difficult to discern, and internet-based operations cross many jurisdictions in making their way to the intended target. That means information-gathering might appear to be something more aggressive. In addition, States might feel compelled to defend their \"cyber-sovereignty\" even from incursions falling short of aggression. Either of these could motivate hostile actions in response, so discerning the distinction between normal cyber operations and those that might be interpreted as aggressive (or transgressive) is of critical importance.\nIn examining that decision space, national decision-makers often ask the question, \"Is this an act of war?\"⁶ This is a consideration of both States considering the wisdom of cyberspace activities, and States who are the victims of unfriendly cyber-acts. The term \"act of war\" is generally meant to be \"any act by a State that would effectively terminate the normal international law of peacetime and activate the international law\n⁶ Although the phrase \"act of war\" is not a legal term, given the difficulties in determining what cyber-events cross the threshold of armed attack, it may be appropriate for States to note the importance of political considerations in their assessments of whether aggressive cyber-activities trigger the right of self-defense. As one cyber-expert puts it, \"calling something an act of war is not a conclusion; it is a decision.\" M. Libicki, \"An Act of War, Even Cyberwar, Is a Decision,\" New York Times (Feb. 28, 2013), www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/02/28/what-is-an-act-of-cyberwar/an-act-of-war-even-cyberwar-is-a-decision.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nof war.”7 In modern usage, an act of war may be considered the equivalent of armed attack or, for the United States, a use of force.8 For cyber operations lawyers advising decision-makers it is appropriate to ask, as the DoD Manual does, whether a certain cyber-act is an unlawful use of force or an international armed attack.\nThe ultimate goal is determining which activity rises to a level that would justify a State’s use of force in self-defense.9 For most States, that would mean the cyber-activity would have to be an armed attack, which would trigger Article 51 of the UN Charter. The United States, however, has consistently asserted that the right of self-defense may be exercised based on a lower threshold: that of a use of force.10 Whichever standard is used, sorting out which cyber-activities would push States to armed conflict is difficult to describe in an abstract ex ante manner.\nThe Manual concludes that if a cyber-activity has kinetic results, it may lawfully be treated the same as if it were caused by non-cyber means. Thus, “if cyber operations cause effects that, if caused by traditional physical means, would be regarded as a use of force . . . then such cyber operations would likely also be regarded as a use of force.”11 The caveat of “likely” in the statement is critical. Cyber-means of warfare are not exempt from the application of international law, but the Manual suggests the application of the law is unsettled. In the kinetic realm, decades of history and precedent are available to study what States consider adequate to support armed self-defense. If the aggressor uses cyber-means, however, the US position is that the legal question cannot be answered merely based on the effects of the attack. States “must evaluate factors including the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action . . ., the target and location, effects and intent, among other possible issues” before determining whether the action constitutes a use of force.12\n7 D.

Norton, 1999), 24, www.crimesofwar.org/a-z-guide/act-of-war-2/.\n8 A proposed bill, H.R.5220 – 114th Congress (2015–2016), was titled The Cyber Act of War Act, yet it would have tasked the President to “develop a policy for determining when an action carried out in cyberspace constitutes a use of force against the United States.” (emphasis added). www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5220/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Cyber+Act+of+War+Act+of+2016%22%5D%7D&amp;resultIndex=1. Some provisions of the Act were included in the Fiscal Year 2017 (National Defense Authorization Act).\n9 The DoD Manual asserts that self-defense is available against non-State actors as well as other States (¶ 16.3.3.4), a position supported by a majority of the Tallinn experts, as well. See Tallinn Manual 2.0, rule 71(19).\n10 See DoD Law of War Manual, Chapter I fn. 230.

For examples of cyber-events that would trigger a resort to war, the Manual lists: using cyber-capabilities to trigger a nuclear plant meltdown, open a dam above a populated area, or disable air traffic control services resulting in airplane crashes. According to the Manual, these instances would \"likely\" be regarded as cyberattacks.¹³ These clear examples are very similar to the ones used in the extensively referenced 1999 paper, but there are subtle differences that may reflect a new understanding of the law in the area. The 1999 paper did not mention the possibility of a nuclear plant meltdown; that may be an understandable sensitivity that creates a clear red-line in the opinion of US legal experts. Somewhat more curiously, the Manual dropped the references to cyber operations that shut down banking systems, financial systems, and public utilities. All of these systems have been the target of cyber operations and, although they were not shut down on a large scale, the exclusion of them from the list of operations that could drive States to war may be a reflection of modern State practice.\nStates have not engaged in armed conflict premised only on cyber-aggression against financial institutions.¹⁴ Similarly, they will not, it seems, wage war over foreign actors establishing a persistent presence on industrial control systems controlling public utilities.¹⁵ State practice seems to be tilting in favor of negotiated agreements between States to refrain from such actions rather than recognizing the resort of armed retaliation. It is possible the non-response from States is because they lack good evidence connecting the actors to States, or even non-State armed groups.¹⁶ State norms and practice regarding cyberspace operations are rapidly forming and being refined. If the US position is that these activities would engender armed self-defense given\n¹³ Ibid., ¶ 16.3.1.\n¹⁴ D. Volz and J.

Brown\nsufficient evidence of the actor, the DoD Manual would have offered an ideal opportunity to state and support that perspective. More likely, the US position is that many activities in this arena fall under the broad rubric of \"espionage,\" activities at which the US excels and does not wish to limit through the international legal structure. Even stating that clearly would have been helpful to the practitioners who will rely on the Manual to form legal opinions in support of cyber operations.\nAnother weakness with the examples the Manual uses is that they are far too facile. A legal advisor with no previous experience in cyber operations could surely have determined that activities causing dams to fail and planes to crash would be international acts of aggression. These obvious examples provide little guidance to practitioners who must advise on where the line is drawn between cyberattacks and lesser cyber-insults. A single example, also from the 1999 paper, may provide more information about where the line between peace and war is drawn, but it is unclear exactly how it fits with the message of the chapter. \"[C]yber operations that cripple a military's logistics systems, and thus its ability to conduct and sustain military operations, might also be considered a use of force under jus ad bellum.\" Compared to a nuclear meltdown and plane crashes, this type of operation seems almost benign.\nAlthough it is not clear what \"crippling\" a military logistics system means, the type of disruptive cyber-action that could be taken against an unclassified logistics system seems similar to the events in Estonia in 2007. In that case, government and economic websites, as well as internet infrastructure sites, were targeted with denial of service attacks that significantly impaired their functioning for three weeks. The events in Estonia were not considered sufficient to support a claim of international self-defense. This interpretation also seems to be a departure from US practice as stated in the Manual. In addition to the failure to react publicly to operations carried out against public utilities and financial systems, the US characterized the 2014 Sony hack, which stole massive amounts of data and was designed to corrupt or destroy more, as \"cyber-vandalism,\" explicitly characterizing it as an activity\n17 K.

The notion of cyber-countermeasures to respond to aggressive but sub-use of force cyber-actions has received significant attention in the international legal community, although it rates little more than a footnote in the chapter.²² Other than in the cyber chapter, the Manual refers to countermeasures as reprisals, which it defines as “acts taken against a party: (1) that would otherwise be unlawful; (2) in order to persuade that party to cease violating the law.”²³ In other words, if undertaken as a countermeasure, unlawful responsive cyber-measures are rendered legal if they remain below the level of a use of force, and are conducted for the purpose of ending the original unlawful activity.\nParagraph 16.3.3.3 of the Manual discusses countermeasures and retorsion together, emphasizing the availability of retorsive responses to cyber-insults, such as diplomatic measures.²⁴ Both are important concepts for cyber operations, but they are distinct. Retorsion in general is defined in paragraph 18.17 of the DoD Manual: “unfriendly conduct, (1) which is not inconsistent with any international obligation of the State engaging in it, and (2) which is done in response to an internationally wrongful act.” An understanding of both in the cyber context is especially critical because it is not always clear when an action in cyberspace is unlawful. When the law on the original action is unclear, responses may be phrased as equivalent; that is, if the initial action was lawful,\n²¹ K.

Brown\nthen the same thing done in return would be retorsion.²⁵ If the triggering action was unlawful, then the response would be a countermeasure, rendered lawful by its status.²⁶\n## 2.2 What Is Cyber-Spying?\nDetermining whether cyber-activities would cross the line from operations to espionage remains a difficult issue for cyber legal advisors. Espionage is generally unregulated under international law but, unlike in the physical world, espionage in cyberspace can be quite difficult to distinguish from the preparation for and conduct of more aggressive military operations.²⁷ The Manual notes that to the extent “cyber operations resemble traditional intelligence and counterintelligence activities, such as unauthorized intrusions into computer networks solely to acquire information, then such cyber operations would likely be treated similarly under international law.”²⁸ This would be more helpful if there were an easy way to ascertain the nature of the cyber-activity in the first place.\nWhether a cyber operation is undertaken for the purpose of espionage or military operations, it normally will require some penetration of the targeted system to gain access. Once access to the system is established, the aggressor might engage in espionage or attack. Even if the mission is espionage, the operator might leave behind malware to facilitate future access to the system, and that future event might be either an attack or spying. How should system penetrations be treated under the law when the actor's intent is unknown? How should pre-implanted capabilities be treated when they are discovered, especially on critical infrastructure or sensitive national security systems? If an espionage event goes wrong and results in accidental damage to a system, does it become an attack at that point? There may be no way for the victim of the event to determine the actor's intent, especially in a timely fashion.\n²⁵ For a discussion on the level of attribution required, see section 3.1 of this chapter.\n²⁶ Not discussed in the Manual is the plea of necessity, which term “is used to denote those exceptional cases where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency.” Draft Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 25, http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf.\n²⁷ “[T]he international legal system generally imposes no sanctions upon nations for acts of espionage except for the political costs of public denunciation.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 18.21.2 fn. 305. See also G. D.

The Manual suggests that the intent of the actor controls, which is perhaps the worst model to choose, because intent is notoriously difficult to discover. The natural anonymity of the internet and the nature of cyber operations makes intent that much more difficult to ascertain. A better reflection of international law is to characterize operations by their effects. For example, espionage is not prohibited by international law, but activities enabling or supporting it may be, depending on their effects. Effects are relatively clear, but misapprehending intent is common and could completely alter the legal range of options available in response.\n## 2.3 What Is a Cyberattack?\nAlthough it is not immediately apparent, the issue of what cyber-activity constitutes an attack in the context of armed conflict is a critical one. US military legal advisors take for granted that the principles of the law of war – distinction, proportionality, humanity, and military necessity – all apply during armed conflict.²⁹ With regard to kinetic attacks, of course, these principles do apply. The challenge with wartime cyber operations is that they can be quite disruptive without being destructive. Legal advisors must be able to distinguish operations that must refrain from targeting civilian objects, for example, and those that fall below the attack threshold.\nThe cyber operations chapter takes note of the issue in a general way, pointing to paragraph 5.4 for details on how attacks are covered by the law of armed conflict (LOAC). That paragraph iterates that attacks must be carried out in compliance with the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions, but paragraph 16.5.2 notes with some circularity that “[a] cyber operation that does not constitute an attack is not restricted by the rules that apply to attacks.” It goes on to give examples of operations that would not constitute attacks: defacing government web pages; briefly disrupting internet service in a minor way; briefly disrupting, disabling, or interfering with communications; or disseminating propaganda. Unfortunately, these examples do little to draw the line between aggressive, non-attack cyber-activity and activity that would qualify as an attack. For example, do the qualifications in the examples mean that DoD would label a brief disruption of internet service in\n²⁹ See Ray Murphy’s contribution to this book in Chapter 7. Chapter II of the DoD Manual lists the principles of the law of war as military necessity, humanity, proportionality, distinction, and honor. The principle of honor seems particularly attenuated from cyberwarfare; it is not discussed in the Manual with reference to cyberwarfare, and will be omitted here, as well.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\na major way an attack? Further, it is unclear that the principles of LOAC apply to any cyber-activity that stops short of causing damage, destruction, or injury. This gap in the law has led some experts to suggest that LOAC ought to apply to cyber operations that affect the functionality of computer systems without actually damaging them.³⁰\nThe Manual states “[i]f a cyber operation constitutes an attack, then the law of war rules on conducting attacks must be applied to those cyber operations.”³¹ Of course, this invites the question of what constitutes an attack. Operational legal advisors who consult the manual for guidance on this question will learn that wartime operations that destroy computers are attacks.³² While this is true, it is also the simplest case – kinetic effects directly caused by cyber operations clearly are attacks. On the more difficult questions of whether loss of functionality of a computer system, without damage to it, is an attack, or whether harm significantly attenuated from the original event, would similarly constitute an attack, the Manual is silent.³³\nAfter identifying the way cyberwarfare techniques might not be governed by the principles of the law of war, the Manual suggests that the case is not closed. “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.”³⁴ This seems to contradict an earlier statement in the Manual, and may be read as *lex ferenda* rather than an articulation of the law.³⁵ Legal advisors who rely on the Manual for guidance would be better served if the Manual made clear this is a US policy rather than the law. The United States might well put such policy restrictions in its own rules of engagement, but if it is meant to be read as a restriction grounded in law, the Manual should have provided some affirmative authority for this belief.\nIn a legal advisor’s analysis of whether a cyber-activity constitutes an attack, the Manual notes the importance of considering whether the effects created\n³⁰ See M. N. Schmitt, “Rewired Warfare: Rethinking the Law of Cyber Attack” (2014) 96(893) *International Review of the Red Cross* 189, www.icrc.org/en/international-review/article/rewired-warfare-rethinking-law-cyber-attack; and C.

Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2014), 221. “[T]he crux of the matter is whether the effect is a reasonably likely or foreseeable consequence of the operation on the basis of the information available at the time of the attack.”\n³⁴ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.2. ³⁵ *Ibid.*, ¶ 5.12.1.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n347\nare temporary or reversible, but it is unclear why this would be important under the law. Neither is that distinction explained in the text. The terms are not relevant with reference to kinetic methods of warfare and, as there are no cyber-specific agreements governing cyberwarfare, there should be no additional restrictions on operations in the law – though the United States is free to limit its own operations by policy. One problem with this particular provision is that there is no agreed concept of “reversible” effects, and even “temporary” has no set meaning in this context. Presumably, temporary means something other than merely non-permanent, or else it would be synonymous with reversible. Reversible is similarly ambiguous, as a reversible cyber-effect could either prohibit the deletion of data or permit the deletion of data if a backup exists that could be used to return the targeted system to its original state. Without more detail, it is not clear that these terms add much meaning to the section.\nIn this section of the chapter, DoD reveals a deep unease with the use of cyber-capabilities in war. The cautious approach regarding cyber-capabilities is perhaps not what one would expect when cyberwarfare seems less likely than kinetic means to cause civilian casualties and damage. Nevertheless, when the Manual assesses the application of the principle of proportionality to kinetic attacks, it specifically excludes any inconvenience to civilians from consideration, noting that such ancillary aspects of a military attack “need not be considered.”³⁶ In contrast, the Manual mandates consideration of “civilian inconvenience” even in cyber operations that are too minor to be considered attacks under the law of war. It is logically inconsistent – and not a reflection of international law – to require no consideration of inconvenience before conducting a lethal attack, but to require that higher standard before a non-lethal cyber-action aiming to achieve the same result, such as disrupting military communications over a dual-use network node.³⁷ If this is US policy, it ought to be set out as policy, and could be reflected in rules of engagement, but it is potentially confusing to cyber operators who refer to the Manual as a source of law.\nAlthough not listed as one of the distinctive principles of the law of war in the Manual, the cyber operations chapter discusses the obligation of precautions. There are two precautions-related requirements under generalized LOAC. The first is precautions in the attack, which requires States, when engaging in an attack, to take all feasible steps to minimize harm to the civilian\n³⁶ Ibid., ¶ 5.12.1.2.\n³⁷ “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack,’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.” Ibid., ¶ 16.5.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\npopulation.³⁸ The second is precautions against the effects of attacks, which requires States to “take other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.”³⁹ This second might be thought of as an obligation of defenders to ensure that military and strategic objects are not commingled with civilian objects in a way that would make it impossible for attackers to distinguish between the two.\nFor the reasons discussed above, precautions in the attack is not a particularly intriguing topic in a cyber-specific context. Cyber-events not qualifying as attacks are not covered by this provision of law, and those that are attacks present the same issues as traditional kinetic warfare. While it is true that destructive cyberattacks could result in the loss of civilian access to internet-based services, for example, so might kinetic attacks. Bombing or destroying bridges and electrical power infrastructure, often part of traditional military campaigns, also frequently results in loss of connectivity due to broken communications lines and lack of power. The consideration of these ancillary civilian effects is the same whether the instrumentality is cyber or kinetic.\nBy contrast, cyberspace operations present a unique opportunity to apply the principle obligating defenders to avoid commingling civilian and military objects. The cyber-infrastructure States use for military and national security missions is the same as that used for civilian activities from personal communications to providing essential utilities such as electricity and water. It might be argued that in choosing to commingle civilian and military capabilities on a single infrastructure, States all violated the defensive application of precautions, leaving the internet more susceptible to attack as a dual-use target.\nIn the cyber context, Manual paragraph 16.5.3 proclaims that “[p]arties to a conflict must take feasible precautions to reduce the risk of incidental harm to the civilian population and other protected persons and objects.” It is unclear why the two aspects of precautions would be conflated in the cyber chapter. For clarity, the cyber-precautions provisions should track the language in AP I and in the other provisions of the Manual.\n³⁸ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of Aug. 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 (AP I), Art. 57. “Combatants must take feasible precautions in planning and conducting attacks to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and other persons and objects protected from being made the object of attack.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.11.\n³⁹ AP I, Art. 58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCommentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n349\n## 2.4 What Is the Definition of a Cyberweapon?\nBoth international and US law require that weapons be reviewed for legal compliance before they may be acquired or used. AP I codifies the requirement to conduct legal reviews of weapons.⁴⁰ The United States is not a party to AP I, but its practice of conducting legal reviews of weapons is consistent with the requirement, and predated AP I.⁴¹ DoD requires that weapons reviews determine whether a proposed weapon's intended use is calculated to cause superfluous injury, whether it is inherently indiscriminate, and whether it is specifically prohibited, for example by treaty.⁴²\nCyberspace operations have introduced new challenges in complying with what is ordinarily a straightforward provision of law. Recognizing that cyberweapons must be subjected to a legal review before acquisition or use does not answer the question of what, exactly, a cyberweapon is. In the case of more traditional weapons, it is generally straightforward to recognize that something is a weapon. Defining \"cyberweapon,\" on the other hand, can be quite tricky. It is difficult to know how to define cyberweapons, as the Manual recognizes: \"Not all cyber capabilities ... constitute a weapon or weapons system.\"⁴³ Nearly every function of a modern military is at least supported by cyber capabilities. Logistics, medical processes, communications, etc. are all highly dependent on computers and networks, yet those particular capabilities would not be classified as weapons. In the case of offensive capabilities, computers, networks, and servers might all be considered part of a cyberweapons system, and legal reviews of the hardware would be straightforward (and pointless, because the same equipment can be used to support civilian and defensive functions). The heart of a cyber-capability is the code on which it is based, and the Manual offers little practical guidance on the proper classification of malware or other commonly encountered cyber techniques.\nRather than take on the difficult task of providing a basis for determining whether a cyber-capability is a weapon, the Manual punts, noting that the military services address which cyber-capabilities require legal reviews. This would be more helpful if the services actually did address the issue. The pertinent Army regulation is dated 1979, and the Navy's 2011 regulation lacks cyber-specific language. Only the Air Force has addressed the issues\n⁴⁰ AP I, Art. 36.\n⁴¹ The Defense Acquisition System, DoD Directive 5000.1, ¶ E1.1.15 (certified current Nov. 20, 2007); DoD Manual, ¶ 6.2.3.\n⁴² DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 6.2.2. ⁴³ Ibid., ¶ 16.6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nsurrounding cyberweapons specifically, so its instruction provides the DoD guidance by default.⁴⁴\nThe Air Force defines “weapons” as “devices designed to kill, injure, disable or temporarily incapacitate people, or destroy, damage or temporarily incapacitate property or materiel.”⁴⁵ The Air Force instruction also defines a “cyber capability” as “any device or software payload intended to disrupt, deny, degrade, negate, impair or destroy adversarial computer systems, data, activities or capabilities,” but excludes “a device or software that is solely intended to provide access to an adversarial computer system for data exploitation.”⁴⁶\nThe Air Force directs that “all cyber capabilities being developed, bought, built, modified or otherwise acquired by the Air Force . . . are reviewed for legality under LOAC, domestic law and international law prior to their acquisition for use in a conflict or other military operation.”⁴⁷ Unlike kinetic means of warfare, cyber means largely consist of intellectual property in the form of computer code. Physical weapons must be designed and manufactured, so changes tend to be infrequent. In contrast, computer code may be changed instantly and easily. It is often altered multiple times in the course of an operation.⁴⁸ The practical problem created is that it appears dozens or hundreds of legal reviews might be required for a single cyber capability.\nAn alternate view of the problem is provided in the Tallinn Manual, which addresses the question of what constitutes a cyberweapon in rule 103. “[C]yber weapons are ‘cyber means of warfare’ that are used, designed, or intended to be used to cause injury to, or death of, persons or damage to, or destruction of, objects, that is, that result in the consequences required for qualification of a cyber operation as an attack.”⁴⁹ In the Tallinn Manual cyberattack is defined as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁰ DoD could consider adopting a modified version of this definition, making a simple change: “design, use, or intended use reasonably capable of causing.” This change would exclude imaginable but remote possibilities of harm that exist with every computer program, but would continue to create\n⁴⁴ Whether weapons reviews are controlled by international law or by US policy, it would be preferable to have a single interpretation from DoD, rather than potentially conflicting interpretations provided by individual services.\n⁴⁵ AFI 51-402, Legal Reviews of Weapons and Cyber Capabilities (July 27, 2011), 6.\n⁴⁶ Ibid., 5. ⁴⁷ Ibid., para 1.1.2.\n⁴⁸ See discussion in G.

However, the Air Force definition described above may provide an indication that leaving aside the subjective element of intent might be unacceptable to the United States because the definition would then capture cyber-espionage tools under the definition of weapon.⁵¹\nEven a workable definition of cyberweapons does not answer all the challenges. The Manual provides no guidance to help determine what “inherently indiscriminate” means with regard to a cyber-capability. Malware is often spread indiscriminately but may by design have no significant negative effect on untargeted computer systems. Malware may use untargeted systems as vectors to reach its intended target, where it might have great effect. This was the case, for example, in the Stuxnet incident, where malware was spread to over 100,000 computers, but had no significant effects until it reached the computer system at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, where it destroyed over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges.⁵² The Manual takes no position on whether inert code copied indiscriminately and without permission to the hard drives of thousands of computers makes use of that malware unlawful. Based on the extant State practice to date, the answer is probably “no,” but the Manual would be a good vehicle for putting the issue to rest.\nCyber “weaponry” is a controversial issue in the larger national security community, as well. The tools and vulnerabilities necessary to conduct computer- and network-based operations for national security missions can also be used against civilian systems in support of intelligence and criminal activity. The US Government has a process to determine whether cyber-vulnerabilities should be disclosed in order to protect the public or held as part of the cyberarsenal to be used in support of national security.⁵³ Some citizen groups argue that States have an obligation to disclose cyber-vulnerabilities they discover so the public can protect themselves from exploitation.⁵⁴ States have been less keen to recognize that there is such an obligation, as it would essentially\n⁵¹ One way to handle the espionage/operations overlap on this issue is to simply exclude espionage tools by intent. Another way would be to accept that weapons can be used in espionage in ways that are not attacks, such as using a machete to cut through vegetation on a fence line. The operation should be analyzed by its effects rather than by its means.\n⁵² K. Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day (New York: Broadway Books, 2014), 96, 175.\n⁵³ A. Schwartz and R. Knake, “Government’s Role in Vulnerability Disclosure,” The Cyber Security Project, Discussion Paper 2016-04 (June 2016), http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/Vulnerability%20Disclosure%20Web-Final4.pdf.\n⁵⁴ D.

Brown\nrequire them to render obsolete many of the cyber-capabilities they acquire or develop.\nAn inability to define what computer code constitutes a weapon also affects arms trade agreements. For example, the Wassenaar Arrangement, developed to control the transfer of arms and dual-use technologies, was amended in 2013 to include some cyber-capabilities.⁵⁵ One of the new prohibited categories is intrusion software, which is software “specially designed or modified to avoid detection by ‘monitoring tools’, or to defeat ‘protective countermeasures’, of a computer or network capable device, and performing [data extraction, data modification, or installation of malware].” The intent of the language was to keep powerful computer tools out of the hands of repressive regimes, but the additions also prevented university researchers and law-abiding cyber-intrusion specialists from properly conducting research, because they were unable to share code across national borders.⁵⁶\nGiven the range of complex issues surrounding cyberweapons, some indication of the appropriate direction here would have been useful not just to US practitioners, but also to other States that look to the United States for leadership in international law, and particularly value the DoD role in clarifying LOAC. DoD has more experience than any organization in the world at assessing weapons for compliance with international law. It may be as befuddled as everyone about how to define and assess cyber weapons, but setting a single DoD policy, even an imperfect one, would have been a superior course than leaving the issue to be determined by individuals across the US services and the international community, perhaps in very different ways.\n## 3 OTHER ISSUES\nThe major issues cyber operations law advisors must be equipped to field are discussed above. The other commonly recurring issues are attribution, neutrality, perfidy, and the role of civilians. All of these are noted in the Manual and are discussed below.\n2013), www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/01/zero_day_exploits_should_the_hacker_gray_market_be_regulated.html.\n⁵⁵ C.

Because of the internet's architecture and operation, concealing the identity and location of actors is relatively simple, while discovering the same can be an expensive and time-consuming process that often fails to deliver a certain answer.⁵⁷ The Manual says but little about attribution, merely noting that it is difficult. If the goal of the Manual is to be useful to practitioners, this is a section that could be more complete. For example, there is no indication of what level of proof should be required for various responses.\nThe Tallinn Manual offers the guidance that, while pinpointing the origin of an attack does not mean the State owner of the infrastructure is responsible for the attack, it does provide a sort of rebuttable presumption that the host State is responsible.⁵⁸ And, although there is no set standard of proof necessary to engage in countermeasures, the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility notes that the standard for attribution in such cases is \"reasonable certainty.\"⁵⁹ Legal advisors are not starting from scratch when determining the appropriate standard to apply; international law does provide guidance that is helpful, even in the new area of cyber operations. It would be useful for this standard, at least, to be referenced in the Manual.\n## 3.2 Neutrality\nNeutrality plays a limited role in the cyberspace context. Neutrality under the law of war only applies during international armed conflict and conflicts between States have become very much the exception. Non-international armed conflict (NIAC) is common, however, and aggressive cyber-activities in support of NIAC, and in support of sub-armed conflict State activity, is common.⁶⁰ The Manual's discussion of when neutrality principles apply is\n⁵⁷ Even in two high-profile instances where the US Government asserted attribution was certain, controversy about the identity of the culprits continued for months. Cybersecurity experts seem to have as many different opinions as lawyers. \"FBI Still Believes North Korea Is Responsible for Sony Hack,\" CBS News (Dec. 30, 2014), www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-still-believes-north-korea-is-responsible-for-sony-hack/; S.

Brown\nbased on both the 1907 Hague Convention and on the opinion of international legal experts.⁶¹ Of particular note, the chapter in the Manual addressing the law of neutrality is silent with respect to cyber operations. In DoD’s interpretation, some principles of neutrality apply in NIACs, although beyond respecting sovereignty, which is a principle of international law independent of neutrality, it is unclear which specific principles apply to belligerents in such conflicts.⁶²\nWith regard to non-participating States in NIACs, the Manual cites the UN General Assembly: “Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.”⁶³ At some point, such activities would result in the offending State becoming a party to the conflict, converting it to an international armed conflict (IAC), so the Manual is apparently citing the language to capture relatively low-level, indirect assistance.⁶⁴ In any event, the Manual suggests that nonbelligerent States in NIACs should refrain from “acquiescing in organized activities” within their territories when the activities are directed to acts of civil strife or terrorism.\nThe Manual suggests a contrasting approach in the cyber context, asserting that a State’s neutrality (a term that appears to be used in this chapter to refer to both neutral States and, unconventionally, to nonparticipating States in NIACs) is not dependent on whether it polices its cyber-infrastructure, as long as it does not take steps to discriminate among users of its infrastructure. The Manual explicitly notes that even if data could be characterized as a cyber weapon or otherwise could cause destructive effects in a belligerent State, relaying it would not impact a State’s status as a neutral.\nThe disconnect here is probably more about trying to govern cyberspace with a treaty over a hundred years old than it is about neutrality. The Manual fails to take into account that aggressive computer code, in the form of data packets transmitted over the internet, can be the actual means of waging war, not merely communications about waging war, which is what Hague V was meant to address. There is little logical distinction between allowing the transmission of a virtual attack across neutral infrastructure and allowing the\n⁶¹ DoD Law of War Manual, § 15.2.1 and Chapter XVII fn. 211. ⁶² Ibid., § 15.2.1.3.\n⁶³ Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, annex to UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV), UN Doc.

If States do have sovereign rights over code passing through internet infrastructure located in their territory, they ought to have the responsibility to ensure the code they host is doing no harm. Otherwise, the host State is essentially protecting cyber-aggressors from effective action by victim States, which is inconsistent with the application of neutrality in the physical world.⁶⁶ The ultimate conclusion may be left to whether States decide packets of information making up cyber-means of warfare are more akin to communications or to weapons.⁶⁷\n## 3.3 Perfidy and Protective Emblems\nThe issue of perfidy has limited practical application in cyberwarfare, but it frequently comes up in conversations with cyber operators. The issue is briefly discussed in the Manual under “Improper Use of Signs.”⁶⁸ International law prohibits using perfidy to kill, injure, or capture an adversary.⁶⁹ Perfidy is widely understood as “[a]cts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to receive, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the\n⁶⁵ Tallinn Manual, rule 152.\n⁶⁶ “These sources make clear that neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent.” A. S. Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense” (2012) 52(3) Virginia Journal of International Law 499, www.vjil.org%2Fassets%2Fpdfs%2Fvol52%2Fissue3%2FDeeks_Post_Production.pdf.\n⁶⁷ On the other hand, States could also have determined that military aircraft crossing neutral territory are permitted, as long as they are only delivering messages. Instead, the mission of the aircraft appears to be irrelevant.\n⁶⁸ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.24. Misuse of protective emblems, treachery, and perfidy are often discussed together, and often (if inaccurately) grouped together as perfidy. As perfidy is the most common of the terms in the operations community, it is used as the section title here.\n⁶⁹ AP I, Art. 37(1). The United States asserts that customary international law prohibits only killing or injuring by means of perfidy, a position shared by the Tallinn experts. DoD Manual, para. 5.22; Tallinn Manual, rule 60(2).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\nintent to betray that confidence.”⁷⁰ To be perfidious, a cyber operation would have to both rely on feigning legal protection and proximately result in death or injury (or capture under the international formulation).⁷¹ For example, an email falsely claiming to be from the International Committee of the Red Cross that successfully lured enemy troops to an armed ambush that resulted in their deaths would constitute perfidy.⁷² One might also imagine a similar false email that escaped electronic scrutiny because of its purported protected sender that, when opened, introduced malware into the adversary network. If that malware directly led to death or injury – by causing a catastrophic failure of a military installation’s power plant, for example – it would be an example of perfidy. If death or injury did not result, it would still be an example of a misuse of a protective emblem.\nThe Manual also states it would be inappropriate to use “communications that initiate non-hostile relations, such as prisoner exchanges or ceasefires” to gain entry into an enemy’s computer network.⁷³ The Manual’s support for this proposition is limited to cross-referencing other provisions in the Manual. While the United States may determine this is a good practice, such ruses are not prohibited under LOAC.⁷⁴\nSimilarly, the DoD Manual asserts “it would be prohibited to fabricate messages from an enemy’s Head of State falsely informing that State’s forces that an armistice or cease-fire had been signed.”⁷⁵ This, like the prior paragraph’s suggestion that perfidy prohibits false communications that initiate non-hostile relations, is inconsistent with established international law. Such practices may not be good policy, but they are not illegal. According to the 1977 International Red Cross (ICRC) Commentary on Additional Protocol I “the central element of the definition of perfidy is the deliberate claim to legal protection for hostile purposes,” which these lack.⁷⁶ There are arguments to the contrary but, as unchivalrous as these situations may be, they do not meet the definition of perfidy.⁷⁷\nCyber operations can be the most effective method of disseminating and obtaining information, so the portions of LOAC related to information are\n⁷⁰ AP I, Art. 37(1). ⁷¹ Tallinn Manual, rule 122(3).\n⁷² This is an adaptation of an example from the Tallinn Manual, rule 122(5).\n⁷³ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.4. ⁷⁴ Ibid., ¶¶ 12.2, 5.21. ⁷⁵ Ibid., ¶ 16.5.4.\n⁷⁶ ICRC, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 (7), 429, www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/RC_commentary-1977.html.\n⁷⁷ See S.

Protective emblems, such as the Red Cross (and other protected emblems), enemy prisoners of war (EPW) protections, and the blue shield that protects cultural property publicly note that certain facilities or individuals are protected from direct attack. Determining how best to translate the requirement of and respect for physical signage to virtual demarcation is still underway.\nAn area that is insufficiently addressed in the law is medical information. AP I requires that medical units and transports be marked as such.78 The Tallinn Manual opined that the marking and protection obligations extend to “[c]omputers, computer networks, and data that form an integral part of the operations or administration of medical units and transports.”79 The DoD Manual is silent on the issue, but it is one that merits consideration and decision so that it can be uniformly implemented. This would help ensure the protection of medical data and protect against accidental misuse of the protective emblem.\n## 3.4 Civilians as Combatants\nThe DoD Manual succinctly summarizes the law on civilian employees’ involvement in cyberwarfare. Civilian employees are permitted to directly participate in hostilities (DPH), but they forfeit any protection they would receive as civilians during the participation. There may be political or other policy rationales for preventing civilians from acting as cyber “trigger-pullers,” but it is permissible under LOAC. One reason DoD is comfortable with this broad reading of appropriate civilian conduct may be that cyberwarfare tends to be conducted from a distance, so there is less concern about increasing the chance that other, non-participating civilians could be mistaken for lawful targets.\n## 4 CONCLUSION\nThis chapter of the Commentary has focused more on developments of the law and shortcomings in the Manual than some other chapters. That is because, despite the lessons learned over many years of armed conflict about how the law of war should apply to best protect civilians and prevent unnecessary suffering, there are gaps in its practical application to cyberwarfare. As noted above, many questions remain about exactly how the law should apply to operations in cyberspace, yet the disruptive and destructive\n78 AP I, Art. 18. 79 Tallinn Manual, rule 132.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\ncapabilities and vulnerabilities available to cyber-actors are increasingly being acknowledged. State custom, practice, and norms are being created rapidly, as well, more through inaction than action. The cyber operations chapter in the Manual offered an opportunity for the United States to guide both the present and the future of cyber operations law, but DoD chose not to grasp it.\nAlthough DoD minimizes the role of military manuals in the development of international law, noting specifically in the DoD Manual that the views \"do not necessarily reflect the views of [other federal agencies] or the US Government as a whole,\" any information the United States provides will carry great weight.80 States are hungry for guidance on how the law of war applies to cyberwarfare, and the US owns the most important voice in the field. This may be why DoD was reluctant to take a bolder stand on the key issues that matter to coalition partners and experts in the field, but it also carries the risk that others, who may not share the interests of the United States with respect to ensuring freedoms of expression and association, may succeed in filling in the gaps.81 In the absence of official guidance, academic works carry more than their usual weight, as well, and the musings of academics are less likely to be constrained by practicality. It would be in DoD's selfish interest to encourage a practical body of law that supports military operations, rather than an idealistic set of pronouncements that will be ignored.\nThe most critical failing of the cyber operations chapter is that it offers no useful ideas on how to apply international law, or even US policy, to the most likely cyber-scenarios. Although military cyberspace operations are in their infancy, useful examples could have been drawn from a short list of real-world events. Cyber-incidents in Estonia (2007), the Republic of Georgia (2008), Iran (2009), and Saudi Arabia (2012) are just a few examples that might have been used to walk through various issues in a way relevant for operations lawyers.82 More recently, Russia's alleged use of cyber-methods to disseminate\n80 DoD Law of War Manual, iv.

The brevity and lack of specificity in the chapter may be an indication that DoD believes the law is insufficiently developed for it to provide guidance. Unfortunately, discomfort with the state of the law does not remove the responsibility of government legal advisors, who are the target audience of the Manual and must provide advice on cyber operations with or without legal direction from the manual. Even if the area is changing rapidly, it would be useful for DoD to provide more complete guidance to the field that would also suggest a framework for the international community. Even providing complete footnotes (as opposed to mostly internal references) would be a great help to practitioners; it would give them a jumping-off point for filling in the substantive gaps left by the Manual.\nDoD seems to be committed to making online changes to the Manual, and has demonstrated some alacrity in doing so. The cyber operations chapter is a likely candidate for significant development in the near future, and we can hope that future revisions will provide more specific guidance on how the law applies, or does not apply, to the emerging area of cyberwarfare.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

Brown ## 1 INTRODUCTION One of the challenges in addressing the law applicable to cyberwarfare is apparent from a statement in the introduction to the Department of Defense (DoD) Law of War Manual (the Manual). Stephen Preston, who was at the time serving as DoD General Counsel, wrote that the manual “reflects the experience of this Department in applying the law of war in actual military operations, and it will help us remember the hard learned lessons from the past.”¹ Indeed, one indisputable advantage DoD brings to law of war discussions is concrete operational experience. No other organization is as practiced in actually applying the law of war in combat as well as a whole range of other operations. DoD has been involved in combat operations during most of its existence since its founding in 1947. There is no organization more experienced in kinetic warfare, and none better positioned to capture lessons learned.\nThat is not the case with regard to cyberwarfare, however, and the lack of lessons learned from operations is evident in the Manual’s treatment of cyberwarfare. Chapter XVI of the Manual, “Cyber Operations,” provides little in the way of useful guidance for cyber operations lawyers. Although they will be required to provide real-time legal advice on cyber operations, operations lawyers have no definitive sources and few references with sufficient depth to guide their endeavors. In that sense, the cyber operations chapter represents the most substantial shortfall between the Manual’s aspiration in support of US forces and its actuality. In any event, Chapter XVI is by far the shortest chapter of the Manual at only sixteen pages (one of which has only two words of text along with a footnote).\n¹ DoD Law of War Manual, ii.\n\nGary D. Brown Before discussing the text, a reflection on the underpinnings of Chapter XVI is in order. As noted above, acknowledged State-sponsored cyber operations are rare to non-existent, so there are few legal lessons to be gleaned from practice between contesting States. That leaves only government policy and academic study as starting points for the construction of a specific body of cyber operations law. In a choice starkly contrasting with the rest of the DoD Manual, the cyber operations chapter relies almost exclusively on two sources: a 1999 DoD Office of General Counsel legal assessment of\"information operations\"and a 2012 speech at the US Cyber Command Legal Conference delivered by the State Department Legal Advisor. Chapter XVI of the Manual has only 44 percent as many footnotes when compared to the next most lightly footnoted chapter. Even more striking, 98.8 percent of the footnotes cite either to the Manual itself or to internal US policy documents and speeches.\nOf particular note, the Manual avoids any mention of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which has been well-received by academics and governments since its original publication in 2013.³ As the Manual's footnotes are meant\"to help practitioners research particular topics discussed in the main text,\"references to at least some of the literature in the field would have been appropriate.⁴ That one of two foundational references dates from the last century and the other is a State Department speech considerably undermines the credibility of the chapter.\n## 2 OVERVIEW The broad scope of the DoD Manual is reflected in the statement of purpose, which is\"to provide information on the law of war to DoD personnel responsible for implementing the law of war and executing military operations.\"⁵ With that in mind, this commentary on the chapter\"Cyber Operations\"is organized according to the four most pressing issues that legal practitioners must address to provide proper legal advice to decision-makers: ³ DoD, Office of the General Counsel,\"An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations\"(2nd ed., Nov. 1999), repr. in 76 US Naval War College International Law Studies (2002); and H.

Koh, Legal Advisor, Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace,\"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery to the USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference\"(Sept. 18, 2012), repr. in 54 Harvard International Law Journal Online (Dec. 2012), 3, www.harvardilj.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Koh-Speech-to-Publish1.pdf. About half of the footnotes are to other portions of the DoD Manual.\n³ Since the publication of the DoD Manual, the Tallinn Manual has been updated to version 2.0, published in 2017.

Although it may be outside the normal area of expertise of an operations legal advisor, they still must be prepared to grapple with the thorny issues of how cyber operations might contribute to, or even drive, a transition from peace to war. Because cyberspace by its nature is global, even those operations meant to be collecting tactical information or focused on a specific region can have far-reaching consequences. The intent of cyberspace operators is often difficult to discern, and internet-based operations cross many jurisdictions in making their way to the intended target. That means information-gathering might appear to be something more aggressive. In addition, States might feel compelled to defend their\"cyber-sovereignty\"even from incursions falling short of aggression. Either of these could motivate hostile actions in response, so discerning the distinction between normal cyber operations and those that might be interpreted as aggressive (or transgressive) is of critical importance.\nIn examining that decision space, national decision-makers often ask the question,\"Is this an act of war?\"⁶ This is a consideration of both States considering the wisdom of cyberspace activities, and States who are the victims of unfriendly cyber-acts. The term\"act of war\"is generally meant to be\"any act by a State that would effectively terminate the normal international law of peacetime and activate the international law ⁶ Although the phrase\"act of war\"is not a legal term, given the difficulties in determining what cyber-events cross the threshold of armed attack, it may be appropriate for States to note the importance of political considerations in their assessments of whether aggressive cyber-activities trigger the right of self-defense. As one cyber-expert puts it,\"calling something an act of war is not a conclusion; it is a decision.\"M. Libicki,\"An Act of War, Even Cyberwar, Is a Decision,\"New York Times (Feb. 28, 2013), www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/02/28/what-is-an-act-of-cyberwar/an-act-of-war-even-cyberwar-is-a-decision.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Gary D. Brown of war.”7 In modern usage, an act of war may be considered the equivalent of armed attack or, for the United States, a use of force.8 For cyber operations lawyers advising decision-makers it is appropriate to ask, as the DoD Manual does, whether a certain cyber-act is an unlawful use of force or an international armed attack.\nThe ultimate goal is determining which activity rises to a level that would justify a State’s use of force in self-defense.9 For most States, that would mean the cyber-activity would have to be an armed attack, which would trigger Article 51 of the UN Charter. The United States, however, has consistently asserted that the right of self-defense may be exercised based on a lower threshold: that of a use of force.10 Whichever standard is used, sorting out which cyber-activities would push States to armed conflict is difficult to describe in an abstract ex ante manner.\nThe Manual concludes that if a cyber-activity has kinetic results, it may lawfully be treated the same as if it were caused by non-cyber means. Thus, “if cyber operations cause effects that, if caused by traditional physical means, would be regarded as a use of force... then such cyber operations would likely also be regarded as a use of force.”11 The caveat of “likely” in the statement is critical. Cyber-means of warfare are not exempt from the application of international law, but the Manual suggests the application of the law is unsettled. In the kinetic realm, decades of history and precedent are available to study what States consider adequate to support armed self-defense. If the aggressor uses cyber-means, however, the US position is that the legal question cannot be answered merely based on the effects of the attack. States “must evaluate factors including the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action..., the target and location, effects and intent, among other possible issues” before determining whether the action constitutes a use of force.12 https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations States have not engaged in armed conflict premised only on cyber-aggression against financial institutions.¹⁴ Similarly, they will not, it seems, wage war over foreign actors establishing a persistent presence on industrial control systems controlling public utilities.¹⁵ State practice seems to be tilting in favor of negotiated agreements between States to refrain from such actions rather than recognizing the resort of armed retaliation. It is possible the non-response from States is because they lack good evidence connecting the actors to States, or even non-State armed groups.¹⁶ State norms and practice regarding cyberspace operations are rapidly forming and being refined. If the US position is that these activities would engender armed self-defense given ¹³ Ibid., ¶ 16.3.1.\n¹⁴ D. Volz and J.

Brown sufficient evidence of the actor, the DoD Manual would have offered an ideal opportunity to state and support that perspective. More likely, the US position is that many activities in this arena fall under the broad rubric of\"espionage,\"activities at which the US excels and does not wish to limit through the international legal structure.[17] Even stating that clearly would have been helpful to the practitioners who will rely on the Manual to form legal opinions in support of cyber operations.\nAnother weakness with the examples the Manual uses is that they are far too facile. A legal advisor with no previous experience in cyber operations could surely have determined that activities causing dams to fail and planes to crash would be international acts of aggression. These obvious examples provide little guidance to practitioners who must advise on where the line is drawn between cyberattacks and lesser cyber-insults. A single example, also from the 1999 paper, may provide more information about where the line between peace and war is drawn, but it is unclear exactly how it fits with the message of the chapter.\"[C]yber operations that cripple a military's logistics systems, and thus its ability to conduct and sustain military operations, might also be considered a use of force under jus ad bellum.\"[18] Compared to a nuclear meltdown and plane crashes, this type of operation seems almost benign.\nAlthough it is not clear what\"crippling\"a military logistics system means, the type of disruptive cyber-action that could be taken against an unclassified logistics system seems similar to the events in Estonia in 2007. In that case, government and economic websites, as well as internet infrastructure sites, were targeted with denial of service attacks that significantly impaired their functioning for three weeks.[19] The events in Estonia were not considered sufficient to support a claim of international self-defense.[20] This interpretation also seems to be a departure from US practice as stated in the Manual. In addition to the failure to react publicly to operations carried out against public utilities and financial systems, the US characterized the 2014 Sony hack, which stole massive amounts of data and was designed to corrupt or destroy more, as\"cyber-vandalism,\"explicitly characterizing it as an activity https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations Even if a cyber-activity is determined not to cross the armed attack/use of force threshold, victims are not without military recourse. The notion of cyber-countermeasures to respond to aggressive but sub-use of force cyber-actions has received significant attention in the international legal community, although it rates little more than a footnote in the chapter.²² Other than in the cyber chapter, the Manual refers to countermeasures as reprisals, which it defines as “acts taken against a party: (1) that would otherwise be unlawful; (2) in order to persuade that party to cease violating the law.”²³ In other words, if undertaken as a countermeasure, unlawful responsive cyber-measures are rendered legal if they remain below the level of a use of force, and are conducted for the purpose of ending the original unlawful activity.\nParagraph 16.3.3.3 of the Manual discusses countermeasures and retorsion together, emphasizing the availability of retorsive responses to cyber-insults, such as diplomatic measures.²⁴ Both are important concepts for cyber operations, but they are distinct. Retorsion in general is defined in paragraph 18.17 of the DoD Manual: “unfriendly conduct, (1) which is not inconsistent with any international obligation of the State engaging in it, and (2) which is done in response to an internationally wrongful act.” An understanding of both in the cyber context is especially critical because it is not always clear when an action in cyberspace is unlawful. When the law on the original action is unclear, responses may be phrased as equivalent; that is, if the initial action was lawful, ²¹ K.

Brown then the same thing done in return would be retorsion.²⁵ If the triggering action was unlawful, then the response would be a countermeasure, rendered lawful by its status.²⁶ ## 2.2 What Is Cyber-Spying?\nDetermining whether cyber-activities would cross the line from operations to espionage remains a difficult issue for cyber legal advisors. Espionage is generally unregulated under international law but, unlike in the physical world, espionage in cyberspace can be quite difficult to distinguish from the preparation for and conduct of more aggressive military operations.²⁷ The Manual notes that to the extent “cyber operations resemble traditional intelligence and counterintelligence activities, such as unauthorized intrusions into computer networks solely to acquire information, then such cyber operations would likely be treated similarly under international law.”²⁸ This would be more helpful if there were an easy way to ascertain the nature of the cyber-activity in the first place.\nWhether a cyber operation is undertaken for the purpose of espionage or military operations, it normally will require some penetration of the targeted system to gain access. Once access to the system is established, the aggressor might engage in espionage or attack. Even if the mission is espionage, the operator might leave behind malware to facilitate future access to the system, and that future event might be either an attack or spying. How should system penetrations be treated under the law when the actor's intent is unknown? How should pre-implanted capabilities be treated when they are discovered, especially on critical infrastructure or sensitive national security systems? If an espionage event goes wrong and results in accidental damage to a system, does it become an attack at that point? There may be no way for the victim of the event to determine the actor's intent, especially in a timely fashion.\n²⁵ For a discussion on the level of attribution required, see section 3.1 of this chapter.\n²⁶ Not discussed in the Manual is the plea of necessity, which term “is used to denote those exceptional cases where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency.” Draft Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 25, http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf.\n²⁷ “[T]he international legal system generally imposes no sanctions upon nations for acts of espionage except for the political costs of public denunciation.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 18.21.2 fn. 305.

US military legal advisors take for granted that the principles of the law of war – distinction, proportionality, humanity, and military necessity – all apply during armed conflict.²⁹ With regard to kinetic attacks, of course, these principles do apply. The challenge with wartime cyber operations is that they can be quite disruptive without being destructive. Legal advisors must be able to distinguish operations that must refrain from targeting civilian objects, for example, and those that fall below the attack threshold.\nThe cyber operations chapter takes note of the issue in a general way, pointing to paragraph 5.4 for details on how attacks are covered by the law of armed conflict (LOAC). That paragraph iterates that attacks must be carried out in compliance with the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions, but paragraph 16.5.2 notes with some circularity that “[a] cyber operation that does not constitute an attack is not restricted by the rules that apply to attacks.” It goes on to give examples of operations that would not constitute attacks: defacing government web pages; briefly disrupting internet service in a minor way; briefly disrupting, disabling, or interfering with communications; or disseminating propaganda. Unfortunately, these examples do little to draw the line between aggressive, non-attack cyber-activity and activity that would qualify as an attack. For example, do the qualifications in the examples mean that DoD would label a brief disruption of internet service in\n²⁹ See Ray Murphy’s contribution to this book in Chapter 7. Chapter II of the DoD Manual lists the principles of the law of war as military necessity, humanity, proportionality, distinction, and honor. The principle of honor seems particularly attenuated from cyberwarfare; it is not discussed in the Manual with reference to cyberwarfare, and will be omitted here, as well.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nGary D. Brown\na major way an attack? Further, it is unclear that the principles of LOAC apply to any cyber-activity that stops short of causing damage, destruction, or injury. This gap in the law has led some experts to suggest that LOAC ought to apply to cyber operations that affect the functionality of computer systems without actually damaging them.³⁰\nThe Manual states “[i]f a cyber operation constitutes an attack, then the law of war rules on conducting attacks must be applied to those cyber operations.”³¹ Of course, this invites the question of what constitutes an attack. Operational legal advisors who consult the manual for guidance on this question will learn that wartime operations that destroy computers are attacks.³² While this is true, it is also the simplest case – kinetic effects directly caused by cyber operations clearly are attacks. On the more difficult questions of whether loss of functionality of a computer system, without damage to it, is an attack, or whether harm significantly attenuated from the original event, would similarly constitute an attack, the Manual is silent.³³\nAfter identifying the way cyberwarfare techniques might not be governed by the principles of the law of war, the Manual suggests that the case is not closed. “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.”³⁴ This seems to contradict an earlier statement in the Manual, and may be read as *lex ferenda* rather than an articulation of the law.³⁵ Legal advisors who rely on the Manual for guidance would be better served if the Manual made clear this is a US policy rather than the law. The United States might well put such policy restrictions in its own rules of engagement, but if it is meant to be read as a restriction grounded in law, the Manual should have provided some affirmative authority for this belief.\nIn a legal advisor’s analysis of whether a cyber-activity constitutes an attack, the Manual notes the importance of considering whether the effects created\n³⁰ See M. N. Schmitt, “Rewired Warfare: Rethinking the Law of Cyber Attack” (2014) 96(893) *International Review of the Red Cross* 189, www.icrc.org/en/international-review/article/rewired-warfare-rethinking-law-cyber-attack; and C.

The cautious approach regarding cyber-capabilities is perhaps not what one would expect when cyberwarfare seems less likely than kinetic means to cause civilian casualties and damage. Nevertheless, when the Manual assesses the application of the principle of proportionality to kinetic attacks, it specifically excludes any inconvenience to civilians from consideration, noting that such ancillary aspects of a military attack “need not be considered.”³⁶ In contrast, the Manual mandates consideration of “civilian inconvenience” even in cyber operations that are too minor to be considered attacks under the law of war. It is logically inconsistent – and not a reflection of international law – to require no consideration of inconvenience before conducting a lethal attack, but to require that higher standard before a non-lethal cyber-action aiming to achieve the same result, such as disrupting military communications over a dual-use network node.³⁷ If this is US policy, it ought to be set out as policy, and could be reflected in rules of engagement, but it is potentially confusing to cyber operators who refer to the Manual as a source of law.\nAlthough not listed as one of the distinctive principles of the law of war in the Manual, the cyber operations chapter discusses the obligation of precautions. There are two precautions-related requirements under generalized LOAC. The first is precautions in the attack, which requires States, when engaging in an attack, to take all feasible steps to minimize harm to the civilian ³⁶ Ibid., ¶ 5.12.1.2.\n³⁷ “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack,’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.” Ibid., ¶ 16.5.2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Gary D. Brown population.³⁸ The second is precautions against the effects of attacks, which requires States to “take other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.”³⁹ This second might be thought of as an obligation of defenders to ensure that military and strategic objects are not commingled with civilian objects in a way that would make it impossible for attackers to distinguish between the two.\nFor the reasons discussed above, precautions in the attack is not a particularly intriguing topic in a cyber-specific context. Cyber-events not qualifying as attacks are not covered by this provision of law, and those that are attacks present the same issues as traditional kinetic warfare. While it is true that destructive cyberattacks could result in the loss of civilian access to internet-based services, for example, so might kinetic attacks. Bombing or destroying bridges and electrical power infrastructure, often part of traditional military campaigns, also frequently results in loss of connectivity due to broken communications lines and lack of power. The consideration of these ancillary civilian effects is the same whether the instrumentality is cyber or kinetic.\nBy contrast, cyberspace operations present a unique opportunity to apply the principle obligating defenders to avoid commingling civilian and military objects. The cyber-infrastructure States use for military and national security missions is the same as that used for civilian activities from personal communications to providing essential utilities such as electricity and water. It might be argued that in choosing to commingle civilian and military capabilities on a single infrastructure, States all violated the defensive application of precautions, leaving the internet more susceptible to attack as a dual-use target.\nIn the cyber context, Manual paragraph 16.5.3 proclaims that “[p]arties to a conflict must take feasible precautions to reduce the risk of incidental harm to the civilian population and other protected persons and objects.” It is unclear why the two aspects of precautions would be conflated in the cyber chapter. For clarity, the cyber-precautions provisions should track the language in AP I and in the other provisions of the Manual.\n³⁸ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of Aug. 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 (AP I), Art. 57. “Combatants must take feasible precautions in planning and conducting attacks to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and other persons and objects protected from being made the object of attack.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.11.\n³⁹ AP I, Art. 58.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations Both international and US law require that weapons be reviewed for legal compliance before they may be acquired or used. AP I codifies the requirement to conduct legal reviews of weapons.⁴⁰ The United States is not a party to AP I, but its practice of conducting legal reviews of weapons is consistent with the requirement, and predated AP I.⁴¹ DoD requires that weapons reviews determine whether a proposed weapon's intended use is calculated to cause superfluous injury, whether it is inherently indiscriminate, and whether it is specifically prohibited, for example by treaty.⁴² Cyberspace operations have introduced new challenges in complying with what is ordinarily a straightforward provision of law. Recognizing that cyberweapons must be subjected to a legal review before acquisition or use does not answer the question of what, exactly, a cyberweapon is. In the case of more traditional weapons, it is generally straightforward to recognize that something is a weapon. Defining\"cyberweapon,\"on the other hand, can be quite tricky. It is difficult to know how to define cyberweapons, as the Manual recognizes:\"Not all cyber capabilities... constitute a weapon or weapons system.\"⁴³ Nearly every function of a modern military is at least supported by cyber capabilities. Logistics, medical processes, communications, etc. are all highly dependent on computers and networks, yet those particular capabilities would not be classified as weapons. In the case of offensive capabilities, computers, networks, and servers might all be considered part of a cyberweapons system, and legal reviews of the hardware would be straightforward (and pointless, because the same equipment can be used to support civilian and defensive functions). The heart of a cyber-capability is the code on which it is based, and the Manual offers little practical guidance on the proper classification of malware or other commonly encountered cyber techniques.\nRather than take on the difficult task of providing a basis for determining whether a cyber-capability is a weapon, the Manual punts, noting that the military services address which cyber-capabilities require legal reviews. This would be more helpful if the services actually did address the issue. The pertinent Army regulation is dated 1979, and the Navy's 2011 regulation lacks cyber-specific language. Only the Air Force has addressed the issues ⁴⁰ AP I, Art. 36.\n⁴¹ The Defense Acquisition System, DoD Directive 5000.1, ¶ E1.1.15 (certified current Nov. 20, 2007); DoD Manual, ¶ 6.2.3.\n⁴² DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 6.2.2. ⁴³ Ibid., ¶ 16.6.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Gary D. Brown surrounding cyberweapons specifically, so its instruction provides the DoD guidance by default.⁴⁴ The Air Force defines “weapons” as “devices designed to kill, injure, disable or temporarily incapacitate people, or destroy, damage or temporarily incapacitate property or materiel.”⁴⁵ The Air Force instruction also defines a “cyber capability” as “any device or software payload intended to disrupt, deny, degrade, negate, impair or destroy adversarial computer systems, data, activities or capabilities,” but excludes “a device or software that is solely intended to provide access to an adversarial computer system for data exploitation.”⁴⁶ The Air Force directs that “all cyber capabilities being developed, bought, built, modified or otherwise acquired by the Air Force... are reviewed for legality under LOAC, domestic law and international law prior to their acquisition for use in a conflict or other military operation.”⁴⁷ Unlike kinetic means of warfare, cyber means largely consist of intellectual property in the form of computer code. Physical weapons must be designed and manufactured, so changes tend to be infrequent. In contrast, computer code may be changed instantly and easily. It is often altered multiple times in the course of an operation.⁴⁸ The practical problem created is that it appears dozens or hundreds of legal reviews might be required for a single cyber capability.\nAn alternate view of the problem is provided in the Tallinn Manual, which addresses the question of what constitutes a cyberweapon in rule 103. “[C]yber weapons are ‘cyber means of warfare’ that are used, designed, or intended to be used to cause injury to, or death of, persons or damage to, or destruction of, objects, that is, that result in the consequences required for qualification of a cyber operation as an attack.”⁴⁹ In the Tallinn Manual cyberattack is defined as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁰ DoD could consider adopting a modified version of this definition, making a simple change: “design, use, or intended use reasonably capable of causing.” This change would exclude imaginable but remote possibilities of harm that exist with every computer program, but would continue to create ⁴⁴ Whether weapons reviews are controlled by international law or by US policy, it would be preferable to have a single interpretation from DoD, rather than potentially conflicting interpretations provided by individual services.\n⁴⁵ AFI 51-402, Legal Reviews of Weapons and Cyber Capabilities (July 27, 2011), 6.\n⁴⁶ Ibid., 5. ⁴⁷ Ibid., para 1.1.2.\n⁴⁸ See discussion in G.

The Manual provides no guidance to help determine what “inherently indiscriminate” means with regard to a cyber-capability. Malware is often spread indiscriminately but may by design have no significant negative effect on untargeted computer systems. Malware may use untargeted systems as vectors to reach its intended target, where it might have great effect. This was the case, for example, in the Stuxnet incident, where malware was spread to over 100,000 computers, but had no significant effects until it reached the computer system at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, where it destroyed over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges.⁵² The Manual takes no position on whether inert code copied indiscriminately and without permission to the hard drives of thousands of computers makes use of that malware unlawful. Based on the extant State practice to date, the answer is probably “no,” but the Manual would be a good vehicle for putting the issue to rest.\nCyber “weaponry” is a controversial issue in the larger national security community, as well. The tools and vulnerabilities necessary to conduct computer- and network-based operations for national security missions can also be used against civilian systems in support of intelligence and criminal activity. The US Government has a process to determine whether cyber-vulnerabilities should be disclosed in order to protect the public or held as part of the cyberarsenal to be used in support of national security.⁵³ Some citizen groups argue that States have an obligation to disclose cyber-vulnerabilities they discover so the public can protect themselves from exploitation.⁵⁴ States have been less keen to recognize that there is such an obligation, as it would essentially ⁵¹ One way to handle the espionage/operations overlap on this issue is to simply exclude espionage tools by intent. Another way would be to accept that weapons can be used in espionage in ways that are not attacks, such as using a machete to cut through vegetation on a fence line. The operation should be analyzed by its effects rather than by its means.\n⁵² K. Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day (New York: Broadway Books, 2014), 96, 175.\n⁵³ A. Schwartz and R.

Brown require them to render obsolete many of the cyber-capabilities they acquire or develop.\nAn inability to define what computer code constitutes a weapon also affects arms trade agreements. For example, the Wassenaar Arrangement, developed to control the transfer of arms and dual-use technologies, was amended in 2013 to include some cyber-capabilities.⁵⁵ One of the new prohibited categories is intrusion software, which is software “specially designed or modified to avoid detection by ‘monitoring tools’, or to defeat ‘protective countermeasures’, of a computer or network capable device, and performing [data extraction, data modification, or installation of malware].” The intent of the language was to keep powerful computer tools out of the hands of repressive regimes, but the additions also prevented university researchers and law-abiding cyber-intrusion specialists from properly conducting research, because they were unable to share code across national borders.⁵⁶ Given the range of complex issues surrounding cyberweapons, some indication of the appropriate direction here would have been useful not just to US practitioners, but also to other States that look to the United States for leadership in international law, and particularly value the DoD role in clarifying LOAC. DoD has more experience than any organization in the world at assessing weapons for compliance with international law. It may be as befuddled as everyone about how to define and assess cyber weapons, but setting a single DoD policy, even an imperfect one, would have been a superior course than leaving the issue to be determined by individuals across the US services and the international community, perhaps in very different ways.\n## 3 OTHER ISSUES The major issues cyber operations law advisors must be equipped to field are discussed above. The other commonly recurring issues are attribution, neutrality, perfidy, and the role of civilians. All of these are noted in the Manual and are discussed below.\n2013), www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/01/zero_day_exploits_should_the_hacker_gray_market_be_regulated.html.\n⁵⁵ C.

Because of the internet's architecture and operation, concealing the identity and location of actors is relatively simple, while discovering the same can be an expensive and time-consuming process that often fails to deliver a certain answer.⁵⁷ The Manual says but little about attribution, merely noting that it is difficult. If the goal of the Manual is to be useful to practitioners, this is a section that could be more complete. For example, there is no indication of what level of proof should be required for various responses.\nThe Tallinn Manual offers the guidance that, while pinpointing the origin of an attack does not mean the State owner of the infrastructure is responsible for the attack, it does provide a sort of rebuttable presumption that the host State is responsible.⁵⁸ And, although there is no set standard of proof necessary to engage in countermeasures, the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility notes that the standard for attribution in such cases is\"reasonable certainty.\"⁵⁹ Legal advisors are not starting from scratch when determining the appropriate standard to apply; international law does provide guidance that is helpful, even in the new area of cyber operations. It would be useful for this standard, at least, to be referenced in the Manual.\n## 3.2 Neutrality Neutrality plays a limited role in the cyberspace context. Neutrality under the law of war only applies during international armed conflict and conflicts between States have become very much the exception. Non-international armed conflict (NIAC) is common, however, and aggressive cyber-activities in support of NIAC, and in support of sub-armed conflict State activity, is common.⁶⁰ The Manual's discussion of when neutrality principles apply is ⁵⁷ Even in two high-profile instances where the US Government asserted attribution was certain, controversy about the identity of the culprits continued for months.

Rep. 92, 101–02 (1987).\n⁶⁰ NWP 1-14M, The Commander's Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, para. 7.1; Tallinn Manual, p. 248.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Gary D. Brown based on both the 1907 Hague Convention and on the opinion of international legal experts.⁶¹ Of particular note, the chapter in the Manual addressing the law of neutrality is silent with respect to cyber operations. In DoD’s interpretation, some principles of neutrality apply in NIACs, although beyond respecting sovereignty, which is a principle of international law independent of neutrality, it is unclear which specific principles apply to belligerents in such conflicts.⁶² With regard to non-participating States in NIACs, the Manual cites the UN General Assembly: “Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.”⁶³ At some point, such activities would result in the offending State becoming a party to the conflict, converting it to an international armed conflict (IAC), so the Manual is apparently citing the language to capture relatively low-level, indirect assistance.⁶⁴ In any event, the Manual suggests that nonbelligerent States in NIACs should refrain from “acquiescing in organized activities” within their territories when the activities are directed to acts of civil strife or terrorism.\nThe Manual suggests a contrasting approach in the cyber context, asserting that a State’s neutrality (a term that appears to be used in this chapter to refer to both neutral States and, unconventionally, to nonparticipating States in NIACs) is not dependent on whether it polices its cyber-infrastructure, as long as it does not take steps to discriminate among users of its infrastructure. The Manual explicitly notes that even if data could be characterized as a cyber weapon or otherwise could cause destructive effects in a belligerent State, relaying it would not impact a State’s status as a neutral.\nThe disconnect here is probably more about trying to govern cyberspace with a treaty over a hundred years old than it is about neutrality. The Manual fails to take into account that aggressive computer code, in the form of data packets transmitted over the internet, can be the actual means of waging war, not merely communications about waging war, which is what Hague V was meant to address. There is little logical distinction between allowing the transmission of a virtual attack across neutral infrastructure and allowing the ⁶¹ DoD Law of War Manual, § 15.2.1 and Chapter XVII fn. 211. ⁶² Ibid., § 15.2.1.3.\n⁶³ Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, annex to UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV), UN Doc. A/RES/2625(XXV) (1970), cited at DoD Manual, Chapter XVII fn. 210.\n⁶⁴ See Nicaragua v. U.S..\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations The Tallinn Manual takes a different approach to cyber-neutrality, with most of the experts opining that a State would violate its status as a neutral if it knowingly allowed the transmission of a cyberweapon across infrastructure it controlled.⁶⁵ The application of neutrality in cyberspace as set out in the DoD Manual is problematic because the United States appears to support the assertion of the rights of national sovereignty by States hosting internet infrastructure, but not the normal responsibilities of a sovereign. If States do have sovereign rights over code passing through internet infrastructure located in their territory, they ought to have the responsibility to ensure the code they host is doing no harm. Otherwise, the host State is essentially protecting cyber-aggressors from effective action by victim States, which is inconsistent with the application of neutrality in the physical world.⁶⁶ The ultimate conclusion may be left to whether States decide packets of information making up cyber-means of warfare are more akin to communications or to weapons.⁶⁷ ## 3.3 Perfidy and Protective Emblems The issue of perfidy has limited practical application in cyberwarfare, but it frequently comes up in conversations with cyber operators. The issue is briefly discussed in the Manual under “Improper Use of Signs.”⁶⁸ International law prohibits using perfidy to kill, injure, or capture an adversary.⁶⁹ Perfidy is widely understood as “[a]cts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to receive, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the ⁶⁵ Tallinn Manual, rule 152.\n⁶⁶ “These sources make clear that neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent.” A. S. Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defense” (2012) 52(3) Virginia Journal of International Law 499, www.vjil.org%2Fassets%2Fpdfs%2Fvol52%2Fissue3%2FDeeks_Post_Production.pdf.\n⁶⁷ On the other hand, States could also have determined that military aircraft crossing neutral territory are permitted, as long as they are only delivering messages. Instead, the mission of the aircraft appears to be irrelevant.\n⁶⁸ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.24. Misuse of protective emblems, treachery, and perfidy are often discussed together, and often (if inaccurately) grouped together as perfidy. As perfidy is the most common of the terms in the operations community, it is used as the section title here.\n⁶⁹ AP I, Art. 37(1). The United States asserts that customary international law prohibits only killing or injuring by means of perfidy, a position shared by the Tallinn experts. DoD Manual, para. 5.22; Tallinn Manual, rule 60(2).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Gary D. Brown intent to betray that confidence.”⁷⁰ To be perfidious, a cyber operation would have to both rely on feigning legal protection and proximately result in death or injury (or capture under the international formulation).⁷¹ For example, an email falsely claiming to be from the International Committee of the Red Cross that successfully lured enemy troops to an armed ambush that resulted in their deaths would constitute perfidy.⁷² One might also imagine a similar false email that escaped electronic scrutiny because of its purported protected sender that, when opened, introduced malware into the adversary network. If that malware directly led to death or injury – by causing a catastrophic failure of a military installation’s power plant, for example – it would be an example of perfidy. If death or injury did not result, it would still be an example of a misuse of a protective emblem.\nThe Manual also states it would be inappropriate to use “communications that initiate non-hostile relations, such as prisoner exchanges or ceasefires” to gain entry into an enemy’s computer network.⁷³ The Manual’s support for this proposition is limited to cross-referencing other provisions in the Manual. While the United States may determine this is a good practice, such ruses are not prohibited under LOAC.⁷⁴ Similarly, the DoD Manual asserts “it would be prohibited to fabricate messages from an enemy’s Head of State falsely informing that State’s forces that an armistice or cease-fire had been signed.”⁷⁵ This, like the prior paragraph’s suggestion that perfidy prohibits false communications that initiate non-hostile relations, is inconsistent with established international law. Such practices may not be good policy, but they are not illegal. According to the 1977 International Red Cross (ICRC) Commentary on Additional Protocol I “the central element of the definition of perfidy is the deliberate claim to legal protection for hostile purposes,” which these lack.⁷⁶ There are arguments to the contrary but, as unchivalrous as these situations may be, they do not meet the definition of perfidy.⁷⁷ Cyber operations can be the most effective method of disseminating and obtaining information, so the portions of LOAC related to information are ⁷⁰ AP I, Art. 37(1). ⁷¹ Tallinn Manual, rule 122(3).\n⁷² This is an adaptation of an example from the Tallinn Manual, rule 122(5).\n⁷³ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.4. ⁷⁴ Ibid., ¶¶ 12.2, 5.21. ⁷⁵ Ibid., ¶ 16.5.4.\n⁷⁶ ICRC, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 (7), 429, www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/RC_commentary-1977.html.\n⁷⁷ See S. Watts, “Law of War Perfidy” (2014) 219 Military Law Review 172, www.jagcnet.army.mil /DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/0/02eb1ceb45ec8dd285257cf9004f63cf/$FILE/By%20Sean%20Watts.pdf; and M. J. Greer, “Redefining Perfidy” (2015) 47 Georgetown Journal of International Law 260, www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/law-journals/gjil/recent/upload/Greer.pdf.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations An area that is insufficiently addressed in the law is medical information. AP I requires that medical units and transports be marked as such.78 The Tallinn Manual opined that the marking and protection obligations extend to “[c]omputers, computer networks, and data that form an integral part of the operations or administration of medical units and transports.”79 The DoD Manual is silent on the issue, but it is one that merits consideration and decision so that it can be uniformly implemented. This would help ensure the protection of medical data and protect against accidental misuse of the protective emblem.\n## 3.4 Civilians as Combatants The DoD Manual succinctly summarizes the law on civilian employees’ involvement in cyberwarfare. Civilian employees are permitted to directly participate in hostilities (DPH), but they forfeit any protection they would receive as civilians during the participation. There may be political or other policy rationales for preventing civilians from acting as cyber “trigger-pullers,” but it is permissible under LOAC. One reason DoD is comfortable with this broad reading of appropriate civilian conduct may be that cyberwarfare tends to be conducted from a distance, so there is less concern about increasing the chance that other, non-participating civilians could be mistaken for lawful targets.\n## 4 CONCLUSION This chapter of the Commentary has focused more on developments of the law and shortcomings in the Manual than some other chapters. That is because, despite the lessons learned over many years of armed conflict about how the law of war should apply to best protect civilians and prevent unnecessary suffering, there are gaps in its practical application to cyberwarfare. As noted above, many questions remain about exactly how the law should apply to operations in cyberspace, yet the disruptive and destructive https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Gary D. Brown capabilities and vulnerabilities available to cyber-actors are increasingly being acknowledged. State custom, practice, and norms are being created rapidly, as well, more through inaction than action. The cyber operations chapter in the Manual offered an opportunity for the United States to guide both the present and the future of cyber operations law, but DoD chose not to grasp it.\nAlthough DoD minimizes the role of military manuals in the development of international law, noting specifically in the DoD Manual that the views\"do not necessarily reflect the views of [other federal agencies] or the US Government as a whole,\"any information the United States provides will carry great weight.80 States are hungry for guidance on how the law of war applies to cyberwarfare, and the US owns the most important voice in the field. This may be why DoD was reluctant to take a bolder stand on the key issues that matter to coalition partners and experts in the field, but it also carries the risk that others, who may not share the interests of the United States with respect to ensuring freedoms of expression and association, may succeed in filling in the gaps.81 In the absence of official guidance, academic works carry more than their usual weight, as well, and the musings of academics are less likely to be constrained by practicality. It would be in DoD's selfish interest to encourage a practical body of law that supports military operations, rather than an idealistic set of pronouncements that will be ignored.\nThe most critical failing of the cyber operations chapter is that it offers no useful ideas on how to apply international law, or even US policy, to the most likely cyber-scenarios. Although military cyberspace operations are in their infancy, useful examples could have been drawn from a short list of real-world events. Cyber-incidents in Estonia (2007), the Republic of Georgia (2008), Iran (2009), and Saudi Arabia (2012) are just a few examples that might have been used to walk through various issues in a way relevant for operations lawyers.82 More recently, Russia's alleged use of cyber-methods to disseminate https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations There remain many unanswered questions regarding the law governing cyberwarfare. The brevity and lack of specificity in the chapter may be an indication that DoD believes the law is insufficiently developed for it to provide guidance. Unfortunately, discomfort with the state of the law does not remove the responsibility of government legal advisors, who are the target audience of the Manual and must provide advice on cyber operations with or without legal direction from the manual. Even if the area is changing rapidly, it would be useful for DoD to provide more complete guidance to the field that would also suggest a framework for the international community. Even providing complete footnotes (as opposed to mostly internal references) would be a great help to practitioners; it would give them a jumping-off point for filling in the substantive gaps left by the Manual.\nDoD seems to be committed to making online changes to the Manual, and has demonstrated some alacrity in doing so. The cyber operations chapter is a likely candidate for significant development in the near future, and we can hope that future revisions will provide more specific guidance on how the law applies, or does not apply, to the emerging area of cyberwarfare.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

Chapter XVI of the Manual has only 44 percent as many footnotes when compared to the next most lightly footnoted chapter. Even more striking, 98.8 percent of the footnotes cite either to the Manual itself or to internal US policy documents and speeches.\nOf particular note, the Manual avoids any mention of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which has been well-received by academics and governments since its original publication in 2013.³ As the Manual's footnotes are meant\"to help practitioners research particular topics discussed in the main text,\"references to at least some of the literature in the field would have been appropriate.⁴ That one of two foundational references dates from the last century and the other is a State Department speech considerably undermines the credibility of the chapter.\n\n---\n\n## ## 4 CONCLUSION This chapter of the Commentary has focused more on developments of the law and shortcomings in the Manual than some other chapters.

In a choice starkly contrasting with the rest of the DoD Manual, the cyber operations chapter relies almost exclusively on two sources: a 1999 DoD Office of General Counsel legal assessment of \"information operations\" and a 2012 speech at the US Cyber Command Legal Conference delivered by the State Department Legal Advisor. Chapter XVI of the Manual has only 44 percent as many footnotes when compared to the next most lightly footnoted chapter. Even more striking, 98.8 percent of the footnotes cite either to the Manual itself or to internal US policy documents and speeches.\n\nOf particular note, the Manual avoids any mention of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which has been well-received by academics and governments since its original publication in 2013.³ As the Manual's footnotes are meant \"to help practitioners research particular topics discussed in the main text,\" references to at least some of the literature in the field would have been appropriate.⁴ That one of two foundational references dates from the last century and the other is a State Department speech considerably undermines the credibility of the chapter.\n\n## 2 OVERVIEW\n\nThe broad scope of the DoD Manual is reflected in the statement of purpose, which is \"to provide information on the law of war to DoD personnel responsible for implementing the law of war and executing military operations.\"⁵ With that in mind, this commentary on the chapter \"Cyber Operations\" is organized according to the four most pressing issues that legal practitioners must address to provide proper legal advice to decision-makers:\n\n³ DoD, Office of the General Counsel, \"An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations\" (2nd ed., Nov. 1999), repr. in 76 US Naval War College International Law Studies (2002); and H.

About half of the footnotes are to other portions of the DoD Manual.\n\n³ Since the publication of the DoD Manual, the Tallinn Manual has been updated to version 2.0, published in 2017.

What is a cyberweapon?\n\nSet out below is a discussion of why these questions are critical, and how well the Manual does as a reference for those who will be providing legal advice on military and other government cyber operations.\n\n## 2.1 What Is Cyberwar?\n\nOne of the key answers legal advisors must provide is whether proposed cyber operations would cross the threshold from peace to war. Although it may be outside the normal area of expertise of an operations legal advisor, they still must be prepared to grapple with the thorny issues of how cyber operations might contribute to, or even drive, a transition from peace to war. Because cyberspace by its nature is global, even those operations meant to be collecting tactical information or focused on a specific region can have far-reaching consequences. The intent of cyberspace operators is often difficult to discern, and internet-based operations cross many jurisdictions in making their way to the intended target. That means information-gathering might appear to be something more aggressive. In addition, States might feel compelled to defend their \"cyber-sovereignty\" even from incursions falling short of aggression. Either of these could motivate hostile actions in response, so discerning the distinction between normal cyber operations and those that might be interpreted as aggressive (or transgressive) is of critical importance.\n\nIn examining that decision space, national decision-makers often ask the question, \"Is this an act of war?\"⁶ This is a consideration of both States considering the wisdom of cyberspace activities, and States who are the victims of unfriendly cyber-acts. The term \"act of war\" is generally meant to be \"any act by a State that would effectively terminate the normal international law of peacetime and activate the international law\n\n⁶ Although the phrase \"act of war\" is not a legal term, given the difficulties in determining what cyber-events cross the threshold of armed attack, it may be appropriate for States to note the importance of political considerations in their assessments of whether aggressive cyber-activities trigger the right of self-defense. As one cyber-expert puts it, \"calling something an act of war is not a conclusion; it is a decision.\" M. Libicki, \"An Act of War, Even Cyberwar, Is a Decision,\" New York Times (Feb. 28, 2013), www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/02/28/what-is-an-act-of-cyberwar/an-act-of-war-even-cyberwar-is-a-decision.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Brown\n\nof war.”7 In modern usage, an act of war may be considered the equivalent of armed attack or, for the United States, a use of force.8 For cyber operations lawyers advising decision-makers it is appropriate to ask, as the DoD Manual does, whether a certain cyber-act is an unlawful use of force or an international armed attack.\n\nThe ultimate goal is determining which activity rises to a level that would justify a State’s use of force in self-defense.9 For most States, that would mean the cyber-activity would have to be an armed attack, which would trigger Article 51 of the UN Charter. The United States, however, has consistently asserted that the right of self-defense may be exercised based on a lower threshold: that of a use of force.10 Whichever standard is used, sorting out which cyber-activities would push States to armed conflict is difficult to describe in an abstract ex ante manner.\n\nThe Manual concludes that if a cyber-activity has kinetic results, it may lawfully be treated the same as if it were caused by non-cyber means. Thus, “if cyber operations cause effects that, if caused by traditional physical means, would be regarded as a use of force . . . then such cyber operations would likely also be regarded as a use of force.”11 The caveat of “likely” in the statement is critical. Cyber-means of warfare are not exempt from the application of international law, but the Manual suggests the application of the law is unsettled. In the kinetic realm, decades of history and precedent are available to study what States consider adequate to support armed self-defense. If the aggressor uses cyber-means, however, the US position is that the legal question cannot be answered merely based on the effects of the attack. States “must evaluate factors including the context of the event, the actor perpetrating the action . . ., the target and location, effects and intent, among other possible issues” before determining whether the action constitutes a use of force.12\n\n7 D.

    "Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n341\n\nPerhaps because the Manual's authors were unable to glean much in the way of helpful operations law guidance from existing international law, they also provided examples to illustrate the principles. For examples of cyber-events that would trigger a resort to war, the Manual lists: using cyber-capabilities to trigger a nuclear plant meltdown, open a dam above a populated area, or disable air traffic control services resulting in airplane crashes. According to the Manual, these instances would \"likely\" be regarded as cyberattacks.¹³ These clear examples are very similar to the ones used in the extensively referenced 1999 paper, but there are subtle differences that may reflect a new understanding of the law in the area. The 1999 paper did not mention the possibility of a nuclear plant meltdown; that may be an understandable sensitivity that creates a clear red-line in the opinion of US legal experts. Somewhat more curiously, the Manual dropped the references to cyber operations that shut down banking systems, financial systems, and public utilities. All of these systems have been the target of cyber operations and, although they were not shut down on a large scale, the exclusion of them from the list of operations that could drive States to war may be a reflection of modern State practice.\n\nStates have not engaged in armed conflict premised only on cyber-aggression against financial institutions.¹⁴ Similarly, they will not, it seems, wage war over foreign actors establishing a persistent presence on industrial control systems controlling public utilities.¹⁵ State practice seems to be tilting in favor of negotiated agreements between States to refrain from such actions rather than recognizing the resort of armed retaliation. It is possible the non-response from States is because they lack good evidence connecting the actors to States, or even non-State armed groups.¹⁶ State norms and practice regarding cyberspace operations are rapidly forming and being refined.

More likely, the US position is that many activities in this arena fall under the broad rubric of \"espionage,\" activities at which the US excels and does not wish to limit through the international legal structure.[17] Even stating that clearly would have been helpful to the practitioners who will rely on the Manual to form legal opinions in support of cyber operations.\n\nAnother weakness with the examples the Manual uses is that they are far too facile. A legal advisor with no previous experience in cyber operations could surely have determined that activities causing dams to fail and planes to crash would be international acts of aggression. These obvious examples provide little guidance to practitioners who must advise on where the line is drawn between cyberattacks and lesser cyber-insults. A single example, also from the 1999 paper, may provide more information about where the line between peace and war is drawn, but it is unclear exactly how it fits with the message of the chapter. \"[C]yber operations that cripple a military's logistics systems, and thus its ability to conduct and sustain military operations, might also be considered a use of force under jus ad bellum.\"[18] Compared to a nuclear meltdown and plane crashes, this type of operation seems almost benign.\n\nAlthough it is not clear what \"crippling\" a military logistics system means, the type of disruptive cyber-action that could be taken against an unclassified logistics system seems similar to the events in Estonia in 2007. In that case, government and economic websites, as well as internet infrastructure sites, were targeted with denial of service attacks that significantly impaired their functioning for three weeks.[19] The events in Estonia were not considered sufficient to support a claim of international self-defense.[20] This interpretation also seems to be a departure from US practice as stated in the Manual. In addition to the failure to react publicly to operations carried out against public utilities and financial systems, the US characterized the 2014 Sony hack, which stole massive amounts of data and was designed to corrupt or destroy more, as \"cyber-vandalism,\" explicitly characterizing it as an activity\n\n17 K.

The notion of cyber-countermeasures to respond to aggressive but sub-use of force cyber-actions has received significant attention in the international legal community, although it rates little more than a footnote in the chapter.²² Other than in the cyber chapter, the Manual refers to countermeasures as reprisals, which it defines as “acts taken against a party: (1) that would otherwise be unlawful; (2) in order to persuade that party to cease violating the law.”²³ In other words, if undertaken as a countermeasure, unlawful responsive cyber-measures are rendered legal if they remain below the level of a use of force, and are conducted for the purpose of ending the original unlawful activity.\n\nParagraph 16.3.3.3 of the Manual discusses countermeasures and retorsion together, emphasizing the availability of retorsive responses to cyber-insults, such as diplomatic measures.²⁴ Both are important concepts for cyber operations, but they are distinct. Retorsion in general is defined in paragraph 18.17 of the DoD Manual: “unfriendly conduct, (1) which is not inconsistent with any international obligation of the State engaging in it, and (2) which is done in response to an internationally wrongful act.” An understanding of both in the cyber context is especially critical because it is not always clear when an action in cyberspace is unlawful.

Brown\n\nthen the same thing done in return would be retorsion.²⁵ If the triggering action was unlawful, then the response would be a countermeasure, rendered lawful by its status.²⁶\n\n## 2.2 What Is Cyber-Spying?\n\nDetermining whether cyber-activities would cross the line from operations to espionage remains a difficult issue for cyber legal advisors. Espionage is generally unregulated under international law but, unlike in the physical world, espionage in cyberspace can be quite difficult to distinguish from the preparation for and conduct of more aggressive military operations.²⁷ The Manual notes that to the extent “cyber operations resemble traditional intelligence and counterintelligence activities, such as unauthorized intrusions into computer networks solely to acquire information, then such cyber operations would likely be treated similarly under international law.”²⁸ This would be more helpful if there were an easy way to ascertain the nature of the cyber-activity in the first place.\n\nWhether a cyber operation is undertaken for the purpose of espionage or military operations, it normally will require some penetration of the targeted system to gain access. Once access to the system is established, the aggressor might engage in espionage or attack. Even if the mission is espionage, the operator might leave behind malware to facilitate future access to the system, and that future event might be either an attack or spying. How should system penetrations be treated under the law when the actor's intent is unknown? How should pre-implanted capabilities be treated when they are discovered, especially on critical infrastructure or sensitive national security systems? If an espionage event goes wrong and results in accidental damage to a system, does it become an attack at that point? There may be no way for the victim of the event to determine the actor's intent, especially in a timely fashion.\n\n²⁵ For a discussion on the level of attribution required, see section 3.1 of this chapter.\n\n²⁶ Not discussed in the Manual is the plea of necessity, which term “is used to denote those exceptional cases where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency.” Draft Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 25, http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf.\n\n²⁷ “[T]he international legal system generally imposes no sanctions upon nations for acts of espionage except for the political costs of public denunciation.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 18.21.2 fn. 305.

    "Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n345\n\nThe Manual provides no satisfactory answers to these questions. The Manual suggests that the intent of the actor controls, which is perhaps the worst model to choose, because intent is notoriously difficult to discover. The natural anonymity of the internet and the nature of cyber operations makes intent that much more difficult to ascertain. A better reflection of international law is to characterize operations by their effects. For example, espionage is not prohibited by international law, but activities enabling or supporting it may be, depending on their effects. Effects are relatively clear, but misapprehending intent is common and could completely alter the legal range of options available in response.\n\n## 2.3 What Is a Cyberattack?\n\nAlthough it is not immediately apparent, the issue of what cyber-activity constitutes an attack in the context of armed conflict is a critical one. US military legal advisors take for granted that the principles of the law of war – distinction, proportionality, humanity, and military necessity – all apply during armed conflict.²⁹ With regard to kinetic attacks, of course, these principles do apply. The challenge with wartime cyber operations is that they can be quite disruptive without being destructive. Legal advisors must be able to distinguish operations that must refrain from targeting civilian objects, for example, and those that fall below the attack threshold.\n\nThe cyber operations chapter takes note of the issue in a general way, pointing to paragraph 5.4 for details on how attacks are covered by the law of armed conflict (LOAC). That paragraph iterates that attacks must be carried out in compliance with the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions, but paragraph 16.5.2 notes with some circularity that “[a] cyber operation that does not constitute an attack is not restricted by the rules that apply to attacks.” It goes on to give examples of operations that would not constitute attacks: defacing government web pages; briefly disrupting internet service in a minor way; briefly disrupting, disabling, or interfering with communications; or disseminating propaganda. Unfortunately, these examples do little to draw the line between aggressive, non-attack cyber-activity and activity that would qualify as an attack. For example, do the qualifications in the examples mean that DoD would label a brief disruption of internet service in\n\n²⁹ See Ray Murphy’s contribution to this book in Chapter 7. Chapter II of the DoD Manual lists the principles of the law of war as military necessity, humanity, proportionality, distinction, and honor. The principle of honor seems particularly attenuated from cyberwarfare; it is not discussed in the Manual with reference to cyberwarfare, and will be omitted here, as well.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "Gary D. Brown\n\na major way an attack? Further, it is unclear that the principles of LOAC apply to any cyber-activity that stops short of causing damage, destruction, or injury. This gap in the law has led some experts to suggest that LOAC ought to apply to cyber operations that affect the functionality of computer systems without actually damaging them.³⁰\n\nThe Manual states “[i]f a cyber operation constitutes an attack, then the law of war rules on conducting attacks must be applied to those cyber operations.”³¹ Of course, this invites the question of what constitutes an attack. Operational legal advisors who consult the manual for guidance on this question will learn that wartime operations that destroy computers are attacks.³² While this is true, it is also the simplest case – kinetic effects directly caused by cyber operations clearly are attacks. On the more difficult questions of whether loss of functionality of a computer system, without damage to it, is an attack, or whether harm significantly attenuated from the original event, would similarly constitute an attack, the Manual is silent.³³\n\nAfter identifying the way cyberwarfare techniques might not be governed by the principles of the law of war, the Manual suggests that the case is not closed. “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.”³⁴ This seems to contradict an earlier statement in the Manual, and may be read as *lex ferenda* rather than an articulation of the law.³⁵ Legal advisors who rely on the Manual for guidance would be better served if the Manual made clear this is a US policy rather than the law. The United States might well put such policy restrictions in its own rules of engagement, but if it is meant to be read as a restriction grounded in law, the Manual should have provided some affirmative authority for this belief.\n\nIn a legal advisor’s analysis of whether a cyber-activity constitutes an attack, the Manual notes the importance of considering whether the effects created\n\n³⁰ See M.

The terms are not relevant with reference to kinetic methods of warfare and, as there are no cyber-specific agreements governing cyberwarfare, there should be no additional restrictions on operations in the law – though the United States is free to limit its own operations by policy. One problem with this particular provision is that there is no agreed concept of “reversible” effects, and even “temporary” has no set meaning in this context. Presumably, temporary means something other than merely non-permanent, or else it would be synonymous with reversible. Reversible is similarly ambiguous, as a reversible cyber-effect could either prohibit the deletion of data or permit the deletion of data if a backup exists that could be used to return the targeted system to its original state. Without more detail, it is not clear that these terms add much meaning to the section.\n\nIn this section of the chapter, DoD reveals a deep unease with the use of cyber-capabilities in war. The cautious approach regarding cyber-capabilities is perhaps not what one would expect when cyberwarfare seems less likely than kinetic means to cause civilian casualties and damage. Nevertheless, when the Manual assesses the application of the principle of proportionality to kinetic attacks, it specifically excludes any inconvenience to civilians from consideration, noting that such ancillary aspects of a military attack “need not be considered.”³⁶ In contrast, the Manual mandates consideration of “civilian inconvenience” even in cyber operations that are too minor to be considered attacks under the law of war. It is logically inconsistent – and not a reflection of international law – to require no consideration of inconvenience before conducting a lethal attack, but to require that higher standard before a non-lethal cyber-action aiming to achieve the same result, such as disrupting military communications over a dual-use network node.³⁷ If this is US policy, it ought to be set out as policy, and could be reflected in rules of engagement, but it is potentially confusing to cyber operators who refer to the Manual as a source of law.\n\nAlthough not listed as one of the distinctive principles of the law of war in the Manual, the cyber operations chapter discusses the obligation of precautions. There are two precautions-related requirements under generalized LOAC. The first is precautions in the attack, which requires States, when engaging in an attack, to take all feasible steps to minimize harm to the civilian\n\n³⁶ Ibid., ¶ 5.12.1.2.\n\n³⁷ “[E]ven if a cyber operation is not an ‘attack,’ or does not cause any injury or damage that would need to be considered under the proportionality rule, that cyber operation still should not be conducted in a way that unnecessarily causes inconvenience to civilians or neutral persons.” Ibid., ¶ 16.5.2.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Brown\n\npopulation.³⁸ The second is precautions against the effects of attacks, which requires States to “take other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.”³⁹ This second might be thought of as an obligation of defenders to ensure that military and strategic objects are not commingled with civilian objects in a way that would make it impossible for attackers to distinguish between the two.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, precautions in the attack is not a particularly intriguing topic in a cyber-specific context. Cyber-events not qualifying as attacks are not covered by this provision of law, and those that are attacks present the same issues as traditional kinetic warfare. While it is true that destructive cyberattacks could result in the loss of civilian access to internet-based services, for example, so might kinetic attacks. Bombing or destroying bridges and electrical power infrastructure, often part of traditional military campaigns, also frequently results in loss of connectivity due to broken communications lines and lack of power. The consideration of these ancillary civilian effects is the same whether the instrumentality is cyber or kinetic.\n\nBy contrast, cyberspace operations present a unique opportunity to apply the principle obligating defenders to avoid commingling civilian and military objects. The cyber-infrastructure States use for military and national security missions is the same as that used for civilian activities from personal communications to providing essential utilities such as electricity and water. It might be argued that in choosing to commingle civilian and military capabilities on a single infrastructure, States all violated the defensive application of precautions, leaving the internet more susceptible to attack as a dual-use target.\n\nIn the cyber context, Manual paragraph 16.5.3 proclaims that “[p]arties to a conflict must take feasible precautions to reduce the risk of incidental harm to the civilian population and other protected persons and objects.” It is unclear why the two aspects of precautions would be conflated in the cyber chapter. For clarity, the cyber-precautions provisions should track the language in AP I and in the other provisions of the Manual.\n\n³⁸ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of Aug. 12, 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 1125 UNTS 3 (AP I), Art. 57. “Combatants must take feasible precautions in planning and conducting attacks to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and other persons and objects protected from being made the object of attack.” DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.11.\n\n³⁹ AP I, Art. 58.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n349\n\n## 2.4 What Is the Definition of a Cyberweapon?\n\nBoth international and US law require that weapons be reviewed for legal compliance before they may be acquired or used. AP I codifies the requirement to conduct legal reviews of weapons.⁴⁰ The United States is not a party to AP I, but its practice of conducting legal reviews of weapons is consistent with the requirement, and predated AP I.⁴¹ DoD requires that weapons reviews determine whether a proposed weapon's intended use is calculated to cause superfluous injury, whether it is inherently indiscriminate, and whether it is specifically prohibited, for example by treaty.⁴²\n\nCyberspace operations have introduced new challenges in complying with what is ordinarily a straightforward provision of law. Recognizing that cyberweapons must be subjected to a legal review before acquisition or use does not answer the question of what, exactly, a cyberweapon is. In the case of more traditional weapons, it is generally straightforward to recognize that something is a weapon. Defining \"cyberweapon,\" on the other hand, can be quite tricky. It is difficult to know how to define cyberweapons, as the Manual recognizes: \"Not all cyber capabilities ... constitute a weapon or weapons system.\"⁴³ Nearly every function of a modern military is at least supported by cyber capabilities. Logistics, medical processes, communications, etc. are all highly dependent on computers and networks, yet those particular capabilities would not be classified as weapons. In the case of offensive capabilities, computers, networks, and servers might all be considered part of a cyberweapons system, and legal reviews of the hardware would be straightforward (and pointless, because the same equipment can be used to support civilian and defensive functions). The heart of a cyber-capability is the code on which it is based, and the Manual offers little practical guidance on the proper classification of malware or other commonly encountered cyber techniques.\n\nRather than take on the difficult task of providing a basis for determining whether a cyber-capability is a weapon, the Manual punts, noting that the military services address which cyber-capabilities require legal reviews. This would be more helpful if the services actually did address the issue. The pertinent Army regulation is dated 1979, and the Navy's 2011 regulation lacks cyber-specific language. Only the Air Force has addressed the issues\n\n⁴⁰ AP I, Art. 36.\n⁴¹ The Defense Acquisition System, DoD Directive 5000.1, ¶ E1.1.15 (certified current Nov. 20, 2007); DoD Manual, ¶ 6.2.3.\n⁴² DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 6.2.2. ⁴³ Ibid., ¶ 16.6.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Physical weapons must be designed and manufactured, so changes tend to be infrequent. In contrast, computer code may be changed instantly and easily. It is often altered multiple times in the course of an operation.⁴⁸ The practical problem created is that it appears dozens or hundreds of legal reviews might be required for a single cyber capability.\n\nAn alternate view of the problem is provided in the Tallinn Manual, which addresses the question of what constitutes a cyberweapon in rule 103. “[C]yber weapons are ‘cyber means of warfare’ that are used, designed, or intended to be used to cause injury to, or death of, persons or damage to, or destruction of, objects, that is, that result in the consequences required for qualification of a cyber operation as an attack.”⁴⁹ In the Tallinn Manual cyberattack is defined as “a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”⁵⁰ DoD could consider adopting a modified version of this definition, making a simple change: “design, use, or intended use reasonably capable of causing.” This change would exclude imaginable but remote possibilities of harm that exist with every computer program, but would continue to create\n\n⁴⁴ Whether weapons reviews are controlled by international law or by US policy, it would be preferable to have a single interpretation from DoD, rather than potentially conflicting interpretations provided by individual services.\n\n⁴⁵ AFI 51-402, Legal Reviews of Weapons and Cyber Capabilities (July 27, 2011), 6.\n\n⁴⁶ Ibid., 5. ⁴⁷ Ibid., para 1.1.2.\n\n⁴⁸ See discussion in G.

However, the Air Force definition described above may provide an indication that leaving aside the subjective element of intent might be unacceptable to the United States because the definition would then capture cyber-espionage tools under the definition of weapon.⁵¹\n\nEven a workable definition of cyberweapons does not answer all the challenges. The Manual provides no guidance to help determine what “inherently indiscriminate” means with regard to a cyber-capability. Malware is often spread indiscriminately but may by design have no significant negative effect on untargeted computer systems. Malware may use untargeted systems as vectors to reach its intended target, where it might have great effect. This was the case, for example, in the Stuxnet incident, where malware was spread to over 100,000 computers, but had no significant effects until it reached the computer system at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, where it destroyed over 1,000 nuclear centrifuges.⁵² The Manual takes no position on whether inert code copied indiscriminately and without permission to the hard drives of thousands of computers makes use of that malware unlawful. Based on the extant State practice to date, the answer is probably “no,” but the Manual would be a good vehicle for putting the issue to rest.\n\nCyber “weaponry” is a controversial issue in the larger national security community, as well. The tools and vulnerabilities necessary to conduct computer- and network-based operations for national security missions can also be used against civilian systems in support of intelligence and criminal activity. The US Government has a process to determine whether cyber-vulnerabilities should be disclosed in order to protect the public or held as part of the cyberarsenal to be used in support of national security.⁵³ Some citizen groups argue that States have an obligation to disclose cyber-vulnerabilities they discover so the public can protect themselves from exploitation.⁵⁴ States have been less keen to recognize that there is such an obligation, as it would essentially\n\n⁵¹ One way to handle the espionage/operations overlap on this issue is to simply exclude espionage tools by intent. Another way would be to accept that weapons can be used in espionage in ways that are not attacks, such as using a machete to cut through vegetation on a fence line.

For example, the Wassenaar Arrangement, developed to control the transfer of arms and dual-use technologies, was amended in 2013 to include some cyber-capabilities.⁵⁵ One of the new prohibited categories is intrusion software, which is software “specially designed or modified to avoid detection by ‘monitoring tools’, or to defeat ‘protective countermeasures’, of a computer or network capable device, and performing [data extraction, data modification, or installation of malware].” The intent of the language was to keep powerful computer tools out of the hands of repressive regimes, but the additions also prevented university researchers and law-abiding cyber-intrusion specialists from properly conducting research, because they were unable to share code across national borders.⁵⁶\n\nGiven the range of complex issues surrounding cyberweapons, some indication of the appropriate direction here would have been useful not just to US practitioners, but also to other States that look to the United States for leadership in international law, and particularly value the DoD role in clarifying LOAC. DoD has more experience than any organization in the world at assessing weapons for compliance with international law. It may be as befuddled as everyone about how to define and assess cyber weapons, but setting a single DoD policy, even an imperfect one, would have been a superior course than leaving the issue to be determined by individuals across the US services and the international community, perhaps in very different ways.\n\n## 3 OTHER ISSUES\n\nThe major issues cyber operations law advisors must be equipped to field are discussed above.

    "Commentary on the Law of Cyber Operations\n353\n\n## 3.1 Attribution and Standards of Proof\n\nAttribution is one of the most commonly discussed aspects of cyber operations. Because of the internet's architecture and operation, concealing the identity and location of actors is relatively simple, while discovering the same can be an expensive and time-consuming process that often fails to deliver a certain answer.⁵⁷ The Manual says but little about attribution, merely noting that it is difficult. If the goal of the Manual is to be useful to practitioners, this is a section that could be more complete. For example, there is no indication of what level of proof should be required for various responses.\n\nThe Tallinn Manual offers the guidance that, while pinpointing the origin of an attack does not mean the State owner of the infrastructure is responsible for the attack, it does provide a sort of rebuttable presumption that the host State is responsible.⁵⁸ And, although there is no set standard of proof necessary to engage in countermeasures, the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility notes that the standard for attribution in such cases is \"reasonable certainty.\"⁵⁹ Legal advisors are not starting from scratch when determining the appropriate standard to apply; international law does provide guidance that is helpful, even in the new area of cyber operations. It would be useful for this standard, at least, to be referenced in the Manual.\n\n## 3.2 Neutrality\n\nNeutrality plays a limited role in the cyberspace context. Neutrality under the law of war only applies during international armed conflict and conflicts between States have become very much the exception. Non-international armed conflict (NIAC) is common, however, and aggressive cyber-activities in support of NIAC, and in support of sub-armed conflict State activity, is common.⁶⁰ The Manual's discussion of when neutrality principles apply is\n\n⁵⁷ Even in two high-profile instances where the US Government asserted attribution was certain, controversy about the identity of the culprits continued for months.

Brown\n\nbased on both the 1907 Hague Convention and on the opinion of international legal experts.⁶¹ Of particular note, the chapter in the Manual addressing the law of neutrality is silent with respect to cyber operations. In DoD’s interpretation, some principles of neutrality apply in NIACs, although beyond respecting sovereignty, which is a principle of international law independent of neutrality, it is unclear which specific principles apply to belligerents in such conflicts.⁶²\n\nWith regard to non-participating States in NIACs, the Manual cites the UN General Assembly: “Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.”⁶³ At some point, such activities would result in the offending State becoming a party to the conflict, converting it to an international armed conflict (IAC), so the Manual is apparently citing the language to capture relatively low-level, indirect assistance.⁶⁴ In any event, the Manual suggests that nonbelligerent States in NIACs should refrain from “acquiescing in organized activities” within their territories when the activities are directed to acts of civil strife or terrorism.\n\nThe Manual suggests a contrasting approach in the cyber context, asserting that a State’s neutrality (a term that appears to be used in this chapter to refer to both neutral States and, unconventionally, to nonparticipating States in NIACs) is not dependent on whether it polices its cyber-infrastructure, as long as it does not take steps to discriminate among users of its infrastructure. The Manual explicitly notes that even if data could be characterized as a cyber weapon or otherwise could cause destructive effects in a belligerent State, relaying it would not impact a State’s status as a neutral.\n\nThe disconnect here is probably more about trying to govern cyberspace with a treaty over a hundred years old than it is about neutrality. The Manual fails to take into account that aggressive computer code, in the form of data packets transmitted over the internet, can be the actual means of waging war, not merely communications about waging war, which is what Hague V was meant to address. There is little logical distinction between allowing the transmission of a virtual attack across neutral infrastructure and allowing the\n\n⁶¹ DoD Law of War Manual, § 15.2.1 and Chapter XVII fn. 211. ⁶² Ibid., § 15.2.1.3.\n\n⁶³ Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, annex to UN General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV), UN Doc.

If States do have sovereign rights over code passing through internet infrastructure located in their territory, they ought to have the responsibility to ensure the code they host is doing no harm. Otherwise, the host State is essentially protecting cyber-aggressors from effective action by victim States, which is inconsistent with the application of neutrality in the physical world.⁶⁶ The ultimate conclusion may be left to whether States decide packets of information making up cyber-means of warfare are more akin to communications or to weapons.⁶⁷\n\n## 3.3 Perfidy and Protective Emblems\n\nThe issue of perfidy has limited practical application in cyberwarfare, but it frequently comes up in conversations with cyber operators. The issue is briefly discussed in the Manual under “Improper Use of Signs.”⁶⁸ International law prohibits using perfidy to kill, injure, or capture an adversary.⁶⁹ Perfidy is widely understood as “[a]cts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to receive, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the\n\n⁶⁵ Tallinn Manual, rule 152.\n\n⁶⁶ “These sources make clear that neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent.” A.

Instead, the mission of the aircraft appears to be irrelevant.\n\n⁶⁸ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 5.24.

Brown\n\nintent to betray that confidence.”⁷⁰ To be perfidious, a cyber operation would have to both rely on feigning legal protection and proximately result in death or injury (or capture under the international formulation).⁷¹ For example, an email falsely claiming to be from the International Committee of the Red Cross that successfully lured enemy troops to an armed ambush that resulted in their deaths would constitute perfidy.⁷² One might also imagine a similar false email that escaped electronic scrutiny because of its purported protected sender that, when opened, introduced malware into the adversary network. If that malware directly led to death or injury – by causing a catastrophic failure of a military installation’s power plant, for example – it would be an example of perfidy. If death or injury did not result, it would still be an example of a misuse of a protective emblem.\n\nThe Manual also states it would be inappropriate to use “communications that initiate non-hostile relations, such as prisoner exchanges or ceasefires” to gain entry into an enemy’s computer network.⁷³ The Manual’s support for this proposition is limited to cross-referencing other provisions in the Manual. While the United States may determine this is a good practice, such ruses are not prohibited under LOAC.⁷⁴\n\nSimilarly, the DoD Manual asserts “it would be prohibited to fabricate messages from an enemy’s Head of State falsely informing that State’s forces that an armistice or cease-fire had been signed.”⁷⁵ This, like the prior paragraph’s suggestion that perfidy prohibits false communications that initiate non-hostile relations, is inconsistent with established international law. Such practices may not be good policy, but they are not illegal. According to the 1977 International Red Cross (ICRC) Commentary on Additional Protocol I “the central element of the definition of perfidy is the deliberate claim to legal protection for hostile purposes,” which these lack.⁷⁶ There are arguments to the contrary but, as unchivalrous as these situations may be, they do not meet the definition of perfidy.⁷⁷\n\nCyber operations can be the most effective method of disseminating and obtaining information, so the portions of LOAC related to information are\n\n⁷⁰ AP I, Art. 37(1). ⁷¹ Tallinn Manual, rule 122(3).\n⁷² This is an adaptation of an example from the Tallinn Manual, rule 122(5).\n⁷³ DoD Law of War Manual, ¶ 16.5.4. ⁷⁴ Ibid., ¶¶ 12.2, 5.21. ⁷⁵ Ibid., ¶ 16.5.4.\n⁷⁶ ICRC, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 (7), 429, www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/RC_commentary-1977.html.\n⁷⁷ See S.

Protective emblems, such as the Red Cross (and other protected emblems), enemy prisoners of war (EPW) protections, and the blue shield that protects cultural property publicly note that certain facilities or individuals are protected from direct attack. Determining how best to translate the requirement of and respect for physical signage to virtual demarcation is still underway.\n\nAn area that is insufficiently addressed in the law is medical information. AP I requires that medical units and transports be marked as such.78 The Tallinn Manual opined that the marking and protection obligations extend to “[c]omputers, computer networks, and data that form an integral part of the operations or administration of medical units and transports.”79 The DoD Manual is silent on the issue, but it is one that merits consideration and decision so that it can be uniformly implemented. This would help ensure the protection of medical data and protect against accidental misuse of the protective emblem.\n\n## 3.4 Civilians as Combatants\n\nThe DoD Manual succinctly summarizes the law on civilian employees’ involvement in cyberwarfare. Civilian employees are permitted to directly participate in hostilities (DPH), but they forfeit any protection they would receive as civilians during the participation. There may be political or other policy rationales for preventing civilians from acting as cyber “trigger-pullers,” but it is permissible under LOAC. One reason DoD is comfortable with this broad reading of appropriate civilian conduct may be that cyberwarfare tends to be conducted from a distance, so there is less concern about increasing the chance that other, non-participating civilians could be mistaken for lawful targets.\n\n## 4 CONCLUSION\n\nThis chapter of the Commentary has focused more on developments of the law and shortcomings in the Manual than some other chapters. That is because, despite the lessons learned over many years of armed conflict about how the law of war should apply to best protect civilians and prevent unnecessary suffering, there are gaps in its practical application to cyberwarfare. As noted above, many questions remain about exactly how the law should apply to operations in cyberspace, yet the disruptive and destructive\n\n78 AP I, Art. 18. 79 Tallinn Manual, rule 132.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

State custom, practice, and norms are being created rapidly, as well, more through inaction than action. The cyber operations chapter in the Manual offered an opportunity for the United States to guide both the present and the future of cyber operations law, but DoD chose not to grasp it.\n\nAlthough DoD minimizes the role of military manuals in the development of international law, noting specifically in the DoD Manual that the views \"do not necessarily reflect the views of [other federal agencies] or the US Government as a whole,\" any information the United States provides will carry great weight.80 States are hungry for guidance on how the law of war applies to cyberwarfare, and the US owns the most important voice in the field. This may be why DoD was reluctant to take a bolder stand on the key issues that matter to coalition partners and experts in the field, but it also carries the risk that others, who may not share the interests of the United States with respect to ensuring freedoms of expression and association, may succeed in filling in the gaps.81 In the absence of official guidance, academic works carry more than their usual weight, as well, and the musings of academics are less likely to be constrained by practicality. It would be in DoD's selfish interest to encourage a practical body of law that supports military operations, rather than an idealistic set of pronouncements that will be ignored.\n\nThe most critical failing of the cyber operations chapter is that it offers no useful ideas on how to apply international law, or even US policy, to the most likely cyber-scenarios. Although military cyberspace operations are in their infancy, useful examples could have been drawn from a short list of real-world events. Cyber-incidents in Estonia (2007), the Republic of Georgia (2008), Iran (2009), and Saudi Arabia (2012) are just a few examples that might have been used to walk through various issues in a way relevant for operations lawyers.82 More recently, Russia's alleged use of cyber-methods to disseminate\n\n80 DoD Law of War Manual, iv.

The brevity and lack of specificity in the chapter may be an indication that DoD believes the law is insufficiently developed for it to provide guidance. Unfortunately, discomfort with the state of the law does not remove the responsibility of government legal advisors, who are the target audience of the Manual and must provide advice on cyber operations with or without legal direction from the manual. Even if the area is changing rapidly, it would be useful for DoD to provide more complete guidance to the field that would also suggest a framework for the international community. Even providing complete footnotes (as opposed to mostly internal references) would be a great help to practitioners; it would give them a jumping-off point for filling in the substantive gaps left by the Manual.\n\nDoD seems to be committed to making online changes to the Manual, and has demonstrated some alacrity in doing so. The cyber operations chapter is a likely candidate for significant development in the near future, and we can hope that future revisions will provide more specific guidance on how the law applies, or does not apply, to the emerging area of cyberwarfare.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108659727.015 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
