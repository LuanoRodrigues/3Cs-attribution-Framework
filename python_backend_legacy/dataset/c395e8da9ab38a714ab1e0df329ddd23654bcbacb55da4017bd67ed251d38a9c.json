Paralysis, rather than physical destruction, appears to be the outcome. Recent incidents between 2007 and 2013 illustrate the slippery interface between war and peace through the conflation of terrestrial order and disorder, cyberspatial chaos, and the lack of clarity of the source of the attack. In April 2007, the world's first full-scale cyberattack targeted the Republic of Estonia. The cause was publicly speculated by Estonian politicians and public opinion as an offline one: Russian residents in the former Soviet republic were vehemently taking to the streets and media to protest the government's removal of a Soviet era military memorial in the Estonian capital Tallinn. It did not help matters that since Estonia declared “independence” from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, relations between Russia and Estonia had been either stagnant or strained. The attacks occurred in the context of Estonia being the most wired nation-state in Europe, with an estimated 90 percent of all domestic financial transactions being carried out online, and some 70 percent of tax returns being filed through the Internet. The so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks disrupted most “peacetime” economic life in the country and virtually paralyzed the government in Tallinn. Estonian defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo admitted that the hardest part about responding was the inability to verify the source of the attacks:“Some of those countries [e.g. Russia, Moldova, Ukraine] have many more serious problems than cybersecurity and cybercrime legislation. Secondly, sometimes there are only claims that people are acting from those geographic locations. We can't prove that. Like there are safe havens for terrorism—I mean, Afghanistan is one example, Yemen is emerging. We don't know about Nigeria. There are very many more safe havens in cyberspace than in real space.”\n\nWhat is interesting here is the conventional disorientation within which a government official assesses his country's first cyberwar. The same conundrum about the source of an attack was manipulated by Israel, North Korea, China, Russia, and nonstate groups named Anonymous and LulzSec, between 2007 and 2011 to launch attacks against commercial companies, foreign governments, and political parties on the pretexts of either private or undeclared vendettas. In 2006, the Bush Administration began inserting malware into Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz in order to map its computer vulnerabilities; since 2009, the Obama Administration had followed up with full-scale attacks to slow down the Iranian nuclear effort. Experts dubbed the cyberweapon “Stuxnet.” The United States was fingered as the source of Stuxnet, developed with Israeli collaboration, only after a journalist interviewed unnamed officials willing to leak the story. In August 2012, the computers at Saudi oil company Aramco were struck by a virus that systematically erased data on three-quarters of their databanks, replacing the data with an image of a burning American flag. No oil was spilled, nor burned, in this “attack” but computer experts flown in",

These experts concluded that the data erasing command within Shamoon, dubbed “Wiper,” clearly imitated another virus named “Flame” that had mysteriously attacked Iranian oil companies right up till May 2012.4 Was Flame therefore a variant and an accessory to Stuxnet, and therefore attributable to Washington's virtual war against Tehran? If the attacking virus was replicated, who was the more culpable electronic combatant: the initiator or the imitator-cum-retaliator? In February 2013, a private web security company, Mandiant, publicly blamed the Chinese army unit 61398, situated in Shanghai, for a spate of cyber vandalism and theft at Google, Microsoft, RSA, and The New York Times, among other American corporations. The Chinese foreign ministry ingenuously countered that their country were equally at the receiving end of cyber attacks from unnamed states.5 The same Chinese spokesperson conveniently omitted any mention of domestic Internet vigilantes, as well as alienated, unemployed, computer literate college graduates within the People's Republic. This article ventures that generating open-ended paralysis and manipulating this vagary behind the source of an attack could well be strategy in itself. This is the core of an Asian prescription for information operations (IO).\n\nFor starters, some terminological clarification is needed to indicate the maneuverable space within IO in contrast to IW. IW has been treated by its foremost American proponents as a paradigmatic displacement of conventional offline warfighting. But the reasons for such a claim are actually rather weak if one considers non-western approaches to informational components of warfare. For a working definition, this article shall define IW as the use of symbolic resources to penetrate the enemy's secrecy and confidence for the purpose of winning a war on one's own terms. The proximate concept of IO refers to that entire range of symbolic resources straddling both military and civilian spheres that are aimed at achieving national objectives in both peacetime and wartime. These include psychological operations (PSYOPS), military deception (MILDEC), electronic countermeasures warfare, and public diplomacy. IW remains IO's predecessor.\n\nThe aim of this article is to supply an Asian perspective on IO that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. The appeal of pondering an Asian perspective lies in opening up the military mind to insights from a different civilization with its attendant particularistic philosophies. Civilizations are desirable sources of ideas given the fact that they are accumulations of wisdom and praxis across time and space directed by conscious human endeavor. This human endeavor aspires to distinguish one section of humanity from the rest.6 Attitudes toward understanding IO in all its complexities can therefore be enhanced through interaction with a non-western body of pre-digital wisdom. The deployment of information for strategic uses is in all probability culturally filtered. The agent deploying information to convert or confuse others is exercising a power over the creation of meaning. This is a point reiterated prominently by social constructivists in political science, international relations, and in linguistics.7 It will consequently be argued that an",

This is a call for dialogue with non-western strategy rather than an ideological confrontation. To some extent, the survey produced by James Yin and Philip Taylor of four Asian countries' existing equivalents of IW doctrines and capabilities breaks ground for the current enterprise.^{8} That said, Yin and Taylor have merely described the existing state of operational profiles of Asian IW and imputed an Asian perspective to them. This cannot be adequate since critics might argue that the existing state of Asian IW doctrines are merely adaptations of western models of PSYOPS from the Cold War and later. It is also quite revealing that in 1955, with Cold War insurgencies in East Asia rising to fever pitch, Edward Katzenbach and Gene Hanrahan commented that Mao Zedong's revolutionary appeal among Southeast Asian communists lies in its “monopoly of patience” and its corollary that the strategy of the superior military mind “has very little to do with technological superiority.”^{9} Given space constraints within an article-length reflection, I sample only three Asian strategic thinkers who are prominent in classic strategic studies readers such as Peter Paret's Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age^{10} and other specialist surveys of unconventional warfare:^{11} Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. Omitted are other Asian voices of varying historical and geographical pedigrees. Nonetheless, by examining Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, readers should be able to discern what a more careful consideration of Asian perspectives could yield. Table 1 illustrates the subtle contrasts between Western IW and Asian IO approaches which this article intends to show.\n\nTaking a foundational approach to sketching Asian IO, this article will begin by surveying the predominantly American interpretation of IW in terms of a number of IW characteristics that should be opened up to critical contrast to Asian ways. The American interpretation of IW will be analyzed in terms of five characteristics: liberal democratic modernization, cyber delinquency, bureaucratic confusion, cyber power, and soft power. Subsequently, via Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a more Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately redescribed as IO. To generalize, an Asian IO approach is ideologically agnostic and unlikely to distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it distinguish strategy from tactics; moreover, it will indulge in subterfuge.\n\n## Western Approaches to IW: Information Capability via Liberal Democratic Modernization, Cyber Delinquency, Bureaucratic Confusion, and Cyber Power and Soft Power\n\nFollowing Clausewitzian thought on military strategy, the utility of information in war may be understood to be heavily dependent upon intellectual powers that are up to the task of deploying information adroitly according to constant changes in capabilities and “out of the box” challenges.^{12} Edward Luttwak's treatment of",

Strategy, to Luttwak, is always an exercise in selecting information to maximize one's purpose, but this in turn requires factoring in the unexpected as undertaken by one's equally breathing and thinking adversary.¹³ As more scholars attempt to keep up with the \"information revolution\" associated with the penetration of computers into business networking and consumer lifestyles, it is to be expected that international relations and security in \"the digital age\" remains an underexplored area.¹⁴ Part of the problem lies in the lack of communication between disciplines and, worse, between different frequencies within the same subfield of a discipline. Such is the problem with treating information as part of strategy. Information is critical to all domains of knowledge inquiry.\n\n## Assumptions of Superiority in Advanced Liberal Democratic Modernization\n\nTaking these complexities to heart, an early groundbreaking work in the study of IW was grandiosely titled *In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information*",

The editors and lead authors, John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, chose the metaphor of the Greek Goddess Athena over Mars, the God of War, for the reason that Athena stood for the superior use of information as knowledge to civilize people; moreover, she embodied the virtues of Athenian government, especially democracy. One can see how such a conception also perfectly mirrors the primary mission of American foreign policy. This liberal democratic influence, married to a technological vision of modernization, is carried further in Arquilla and Ronfeldt's choice of authors for their Foreword, Alvin and Heidi Toffler. The Tofflers are well known for their futurism studies, as well as their thesis about the three waves of technological civilization. The first wave concerned the agricultural revolution whereby certain peoples organized government and economy to systematically exploit natural food sources for sustaining human life. The second wave witnessed the application of electromechanical principles to provide inanimate sources of energy for human industry. The third wave enabled humanity to manipulate scientific principles to create whole new energy sources and even life forms. This made the \"Revolution in Military Affairs” (RMA) possible by the late twentieth century. To the Tofflers, the implications of the RMA would be on par with those generated by microbiological technology, genetics and cloning, and nuclear physics. Knowledge “has moved from a peripheral to a central position where ideas, innovation, values, imagination, symbols and imagery, not just computer data, play more and more important roles.”\n\nWhereas in the past, information in military strategy referred to morale, leadership, courage, and strategic insight, in today's terms, intangible information also includes “what is inside our databanks as well as the skulls of our soldiers. They include the power of software, the ability to blindside an opponent's information technology, the superiority of information collection and dissemination, the compatibility of information-enhancing tools, and much more.” This was framed by the Tofflers' reading that “America is the source of the most stunning knowledge-enhancing technologies, and most of its workforce is engaged in one or another form of knowledge work ... Nevertheless, the United States still has a residual sector of the economy based on low-skill muscle-work. And the US military reflects a similar duality.” The Tofflers acknowledge that while the United States currently possesses “some very big ‘media howitzers' that nobody else has” in the form of Hollywood and CNN:“ ... any idea that the US government or its military should attempt to rationalize or to impose broad controls on the US media in the interest of a coherent information warfare doctrine is anachronistic and counterproductive. The further a country advances toward Third Wave economic and social systems, the less likely central censorship or control will work. Third Wave economies thrive on open ideas and information systems, the irrepressible Internet being the most obvious example.”\n\nFreedom of information flow should theoretically lead to the unleashing of the ideological power of “open society” and “open government” as concepts.

On one hand, he claims clinically that technology is not necessarily predestined to support or yield liberty but in the case of the Internet, the precedents of its use have opened up the possibilities of a struggle:“Yet, all the same, the distortions [of Internet usage] are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most fantastic means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed peoples, who have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the Internet provides power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can be disseminated worldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult to hide a public demonstration, an act of repression or a violation of human rights.In authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion and civil society. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.”\n\nA battle is continually being waged to harness the Internet in the service of either authoritarian politics or its liberal protagonists, but one that liberals ought to win, in Kouchner's view. The first wave of the Arab Spring Revolutions of 2010--2012 have borne out Kouchner's predictions, but the ongoing bittersweet postscript in Egypt and Libya have dulled popular expectations that “Facebook revolutions” can be sustained in their political gains. These contradictory trends mean that IW will be inevitably politicized according to some of these “default, western” ideological assumptions. In fact, the link between liberal democracy and IW actually inhibits further exploration of IW as a comprehensive strategy since it limits debate and exploration to the uses liberal democracies make of it. The recent practices of undeclared IW by Russia and China, and some purport North Korea and Iran as well, undermine the liberal claims to the IW discourse. It is a mistake for IW thinkers to assume there is a preferential kinship between IW and any particular ideology.\n\n### IW's Roots in Cyber Delinquency\n\nCyber delinquency is a very recent label used to categorize criminal activities produced directly through the Internet. Yet, like the presumed linkage between liberalism and IW, this deserves unpacking. As a source of information, the Internet was designed for accessibility by its myriad contributors. Yet, in the twenty years since its public debut, it has been treated by many observers as an evolving “jungle” of abuse and source of harm to “innocent” democratically faithful users. Most",

If “breaking and entering” without consent is criminal in the terrestrial world, it appears that cyberspace has taken on earthly characteristics, especially when observers and governments debate the prospect of governance of the Internet. Interestingly, the phrase “computer hacker,” or simply “hacker” has taken on the connotation of a night robber who forces his way into the inner sanctum of a home or office and steals its valuable contents. This is an unproblematic assumption from the perspective of law enforcement officials, but misses an important feature of the Internet era society according to a prominent scholar of the Internet, Manuel Castells.\n\nCastells argues that the so-called culture of freedom embedded in the Internet depends upon the interplay of roles between four virtual cultures arising from online interaction: “These cultural layers are hierarchically disposed: the techno-meritocratic culture becomes specified as a hacker culture by building rules and customs into networks of cooperation aimed at technological projects. The virtual communitarian culture adds a social dimension to technological sharing, by making the Internet a medium of selective social interaction and symbolic belonging. The entrepreneurial culture works on top of the hacker culture, and on the communitarian culture, to diffuse Internet practices in all domains of society by way of moneymaking. Without the techno-meritocratic culture, hackers would simply be a specific countercultural community of geeks and nerds.” Richard Power, one of the first observers of Internet security to author a book on digital crime, echoes his view. In his many visits to and interviews with cybersecurity analysts, Power observes that hacking begins with a deep-seated curiosity about computer systems. How capable is a computer, a software, or a particular database unless it is tested? Furthermore, as Power's research indicates, curiosity is bound up with professional desire to prove one's competence in discovering the vulnerabilities of connected computers, as well as in savoring an ego trip toward becoming the “master of online access.” These ambitions might also lead computer hackers to embrace a highly presumptuous, and even delusional, form of social heroism endeavoring to protect the ordinary user from rapacious corporations and governments. Power goes so far as to distinguish the hacker from the virus writer.\n\nThere is a great deal of intelligence and skill coupled to social and political potential in cyberspace crimes. Between 1997 and 2000, roughly coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the advent of the Internet, the top four criminal activities online were, in descending order of importance: virus attacks, insider abuse of web access, unauthorized access to databases by insiders, and denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. By 2009--2010, the US government reported that these categories appeared to have diminished in volume, and the new top four categories were “non-delivery of payment or merchandise,” Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)-related scams such as impersonating the Bureau online, “identity theft” and “computer crimes.” Since 1997, the US Department of Justice and the FBI have become more refined in their data capture. But it is also significant that between 2008 and 2009, there was a 22.3",

After 2010, both American agencies have discontinued annual Internet Crime Reports, preferring instead to issue periodic and crime-specific alerts. These criminal activities suggest that the Internet has evolved in tandem with real-world human nature to enable the extension of offline crimes into online activities. One could of course go on and cite the quality and intensity of cyberspace fraud that ranges from the disgruntled employee who attacks his own corporation, to the frequency of curiosity-driven sabotage of telecommunications companies, as well as the first widespread DDOS attacks against Yahoo, eBay, CNN, and Amazon.com in 2000. But this is, if Castells, Power, and other scholars are to be taken seriously, intrinsic to the human side of the web. Just as human enlightenment is to be expanded through the Internet and its applications, human beings can likewise use it to inflict pain and destruction. These predicaments are little different from those arising from the abuse of public spaces for hate crimes or supplying energy utilities at inflated rates to fleece consumers within a nation-state.\n\nHence, one cannot assume that cyber delinquency is simply just that—crime. Internet-based delinquency affords multiple new arenas for trials of strength among persons participating in and building an information society. Whenever authorities investigate “hacktivism,” the more enlightened among them often spot an opportunity to turn the perpetrator around toward new online uses that harmonize with pre-existing political interests. It is not surprising that, just as in espionage, governments rarely advertise the fact that online saboteurs can just as easily be turned to the service of covert national missions against real and imagined enemies. Alexander Klimburg has highlighted the roles of “Patriot Hackers” in the Chinese and Russian cyberwar “armies.” Most books on IW or cyberwar often use the commanding verb “imagine” to introduce the discussions of what hackers and virus creators could do if they penetrated international boundaries online. The world's first interstate cyberwar nearly broke out in tandem with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s military intervention in Kosovo in 1999. What eventually happened was a series of localized skirmishes between anti-Serb and pro-Serb Internet users employing propaganda e-mails and website postings. The US government hesitated before unleashing its cyber attack on Serbian banks, government and military systems to coincide with the physical aerial bombing campaign on the grounds of self-restraint. The US Department of Defense (US DoD) had concluded that IW against Serbia might invoke charges from third parties, as well as Serbians, that the Americans had willfully committed war crimes and other violations against United States and international law on cybercrimes. Additionally, it was reported that Serbian military computer systems were too dispersed, and had the Serbs attacked first, the chances of accurately verifying the sources of those attacks would be low. The unofficial revelations in June 2012 of President Obama's green light for preemptive cyber attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities suggest that the United States may have revised its doctrinal treatment of cyberwar as cyber delinquency.

By the time the next major Sino--American military incident occurred in April 2001, over the mid-air collision between a Chinese jet fighter and a US reconnaissance plane, Chinese hackers “unilaterally” defaced several US government sites. This coincided with the appearance of a number of smart viruses originating from Chinese users. Furthermore, the silence from Beijing regarding these actions hinted at the growing sophistication of its IW doctrine. Henceforth, any strategic doctrine should pay heed to the implications of the fungibility of cyber delinquency for defense purposes.\n\n### E-promise, Bureaucratic Confusion\n\nWhen the conceptual promise of “E-government” was derived with the advent of the Internet, the clarion call from information age gurus and journalists was to speed up, open up, and render government ever more transparent and responsive to its clients—the public at large. An Economist commentary in 2000 suggested that if web retailers and Internet service providers set the benchmark for virtual services, consumers would definitely not put up with “slum standards in the public sector.” The reason why governments have traditionally been slow to respond to public demands is due to the need to coordinate action across multiple agencies and to verify identities and other stored information about the citizenry. In tandem with this information-rich development, the public sector organization has been “problematized” as a rich target for IW.\n\nChristopher Paul, in scrutinizing the US government's predicament, observes that “the novelty of IO [Information Operations] was a combination of the recognition of the information age importance and vulnerability of adversary (and friendly) information and information systems, plus a desire for a coordinated, integrated approach to attacking and defending those data and systems.” This bureaucratic feature of IO implies that strengths and weaknesses are interchangeable. There is also the implication that organizations are only as strong as the weakest link in their chain of command. The idea of the bureaucracy as a system simply means that pulverizing a linchpin of it can trigger its wholesale collapse.\n\nIn the mostly American dominated literature on IW, there have been a number of books and articles that critically analyze the problems with defining mission foci among a number of overlapping governmental agencies tasked with prosecuting IW, and with identifying vulnerabilities in target organizations for IW. Walter Jajko's “Critical Commentary on the Department of Defense Authorities for Information Operations” published ten years ago in the journal Comparative Strategy called attention to the bureaucratic weaknesses in the American effort. While most of Jajko's piece deals with the specifics of US organizational tasking, some highlights are worth noting here to facilitate the discussion of the Asian supplement to IW theorizing. Jajko argued that the definitional vagary of IW, or IO, could potentially hamper governmental coordination but praised the US DoD for adopting an all-inclusive definition that could encompass",

This was somewhat addressed by a secret presidential directive signed by the Obama Administration in mid-2009 creating a White House office for a “Cyberczar” as well as a corresponding Pentagon-housed military command for cyberspace. Nevertheless, Jajko labels the reversibility of information/Internet dependence and accessibility a vulnerability for military planners.\n\nTraditional service cultures within the Army, Navy, and Air Force also tended to treat IO as “adjunct operations” supporting physical missions in their respective domains of land, sea, and air. Furthermore, IW doctrine is pursued only according to each service's intrinsic interpretations. Moreover, there is, attending to each service interpretation, the lack of clarity over whether to target strictly military enemies, or whether there should be any operational distinction between actual and potential enemies. US DoD guidelines up till 2002 were analyzed as being open-ended and vague in implying that peacetime, precrisis offensive IO could well prove useful to war planning and may be conducted “inside and outside of the traditional battlespace to shape it and prepare the way for future operations.” As of 2013, it remains unclear if any of these issues have been addressed institutionally by the three US armed services, but Jajko's commentary deserves its place as a form of “pre-theorizing” of IW as bureaucratic streamlining.\n\nBooks by Christopher Paul and Alexander, Kott et al. not only echo Jajko's analyses, but also go on to address the possibilities of targeting the adversary's precise organizational decision-making processes and chain of command. Yet, as the contributors to Kott et al. note “the challenge is that most of the time we cannot observe the elements of the structures in the organization. Instead, we can obtain the intelligence due to the actions and activities of the organization.” The thrust of the various contributors to Kott et al.'s volume is that traditional modes of intelligence operations, under familiar labels such as penetrating the enemy's operations security, planting moles, playing deception through PSYOPS, and the accumulation of open-source political intelligence are all essential to displacing the many weak links in the adversary's bureaucratic decision-making process. Paul appreciates that these penetration efforts represent strategy at work but warns that IO straddle the black, the white, and the gray, implying that PSYOPS involve deploying untruths and half-truths, and hence should be used sparingly. In these ways, American scholars point to a fundamental problem in any information-reliant and complex governing environment: how should IW become a multipronged and nimble information operation?\n\n### Cyber Power for IW\n\nThe promise of Internet-enabled long range computer attacks has spurred fevered imaginations to propose the integrated concept of national cyber power.

There is scant attention toward the subtleties of force, and impact multiplication, arising from any physically miniscule form of power. The power of computer analysts armed with skills for hacking, and capabilities for code breaking and cipher alteration through mathematical speculation, cannot be quantified. Yet another set of complementary perspectives is fronted by the writings of Adam Liff, Dale Peterson, and Thomas Rid. Liff tried very hard in his 2012 article to stimulate analysis of cyberwar along the premise of Bernard Brodie's^{45} post-1945 speculation upon the impact of atomic weapons on war. Liff contends that cyberwarfare should be understood as the “cost-inducing use of computer network attacks” against an enemy's vital military and civilian infrastructures with coercive intentions.^{46} He claims it is a political bargaining process between two or more actors where costs are decisive in shaping outcomes. This is elaborated by his conjectures upon cyberweapons as the ideal asymmetrical ideal; the difficulty of attributing attacks for certain; cyberweapons as an offensive force multiplier; and the possibility of cyberdeterrence.^{47} Dale Peterson goes further into the mode of specifying cyberweapons in three tiers: simple, moderate level, and complex.^{48} Each of these types correspond to the degree of damage they are intended to inflict, ranging from disruption of normal service, to disablement of specific components of a targeted system, to a thorough transformation by stealth of a targeted industrial system to the extent that the latter is hijacked or programmed to be remotely controlled by the attacker. Peterson goes on to discuss the architecture of an industrial control system and how a cyberweapon can be reverse engineered in tandem with the intricacies of the original design of that system.^{49} Finally, Thomas Rid has proposed that cyber weapons can be “helpfully” employed for “sabotage” campaigns short of the violence associated with outright war.^{50} Such distinctions depend on the ability to draw fine lines between the Clausewitzian conception of war as absolute violence and targeted destruction suited to limited objectives. In pondering cyber power through the rational choice frames of conventional kinetic and nuclear weaponry, these authors are bound by an imperfect hindsight that neglects the possibilities of structural human and philosophical vagaries that may deeply characterize those parts of IW employing cyber means.\n\n### Soft Power as IW\n\nA fourth characteristic of the existing literature on IW stems from Joseph Nye's concept of soft power as the ability to get others to want what one wants through voluntary attraction.^{51} In Nye's original formulation, soft power was thought to",

Starting with Nye and Owens' article published in 1996 in Foreign Affairs magazine, titled “America's Information Edge,” the idea that American public diplomacy ought to be integrated into a coherent grand strategy of information that connected the dots between Hollywood films, US universities, the US Constitution, US popular culture, civic culture, and America's corporate mastery of the electronic communications market, captured the imagination of governments and think tanks worldwide. Arquilla and Ronfeldt included it in their gamut of tools in preparing the nation for information age threats but elaborated no further as to how soft power could actually assist warfare.\n\nLeigh Armistead's book, Information Operations: Warfare and the Hard Reality of Soft Power, has at least attempted to persuade the military to embrace the new power currency as a means to deal with the spectrum of post-Cold War “new threats” ranging from rogue states (the then Baathist Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and Myanmar) to rogue nonstate actors, such as separatist groups, exiled groups, and Al Qaeda. To Armistead, the new threats could not be simply bombed out of existence, or neutralized through direct armed occupation; they could only be eliminated through a battle for hearts and minds. Unless carefully redefined, PSYOPS and MILDEC are too crude in the era of globalization since foreign public opinion can verify information credibility through access to Internet sources and satellite-based round-the-clock global news on both television and Internet. Armistead's approach is unhelpful since it takes a kitchen sink approach to strategy, implying information is all important but hardly detailing how it integrates into grand strategy.\n\nBut as Armistead points out, the invocation of soft power returns the discussion to whether peacetime and wartime distinctions in information strategy are operationally relevant. Presumably, militaries committed to IW or IO need to automatically fold domestic public opinion and private sector entities into a holistic effort. Soft power therefore merits inclusion as a point of reflection because of its civilian face, which is crucial for mitigating armed conflict. Some might also argue that the power of ideas embedded in the structures of knowledge and everyday practice could well constrict a rival's choices, leading toward the achievement of one's goals without ever firing a shot. Should one then consider dismissing IW in its strictest definition in favor of invoking the “magic” of soft power?\n\nUnfortunately, Nye has himself muddled the soft power component in IO when he recently argued that cyber power was the larger concept encompassing soft power. According to Nye, cyber power refers to the contextual power arising from resources deployable within cyberspace. He then goes on to argue that cyber power can be both hard (e.g. “denial of service attacks,” “government control over companies,” and “bombing of routers and cutting of cables”) and soft (e.g. “public diplomacy campaign,” “setting norms and standards,” and “protests to name and shame cyber providers”). Since cyberspace is an “imperfect [global] commons,” both hard and soft cyber power should be used as appropriate. While governments",

But this angle of approach reflects nothing more than Nye's inability to provide a definitive formulation of IO through the lens of soft power—after all, if the power of ideas is paramount in a networked world, why does the United States need to contemplate physical denial as an aspect of exercising cyber power? As many observers have pointed out in the wake of eroding American economic competitiveness in Africa and Latin America vis-à-vis China, and mounting criticism of drone-enabled assassinations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen, soft power through IO needs to deploy social sensitivity in the minds of the proverbial boots on the ground.\n\n## Asian Strategic Thought on IO\n\nIn contrast to the aforementioned strands of cyberwarfare thinking, certain Asian theorists and practitioners have not tried to delineate between the physical, the permissible and democratic, and the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. Asian strategic thought has long been viewed as both a complement to and a contrast against western theorizing. But it has been underappreciated in operationally remolding western-originated strategy. Before one proceeds any further in adducing an Asian supplement via a sampled reading of the works of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, the invocation of Asian thinkers must be justified. The thesis of a culturally filtered Asian military revolution must be treated seriously if one is to break out of the mold of treating the West as the only source of military strategy. Peter Lorge has made a compelling case that Asian military strategy cannot be regarded as historically inferior simply because Asia appeared to be laggard in embracing a military revolution characterized by gunpowder, guns, and war-making machines powered by inanimate energy sources. Asian guns were available earlier than the assumed military revolution in Europe; they were not widely deployed simply because the Asian theater and cultural mores of the time militated against their use. But, more importantly, there are some distinct and intriguing parallels between Asian political philosophies that emphasize undoing the enemy's strategies by sowing chaos and the pre-digital western strategic thought of individuals like Machiavelli and Clausewitz. Considering that IOs prior to the advent of the Internet have already been partially treated as a worthy subject, there is every reason to study past wisdom for their bearing on the current information age.\n\n### Sun Tzu\n\nAs a cumulative collection of didactic texts on military strategy dating back more than 2,500 years, Sun Tzu's Art of War (Sunzi Bingfa) has captured the imagination of strategic studies scholars beyond China and Japan, even though many scholars believe it to have been inspired by the Sung Dynasty's (tenth to thirteenth centuries)",

In Sun Tzu's opening chapter “Making Assessments,” he identifies five fundamental factors of war: moral influence, weather, distance and terrain, command, and doctrine. Of these, his reading of moral influence, cryptically referred to as Dao or “the Way” in Sun Tzu's original parlance, carries particular Daoist and Confucian connotations. Moral influence is “that which causes people to think in line with their sovereign so that they will follow him through every vicissitude, whether to live or to die, without fear of mortal peril.” Information in Sun Tzu's mental framework emerges as a paradigm of correctly investing the energies of the state and its people in harmonized attainment of the national objective through either peace or war. War might be a miscalculation if it ultimately ruins the state and its people, so it must be embarked upon only after in-depth consideration of all its factors, with “moral influence” being the leading one. The general ought also to be skilled in balancing the seemingly contradictory values of compassion for his soldiers with courage in battle. Boldness should not be confused with recklessness. Calculating information is also critical to treating war as a game of deception: “feign incapability when in fact capable; feign inactivity when ready to strike; appear to be far away when actually nearby, and vice versa. When the enemy is greedy for gains, hand out a bait to lure him; when he is in disorder, attack and overcome him ... if he is given to anger, provoke him.” In Chapter 3 “Attacking by Stratagem,” Sun Tzu counsels that “to fight a hundred battles and win each and every one of them is not the wisest thing to do. To break the enemy's resistance without fighting is.”\n\nInsofar as Sun Tzu speaks directly to IW in our time, his counsel is to read the opportunity costs of waging war correctly, and never end up with greater losses than those envisioned in the opening gambit. Essentially, IW is folded into what we term IO as an art of reading the proverbial “tea leaves” of achieving national goals using the right policy instruments adapted to circumstances.\n\nLiterally, one should follow the Way of the Dao. Although Sun Tzu does not explicitly address the distinction between peacetime and wartime, there is frequent intimation that the two periods exist on a seamless continuum of preparation for the eventuality of combat. To be victorious in the event of war, one's military must be deployed advantageously, akin to the momentum found in nature: torrential water moving boulders, falcons falling upon hapless prey, and so forth. Because mental preparations must draw on parallels to the forces of nature, and nature in turn",

Conversely, Sun Tzu extolled the possibilities of sowing luan within one's enemy.\n\nAs such, Sun Tzu appears to embrace espionage as a lofty form of IO in his time. Here, it is worth quoting in full: “The enlightened sovereign and the capable commander conquer the enemy at every move and achieve successes far surpassing those of ordinary people because they possess ‘foreknowledge.' This ‘foreknowledge' cannot be obtained from ghosts or spirits, nor from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor from astrological calculations. It can only come from men who know the enemy situation.” This is from the Art of War's closing Chapter 13, titled “Using Spies.” Sun Tzu specifies in some detail five types of spy: the native agent, the internal agent, the converted agent, the expendable agent, and the surviving agent. The details need not concern us; all involve the need to penetrate the walls of the enemy's inner sanctums of government and put on a veneer of sincerely empathizing with the enemy, in order to listen in on their most subtle intentions. There is no right or wrong time for espionage—“so delicate and so secretive is espionage that there is nowhere you cannot put it to good use.” In employing spies, the overriding goal of gaining “foreknowledge” must always drive action. Fully deniable cyberspace intrusions are highly necessary if one takes this advice seriously. One, of course, might pose the question as to whether gaining “foreknowledge” does not undercut adherence to the cosmic harmony that the Way promotes in harmonizing interstate relations.\n\n### Mao Zedong\n\nMao is easily the second most important Asian military thinker found in war studies syllabi. His stature is partly derived from association with the contemporary postcolonial politics of East Asia. It also stems from the fact that Mao's ideological immersion in Marxism--Leninism was indigenized in the fledgling Chinese Communist Party, followed by constant harassment from “class enemies,” as well as the Japanese during the Pacific War. Mao's brand of armed rural revolutionary war was hatched in the vast and often inhospitable countryside, in mountains, valleys, and secluded areas. He had to appraise the Chinese strategic environment virtually from scratch as a political outsider to the then ruling Guomindang's dominance in the teeming urban population centers. The Chinese Civil War was scripted into a war between the “righteous” have-nots against the “nefarious” haves. In many ways, Mao's thinking on military affairs possessed a do-it-yourself quality, though he was also drawn to ideologies bound to be attractive to the underdog in a revolutionary struggle.\n\nAs John Shy and Thomas Collier have aptly noted in their survey of the subject of revolutionary war, Mao stands out as one of the rare thinkers postulating that “strategic theory has meaning only in terms of the concrete political, social, and international circumstances at the moment in which theory is being elucidated.” In Mao's",

In this regard, political warfare qua IW qua revolutionary warfare qua armed struggle should be components in a fluid spectrum of means used to attain revolutionary objectives. In his essay, “The Military Problem” written under very difficult physical circumstances, Mao exhorts his comrades to place the party and the masses on a war footing. The latter phrase did not presage a long list of tasks. Mao's thrust was instead to encourage the enemy troops to defect and join the Red Army rank and file, “to intensify political training,” in Mao's translated words. The challenge in his informational strategy was to ensure that despite the relative material poverty of the Red Army, the Guomindang soldiers would find it morally rewarding to join the righteous cause of fighting for revolution against their former masters. The Red Army would thus gain mass through the conversion of the enemy's ranks:“Apart from the role played by the party, the reason the Red Army can sustain itself without collapse in spite of such a poor standard of material life and incessant engagements, is its practice of democracy. The officers do not beat the men; officers and men receive equal treatment; soldiers enjoy freedom of assembly and speech; cumbersome formalities and ceremonies are done away with; and the account books are open to the inspection of all ... They [the captured soldiers] feel that, though in material life they are worse off in the Red Army than in the White [Guomindang] army, spiritually they are liberated. The fact that the same soldier who was not brave in the enemy army yesterday becomes very brave in the Red Army today shows precisely the impact of democracy. The Red Army is like a furnace in which all captured soldiers are melted down and transformed the moment they come over.”\n\nUnder this rubric, PSYOPS is treated as both substitute and supplement for the strategies of mass and technological augmentation. In this way, Mao has inherited Sun Tzu's precept of executing one's military campaign with the Dao of harmonizing the people and their rulers. This likewise extends into propaganda tasks other than fighting. In Mao's words, proper war fighting should transcend “the purely military viewpoint” and the military “should also shoulder such important tasks as agitating the masses, organizing them, arming them, and helping them to set up revolutionary political power, and even establishing organizations of the Communist Party.” That Mao's undeclared targets are the winning of the populace's “hearts and minds,” and the subversion of the enemy's political command, is obvious in the disproportionate emphasis placed upon informational strategies in his writings. Even when dealing with specific military strategies, his emphasis remains steadfastly fixed upon correctly appraising the terrain and foreknowledge gleaned of the enemy forces. His clarion call is for the flexibility of means to be reconciled with some semblance of centralized command at every level. Mao was set “against fixed operational fronts and positional warfare, and for fluid operational fronts and mobile warfare; against the mere routing of the enemy, and for a war of annihilation;",

People have to be aroused to rebel against their oppressors. In Cold War vintage vocabulary, Mao envisioned that imperialists and their lackeys tend to gravitate toward the positional control of urban centers and main lines of communication. A successful people's war should therefore convert the countryside with its people and physical resources into a revolutionary force to engulf the exploitative capitalist centers from the countryside. How might this be extrapolated into IO? There is one telling commentary published in the People's Liberation Army Daily on June 25, 1996, which has since been extensively reproduced on the Internet as a sign of Chinese thinking:“A people's war in the context of information warfare is carried out by hundreds of millions of people using open-type modern information systems. Because the traditional mode of industrial production has changed from centralization to dispersion and commercial activities have expanded from urban areas to rural areas, the working method and mode of interaction in the original sense are increasingly information-based. Political mobilization for war must rely on information technology to become effective, for example by generating and distributing political mobilization software via the Internet, sending patriotic e-mail messages, and setting up databases for traditional education. This way, modern technical media can be fully utilized and the openness and diffusion effect of the Internet can be expanded, to help political mobilization exert its subtle influence.In short, the meaning and implications of a people's war have profoundly changed in the information age, and the chance of people taking the initiative and randomly participating in the war has increased. The ethnic signature and geographic mark on an information war are more pronounced and the application of strategies is more secretive and unpredictable.^{74}”\n\nOne might add that a People's War can in fact take on additional characteristics of anonymity and contagion in the Internet age.^{75} Moreover, the didactic spirit of this passage is a direct twist on the liberal democratic modernization spiel embedded in western IW as espoused for instance by the Tofflers. Finally, one might interpret grand strategic possibilities for an ongoing People's War involving large numbers of Chinese government co-opted college graduates equipped with computer skills tasked to conduct Web-based infiltration and deception across sovereign borders. This might be dubbed an IO sub-strategy of loose unison in the service of a collective national interest. The declared establishment of an American Cybercorps is equally likely to draw on such transnational possibilities of pursuing grand strategy across the World Wide Web, as well as to retaliate against People's War intrusions conducted by rival powers and non-state actors.",

His relevance to our discussion falls under the shadow of Mao. While Mao postulated strategy in the light of Chinese geopolitical and ideological circumstances, Giap adapted its execution in a much smaller theater of war against technologically superior enemies. One might also draw a straight line affirming the lineage between Sun Tzu and Giap. Cognizant of Sun Tzu's admonition to the ruler and commander to ensure concord between a people and their government, Giap identified the French imperialist stature after World War II in terms of its “weak point [lying] in the unjust character of his war. As a result, he was internally divided, not supported by the people of his own country, and did not enjoy the sympathy of world opinion.” Furthermore, “his army was strong at the beginning but its fighting spirit was deteriorating.”^{76}\n\nIn contrast, the Vietnamese revolutionary forces enjoyed the advantage of tapping into a ragtag untested guerrilla army that had tasted independence at the conclusion of the Japanese Occupation; they could also count on the sympathy of newly liberated peoples elsewhere. Based upon such assessments, Giap was willing to join his comrades in strategizing a protracted war to wear down French material strength by deploying the spiritual and symbolic strengths of the Vietnamese. Giap has admitted to spending time in Mao's camps in southern China in the early 1940s, observing and learning from his communist brethren how to fight successfully as the weaker party. From this experience, Giap helped the Party formulate the overlapping concepts of resistance war, anti-imperialist war, and war for national liberation. These slogans were meant to capture the loyalties of as broad a segment of Vietnamese society as possible for an armed and unified anti-French front. This broad coalition would also discursively alienate collaborators and compel Vietnamese with wavering loyalties to take sides in a “just war.”^{77}\n\nAlong with consolidating the political front, Giap noted that “guerrilla war must multiply. To keep itself in life and to develop, guerrilla warfare necessarily has to develop into mobile warfare. This is a general law.”^{78} Giap subsequently elaborated this guerrilla strategy into a three-stage scenario with: first, the “stage of contention,” second, the “stage of equilibrium;” and third, the “stage of counter-offensive.” In the stage of contention, one's forces were both numerically and materially weaker than the enemy's. Small-scale attacks on enemy outposts and the killing or capturing of a handful of enemy soldiers counted for important political effects. At every turn, guerrillas were expected to trade ground for safety through retreat into the jungles. With time and steadily growing confidence and supplies, hit-and-run attacks would give way to pitched battles with the enemy. Once the base areas had attained a level of security from large-scale harassment by enemy troops, the people's army could then transit from mere guerrilla attacks to concerted regimental and battalion scale campaigns against the enemy.^{79}",

Certainly, PSYOPS and other propaganda maneuvers to marshal political loyalties in support of one's cause were crucial to constituting the base for subsequent stages. As a communist, Giap interpreted Marx, Lenin, and Mao correctly in preparing armed struggle through political engineering. His guerrilla pronouncements suggested that the weaker party in a conflict should always bide its time, staging attacks commensurate with its deployable resources at any given point in time to demonstrate the lively presence of opposition. Incrementally, gains achieved through harassment would build momentum toward full-scale assault.^{80} This is especially relevant to the exploitability of Internet-based IO—the simple and random acts of hacking displace the enemy's security systems and its state of tranquility; consequently, when the enemy's information systems prove ever more vulnerable, more decisive DOS attacks, virus injections, and spam waves can be deployed to paralyze him. In this regard, both North Korea and Iran should merit serious study as paradigmatic cases of asymmetrical IO practitioners in the light of their ongoing postures of strategic defiance against a number of great military powers.\n\n## Conclusion: The Shape of an Asian Perspective to IW—Advocating the Characteristics of Continuity in IO\n\nYin and Taylor's initial work exploring an Asian approach to IO helpfully focuses attention on existing doctrines employed by China, Taiwan, Japan, and Thailand, but they are pessimistic about the relative backwardness of Asian capabilities.^{81} They assert that Asia will be “playing catch up to the West” for some time to come. Jacqueline Newmyer has even asserted that one should expect to witness a “Revolution in Military Affairs with Chinese Characteristics” as the People's Liberation Army attempts to westernize its IW capabilities.^{82} This article has argued otherwise through a thickly inferred reading of a sample of Asian strategists. While western strategizing for IW has opened up avenues for pondering the time and space complexities inherent in IO, this opening allows scholars and practitioners alike to mine non-Western, and specifically, Asian strategic thought to discover fresh insights into how asymmetrically powerful IO can be if one wishes to look beyond the glamour of high-technology dominance in conceptualizing information as a military weapon.\n\nFirst, as Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap suggest, there is a premium to be placed upon harmonizing trust between governments and peoples in executing any form of information strategy for defense. There is no specific need for any state to be a liberal democratic high-technology power in order to maximize the potential of information as a military resource. In fact, the Asian thinkers sampled here suggest that some degree of centralized absolutism should be practiced to conduct IW successfully. Asian strategists appear to privilege unity in transmitting political messages, as opposed to the emphasis on putting democratic soft power on an immutable pedestal for foreign consumption. More importantly, Asian thinkers embrace a form of soft power that is mostly internally directed to consolidate one's own domestic military",

This addresses the dual nature of cyber delinquency. Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap referred to this as flexibility in fighting with a weaker hand, asserting presence by converting a population, as well as dispatching spies as information seekers. In Sun Tzu's writings, we see the importance of secrecy of foreknowledge mixed with outward guile. For Mao and Giap, flexibility was meant to displace the enemy's comfort zone insofar as the enemy applied premeditated doctrines. The Asian thinkers treated here make little or no distinction between peacetime or wartime activity; politics and its goals dictate the agency, scale, and timing of IO. This has been misinterpreted by Newmyer as a historical phenomenon specific only to the era of China's ancient warring kingdoms.\n\nThird, the matter of PSYOPS links western thought to its Asian counterpart. Targeting the political minds responsible for determining the central strategic direction of the war, or any political confrontation, is as important as dealing with the technological threat posed by one's adversaries. In the case of Mao and Giap, whom many assume interpreted Sun Tzu for the modern Asian military audience, high technology should not obscure the relative importance of subverting the enemy's confidence. This is a soft target which can always be exploited by a technologically weaker adversary without even resorting to a physical clash of arms.\n\nUltimately then, people's war for the information age will be no less unpredictable than the Cold War version. IW appears to have borrowed too much from conventional understandings of war fighting. IO is the broader, more important discipline to read or to deflect an enemy without distinguishing between peacetime and wartime. As a sign that Asian IO theory is perhaps gaining traction, the Obama Administration has responded to the exposure of Chinese cyber provocations in February 2013 by avoiding official attribution to Beijing and deflecting calls for straightforward retaliation, instead it is seeking ways to warn the unnamed state-sponsored intruders of the risks of collateral economic and political damages to their interdependent relationship. Chris Johnson of the Central Intelligence Agency neatly summed up the policy predicament on this occasion: “The problem so far is that we have rhetoric, and we have Cyber Command, and not much in between.”\n\nThe author wishes to thank participants at the first Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College Seminar in 2010 in Singapore for the opportunity to present a preliminary version of this article.

This article ventures an Asian perspective that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. This article will pan out by first critically analyzing the predominantly American interpretation of IW as a set of five characteristics that can be contrasted to an Asian rival. Subsequently, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a generic Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately termed information operations (IO). These Asian IO features will be teased out through a reading of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. An Asian IO approach will not distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it place a premium on liberal democratic ideology as a basis for information superiority.\nWith the advent of cyberspace, information warfare (IW) boggles the military mind with its self-revelation as a weapon of mass disruption. Paralysis, rather than physical destruction, appears to be the outcome. Recent incidents between 2007 and 2013 illustrate the slippery interface between war and peace through the conflation of terrestrial order and disorder, cyberspatial chaos, and the lack of clarity of the source of the attack. In April 2007, the world's first full-scale cyberattack targeted the Republic of Estonia. The cause was publicly speculated by Estonian politicians and public opinion as an offline one: Russian residents in the former Soviet republic were vehemently taking to the streets and media to protest the government's removal of a Soviet era military memorial in the Estonian capital Tallinn. It did not help matters that since Estonia declared “independence” from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, relations between Russia and Estonia had been either stagnant or strained. The attacks occurred in the context of Estonia being the most wired nation-state in Europe, with an estimated 90 percent of all domestic financial transactions being carried out online, and some 70 percent of tax returns being filed through the Internet. The so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks disrupted most “peacetime” economic life in the country and virtually paralyzed the government in Tallinn. Estonian defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo admitted that the hardest part about responding was the inability to verify the source of the attacks:“Some of those countries [e.g. Russia, Moldova, Ukraine] have many more serious problems than cybersecurity and cybercrime legislation. Secondly, sometimes there are only claims that people are acting from those geographic locations. We can't prove that. Like there are safe havens for terrorism—I mean, Afghanistan is one example, Yemen is emerging. We don't know about Nigeria. There are very many more safe havens in cyberspace than in real space.”\nWhat is interesting here is the conventional disorientation within which a government official assesses his country's first cyberwar. The same conundrum about the source of an attack was manipulated by Israel, North Korea, China, Russia, and nonstate groups named Anonymous and LulzSec, between 2007 and 2011 to launch attacks against commercial companies, foreign governments, and political parties on the pretexts of either private or undeclared vendettas. In 2006, the Bush Administration began inserting malware into Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz in order to map its computer vulnerabilities; since 2009, the Obama Administration had followed up with full-scale attacks to slow down the Iranian nuclear effort. Experts dubbed the cyberweapon “Stuxnet.” The United States was fingered as the source of Stuxnet, developed with Israeli collaboration, only after a journalist interviewed unnamed officials willing to leak the story. In August 2012, the computers at Saudi oil company Aramco were struck by a virus that systematically erased data on three-quarters of their databanks, replacing the data with an image of a burning American flag. No oil was spilled, nor burned, in this “attack” but computer experts flown in\nby the Saudis, including those from Symantec, ventured that this virus—dubbed “Shamoon” after a word embedded in its code—was the work of Iranian agents. These experts concluded that the data erasing command within Shamoon, dubbed “Wiper,” clearly imitated another virus named “Flame” that had mysteriously attacked Iranian oil companies right up till May 2012.4 Was Flame therefore a variant and an accessory to Stuxnet, and therefore attributable to Washington's virtual war against Tehran? If the attacking virus was replicated, who was the more culpable electronic combatant: the initiator or the imitator-cum-retaliator? In February 2013, a private web security company, Mandiant, publicly blamed the Chinese army unit 61398, situated in Shanghai, for a spate of cyber vandalism and theft at Google, Microsoft, RSA, and The New York Times, among other American corporations. The Chinese foreign ministry ingenuously countered that their country were equally at the receiving end of cyber attacks from unnamed states.5 The same Chinese spokesperson conveniently omitted any mention of domestic Internet vigilantes, as well as alienated, unemployed, computer literate college graduates within the People's Republic. This article ventures that generating open-ended paralysis and manipulating this vagary behind the source of an attack could well be strategy in itself. This is the core of an Asian prescription for information operations (IO).\nFor starters, some terminological clarification is needed to indicate the maneuverable space within IO in contrast to IW. IW has been treated by its foremost American proponents as a paradigmatic displacement of conventional offline warfighting. But the reasons for such a claim are actually rather weak if one considers non-western approaches to informational components of warfare. For a working definition, this article shall define IW as the use of symbolic resources to penetrate the enemy's secrecy and confidence for the purpose of winning a war on one's own terms. The proximate concept of IO refers to that entire range of symbolic resources straddling both military and civilian spheres that are aimed at achieving national objectives in both peacetime and wartime. These include psychological operations (PSYOPS), military deception (MILDEC), electronic countermeasures warfare, and public diplomacy. IW remains IO's predecessor.\nThe aim of this article is to supply an Asian perspective on IO that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. The appeal of pondering an Asian perspective lies in opening up the military mind to insights from a different civilization with its attendant particularistic philosophies. Civilizations are desirable sources of ideas given the fact that they are accumulations of wisdom and praxis across time and space directed by conscious human endeavor. This human endeavor aspires to distinguish one section of humanity from the rest.6 Attitudes toward understanding IO in all its complexities can therefore be enhanced through interaction with a non-western body of pre-digital wisdom. The deployment of information for strategic uses is in all probability culturally filtered. The agent deploying information to convert or confuse others is exercising a power over the creation of meaning. This is a point reiterated prominently by social constructivists in political science, international relations, and in linguistics.7 It will consequently be argued that an\nAsian way of IO does not try to delineate the physical, the permissible, and democratic elements from the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. This is a call for dialogue with non-western strategy rather than an ideological confrontation. To some extent, the survey produced by James Yin and Philip Taylor of four Asian countries' existing equivalents of IW doctrines and capabilities breaks ground for the current enterprise.^{8} That said, Yin and Taylor have merely described the existing state of operational profiles of Asian IW and imputed an Asian perspective to them. This cannot be adequate since critics might argue that the existing state of Asian IW doctrines are merely adaptations of western models of PSYOPS from the Cold War and later. It is also quite revealing that in 1955, with Cold War insurgencies in East Asia rising to fever pitch, Edward Katzenbach and Gene Hanrahan commented that Mao Zedong's revolutionary appeal among Southeast Asian communists lies in its “monopoly of patience” and its corollary that the strategy of the superior military mind “has very little to do with technological superiority.”^{9} Given space constraints within an article-length reflection, I sample only three Asian strategic thinkers who are prominent in classic strategic studies readers such as Peter Paret's Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age^{10} and other specialist surveys of unconventional warfare:^{11} Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. Omitted are other Asian voices of varying historical and geographical pedigrees. Nonetheless, by examining Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, readers should be able to discern what a more careful consideration of Asian perspectives could yield. Table 1 illustrates the subtle contrasts between Western IW and Asian IO approaches which this article intends to show.\nTaking a foundational approach to sketching Asian IO, this article will begin by surveying the predominantly American interpretation of IW in terms of a number of IW characteristics that should be opened up to critical contrast to Asian ways. The American interpretation of IW will be analyzed in terms of five characteristics: liberal democratic modernization, cyber delinquency, bureaucratic confusion, cyber power, and soft power. Subsequently, via Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a more Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately redescribed as IO. To generalize, an Asian IO approach is ideologically agnostic and unlikely to distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it distinguish strategy from tactics; moreover, it will indulge in subterfuge.\n## Western Approaches to IW: Information Capability via Liberal Democratic Modernization, Cyber Delinquency, Bureaucratic Confusion, and Cyber Power and Soft Power\nFollowing Clausewitzian thought on military strategy, the utility of information in war may be understood to be heavily dependent upon intellectual powers that are up to the task of deploying information adroitly according to constant changes in capabilities and “out of the box” challenges.^{12} Edward Luttwak's treatment of\nChang\n603\nTable I. Contrasts between \"Western\" IW and \"Asian\" IO Approaches.\n|  Dimensions for comparison | Western approaches | Asian approaches  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Governing ideology as basis for information power | Liberal democratic modernization | Ideologically agnostic modernization  |\n|  Order and civil-military distinctions | Distinguishing delinquency in peacetime and offense in wartime; hesitation over questions of legality | Vagary and gray legal, political terrain as an advantage for mounting cyber attack; no peacetime; or wartime distinctions  |\n|  Bureaucracy and chain of command | Clarity of targeted system required to plan attack and/or defense | Targeted systems, as well as friendly systems, may be centralized and opaque so long as attack and defense can be mounted to maximum effect  |\n|  Power | Delineated levels of power application and escalation possible, and advisable | Power can be obscured and chameleonic  |\n|  Martial spirit | Deep penetration to uncover enemy plans, and to disrupt operations either before they commence or when they are underway; concern with legality; seeing the enemy more important than deception | Physical war as last resort; the acme of “fighting” is to defeat the enemy’s plans first, via calculated deception, and through unexpected angles; embrace asymmetry; anonymity; and contagion as advantages  |\nNote. IO = information operations; IW = information warfare.\nstrategy in terms of the conscious use of paradox in military execution illustrates this. Strategy, to Luttwak, is always an exercise in selecting information to maximize one's purpose, but this in turn requires factoring in the unexpected as undertaken by one's equally breathing and thinking adversary.¹³ As more scholars attempt to keep up with the \"information revolution\" associated with the penetration of computers into business networking and consumer lifestyles, it is to be expected that international relations and security in \"the digital age\" remains an underexplored area.¹⁴ Part of the problem lies in the lack of communication between disciplines and, worse, between different frequencies within the same subfield of a discipline. Such is the problem with treating information as part of strategy. Information is critical to all domains of knowledge inquiry.\n## Assumptions of Superiority in Advanced Liberal Democratic Modernization\nTaking these complexities to heart, an early groundbreaking work in the study of IW was grandiosely titled *In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information*\nAge. The editors and lead authors, John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, chose the metaphor of the Greek Goddess Athena over Mars, the God of War, for the reason that Athena stood for the superior use of information as knowledge to civilize people; moreover, she embodied the virtues of Athenian government, especially democracy. One can see how such a conception also perfectly mirrors the primary mission of American foreign policy. This liberal democratic influence, married to a technological vision of modernization, is carried further in Arquilla and Ronfeldt's choice of authors for their Foreword, Alvin and Heidi Toffler. The Tofflers are well known for their futurism studies, as well as their thesis about the three waves of technological civilization. The first wave concerned the agricultural revolution whereby certain peoples organized government and economy to systematically exploit natural food sources for sustaining human life. The second wave witnessed the application of electromechanical principles to provide inanimate sources of energy for human industry. The third wave enabled humanity to manipulate scientific principles to create whole new energy sources and even life forms. This made the \"Revolution in Military Affairs” (RMA) possible by the late twentieth century. To the Tofflers, the implications of the RMA would be on par with those generated by microbiological technology, genetics and cloning, and nuclear physics. Knowledge “has moved from a peripheral to a central position where ideas, innovation, values, imagination, symbols and imagery, not just computer data, play more and more important roles.”\nWhereas in the past, information in military strategy referred to morale, leadership, courage, and strategic insight, in today's terms, intangible information also includes “what is inside our databanks as well as the skulls of our soldiers. They include the power of software, the ability to blindside an opponent's information technology, the superiority of information collection and dissemination, the compatibility of information-enhancing tools, and much more.” This was framed by the Tofflers' reading that “America is the source of the most stunning knowledge-enhancing technologies, and most of its workforce is engaged in one or another form of knowledge work ... Nevertheless, the United States still has a residual sector of the economy based on low-skill muscle-work. And the US military reflects a similar duality.” The Tofflers acknowledge that while the United States currently possesses “some very big ‘media howitzers' that nobody else has” in the form of Hollywood and CNN:“ ... any idea that the US government or its military should attempt to rationalize or to impose broad controls on the US media in the interest of a coherent information warfare doctrine is anachronistic and counterproductive. The further a country advances toward Third Wave economic and social systems, the less likely central censorship or control will work. Third Wave economies thrive on open ideas and information systems, the irrepressible Internet being the most obvious example.”\nFreedom of information flow should theoretically lead to the unleashing of the ideological power of “open society” and “open government” as concepts. Woven\nthrough the writings of the Tofflers, David Gompert, and other narratives within Athena's Camp is a derogatory attitude toward authoritarian states such as China, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba, the erstwhile USSR, and even Singapore.\nAt the time of writing, the latest evangelizer of Internet freedom is Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister and founder of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders). On one hand, he claims clinically that technology is not necessarily predestined to support or yield liberty but in the case of the Internet, the precedents of its use have opened up the possibilities of a struggle:“Yet, all the same, the distortions [of Internet usage] are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most fantastic means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed peoples, who have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the Internet provides power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can be disseminated worldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult to hide a public demonstration, an act of repression or a violation of human rights.In authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion and civil society. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.”\nA battle is continually being waged to harness the Internet in the service of either authoritarian politics or its liberal protagonists, but one that liberals ought to win, in Kouchner's view. The first wave of the Arab Spring Revolutions of 2010--2012 have borne out Kouchner's predictions, but the ongoing bittersweet postscript in Egypt and Libya have dulled popular expectations that “Facebook revolutions” can be sustained in their political gains. These contradictory trends mean that IW will be inevitably politicized according to some of these “default, western” ideological assumptions. In fact, the link between liberal democracy and IW actually inhibits further exploration of IW as a comprehensive strategy since it limits debate and exploration to the uses liberal democracies make of it. The recent practices of undeclared IW by Russia and China, and some purport North Korea and Iran as well, undermine the liberal claims to the IW discourse. It is a mistake for IW thinkers to assume there is a preferential kinship between IW and any particular ideology.\n### IW's Roots in Cyber Delinquency\nCyber delinquency is a very recent label used to categorize criminal activities produced directly through the Internet. Yet, like the presumed linkage between liberalism and IW, this deserves unpacking. As a source of information, the Internet was designed for accessibility by its myriad contributors. Yet, in the twenty years since its public debut, it has been treated by many observers as an evolving “jungle” of abuse and source of harm to “innocent” democratically faithful users. Most\nnational legislation on computer crimes takes aim at persons who attempt unauthorized access to databases and other sites on the Internet. If “breaking and entering” without consent is criminal in the terrestrial world, it appears that cyberspace has taken on earthly characteristics, especially when observers and governments debate the prospect of governance of the Internet. Interestingly, the phrase “computer hacker,” or simply “hacker” has taken on the connotation of a night robber who forces his way into the inner sanctum of a home or office and steals its valuable contents. This is an unproblematic assumption from the perspective of law enforcement officials, but misses an important feature of the Internet era society according to a prominent scholar of the Internet, Manuel Castells.\nCastells argues that the so-called culture of freedom embedded in the Internet depends upon the interplay of roles between four virtual cultures arising from online interaction: “These cultural layers are hierarchically disposed: the techno-meritocratic culture becomes specified as a hacker culture by building rules and customs into networks of cooperation aimed at technological projects. The virtual communitarian culture adds a social dimension to technological sharing, by making the Internet a medium of selective social interaction and symbolic belonging. The entrepreneurial culture works on top of the hacker culture, and on the communitarian culture, to diffuse Internet practices in all domains of society by way of moneymaking. Without the techno-meritocratic culture, hackers would simply be a specific countercultural community of geeks and nerds.” Richard Power, one of the first observers of Internet security to author a book on digital crime, echoes his view. In his many visits to and interviews with cybersecurity analysts, Power observes that hacking begins with a deep-seated curiosity about computer systems. How capable is a computer, a software, or a particular database unless it is tested? Furthermore, as Power's research indicates, curiosity is bound up with professional desire to prove one's competence in discovering the vulnerabilities of connected computers, as well as in savoring an ego trip toward becoming the “master of online access.” These ambitions might also lead computer hackers to embrace a highly presumptuous, and even delusional, form of social heroism endeavoring to protect the ordinary user from rapacious corporations and governments. Power goes so far as to distinguish the hacker from the virus writer.\nThere is a great deal of intelligence and skill coupled to social and political potential in cyberspace crimes. Between 1997 and 2000, roughly coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the advent of the Internet, the top four criminal activities online were, in descending order of importance: virus attacks, insider abuse of web access, unauthorized access to databases by insiders, and denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. By 2009--2010, the US government reported that these categories appeared to have diminished in volume, and the new top four categories were “non-delivery of payment or merchandise,” Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)-related scams such as impersonating the Bureau online, “identity theft” and “computer crimes.” Since 1997, the US Department of Justice and the FBI have become more refined in their data capture. But it is also significant that between 2008 and 2009, there was a 22.3\npercent jump in Internet crimes complaints. The 2010 Internet Crime Report reiterated the pervasiveness of Internet crime. After 2010, both American agencies have discontinued annual Internet Crime Reports, preferring instead to issue periodic and crime-specific alerts. These criminal activities suggest that the Internet has evolved in tandem with real-world human nature to enable the extension of offline crimes into online activities. One could of course go on and cite the quality and intensity of cyberspace fraud that ranges from the disgruntled employee who attacks his own corporation, to the frequency of curiosity-driven sabotage of telecommunications companies, as well as the first widespread DDOS attacks against Yahoo, eBay, CNN, and Amazon.com in 2000. But this is, if Castells, Power, and other scholars are to be taken seriously, intrinsic to the human side of the web. Just as human enlightenment is to be expanded through the Internet and its applications, human beings can likewise use it to inflict pain and destruction. These predicaments are little different from those arising from the abuse of public spaces for hate crimes or supplying energy utilities at inflated rates to fleece consumers within a nation-state.\nHence, one cannot assume that cyber delinquency is simply just that—crime. Internet-based delinquency affords multiple new arenas for trials of strength among persons participating in and building an information society. Whenever authorities investigate “hacktivism,” the more enlightened among them often spot an opportunity to turn the perpetrator around toward new online uses that harmonize with pre-existing political interests. It is not surprising that, just as in espionage, governments rarely advertise the fact that online saboteurs can just as easily be turned to the service of covert national missions against real and imagined enemies. Alexander Klimburg has highlighted the roles of “Patriot Hackers” in the Chinese and Russian cyberwar “armies.” Most books on IW or cyberwar often use the commanding verb “imagine” to introduce the discussions of what hackers and virus creators could do if they penetrated international boundaries online. The world's first interstate cyberwar nearly broke out in tandem with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s military intervention in Kosovo in 1999. What eventually happened was a series of localized skirmishes between anti-Serb and pro-Serb Internet users employing propaganda e-mails and website postings. The US government hesitated before unleashing its cyber attack on Serbian banks, government and military systems to coincide with the physical aerial bombing campaign on the grounds of self-restraint. The US Department of Defense (US DoD) had concluded that IW against Serbia might invoke charges from third parties, as well as Serbians, that the Americans had willfully committed war crimes and other violations against United States and international law on cybercrimes. Additionally, it was reported that Serbian military computer systems were too dispersed, and had the Serbs attacked first, the chances of accurately verifying the sources of those attacks would be low. The unofficial revelations in June 2012 of President Obama's green light for preemptive cyber attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities suggest that the United States may have revised its doctrinal treatment of cyberwar as cyber delinquency. Of course,\nas it was widely reported in 1999, when NATO aircraft accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as part of their campaign, Chinese netizens behaved in an uninhibited fashion to send streams of spam into American mailboxes. By the time the next major Sino--American military incident occurred in April 2001, over the mid-air collision between a Chinese jet fighter and a US reconnaissance plane, Chinese hackers “unilaterally” defaced several US government sites. This coincided with the appearance of a number of smart viruses originating from Chinese users. Furthermore, the silence from Beijing regarding these actions hinted at the growing sophistication of its IW doctrine. Henceforth, any strategic doctrine should pay heed to the implications of the fungibility of cyber delinquency for defense purposes.\n### E-promise, Bureaucratic Confusion\nWhen the conceptual promise of “E-government” was derived with the advent of the Internet, the clarion call from information age gurus and journalists was to speed up, open up, and render government ever more transparent and responsive to its clients—the public at large. An Economist commentary in 2000 suggested that if web retailers and Internet service providers set the benchmark for virtual services, consumers would definitely not put up with “slum standards in the public sector.” The reason why governments have traditionally been slow to respond to public demands is due to the need to coordinate action across multiple agencies and to verify identities and other stored information about the citizenry. In tandem with this information-rich development, the public sector organization has been “problematized” as a rich target for IW.\nChristopher Paul, in scrutinizing the US government's predicament, observes that “the novelty of IO [Information Operations] was a combination of the recognition of the information age importance and vulnerability of adversary (and friendly) information and information systems, plus a desire for a coordinated, integrated approach to attacking and defending those data and systems.” This bureaucratic feature of IO implies that strengths and weaknesses are interchangeable. There is also the implication that organizations are only as strong as the weakest link in their chain of command. The idea of the bureaucracy as a system simply means that pulverizing a linchpin of it can trigger its wholesale collapse.\nIn the mostly American dominated literature on IW, there have been a number of books and articles that critically analyze the problems with defining mission foci among a number of overlapping governmental agencies tasked with prosecuting IW, and with identifying vulnerabilities in target organizations for IW. Walter Jajko's “Critical Commentary on the Department of Defense Authorities for Information Operations” published ten years ago in the journal Comparative Strategy called attention to the bureaucratic weaknesses in the American effort. While most of Jajko's piece deals with the specifics of US organizational tasking, some highlights are worth noting here to facilitate the discussion of the Asian supplement to IW theorizing. Jajko argued that the definitional vagary of IW, or IO, could potentially hamper governmental coordination but praised the US DoD for adopting an all-inclusive definition that could encompass\ncivilian activities as well as provide direction at the national level: “actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems, while defending one's own information and information systems.” Yet, he goes on to lament that while the US DoD provides some guidance on offensive and defensive IW doctrines, there is no presidential directive for doing so on a national level. This was somewhat addressed by a secret presidential directive signed by the Obama Administration in mid-2009 creating a White House office for a “Cyberczar” as well as a corresponding Pentagon-housed military command for cyberspace. Nevertheless, Jajko labels the reversibility of information/Internet dependence and accessibility a vulnerability for military planners.\nTraditional service cultures within the Army, Navy, and Air Force also tended to treat IO as “adjunct operations” supporting physical missions in their respective domains of land, sea, and air. Furthermore, IW doctrine is pursued only according to each service's intrinsic interpretations. Moreover, there is, attending to each service interpretation, the lack of clarity over whether to target strictly military enemies, or whether there should be any operational distinction between actual and potential enemies. US DoD guidelines up till 2002 were analyzed as being open-ended and vague in implying that peacetime, precrisis offensive IO could well prove useful to war planning and may be conducted “inside and outside of the traditional battlespace to shape it and prepare the way for future operations.” As of 2013, it remains unclear if any of these issues have been addressed institutionally by the three US armed services, but Jajko's commentary deserves its place as a form of “pre-theorizing” of IW as bureaucratic streamlining.\nBooks by Christopher Paul and Alexander, Kott et al. not only echo Jajko's analyses, but also go on to address the possibilities of targeting the adversary's precise organizational decision-making processes and chain of command. Yet, as the contributors to Kott et al. note “the challenge is that most of the time we cannot observe the elements of the structures in the organization. Instead, we can obtain the intelligence due to the actions and activities of the organization.” The thrust of the various contributors to Kott et al.'s volume is that traditional modes of intelligence operations, under familiar labels such as penetrating the enemy's operations security, planting moles, playing deception through PSYOPS, and the accumulation of open-source political intelligence are all essential to displacing the many weak links in the adversary's bureaucratic decision-making process. Paul appreciates that these penetration efforts represent strategy at work but warns that IO straddle the black, the white, and the gray, implying that PSYOPS involve deploying untruths and half-truths, and hence should be used sparingly. In these ways, American scholars point to a fundamental problem in any information-reliant and complex governing environment: how should IW become a multipronged and nimble information operation?\n### Cyber Power for IW\nThe promise of Internet-enabled long range computer attacks has spurred fevered imaginations to propose the integrated concept of national cyber power. Alex\nKlimburg has defined cyber power in three dimensions: policy coordination across government in the manner sketched in the preceding subsection; coherence of policy across a nation-state's participation in international organizations and legal regimes; and the cooperation of nonstate actors in a national mission.^{44} This is a laudable policy recommendation for making strategy, but it is also a rear view perspective analogous to speculating the size of air force arsenals, chemical, and biological weapons in the manner of foot soldiers, armored personnel carriers, and combat ships. There is scant attention toward the subtleties of force, and impact multiplication, arising from any physically miniscule form of power. The power of computer analysts armed with skills for hacking, and capabilities for code breaking and cipher alteration through mathematical speculation, cannot be quantified. Yet another set of complementary perspectives is fronted by the writings of Adam Liff, Dale Peterson, and Thomas Rid. Liff tried very hard in his 2012 article to stimulate analysis of cyberwar along the premise of Bernard Brodie's^{45} post-1945 speculation upon the impact of atomic weapons on war. Liff contends that cyberwarfare should be understood as the “cost-inducing use of computer network attacks” against an enemy's vital military and civilian infrastructures with coercive intentions.^{46} He claims it is a political bargaining process between two or more actors where costs are decisive in shaping outcomes. This is elaborated by his conjectures upon cyberweapons as the ideal asymmetrical ideal; the difficulty of attributing attacks for certain; cyberweapons as an offensive force multiplier; and the possibility of cyberdeterrence.^{47} Dale Peterson goes further into the mode of specifying cyberweapons in three tiers: simple, moderate level, and complex.^{48} Each of these types correspond to the degree of damage they are intended to inflict, ranging from disruption of normal service, to disablement of specific components of a targeted system, to a thorough transformation by stealth of a targeted industrial system to the extent that the latter is hijacked or programmed to be remotely controlled by the attacker. Peterson goes on to discuss the architecture of an industrial control system and how a cyberweapon can be reverse engineered in tandem with the intricacies of the original design of that system.^{49} Finally, Thomas Rid has proposed that cyber weapons can be “helpfully” employed for “sabotage” campaigns short of the violence associated with outright war.^{50} Such distinctions depend on the ability to draw fine lines between the Clausewitzian conception of war as absolute violence and targeted destruction suited to limited objectives. In pondering cyber power through the rational choice frames of conventional kinetic and nuclear weaponry, these authors are bound by an imperfect hindsight that neglects the possibilities of structural human and philosophical vagaries that may deeply characterize those parts of IW employing cyber means.\n### Soft Power as IW\nA fourth characteristic of the existing literature on IW stems from Joseph Nye's concept of soft power as the ability to get others to want what one wants through voluntary attraction.^{51} In Nye's original formulation, soft power was thought to\nbe important as the new currency of American great power status in a post-Cold War era characterized by economic interdependence and a communications revolution that has shrunk the globe in political terms. Starting with Nye and Owens' article published in 1996 in Foreign Affairs magazine, titled “America's Information Edge,” the idea that American public diplomacy ought to be integrated into a coherent grand strategy of information that connected the dots between Hollywood films, US universities, the US Constitution, US popular culture, civic culture, and America's corporate mastery of the electronic communications market, captured the imagination of governments and think tanks worldwide. Arquilla and Ronfeldt included it in their gamut of tools in preparing the nation for information age threats but elaborated no further as to how soft power could actually assist warfare.\nLeigh Armistead's book, Information Operations: Warfare and the Hard Reality of Soft Power, has at least attempted to persuade the military to embrace the new power currency as a means to deal with the spectrum of post-Cold War “new threats” ranging from rogue states (the then Baathist Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and Myanmar) to rogue nonstate actors, such as separatist groups, exiled groups, and Al Qaeda. To Armistead, the new threats could not be simply bombed out of existence, or neutralized through direct armed occupation; they could only be eliminated through a battle for hearts and minds. Unless carefully redefined, PSYOPS and MILDEC are too crude in the era of globalization since foreign public opinion can verify information credibility through access to Internet sources and satellite-based round-the-clock global news on both television and Internet. Armistead's approach is unhelpful since it takes a kitchen sink approach to strategy, implying information is all important but hardly detailing how it integrates into grand strategy.\nBut as Armistead points out, the invocation of soft power returns the discussion to whether peacetime and wartime distinctions in information strategy are operationally relevant. Presumably, militaries committed to IW or IO need to automatically fold domestic public opinion and private sector entities into a holistic effort. Soft power therefore merits inclusion as a point of reflection because of its civilian face, which is crucial for mitigating armed conflict. Some might also argue that the power of ideas embedded in the structures of knowledge and everyday practice could well constrict a rival's choices, leading toward the achievement of one's goals without ever firing a shot. Should one then consider dismissing IW in its strictest definition in favor of invoking the “magic” of soft power?\nUnfortunately, Nye has himself muddled the soft power component in IO when he recently argued that cyber power was the larger concept encompassing soft power. According to Nye, cyber power refers to the contextual power arising from resources deployable within cyberspace. He then goes on to argue that cyber power can be both hard (e.g. “denial of service attacks,” “government control over companies,” and “bombing of routers and cutting of cables”) and soft (e.g. “public diplomacy campaign,” “setting norms and standards,” and “protests to name and shame cyber providers”). Since cyberspace is an “imperfect [global] commons,” both hard and soft cyber power should be used as appropriate. While governments\nin cyberspace remain the most potent wielders of cyber power, the diffusion of cyber technologies ensure that nonstate actors can increasingly exploit asymmetrical contests to their advantage vis-à-vis governments. But this angle of approach reflects nothing more than Nye's inability to provide a definitive formulation of IO through the lens of soft power—after all, if the power of ideas is paramount in a networked world, why does the United States need to contemplate physical denial as an aspect of exercising cyber power? As many observers have pointed out in the wake of eroding American economic competitiveness in Africa and Latin America vis-à-vis China, and mounting criticism of drone-enabled assassinations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen, soft power through IO needs to deploy social sensitivity in the minds of the proverbial boots on the ground.\n## Asian Strategic Thought on IO\nIn contrast to the aforementioned strands of cyberwarfare thinking, certain Asian theorists and practitioners have not tried to delineate between the physical, the permissible and democratic, and the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. Asian strategic thought has long been viewed as both a complement to and a contrast against western theorizing. But it has been underappreciated in operationally remolding western-originated strategy. Before one proceeds any further in adducing an Asian supplement via a sampled reading of the works of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, the invocation of Asian thinkers must be justified. The thesis of a culturally filtered Asian military revolution must be treated seriously if one is to break out of the mold of treating the West as the only source of military strategy. Peter Lorge has made a compelling case that Asian military strategy cannot be regarded as historically inferior simply because Asia appeared to be laggard in embracing a military revolution characterized by gunpowder, guns, and war-making machines powered by inanimate energy sources. Asian guns were available earlier than the assumed military revolution in Europe; they were not widely deployed simply because the Asian theater and cultural mores of the time militated against their use. But, more importantly, there are some distinct and intriguing parallels between Asian political philosophies that emphasize undoing the enemy's strategies by sowing chaos and the pre-digital western strategic thought of individuals like Machiavelli and Clausewitz. Considering that IOs prior to the advent of the Internet have already been partially treated as a worthy subject, there is every reason to study past wisdom for their bearing on the current information age.\n### Sun Tzu\nAs a cumulative collection of didactic texts on military strategy dating back more than 2,500 years, Sun Tzu's Art of War (Sunzi Bingfa) has captured the imagination of strategic studies scholars beyond China and Japan, even though many scholars believe it to have been inspired by the Sung Dynasty's (tenth to thirteenth centuries)\ndesperate attempt to think their way out of their strategic enclosure by “barbarian powers.” An official translation of the Art of War published by Beijing-based Foreign Languages Press in 1999 describes this work as “representing the quintessence of Chinese military thinking, [and] it summarizes the rich experiences of ancient wars and analyses them from political, economic, social and cultural angles.” Interestingly, these translators also echo the standard culturalist interpretation of Sun Tzu's tract as treating “war as ill-boding and perilous, insisting that the purpose of studying war is to end war.”\nWar is treated as an inherently philosophical enterprise that reflects upon human virtue and cultivation of superior intellect. In Sun Tzu's opening chapter “Making Assessments,” he identifies five fundamental factors of war: moral influence, weather, distance and terrain, command, and doctrine. Of these, his reading of moral influence, cryptically referred to as Dao or “the Way” in Sun Tzu's original parlance, carries particular Daoist and Confucian connotations. Moral influence is “that which causes people to think in line with their sovereign so that they will follow him through every vicissitude, whether to live or to die, without fear of mortal peril.” Information in Sun Tzu's mental framework emerges as a paradigm of correctly investing the energies of the state and its people in harmonized attainment of the national objective through either peace or war. War might be a miscalculation if it ultimately ruins the state and its people, so it must be embarked upon only after in-depth consideration of all its factors, with “moral influence” being the leading one. The general ought also to be skilled in balancing the seemingly contradictory values of compassion for his soldiers with courage in battle. Boldness should not be confused with recklessness. Calculating information is also critical to treating war as a game of deception: “feign incapability when in fact capable; feign inactivity when ready to strike; appear to be far away when actually nearby, and vice versa. When the enemy is greedy for gains, hand out a bait to lure him; when he is in disorder, attack and overcome him ... if he is given to anger, provoke him.” In Chapter 3 “Attacking by Stratagem,” Sun Tzu counsels that “to fight a hundred battles and win each and every one of them is not the wisest thing to do. To break the enemy's resistance without fighting is.”\nInsofar as Sun Tzu speaks directly to IW in our time, his counsel is to read the opportunity costs of waging war correctly, and never end up with greater losses than those envisioned in the opening gambit. Essentially, IW is folded into what we term IO as an art of reading the proverbial “tea leaves” of achieving national goals using the right policy instruments adapted to circumstances.\nLiterally, one should follow the Way of the Dao. Although Sun Tzu does not explicitly address the distinction between peacetime and wartime, there is frequent intimation that the two periods exist on a seamless continuum of preparation for the eventuality of combat. To be victorious in the event of war, one's military must be deployed advantageously, akin to the momentum found in nature: torrential water moving boulders, falcons falling upon hapless prey, and so forth. Because mental preparations must draw on parallels to the forces of nature, and nature in turn\nprivileges harmony among its forces, Sun Tzu denigrates any form of chaos (luan), whether in strategic planning, logistics, failure to treat physical terrain as an ally, or in the absence of unwavering charismatic inspiration of one's troops. Conversely, Sun Tzu extolled the possibilities of sowing luan within one's enemy.\nAs such, Sun Tzu appears to embrace espionage as a lofty form of IO in his time. Here, it is worth quoting in full: “The enlightened sovereign and the capable commander conquer the enemy at every move and achieve successes far surpassing those of ordinary people because they possess ‘foreknowledge.' This ‘foreknowledge' cannot be obtained from ghosts or spirits, nor from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor from astrological calculations. It can only come from men who know the enemy situation.” This is from the Art of War's closing Chapter 13, titled “Using Spies.” Sun Tzu specifies in some detail five types of spy: the native agent, the internal agent, the converted agent, the expendable agent, and the surviving agent. The details need not concern us; all involve the need to penetrate the walls of the enemy's inner sanctums of government and put on a veneer of sincerely empathizing with the enemy, in order to listen in on their most subtle intentions. There is no right or wrong time for espionage—“so delicate and so secretive is espionage that there is nowhere you cannot put it to good use.” In employing spies, the overriding goal of gaining “foreknowledge” must always drive action. Fully deniable cyberspace intrusions are highly necessary if one takes this advice seriously. One, of course, might pose the question as to whether gaining “foreknowledge” does not undercut adherence to the cosmic harmony that the Way promotes in harmonizing interstate relations.\n### Mao Zedong\nMao is easily the second most important Asian military thinker found in war studies syllabi. His stature is partly derived from association with the contemporary postcolonial politics of East Asia. It also stems from the fact that Mao's ideological immersion in Marxism--Leninism was indigenized in the fledgling Chinese Communist Party, followed by constant harassment from “class enemies,” as well as the Japanese during the Pacific War. Mao's brand of armed rural revolutionary war was hatched in the vast and often inhospitable countryside, in mountains, valleys, and secluded areas. He had to appraise the Chinese strategic environment virtually from scratch as a political outsider to the then ruling Guomindang's dominance in the teeming urban population centers. The Chinese Civil War was scripted into a war between the “righteous” have-nots against the “nefarious” haves. In many ways, Mao's thinking on military affairs possessed a do-it-yourself quality, though he was also drawn to ideologies bound to be attractive to the underdog in a revolutionary struggle.\nAs John Shy and Thomas Collier have aptly noted in their survey of the subject of revolutionary war, Mao stands out as one of the rare thinkers postulating that “strategic theory has meaning only in terms of the concrete political, social, and international circumstances at the moment in which theory is being elucidated.” In Mao's\nvision of using flexible means toward achieving one's goals, theory and practice should be conjoined. In this regard, political warfare qua IW qua revolutionary warfare qua armed struggle should be components in a fluid spectrum of means used to attain revolutionary objectives. In his essay, “The Military Problem” written under very difficult physical circumstances, Mao exhorts his comrades to place the party and the masses on a war footing. The latter phrase did not presage a long list of tasks. Mao's thrust was instead to encourage the enemy troops to defect and join the Red Army rank and file, “to intensify political training,” in Mao's translated words. The challenge in his informational strategy was to ensure that despite the relative material poverty of the Red Army, the Guomindang soldiers would find it morally rewarding to join the righteous cause of fighting for revolution against their former masters. The Red Army would thus gain mass through the conversion of the enemy's ranks:“Apart from the role played by the party, the reason the Red Army can sustain itself without collapse in spite of such a poor standard of material life and incessant engagements, is its practice of democracy. The officers do not beat the men; officers and men receive equal treatment; soldiers enjoy freedom of assembly and speech; cumbersome formalities and ceremonies are done away with; and the account books are open to the inspection of all ... They [the captured soldiers] feel that, though in material life they are worse off in the Red Army than in the White [Guomindang] army, spiritually they are liberated. The fact that the same soldier who was not brave in the enemy army yesterday becomes very brave in the Red Army today shows precisely the impact of democracy. The Red Army is like a furnace in which all captured soldiers are melted down and transformed the moment they come over.”\nUnder this rubric, PSYOPS is treated as both substitute and supplement for the strategies of mass and technological augmentation. In this way, Mao has inherited Sun Tzu's precept of executing one's military campaign with the Dao of harmonizing the people and their rulers. This likewise extends into propaganda tasks other than fighting. In Mao's words, proper war fighting should transcend “the purely military viewpoint” and the military “should also shoulder such important tasks as agitating the masses, organizing them, arming them, and helping them to set up revolutionary political power, and even establishing organizations of the Communist Party.” That Mao's undeclared targets are the winning of the populace's “hearts and minds,” and the subversion of the enemy's political command, is obvious in the disproportionate emphasis placed upon informational strategies in his writings. Even when dealing with specific military strategies, his emphasis remains steadfastly fixed upon correctly appraising the terrain and foreknowledge gleaned of the enemy forces. His clarion call is for the flexibility of means to be reconciled with some semblance of centralized command at every level. Mao was set “against fixed operational fronts and positional warfare, and for fluid operational fronts and mobile warfare; against the mere routing of the enemy, and for a war of annihilation;\nagainst the principle of striking with both fists, and for the principle of striking with one fist ... ”^{72}\nMao's concept of People's War essentially converts the asymmetry of the militarily weaker protagonist into unconventional strengths used to defeat the militarily stronger.^{73} Taking account of the enemy tactically means learning where the disaffected majority of the population lives and earns its livelihood. People have to be aroused to rebel against their oppressors. In Cold War vintage vocabulary, Mao envisioned that imperialists and their lackeys tend to gravitate toward the positional control of urban centers and main lines of communication. A successful people's war should therefore convert the countryside with its people and physical resources into a revolutionary force to engulf the exploitative capitalist centers from the countryside. How might this be extrapolated into IO? There is one telling commentary published in the People's Liberation Army Daily on June 25, 1996, which has since been extensively reproduced on the Internet as a sign of Chinese thinking:“A people's war in the context of information warfare is carried out by hundreds of millions of people using open-type modern information systems. Because the traditional mode of industrial production has changed from centralization to dispersion and commercial activities have expanded from urban areas to rural areas, the working method and mode of interaction in the original sense are increasingly information-based. Political mobilization for war must rely on information technology to become effective, for example by generating and distributing political mobilization software via the Internet, sending patriotic e-mail messages, and setting up databases for traditional education. This way, modern technical media can be fully utilized and the openness and diffusion effect of the Internet can be expanded, to help political mobilization exert its subtle influence.In short, the meaning and implications of a people's war have profoundly changed in the information age, and the chance of people taking the initiative and randomly participating in the war has increased. The ethnic signature and geographic mark on an information war are more pronounced and the application of strategies is more secretive and unpredictable.^{74}”\nOne might add that a People's War can in fact take on additional characteristics of anonymity and contagion in the Internet age.^{75} Moreover, the didactic spirit of this passage is a direct twist on the liberal democratic modernization spiel embedded in western IW as espoused for instance by the Tofflers. Finally, one might interpret grand strategic possibilities for an ongoing People's War involving large numbers of Chinese government co-opted college graduates equipped with computer skills tasked to conduct Web-based infiltration and deception across sovereign borders. This might be dubbed an IO sub-strategy of loose unison in the service of a collective national interest. The declared establishment of an American Cybercorps is equally likely to draw on such transnational possibilities of pursuing grand strategy across the World Wide Web, as well as to retaliate against People's War intrusions conducted by rival powers and non-state actors.\nVo Nguyen Giap\nGeneral Giap is often considered the military brain behind the military successes against both French and American forces in the First and Second Indochina wars. His relevance to our discussion falls under the shadow of Mao. While Mao postulated strategy in the light of Chinese geopolitical and ideological circumstances, Giap adapted its execution in a much smaller theater of war against technologically superior enemies. One might also draw a straight line affirming the lineage between Sun Tzu and Giap. Cognizant of Sun Tzu's admonition to the ruler and commander to ensure concord between a people and their government, Giap identified the French imperialist stature after World War II in terms of its “weak point [lying] in the unjust character of his war. As a result, he was internally divided, not supported by the people of his own country, and did not enjoy the sympathy of world opinion.” Furthermore, “his army was strong at the beginning but its fighting spirit was deteriorating.”^{76}\nIn contrast, the Vietnamese revolutionary forces enjoyed the advantage of tapping into a ragtag untested guerrilla army that had tasted independence at the conclusion of the Japanese Occupation; they could also count on the sympathy of newly liberated peoples elsewhere. Based upon such assessments, Giap was willing to join his comrades in strategizing a protracted war to wear down French material strength by deploying the spiritual and symbolic strengths of the Vietnamese. Giap has admitted to spending time in Mao's camps in southern China in the early 1940s, observing and learning from his communist brethren how to fight successfully as the weaker party. From this experience, Giap helped the Party formulate the overlapping concepts of resistance war, anti-imperialist war, and war for national liberation. These slogans were meant to capture the loyalties of as broad a segment of Vietnamese society as possible for an armed and unified anti-French front. This broad coalition would also discursively alienate collaborators and compel Vietnamese with wavering loyalties to take sides in a “just war.”^{77}\nAlong with consolidating the political front, Giap noted that “guerrilla war must multiply. To keep itself in life and to develop, guerrilla warfare necessarily has to develop into mobile warfare. This is a general law.”^{78} Giap subsequently elaborated this guerrilla strategy into a three-stage scenario with: first, the “stage of contention,” second, the “stage of equilibrium;” and third, the “stage of counter-offensive.” In the stage of contention, one's forces were both numerically and materially weaker than the enemy's. Small-scale attacks on enemy outposts and the killing or capturing of a handful of enemy soldiers counted for important political effects. At every turn, guerrillas were expected to trade ground for safety through retreat into the jungles. With time and steadily growing confidence and supplies, hit-and-run attacks would give way to pitched battles with the enemy. Once the base areas had attained a level of security from large-scale harassment by enemy troops, the people's army could then transit from mere guerrilla attacks to concerted regimental and battalion scale campaigns against the enemy.^{79}\nWhat, then, is Giap's contribution to a non-Western reading of IO? Certainly, PSYOPS and other propaganda maneuvers to marshal political loyalties in support of one's cause were crucial to constituting the base for subsequent stages. As a communist, Giap interpreted Marx, Lenin, and Mao correctly in preparing armed struggle through political engineering. His guerrilla pronouncements suggested that the weaker party in a conflict should always bide its time, staging attacks commensurate with its deployable resources at any given point in time to demonstrate the lively presence of opposition. Incrementally, gains achieved through harassment would build momentum toward full-scale assault.^{80} This is especially relevant to the exploitability of Internet-based IO—the simple and random acts of hacking displace the enemy's security systems and its state of tranquility; consequently, when the enemy's information systems prove ever more vulnerable, more decisive DOS attacks, virus injections, and spam waves can be deployed to paralyze him. In this regard, both North Korea and Iran should merit serious study as paradigmatic cases of asymmetrical IO practitioners in the light of their ongoing postures of strategic defiance against a number of great military powers.\n## Conclusion: The Shape of an Asian Perspective to IW—Advocating the Characteristics of Continuity in IO\nYin and Taylor's initial work exploring an Asian approach to IO helpfully focuses attention on existing doctrines employed by China, Taiwan, Japan, and Thailand, but they are pessimistic about the relative backwardness of Asian capabilities.^{81} They assert that Asia will be “playing catch up to the West” for some time to come. Jacqueline Newmyer has even asserted that one should expect to witness a “Revolution in Military Affairs with Chinese Characteristics” as the People's Liberation Army attempts to westernize its IW capabilities.^{82} This article has argued otherwise through a thickly inferred reading of a sample of Asian strategists. While western strategizing for IW has opened up avenues for pondering the time and space complexities inherent in IO, this opening allows scholars and practitioners alike to mine non-Western, and specifically, Asian strategic thought to discover fresh insights into how asymmetrically powerful IO can be if one wishes to look beyond the glamour of high-technology dominance in conceptualizing information as a military weapon.\nFirst, as Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap suggest, there is a premium to be placed upon harmonizing trust between governments and peoples in executing any form of information strategy for defense. There is no specific need for any state to be a liberal democratic high-technology power in order to maximize the potential of information as a military resource. In fact, the Asian thinkers sampled here suggest that some degree of centralized absolutism should be practiced to conduct IW successfully. Asian strategists appear to privilege unity in transmitting political messages, as opposed to the emphasis on putting democratic soft power on an immutable pedestal for foreign consumption. More importantly, Asian thinkers embrace a form of soft power that is mostly internally directed to consolidate one's own domestic military\nfront as an ideological cudgel, enabling one to then summon almost infinite sacrifices in blood and treasure.\nSecond, Asian thinkers appreciate the offensive and defensive utilities of vagary. This addresses the dual nature of cyber delinquency. Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap referred to this as flexibility in fighting with a weaker hand, asserting presence by converting a population, as well as dispatching spies as information seekers. In Sun Tzu's writings, we see the importance of secrecy of foreknowledge mixed with outward guile. For Mao and Giap, flexibility was meant to displace the enemy's comfort zone insofar as the enemy applied premeditated doctrines. The Asian thinkers treated here make little or no distinction between peacetime or wartime activity; politics and its goals dictate the agency, scale, and timing of IO. This has been misinterpreted by Newmyer as a historical phenomenon specific only to the era of China's ancient warring kingdoms.\nThird, the matter of PSYOPS links western thought to its Asian counterpart. Targeting the political minds responsible for determining the central strategic direction of the war, or any political confrontation, is as important as dealing with the technological threat posed by one's adversaries. In the case of Mao and Giap, whom many assume interpreted Sun Tzu for the modern Asian military audience, high technology should not obscure the relative importance of subverting the enemy's confidence. This is a soft target which can always be exploited by a technologically weaker adversary without even resorting to a physical clash of arms.\nUltimately then, people's war for the information age will be no less unpredictable than the Cold War version. IW appears to have borrowed too much from conventional understandings of war fighting. IO is the broader, more important discipline to read or to deflect an enemy without distinguishing between peacetime and wartime. As a sign that Asian IO theory is perhaps gaining traction, the Obama Administration has responded to the exposure of Chinese cyber provocations in February 2013 by avoiding official attribution to Beijing and deflecting calls for straightforward retaliation, instead it is seeking ways to warn the unnamed state-sponsored intruders of the risks of collateral economic and political damages to their interdependent relationship. Chris Johnson of the Central Intelligence Agency neatly summed up the policy predicament on this occasion: “The problem so far is that we have rhetoric, and we have Cyber Command, and not much in between.”\nThe author wishes to thank participants at the first Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College Seminar in 2010 in Singapore for the opportunity to present a preliminary version of this article.

This article ventures an Asian perspective that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. This article will pan out by first critically analyzing the predominantly American interpretation of IW as a set of five characteristics that can be contrasted to an Asian rival. Subsequently, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a generic Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately termed information operations (IO). These Asian IO features will be teased out through a reading of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. An Asian IO approach will not distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it place a premium on liberal democratic ideology as a basis for information superiority.\nWith the advent of cyberspace, information warfare (IW) boggles the military mind with its self-revelation as a weapon of mass disruption. Paralysis, rather than physical destruction, appears to be the outcome. Recent incidents between 2007 and 2013 illustrate the slippery interface between war and peace through the conflation of terrestrial order and disorder, cyberspatial chaos, and the lack of clarity of the source of the attack. In April 2007, the world's first full-scale cyberattack targeted the Republic of Estonia. The cause was publicly speculated by Estonian politicians and public opinion as an offline one: Russian residents in the former Soviet republic were vehemently taking to the streets and media to protest the government's removal of a Soviet era military memorial in the Estonian capital Tallinn. It did not help matters that since Estonia declared “independence” from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, relations between Russia and Estonia had been either stagnant or strained. The attacks occurred in the context of Estonia being the most wired nation-state in Europe, with an estimated 90 percent of all domestic financial transactions being carried out online, and some 70 percent of tax returns being filed through the Internet. The so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks disrupted most “peacetime” economic life in the country and virtually paralyzed the government in Tallinn. Estonian defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo admitted that the hardest part about responding was the inability to verify the source of the attacks:“Some of those countries [e.g. Russia, Moldova, Ukraine] have many more serious problems than cybersecurity and cybercrime legislation. Secondly, sometimes there are only claims that people are acting from those geographic locations. We can't prove that. Like there are safe havens for terrorism—I mean, Afghanistan is one example, Yemen is emerging. We don't know about Nigeria. There are very many more safe havens in cyberspace than in real space.”\nWhat is interesting here is the conventional disorientation within which a government official assesses his country's first cyberwar. The same conundrum about the source of an attack was manipulated by Israel, North Korea, China, Russia, and nonstate groups named Anonymous and LulzSec, between 2007 and 2011 to launch attacks against commercial companies, foreign governments, and political parties on the pretexts of either private or undeclared vendettas. In 2006, the Bush Administration began inserting malware into Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz in order to map its computer vulnerabilities; since 2009, the Obama Administration had followed up with full-scale attacks to slow down the Iranian nuclear effort. Experts dubbed the cyberweapon “Stuxnet.” The United States was fingered as the source of Stuxnet, developed with Israeli collaboration, only after a journalist interviewed unnamed officials willing to leak the story. In August 2012, the computers at Saudi oil company Aramco were struck by a virus that systematically erased data on three-quarters of their databanks, replacing the data with an image of a burning American flag. No oil was spilled, nor burned, in this “attack” but computer experts flown in by the Saudis, including those from Symantec, ventured that this virus—dubbed “Shamoon” after a word embedded in its code—was the work of Iranian agents. These experts concluded that the data erasing command within Shamoon, dubbed “Wiper,” clearly imitated another virus named “Flame” that had mysteriously attacked Iranian oil companies right up till May 2012.4 Was Flame therefore a variant and an accessory to Stuxnet, and therefore attributable to Washington's virtual war against Tehran? If the attacking virus was replicated, who was the more culpable electronic combatant: the initiator or the imitator-cum-retaliator? In February 2013, a private web security company, Mandiant, publicly blamed the Chinese army unit 61398, situated in Shanghai, for a spate of cyber vandalism and theft at Google, Microsoft, RSA, and The New York Times, among other American corporations. The Chinese foreign ministry ingenuously countered that their country were equally at the receiving end of cyber attacks from unnamed states.5 The same Chinese spokesperson conveniently omitted any mention of domestic Internet vigilantes, as well as alienated, unemployed, computer literate college graduates within the People's Republic. This article ventures that generating open-ended paralysis and manipulating this vagary behind the source of an attack could well be strategy in itself. This is the core of an Asian prescription for information operations (IO).\nFor starters, some terminological clarification is needed to indicate the maneuverable space within IO in contrast to IW. IW has been treated by its foremost American proponents as a paradigmatic displacement of conventional offline warfighting. But the reasons for such a claim are actually rather weak if one considers non-western approaches to informational components of warfare. For a working definition, this article shall define IW as the use of symbolic resources to penetrate the enemy's secrecy and confidence for the purpose of winning a war on one's own terms. The proximate concept of IO refers to that entire range of symbolic resources straddling both military and civilian spheres that are aimed at achieving national objectives in both peacetime and wartime. These include psychological operations (PSYOPS), military deception (MILDEC), electronic countermeasures warfare, and public diplomacy. IW remains IO's predecessor.\nThe aim of this article is to supply an Asian perspective on IO that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. The appeal of pondering an Asian perspective lies in opening up the military mind to insights from a different civilization with its attendant particularistic philosophies. Civilizations are desirable sources of ideas given the fact that they are accumulations of wisdom and praxis across time and space directed by conscious human endeavor. This human endeavor aspires to distinguish one section of humanity from the rest.6 Attitudes toward understanding IO in all its complexities can therefore be enhanced through interaction with a non-western body of pre-digital wisdom. The deployment of information for strategic uses is in all probability culturally filtered. The agent deploying information to convert or confuse others is exercising a power over the creation of meaning. This is a point reiterated prominently by social constructivists in political science, international relations, and in linguistics.7 It will consequently be argued that an Asian way of IO does not try to delineate the physical, the permissible, and democratic elements from the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. This is a call for dialogue with non-western strategy rather than an ideological confrontation. To some extent, the survey produced by James Yin and Philip Taylor of four Asian countries' existing equivalents of IW doctrines and capabilities breaks ground for the current enterprise. That said, Yin and Taylor have merely described the existing state of operational profiles of Asian IW and imputed an Asian perspective to them. This cannot be adequate since critics might argue that the existing state of Asian IW doctrines are merely adaptations of western models of PSYOPS from the Cold War and later. It is also quite revealing that in 1955, with Cold War insurgencies in East Asia rising to fever pitch, Edward Katzenbach and Gene Hanrahan commented that Mao Zedong's revolutionary appeal among Southeast Asian communists lies in its “monopoly of patience” and its corollary that the strategy of the superior military mind “has very little to do with technological superiority.” Given space constraints within an article-length reflection, I sample only three Asian strategic thinkers who are prominent in classic strategic studies readers such as Peter Paret's Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age and other specialist surveys of unconventional warfare: Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. Omitted are other Asian voices of varying historical and geographical pedigrees. Nonetheless, by examining Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, readers should be able to discern what a more careful consideration of Asian perspectives could yield. Table 1 illustrates the subtle contrasts between Western IW and Asian IO approaches which this article intends to show.\nTaking a foundational approach to sketching Asian IO, this article will begin by surveying the predominantly American interpretation of IW in terms of a number of IW characteristics that should be opened up to critical contrast to Asian ways. The American interpretation of IW will be analyzed in terms of five characteristics: liberal democratic modernization, cyber delinquency, bureaucratic confusion, cyber power, and soft power. Subsequently, via Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a more Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately redescribed as IO. To generalize, an Asian IO approach is ideologically agnostic and unlikely to distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it distinguish strategy from tactics; moreover, it will indulge in subterfuge.\n## Western Approaches to IW: Information Capability via Liberal Democratic Modernization, Cyber Delinquency, Bureaucratic Confusion, and Cyber Power and Soft Power Following Clausewitzian thought on military strategy, the utility of information in war may be understood to be heavily dependent upon intellectual powers that are up to the task of deploying information adroitly according to constant changes in capabilities and “out of the box” challenges. Edward Luttwak's treatment of Chang\n\n|  Dimensions for comparison | Western approaches | Asian approaches  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Governing ideology as basis for information power | Liberal democratic modernization | Ideologically agnostic modernization  |\n|  Order and civil-military distinctions | Distinguishing delinquency in peacetime and offense in wartime; hesitation over questions of legality | Vagary and gray legal, political terrain as an advantage for mounting cyber attack; no peacetime; or wartime distinctions  |\n|  Bureaucracy and chain of command | Clarity of targeted system required to plan attack and/or defense | Targeted systems, as well as friendly systems, may be centralized and opaque so long as attack and defense can be mounted to maximum effect  |\n|  Power | Delineated levels of power application and escalation possible, and advisable | Power can be obscured and chameleonic  |\n|  Martial spirit | Deep penetration to uncover enemy plans, and to disrupt operations either before they commence or when they are underway; concern with legality; seeing the enemy more important than deception | Physical war as last resort; the acme of “fighting” is to defeat the enemy’s plans first, via calculated deception, and through unexpected angles; embrace asymmetry; anonymity; and contagion as advantages  |\nNote. IO = information operations; IW = information warfare.\nstrategy in terms of the conscious use of paradox in military execution illustrates this. Strategy, to Luttwak, is always an exercise in selecting information to maximize one's purpose, but this in turn requires factoring in the unexpected as undertaken by one's equally breathing and thinking adversary.¹³ As more scholars attempt to keep up with the \"information revolution\" associated with the penetration of computers into business networking and consumer lifestyles, it is to be expected that international relations and security in \"the digital age\" remains an underexplored area.¹⁴ Part of the problem lies in the lack of communication between disciplines and, worse, between different frequencies within the same subfield of a discipline. Such is the problem with treating information as part of strategy. Information is critical to all domains of knowledge inquiry.\n## Assumptions of Superiority in Advanced Liberal Democratic Modernization\nTaking these complexities to heart, an early groundbreaking work in the study of IW was grandiosely titled *In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information*\nAge. The editors and lead authors, John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, chose the metaphor of the Greek Goddess Athena over Mars, the God of War, for the reason that Athena stood for the superior use of information as knowledge to civilize people; moreover, she embodied the virtues of Athenian government, especially democracy. One can see how such a conception also perfectly mirrors the primary mission of American foreign policy. This liberal democratic influence, married to a technological vision of modernization, is carried further in Arquilla and Ronfeldt's choice of authors for their Foreword, Alvin and Heidi Toffler. The Tofflers are well known for their futurism studies, as well as their thesis about the three waves of technological civilization. The first wave concerned the agricultural revolution whereby certain peoples organized government and economy to systematically exploit natural food sources for sustaining human life. The second wave witnessed the application of electromechanical principles to provide inanimate sources of energy for human industry. The third wave enabled humanity to manipulate scientific principles to create whole new energy sources and even life forms. This made the \"Revolution in Military Affairs” (RMA) possible by the late twentieth century. To the Tofflers, the implications of the RMA would be on par with those generated by microbiological technology, genetics and cloning, and nuclear physics. Knowledge “has moved from a peripheral to a central position where ideas, innovation, values, imagination, symbols and imagery, not just computer data, play more and more important roles.”\nWhereas in the past, information in military strategy referred to morale, leadership, courage, and strategic insight, in today's terms, intangible information also includes “what is inside our databanks as well as the skulls of our soldiers. They include the power of software, the ability to blindside an opponent's information technology, the superiority of information collection and dissemination, the compatibility of information-enhancing tools, and much more.” This was framed by the Tofflers' reading that “America is the source of the most stunning knowledge-enhancing technologies, and most of its workforce is engaged in one or another form of knowledge work ... Nevertheless, the United States still has a residual sector of the economy based on low-skill muscle-work. And the US military reflects a similar duality.” The Tofflers acknowledge that while the United States currently possesses “some very big ‘media howitzers' that nobody else has” in the form of Hollywood and CNN:“ ... any idea that the US government or its military should attempt to rationalize or to impose broad controls on the US media in the interest of a coherent information warfare doctrine is anachronistic and counterproductive. The further a country advances toward Third Wave economic and social systems, the less likely central censorship or control will work. Third Wave economies thrive on open ideas and information systems, the irrepressible Internet being the most obvious example.”\nFreedom of information flow should theoretically lead to the unleashing of the ideological power of “open society” and “open government” as concepts. Woven\nthrough the writings of the Tofflers, David Gompert, and other narratives within Athena's Camp is a derogatory attitude toward authoritarian states such as China, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba, the erstwhile USSR, and even Singapore.\nAt the time of writing, the latest evangelizer of Internet freedom is Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister and founder of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders). On one hand, he claims clinically that technology is not necessarily predestined to support or yield liberty but in the case of the Internet, the precedents of its use have opened up the possibilities of a struggle:“Yet, all the same, the distortions [of Internet usage] are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most fantastic means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed peoples, who have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the Internet provides power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can be disseminated worldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult to hide a public demonstration, an act of repression or a violation of human rights.In authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion and civil society. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.”\nA battle is continually being waged to harness the Internet in the service of either authoritarian politics or its liberal protagonists, but one that liberals ought to win, in Kouchner's view. The first wave of the Arab Spring Revolutions of 2010--2012 have borne out Kouchner's predictions, but the ongoing bittersweet postscript in Egypt and Libya have dulled popular expectations that “Facebook revolutions” can be sustained in their political gains. These contradictory trends mean that IW will be inevitably politicized according to some of these “default, western” ideological assumptions. In fact, the link between liberal democracy and IW actually inhibits further exploration of IW as a comprehensive strategy since it limits debate and exploration to the uses liberal democracies make of it. The recent practices of undeclared IW by Russia and China, and some purport North Korea and Iran as well, undermine the liberal claims to the IW discourse. It is a mistake for IW thinkers to assume there is a preferential kinship between IW and any particular ideology.\n### IW's Roots in Cyber Delinquency\nCyber delinquency is a very recent label used to categorize criminal activities produced directly through the Internet. Yet, like the presumed linkage between liberalism and IW, this deserves unpacking. As a source of information, the Internet was designed for accessibility by its myriad contributors. Yet, in the twenty years since its public debut, it has been treated by many observers as an evolving “jungle” of abuse and source of harm to “innocent” democratically faithful users. Most\nnational legislation on computer crimes takes aim at persons who attempt unauthorized access to databases and other sites on the Internet. If “breaking and entering” without consent is criminal in the terrestrial world, it appears that cyberspace has taken on earthly characteristics, especially when observers and governments debate the prospect of governance of the Internet. Interestingly, the phrase “computer hacker,” or simply “hacker” has taken on the connotation of a night robber who forces his way into the inner sanctum of a home or office and steals its valuable contents. This is an unproblematic assumption from the perspective of law enforcement officials, but misses an important feature of the Internet era society according to a prominent scholar of the Internet, Manuel Castells.\nCastells argues that the so-called culture of freedom embedded in the Internet depends upon the interplay of roles between four virtual cultures arising from online interaction: “These cultural layers are hierarchically disposed: the techno-meritocratic culture becomes specified as a hacker culture by building rules and customs into networks of cooperation aimed at technological projects. The virtual communitarian culture adds a social dimension to technological sharing, by making the Internet a medium of selective social interaction and symbolic belonging. The entrepreneurial culture works on top of the hacker culture, and on the communitarian culture, to diffuse Internet practices in all domains of society by way of moneymaking. Without the techno-meritocratic culture, hackers would simply be a specific countercultural community of geeks and nerds.” Richard Power, one of the first observers of Internet security to author a book on digital crime, echoes his view. In his many visits to and interviews with cybersecurity analysts, Power observes that hacking begins with a deep-seated curiosity about computer systems. How capable is a computer, a software, or a particular database unless it is tested? Furthermore, as Power's research indicates, curiosity is bound up with professional desire to prove one's competence in discovering the vulnerabilities of connected computers, as well as in savoring an ego trip toward becoming the “master of online access.” These ambitions might also lead computer hackers to embrace a highly presumptuous, and even delusional, form of social heroism endeavoring to protect the ordinary user from rapacious corporations and governments. Power goes so far as to distinguish the hacker from the virus writer.\nThere is a great deal of intelligence and skill coupled to social and political potential in cyberspace crimes. Between 1997 and 2000, roughly coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the advent of the Internet, the top four criminal activities online were, in descending order of importance: virus attacks, insider abuse of web access, unauthorized access to databases by insiders, and denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. By 2009--2010, the US government reported that these categories appeared to have diminished in volume, and the new top four categories were “non-delivery of payment or merchandise,” Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)-related scams such as impersonating the Bureau online, “identity theft” and “computer crimes.” Since 1997, the US Department of Justice and the FBI have become more refined in their data capture. But it is also significant that between 2008 and 2009, there was a 22.3\npercent jump in Internet crimes complaints. The 2010 Internet Crime Report reiterated the pervasiveness of Internet crime. After 2010, both American agencies have discontinued annual Internet Crime Reports, preferring instead to issue periodic and crime-specific alerts. These criminal activities suggest that the Internet has evolved in tandem with real-world human nature to enable the extension of offline crimes into online activities. One could of course go on and cite the quality and intensity of cyberspace fraud that ranges from the disgruntled employee who attacks his own corporation, to the frequency of curiosity-driven sabotage of telecommunications companies, as well as the first widespread DDOS attacks against Yahoo, eBay, CNN, and Amazon.com in 2000. But this is, if Castells, Power, and other scholars are to be taken seriously, intrinsic to the human side of the web. Just as human enlightenment is to be expanded through the Internet and its applications, human beings can likewise use it to inflict pain and destruction. These predicaments are little different from those arising from the abuse of public spaces for hate crimes or supplying energy utilities at inflated rates to fleece consumers within a nation-state.\nHence, one cannot assume that cyber delinquency is simply just that—crime. Internet-based delinquency affords multiple new arenas for trials of strength among persons participating in and building an information society. Whenever authorities investigate “hacktivism,” the more enlightened among them often spot an opportunity to turn the perpetrator around toward new online uses that harmonize with pre-existing political interests. It is not surprising that, just as in espionage, governments rarely advertise the fact that online saboteurs can just as easily be turned to the service of covert national missions against real and imagined enemies. Alexander Klimburg has highlighted the roles of “Patriot Hackers” in the Chinese and Russian cyberwar “armies.” Most books on IW or cyberwar often use the commanding verb “imagine” to introduce the discussions of what hackers and virus creators could do if they penetrated international boundaries online. The world's first interstate cyberwar nearly broke out in tandem with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s military intervention in Kosovo in 1999. What eventually happened was a series of localized skirmishes between anti-Serb and pro-Serb Internet users employing propaganda e-mails and website postings. The US government hesitated before unleashing its cyber attack on Serbian banks, government and military systems to coincide with the physical aerial bombing campaign on the grounds of self-restraint. The US Department of Defense (US DoD) had concluded that IW against Serbia might invoke charges from third parties, as well as Serbians, that the Americans had willfully committed war crimes and other violations against United States and international law on cybercrimes. Additionally, it was reported that Serbian military computer systems were too dispersed, and had the Serbs attacked first, the chances of accurately verifying the sources of those attacks would be low. The unofficial revelations in June 2012 of President Obama's green light for preemptive cyber attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities suggest that the United States may have revised its doctrinal treatment of cyberwar as cyber delinquency. Of course,\nas it was widely reported in 1999, when NATO aircraft accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as part of their campaign, Chinese netizens behaved in an uninhibited fashion to send streams of spam into American mailboxes. By the time the next major Sino--American military incident occurred in April 2001, over the mid-air collision between a Chinese jet fighter and a US reconnaissance plane, Chinese hackers “unilaterally” defaced several US government sites. This coincided with the appearance of a number of smart viruses originating from Chinese users. Furthermore, the silence from Beijing regarding these actions hinted at the growing sophistication of its IW doctrine. Henceforth, any strategic doctrine should pay heed to the implications of the fungibility of cyber delinquency for defense purposes.\n### E-promise, Bureaucratic Confusion\nWhen the conceptual promise of “E-government” was derived with the advent of the Internet, the clarion call from information age gurus and journalists was to speed up, open up, and render government ever more transparent and responsive to its clients—the public at large. An Economist commentary in 2000 suggested that if web retailers and Internet service providers set the benchmark for virtual services, consumers would definitely not put up with “slum standards in the public sector.” The reason why governments have traditionally been slow to respond to public demands is due to the need to coordinate action across multiple agencies and to verify identities and other stored information about the citizenry. In tandem with this information-rich development, the public sector organization has been “problematized” as a rich target for IW.\nChristopher Paul, in scrutinizing the US government's predicament, observes that “the novelty of IO [Information Operations] was a combination of the recognition of the information age importance and vulnerability of adversary (and friendly) information and information systems, plus a desire for a coordinated, integrated approach to attacking and defending those data and systems.” This bureaucratic feature of IO implies that strengths and weaknesses are interchangeable. There is also the implication that organizations are only as strong as the weakest link in their chain of command. The idea of the bureaucracy as a system simply means that pulverizing a linchpin of it can trigger its wholesale collapse.\nIn the mostly American dominated literature on IW, there have been a number of books and articles that critically analyze the problems with defining mission foci among a number of overlapping governmental agencies tasked with prosecuting IW, and with identifying vulnerabilities in target organizations for IW. Walter Jajko's “Critical Commentary on the Department of Defense Authorities for Information Operations” published ten years ago in the journal Comparative Strategy called attention to the bureaucratic weaknesses in the American effort. While most of Jajko's piece deals with the specifics of US organizational tasking, some highlights are worth noting here to facilitate the discussion of the Asian supplement to IW theorizing. Jajko argued that the definitional vagary of IW, or IO, could potentially hamper governmental coordination but praised the US DoD for adopting an all-inclusive definition that could encompass\ncivilian activities as well as provide direction at the national level: “actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems, while defending one's own information and information systems.” Yet, he goes on to lament that while the US DoD provides some guidance on offensive and defensive IW doctrines, there is no presidential directive for doing so on a national level. This was somewhat addressed by a secret presidential directive signed by the Obama Administration in mid-2009 creating a White House office for a “Cyberczar” as well as a corresponding Pentagon-housed military command for cyberspace. Nevertheless, Jajko labels the reversibility of information/Internet dependence and accessibility a vulnerability for military planners.\nTraditional service cultures within the Army, Navy, and Air Force also tended to treat IO as “adjunct operations” supporting physical missions in their respective domains of land, sea, and air. Furthermore, IW doctrine is pursued only according to each service's intrinsic interpretations. Moreover, there is, attending to each service interpretation, the lack of clarity over whether to target strictly military enemies, or whether there should be any operational distinction between actual and potential enemies. US DoD guidelines up till 2002 were analyzed as being open-ended and vague in implying that peacetime, precrisis offensive IO could well prove useful to war planning and may be conducted “inside and outside of the traditional battlespace to shape it and prepare the way for future operations.” As of 2013, it remains unclear if any of these issues have been addressed institutionally by the three US armed services, but Jajko's commentary deserves its place as a form of “pre-theorizing” of IW as bureaucratic streamlining.\nBooks by Christopher Paul and Alexander, Kott et al. not only echo Jajko's analyses, but also go on to address the possibilities of targeting the adversary's precise organizational decision-making processes and chain of command. Yet, as the contributors to Kott et al. note “the challenge is that most of the time we cannot observe the elements of the structures in the organization. Instead, we can obtain the intelligence due to the actions and activities of the organization.” The thrust of the various contributors to Kott et al.'s volume is that traditional modes of intelligence operations, under familiar labels such as penetrating the enemy's operations security, planting moles, playing deception through PSYOPS, and the accumulation of open-source political intelligence are all essential to displacing the many weak links in the adversary's bureaucratic decision-making process. Paul appreciates that these penetration efforts represent strategy at work but warns that IO straddle the black, the white, and the gray, implying that PSYOPS involve deploying untruths and half-truths, and hence should be used sparingly. In these ways, American scholars point to a fundamental problem in any information-reliant and complex governing environment: how should IW become a multipronged and nimble information operation?\n### Cyber Power for IW\nThe promise of Internet-enabled long range computer attacks has spurred fevered imaginations to propose the integrated concept of national cyber power. Alex\nKlimburg has defined cyber power in three dimensions: policy coordination across government in the manner sketched in the preceding subsection; coherence of policy across a nation-state's participation in international organizations and legal regimes; and the cooperation of nonstate actors in a national mission.^{44} This is a laudable policy recommendation for making strategy, but it is also a rear view perspective analogous to speculating the size of air force arsenals, chemical, and biological weapons in the manner of foot soldiers, armored personnel carriers, and combat ships. There is scant attention toward the subtleties of force, and impact multiplication, arising from any physically miniscule form of power. The power of computer analysts armed with skills for hacking, and capabilities for code breaking and cipher alteration through mathematical speculation, cannot be quantified. Yet another set of complementary perspectives is fronted by the writings of Adam Liff, Dale Peterson, and Thomas Rid. Liff tried very hard in his 2012 article to stimulate analysis of cyberwar along the premise of Bernard Brodie's^{45} post-1945 speculation upon the impact of atomic weapons on war. Liff contends that cyberwarfare should be understood as the “cost-inducing use of computer network attacks” against an enemy's vital military and civilian infrastructures with coercive intentions.^{46} He claims it is a political bargaining process between two or more actors where costs are decisive in shaping outcomes. This is elaborated by his conjectures upon cyberweapons as the ideal asymmetrical ideal; the difficulty of attributing attacks for certain; cyberweapons as an offensive force multiplier; and the possibility of cyberdeterrence.^{47} Dale Peterson goes further into the mode of specifying cyberweapons in three tiers: simple, moderate level, and complex.^{48} Each of these types correspond to the degree of damage they are intended to inflict, ranging from disruption of normal service, to disablement of specific components of a targeted system, to a thorough transformation by stealth of a targeted industrial system to the extent that the latter is hijacked or programmed to be remotely controlled by the attacker. Peterson goes on to discuss the architecture of an industrial control system and how a cyberweapon can be reverse engineered in tandem with the intricacies of the original design of that system.^{49} Finally, Thomas Rid has proposed that cyber weapons can be “helpfully” employed for “sabotage” campaigns short of the violence associated with outright war.^{50} Such distinctions depend on the ability to draw fine lines between the Clausewitzian conception of war as absolute violence and targeted destruction suited to limited objectives. In pondering cyber power through the rational choice frames of conventional kinetic and nuclear weaponry, these authors are bound by an imperfect hindsight that neglects the possibilities of structural human and philosophical vagaries that may deeply characterize those parts of IW employing cyber means.\n### Soft Power as IW\nA fourth characteristic of the existing literature on IW stems from Joseph Nye's concept of soft power as the ability to get others to want what one wants through voluntary attraction.^{51} In Nye's original formulation, soft power was thought to\nbe important as the new currency of American great power status in a post-Cold War era characterized by economic interdependence and a communications revolution that has shrunk the globe in political terms. Starting with Nye and Owens' article published in 1996 in Foreign Affairs magazine, titled “America's Information Edge,” the idea that American public diplomacy ought to be integrated into a coherent grand strategy of information that connected the dots between Hollywood films, US universities, the US Constitution, US popular culture, civic culture, and America's corporate mastery of the electronic communications market, captured the imagination of governments and think tanks worldwide. Arquilla and Ronfeldt included it in their gamut of tools in preparing the nation for information age threats but elaborated no further as to how soft power could actually assist warfare.\nLeigh Armistead's book, Information Operations: Warfare and the Hard Reality of Soft Power, has at least attempted to persuade the military to embrace the new power currency as a means to deal with the spectrum of post-Cold War “new threats” ranging from rogue states (the then Baathist Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and Myanmar) to rogue nonstate actors, such as separatist groups, exiled groups, and Al Qaeda. To Armistead, the new threats could not be simply bombed out of existence, or neutralized through direct armed occupation; they could only be eliminated through a battle for hearts and minds. Unless carefully redefined, PSYOPS and MILDEC are too crude in the era of globalization since foreign public opinion can verify information credibility through access to Internet sources and satellite-based round-the-clock global news on both television and Internet. Armistead's approach is unhelpful since it takes a kitchen sink approach to strategy, implying information is all important but hardly detailing how it integrates into grand strategy.\nBut as Armistead points out, the invocation of soft power returns the discussion to whether peacetime and wartime distinctions in information strategy are operationally relevant. Presumably, militaries committed to IW or IO need to automatically fold domestic public opinion and private sector entities into a holistic effort. Soft power therefore merits inclusion as a point of reflection because of its civilian face, which is crucial for mitigating armed conflict. Some might also argue that the power of ideas embedded in the structures of knowledge and everyday practice could well constrict a rival's choices, leading toward the achievement of one's goals without ever firing a shot. Should one then consider dismissing IW in its strictest definition in favor of invoking the “magic” of soft power?\nUnfortunately, Nye has himself muddled the soft power component in IO when he recently argued that cyber power was the larger concept encompassing soft power. According to Nye, cyber power refers to the contextual power arising from resources deployable within cyberspace. He then goes on to argue that cyber power can be both hard (e.g. “denial of service attacks,” “government control over companies,” and “bombing of routers and cutting of cables”) and soft (e.g. “public diplomacy campaign,” “setting norms and standards,” and “protests to name and shame cyber providers”). Since cyberspace is an “imperfect [global] commons,” both hard and soft cyber power should be used as appropriate. While governments\nin cyberspace remain the most potent wielders of cyber power, the diffusion of cyber technologies ensure that nonstate actors can increasingly exploit asymmetrical contests to their advantage vis-à-vis governments. But this angle of approach reflects nothing more than Nye's inability to provide a definitive formulation of IO through the lens of soft power—after all, if the power of ideas is paramount in a networked world, why does the United States need to contemplate physical denial as an aspect of exercising cyber power? As many observers have pointed out in the wake of eroding American economic competitiveness in Africa and Latin America vis-à-vis China, and mounting criticism of drone-enabled assassinations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen, soft power through IO needs to deploy social sensitivity in the minds of the proverbial boots on the ground.\n## Asian Strategic Thought on IO\nIn contrast to the aforementioned strands of cyberwarfare thinking, certain Asian theorists and practitioners have not tried to delineate between the physical, the permissible and democratic, and the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. Asian strategic thought has long been viewed as both a complement to and a contrast against western theorizing. But it has been underappreciated in operationally remolding western-originated strategy. Before one proceeds any further in adducing an Asian supplement via a sampled reading of the works of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, the invocation of Asian thinkers must be justified. The thesis of a culturally filtered Asian military revolution must be treated seriously if one is to break out of the mold of treating the West as the only source of military strategy. Peter Lorge has made a compelling case that Asian military strategy cannot be regarded as historically inferior simply because Asia appeared to be laggard in embracing a military revolution characterized by gunpowder, guns, and war-making machines powered by inanimate energy sources. Asian guns were available earlier than the assumed military revolution in Europe; they were not widely deployed simply because the Asian theater and cultural mores of the time militated against their use. But, more importantly, there are some distinct and intriguing parallels between Asian political philosophies that emphasize undoing the enemy's strategies by sowing chaos and the pre-digital western strategic thought of individuals like Machiavelli and Clausewitz. Considering that IOs prior to the advent of the Internet have already been partially treated as a worthy subject, there is every reason to study past wisdom for their bearing on the current information age.\n### Sun Tzu\nAs a cumulative collection of didactic texts on military strategy dating back more than 2,500 years, Sun Tzu's Art of War (Sunzi Bingfa) has captured the imagination of strategic studies scholars beyond China and Japan, even though many scholars believe it to have been inspired by the Sung Dynasty's (tenth to thirteenth centuries)\ndesperate attempt to think their way out of their strategic enclosure by “barbarian powers.” An official translation of the Art of War published by Beijing-based Foreign Languages Press in 1999 describes this work as “representing the quintessence of Chinese military thinking, [and] it summarizes the rich experiences of ancient wars and analyses them from political, economic, social and cultural angles.” Interestingly, these translators also echo the standard culturalist interpretation of Sun Tzu's tract as treating “war as ill-boding and perilous, insisting that the purpose of studying war is to end war.”\nWar is treated as an inherently philosophical enterprise that reflects upon human virtue and cultivation of superior intellect. In Sun Tzu's opening chapter “Making Assessments,” he identifies five fundamental factors of war: moral influence, weather, distance and terrain, command, and doctrine. Of these, his reading of moral influence, cryptically referred to as Dao or “the Way” in Sun Tzu's original parlance, carries particular Daoist and Confucian connotations. Moral influence is “that which causes people to think in line with their sovereign so that they will follow him through every vicissitude, whether to live or to die, without fear of mortal peril.” Information in Sun Tzu's mental framework emerges as a paradigm of correctly investing the energies of the state and its people in harmonized attainment of the national objective through either peace or war. War might be a miscalculation if it ultimately ruins the state and its people, so it must be embarked upon only after in-depth consideration of all its factors, with “moral influence” being the leading one. The general ought also to be skilled in balancing the seemingly contradictory values of compassion for his soldiers with courage in battle. Boldness should not be confused with recklessness. Calculating information is also critical to treating war as a game of deception: “feign incapability when in fact capable; feign inactivity when ready to strike; appear to be far away when actually nearby, and vice versa. When the enemy is greedy for gains, hand out a bait to lure him; when he is in disorder, attack and overcome him ... if he is given to anger, provoke him.” In Chapter 3 “Attacking by Stratagem,” Sun Tzu counsels that “to fight a hundred battles and win each and every one of them is not the wisest thing to do. To break the enemy's resistance without fighting is.”\nInsofar as Sun Tzu speaks directly to IW in our time, his counsel is to read the opportunity costs of waging war correctly, and never end up with greater losses than those envisioned in the opening gambit. Essentially, IW is folded into what we term IO as an art of reading the proverbial “tea leaves” of achieving national goals using the right policy instruments adapted to circumstances.\nLiterally, one should follow the Way of the Dao. Although Sun Tzu does not explicitly address the distinction between peacetime and wartime, there is frequent intimation that the two periods exist on a seamless continuum of preparation for the eventuality of combat. To be victorious in the event of war, one's military must be deployed advantageously, akin to the momentum found in nature: torrential water moving boulders, falcons falling upon hapless prey, and so forth. Because mental preparations must draw on parallels to the forces of nature, and nature in turn\nprivileges harmony among its forces, Sun Tzu denigrates any form of chaos (luan), whether in strategic planning, logistics, failure to treat physical terrain as an ally, or in the absence of unwavering charismatic inspiration of one's troops. Conversely, Sun Tzu extolled the possibilities of sowing luan within one's enemy.\nAs such, Sun Tzu appears to embrace espionage as a lofty form of IO in his time. Here, it is worth quoting in full: “The enlightened sovereign and the capable commander conquer the enemy at every move and achieve successes far surpassing those of ordinary people because they possess ‘foreknowledge.' This ‘foreknowledge' cannot be obtained from ghosts or spirits, nor from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor from astrological calculations. It can only come from men who know the enemy situation.” This is from the Art of War's closing Chapter 13, titled “Using Spies.” Sun Tzu specifies in some detail five types of spy: the native agent, the internal agent, the converted agent, the expendable agent, and the surviving agent. The details need not concern us; all involve the need to penetrate the walls of the enemy's inner sanctums of government and put on a veneer of sincerely empathizing with the enemy, in order to listen in on their most subtle intentions. There is no right or wrong time for espionage—“so delicate and so secretive is espionage that there is nowhere you cannot put it to good use.” In employing spies, the overriding goal of gaining “foreknowledge” must always drive action. Fully deniable cyberspace intrusions are highly necessary if one takes this advice seriously. One, of course, might pose the question as to whether gaining “foreknowledge” does not undercut adherence to the cosmic harmony that the Way promotes in harmonizing interstate relations.\n### Mao Zedong\nMao is easily the second most important Asian military thinker found in war studies syllabi. His stature is partly derived from association with the contemporary postcolonial politics of East Asia. It also stems from the fact that Mao's ideological immersion in Marxism--Leninism was indigenized in the fledgling Chinese Communist Party, followed by constant harassment from “class enemies,” as well as the Japanese during the Pacific War. Mao's brand of armed rural revolutionary war was hatched in the vast and often inhospitable countryside, in mountains, valleys, and secluded areas. He had to appraise the Chinese strategic environment virtually from scratch as a political outsider to the then ruling Guomindang's dominance in the teeming urban population centers. The Chinese Civil War was scripted into a war between the “righteous” have-nots against the “nefarious” haves. In many ways, Mao's thinking on military affairs possessed a do-it-yourself quality, though he was also drawn to ideologies bound to be attractive to the underdog in a revolutionary struggle.\nAs John Shy and Thomas Collier have aptly noted in their survey of the subject of revolutionary war, Mao stands out as one of the rare thinkers postulating that “strategic theory has meaning only in terms of the concrete political, social, and international circumstances at the moment in which theory is being elucidated.” In Mao's\nvision of using flexible means toward achieving one's goals, theory and practice should be conjoined. In this regard, political warfare qua IW qua revolutionary warfare qua armed struggle should be components in a fluid spectrum of means used to attain revolutionary objectives. In his essay, “The Military Problem” written under very difficult physical circumstances, Mao exhorts his comrades to place the party and the masses on a war footing. The latter phrase did not presage a long list of tasks. Mao's thrust was instead to encourage the enemy troops to defect and join the Red Army rank and file, “to intensify political training,” in Mao's translated words. The challenge in his informational strategy was to ensure that despite the relative material poverty of the Red Army, the Guomindang soldiers would find it morally rewarding to join the righteous cause of fighting for revolution against their former masters. The Red Army would thus gain mass through the conversion of the enemy's ranks:“Apart from the role played by the party, the reason the Red Army can sustain itself without collapse in spite of such a poor standard of material life and incessant engagements, is its practice of democracy. The officers do not beat the men; officers and men receive equal treatment; soldiers enjoy freedom of assembly and speech; cumbersome formalities and ceremonies are done away with; and the account books are open to the inspection of all ... They [the captured soldiers] feel that, though in material life they are worse off in the Red Army than in the White [Guomindang] army, spiritually they are liberated. The fact that the same soldier who was not brave in the enemy army yesterday becomes very brave in the Red Army today shows precisely the impact of democracy. The Red Army is like a furnace in which all captured soldiers are melted down and transformed the moment they come over.”\nUnder this rubric, PSYOPS is treated as both substitute and supplement for the strategies of mass and technological augmentation. In this way, Mao has inherited Sun Tzu's precept of executing one's military campaign with the Dao of harmonizing the people and their rulers. This likewise extends into propaganda tasks other than fighting. In Mao's words, proper war fighting should transcend “the purely military viewpoint” and the military “should also shoulder such important tasks as agitating the masses, organizing them, arming them, and helping them to set up revolutionary political power, and even establishing organizations of the Communist Party.” That Mao's undeclared targets are the winning of the populace's “hearts and minds,” and the subversion of the enemy's political command, is obvious in the disproportionate emphasis placed upon informational strategies in his writings. Even when dealing with specific military strategies, his emphasis remains steadfastly fixed upon correctly appraising the terrain and foreknowledge gleaned of the enemy forces. His clarion call is for the flexibility of means to be reconciled with some semblance of centralized command at every level. Mao was set “against fixed operational fronts and positional warfare, and for fluid operational fronts and mobile warfare; against the mere routing of the enemy, and for a war of annihilation;\nagainst the principle of striking with both fists, and for the principle of striking with one fist ... ”^{72}\nMao's concept of People's War essentially converts the asymmetry of the militarily weaker protagonist into unconventional strengths used to defeat the militarily stronger.^{73} Taking account of the enemy tactically means learning where the disaffected majority of the population lives and earns its livelihood. People have to be aroused to rebel against their oppressors. In Cold War vintage vocabulary, Mao envisioned that imperialists and their lackeys tend to gravitate toward the positional control of urban centers and main lines of communication. A successful people's war should therefore convert the countryside with its people and physical resources into a revolutionary force to engulf the exploitative capitalist centers from the countryside. How might this be extrapolated into IO? There is one telling commentary published in the People's Liberation Army Daily on June 25, 1996, which has since been extensively reproduced on the Internet as a sign of Chinese thinking:“A people's war in the context of information warfare is carried out by hundreds of millions of people using open-type modern information systems. Because the traditional mode of industrial production has changed from centralization to dispersion and commercial activities have expanded from urban areas to rural areas, the working method and mode of interaction in the original sense are increasingly information-based. Political mobilization for war must rely on information technology to become effective, for example by generating and distributing political mobilization software via the Internet, sending patriotic e-mail messages, and setting up databases for traditional education. This way, modern technical media can be fully utilized and the openness and diffusion effect of the Internet can be expanded, to help political mobilization exert its subtle influence.In short, the meaning and implications of a people's war have profoundly changed in the information age, and the chance of people taking the initiative and randomly participating in the war has increased. The ethnic signature and geographic mark on an information war are more pronounced and the application of strategies is more secretive and unpredictable.^{74}”\nOne might add that a People's War can in fact take on additional characteristics of anonymity and contagion in the Internet age.^{75} Moreover, the didactic spirit of this passage is a direct twist on the liberal democratic modernization spiel embedded in western IW as espoused for instance by the Tofflers. Finally, one might interpret grand strategic possibilities for an ongoing People's War involving large numbers of Chinese government co-opted college graduates equipped with computer skills tasked to conduct Web-based infiltration and deception across sovereign borders. This might be dubbed an IO sub-strategy of loose unison in the service of a collective national interest. The declared establishment of an American Cybercorps is equally likely to draw on such transnational possibilities of pursuing grand strategy across the World Wide Web, as well as to retaliate against People's War intrusions conducted by rival powers and non-state actors.\nVo Nguyen Giap\nGeneral Giap is often considered the military brain behind the military successes against both French and American forces in the First and Second Indochina wars. His relevance to our discussion falls under the shadow of Mao. While Mao postulated strategy in the light of Chinese geopolitical and ideological circumstances, Giap adapted its execution in a much smaller theater of war against technologically superior enemies. One might also draw a straight line affirming the lineage between Sun Tzu and Giap. Cognizant of Sun Tzu's admonition to the ruler and commander to ensure concord between a people and their government, Giap identified the French imperialist stature after World War II in terms of its “weak point [lying] in the unjust character of his war. As a result, he was internally divided, not supported by the people of his own country, and did not enjoy the sympathy of world opinion.” Furthermore, “his army was strong at the beginning but its fighting spirit was deteriorating.”^{76}\nIn contrast, the Vietnamese revolutionary forces enjoyed the advantage of tapping into a ragtag untested guerrilla army that had tasted independence at the conclusion of the Japanese Occupation; they could also count on the sympathy of newly liberated peoples elsewhere. Based upon such assessments, Giap was willing to join his comrades in strategizing a protracted war to wear down French material strength by deploying the spiritual and symbolic strengths of the Vietnamese. Giap has admitted to spending time in Mao's camps in southern China in the early 1940s, observing and learning from his communist brethren how to fight successfully as the weaker party. From this experience, Giap helped the Party formulate the overlapping concepts of resistance war, anti-imperialist war, and war for national liberation. These slogans were meant to capture the loyalties of as broad a segment of Vietnamese society as possible for an armed and unified anti-French front. This broad coalition would also discursively alienate collaborators and compel Vietnamese with wavering loyalties to take sides in a “just war.”^{77}\nAlong with consolidating the political front, Giap noted that “guerrilla war must multiply. To keep itself in life and to develop, guerrilla warfare necessarily has to develop into mobile warfare. This is a general law.”^{78} Giap subsequently elaborated this guerrilla strategy into a three-stage scenario with: first, the “stage of contention,” second, the “stage of equilibrium;” and third, the “stage of counter-offensive.” In the stage of contention, one's forces were both numerically and materially weaker than the enemy's. Small-scale attacks on enemy outposts and the killing or capturing of a handful of enemy soldiers counted for important political effects. At every turn, guerrillas were expected to trade ground for safety through retreat into the jungles. With time and steadily growing confidence and supplies, hit-and-run attacks would give way to pitched battles with the enemy. Once the base areas had attained a level of security from large-scale harassment by enemy troops, the people's army could then transit from mere guerrilla attacks to concerted regimental and battalion scale campaigns against the enemy.^{79}\nWhat, then, is Giap's contribution to a non-Western reading of IO? Certainly, PSYOPS and other propaganda maneuvers to marshal political loyalties in support of one's cause were crucial to constituting the base for subsequent stages. As a communist, Giap interpreted Marx, Lenin, and Mao correctly in preparing armed struggle through political engineering. His guerrilla pronouncements suggested that the weaker party in a conflict should always bide its time, staging attacks commensurate with its deployable resources at any given point in time to demonstrate the lively presence of opposition. Incrementally, gains achieved through harassment would build momentum toward full-scale assault.^{80} This is especially relevant to the exploitability of Internet-based IO—the simple and random acts of hacking displace the enemy's security systems and its state of tranquility; consequently, when the enemy's information systems prove ever more vulnerable, more decisive DOS attacks, virus injections, and spam waves can be deployed to paralyze him. In this regard, both North Korea and Iran should merit serious study as paradigmatic cases of asymmetrical IO practitioners in the light of their ongoing postures of strategic defiance against a number of great military powers.\n## Conclusion: The Shape of an Asian Perspective to IW—Advocating the Characteristics of Continuity in IO\nYin and Taylor's initial work exploring an Asian approach to IO helpfully focuses attention on existing doctrines employed by China, Taiwan, Japan, and Thailand, but they are pessimistic about the relative backwardness of Asian capabilities.^{81} They assert that Asia will be “playing catch up to the West” for some time to come. Jacqueline Newmyer has even asserted that one should expect to witness a “Revolution in Military Affairs with Chinese Characteristics” as the People's Liberation Army attempts to westernize its IW capabilities.^{82} This article has argued otherwise through a thickly inferred reading of a sample of Asian strategists. While western strategizing for IW has opened up avenues for pondering the time and space complexities inherent in IO, this opening allows scholars and practitioners alike to mine non-Western, and specifically, Asian strategic thought to discover fresh insights into how asymmetrically powerful IO can be if one wishes to look beyond the glamour of high-technology dominance in conceptualizing information as a military weapon.\nFirst, as Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap suggest, there is a premium to be placed upon harmonizing trust between governments and peoples in executing any form of information strategy for defense. There is no specific need for any state to be a liberal democratic high-technology power in order to maximize the potential of information as a military resource. In fact, the Asian thinkers sampled here suggest that some degree of centralized absolutism should be practiced to conduct IW successfully. Asian strategists appear to privilege unity in transmitting political messages, as opposed to the emphasis on putting democratic soft power on an immutable pedestal for foreign consumption. More importantly, Asian thinkers embrace a form of soft power that is mostly internally directed to consolidate one's own domestic military\nfront as an ideological cudgel, enabling one to then summon almost infinite sacrifices in blood and treasure.\nSecond, Asian thinkers appreciate the offensive and defensive utilities of vagary. This addresses the dual nature of cyber delinquency. Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap referred to this as flexibility in fighting with a weaker hand, asserting presence by converting a population, as well as dispatching spies as information seekers. In Sun Tzu's writings, we see the importance of secrecy of foreknowledge mixed with outward guile. For Mao and Giap, flexibility was meant to displace the enemy's comfort zone insofar as the enemy applied premeditated doctrines. The Asian thinkers treated here make little or no distinction between peacetime or wartime activity; politics and its goals dictate the agency, scale, and timing of IO. This has been misinterpreted by Newmyer as a historical phenomenon specific only to the era of China's ancient warring kingdoms.\nThird, the matter of PSYOPS links western thought to its Asian counterpart. Targeting the political minds responsible for determining the central strategic direction of the war, or any political confrontation, is as important as dealing with the technological threat posed by one's adversaries. In the case of Mao and Giap, whom many assume interpreted Sun Tzu for the modern Asian military audience, high technology should not obscure the relative importance of subverting the enemy's confidence. This is a soft target which can always be exploited by a technologically weaker adversary without even resorting to a physical clash of arms.\nUltimately then, people's war for the information age will be no less unpredictable than the Cold War version. IW appears to have borrowed too much from conventional understandings of war fighting. IO is the broader, more important discipline to read or to deflect an enemy without distinguishing between peacetime and wartime. As a sign that Asian IO theory is perhaps gaining traction, the Obama Administration has responded to the exposure of Chinese cyber provocations in February 2013 by avoiding official attribution to Beijing and deflecting calls for straightforward retaliation, instead it is seeking ways to warn the unnamed state-sponsored intruders of the risks of collateral economic and political damages to their interdependent relationship. Chris Johnson of the Central Intelligence Agency neatly summed up the policy predicament on this occasion: “The problem so far is that we have rhetoric, and we have Cyber Command, and not much in between.”\nThe author wishes to thank participants at the first Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College Seminar in 2010 in Singapore for the opportunity to present a preliminary version of this article.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Block S4, Level B4, Nanyang Avenue, Singapore. 639798 Email: iscschong@ntu.edu.sg ## Abstract While information warfare (IW) has been treated by its foremost western proponents as a strategic revolution, the reasons for such a claim are actually rather weak if one considers how non-western approaches to the informational components of warfare have put forth their positions within a multidimensional context of strategy. This article ventures an Asian perspective that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. This article will pan out by first critically analyzing the predominantly American interpretation of IW as a set of five characteristics that can be contrasted to an Asian rival. Subsequently, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a generic Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately termed information operations (IO). These Asian IO features will be teased out through a reading of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. An Asian IO approach will not distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it place a premium on liberal democratic ideology as a basis for information superiority.\nWith the advent of cyberspace, information warfare (IW) boggles the military mind with its self-revelation as a weapon of mass disruption. Paralysis, rather than physical destruction, appears to be the outcome. Recent incidents between 2007 and 2013 illustrate the slippery interface between war and peace through the conflation of terrestrial order and disorder, cyberspatial chaos, and the lack of clarity of the source of the attack. In April 2007, the world's first full-scale cyberattack targeted the Republic of Estonia. The cause was publicly speculated by Estonian politicians and public opinion as an offline one: Russian residents in the former Soviet republic were vehemently taking to the streets and media to protest the government's removal of a Soviet era military memorial in the Estonian capital Tallinn. It did not help matters that since Estonia declared “independence” from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, relations between Russia and Estonia had been either stagnant or strained. The attacks occurred in the context of Estonia being the most wired nation-state in Europe, with an estimated 90 percent of all domestic financial transactions being carried out online, and some 70 percent of tax returns being filed through the Internet. The so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks disrupted most “peacetime” economic life in the country and virtually paralyzed the government in Tallinn. Estonian defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo admitted that the hardest part about responding was the inability to verify the source of the attacks:“Some of those countries [e.g. Russia, Moldova, Ukraine] have many more serious problems than cybersecurity and cybercrime legislation. Secondly, sometimes there are only claims that people are acting from those geographic locations. We can't prove that. Like there are safe havens for terrorism—I mean, Afghanistan is one example, Yemen is emerging. We don't know about Nigeria. There are very many more safe havens in cyberspace than in real space.”\nWhat is interesting here is the conventional disorientation within which a government official assesses his country's first cyberwar. The same conundrum about the source of an attack was manipulated by Israel, North Korea, China, Russia, and nonstate groups named Anonymous and LulzSec, between 2007 and 2011 to launch attacks against commercial companies, foreign governments, and political parties on the pretexts of either private or undeclared vendettas. In 2006, the Bush Administration began inserting malware into Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz in order to map its computer vulnerabilities; since 2009, the Obama Administration had followed up with full-scale attacks to slow down the Iranian nuclear effort. Experts dubbed the cyberweapon “Stuxnet.” The United States was fingered as the source of Stuxnet, developed with Israeli collaboration, only after a journalist interviewed unnamed officials willing to leak the story. In August 2012, the computers at Saudi oil company Aramco were struck by a virus that systematically erased data on three-quarters of their databanks, replacing the data with an image of a burning American flag. No oil was spilled, nor burned, in this “attack” but computer experts flown in by the Saudis, including those from Symantec, ventured that this virus—dubbed “Shamoon” after a word embedded in its code—was the work of Iranian agents. These experts concluded that the data erasing command within Shamoon, dubbed “Wiper,” clearly imitated another virus named “Flame” that had mysteriously attacked Iranian oil companies right up till May 2012.4 Was Flame therefore a variant and an accessory to Stuxnet, and therefore attributable to Washington's virtual war against Tehran? If the attacking virus was replicated, who was the more culpable electronic combatant: the initiator or the imitator-cum-retaliator? In February 2013, a private web security company, Mandiant, publicly blamed the Chinese army unit 61398, situated in Shanghai, for a spate of cyber vandalism and theft at Google, Microsoft, RSA, and The New York Times, among other American corporations. The Chinese foreign ministry ingenuously countered that their country were equally at the receiving end of cyber attacks from unnamed states.5 The same Chinese spokesperson conveniently omitted any mention of domestic Internet vigilantes, as well as alienated, unemployed, computer literate college graduates within the People's Republic. This article ventures that generating open-ended paralysis and manipulating this vagary behind the source of an attack could well be strategy in itself. This is the core of an Asian prescription for information operations (IO).\nFor starters, some terminological clarification is needed to indicate the maneuverable space within IO in contrast to IW. IW has been treated by its foremost American proponents as a paradigmatic displacement of conventional offline warfighting. But the reasons for such a claim are actually rather weak if one considers non-western approaches to informational components of warfare. For a working definition, this article shall define IW as the use of symbolic resources to penetrate the enemy's secrecy and confidence for the purpose of winning a war on one's own terms. The proximate concept of IO refers to that entire range of symbolic resources straddling both military and civilian spheres that are aimed at achieving national objectives in both peacetime and wartime. These include psychological operations (PSYOPS), military deception (MILDEC), electronic countermeasures warfare, and public diplomacy. IW remains IO's predecessor.\nThe aim of this article is to supply an Asian perspective on IO that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. The appeal of pondering an Asian perspective lies in opening up the military mind to insights from a different civilization with its attendant particularistic philosophies. Civilizations are desirable sources of ideas given the fact that they are accumulations of wisdom and praxis across time and space directed by conscious human endeavor. This human endeavor aspires to distinguish one section of humanity from the rest.6 Attitudes toward understanding IO in all its complexities can therefore be enhanced through interaction with a non-western body of pre-digital wisdom. The deployment of information for strategic uses is in all probability culturally filtered. The agent deploying information to convert or confuse others is exercising a power over the creation of meaning. This is a point reiterated prominently by social constructivists in political science, international relations, and in linguistics.7 It will consequently be argued that an Asian way of IO does not try to delineate the physical, the permissible, and democratic elements from the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. This is a call for dialogue with non-western strategy rather than an ideological confrontation. To some extent, the survey produced by James Yin and Philip Taylor of four Asian countries' existing equivalents of IW doctrines and capabilities breaks ground for the current enterprise. That said, Yin and Taylor have merely described the existing state of operational profiles of Asian IW and imputed an Asian perspective to them. This cannot be adequate since critics might argue that the existing state of Asian IW doctrines are merely adaptations of western models of PSYOPS from the Cold War and later. It is also quite revealing that in 1955, with Cold War insurgencies in East Asia rising to fever pitch, Edward Katzenbach and Gene Hanrahan commented that Mao Zedong's revolutionary appeal among Southeast Asian communists lies in its “monopoly of patience” and its corollary that the strategy of the superior military mind “has very little to do with technological superiority.” Given space constraints within an article-length reflection, I sample only three Asian strategic thinkers who are prominent in classic strategic studies readers such as Peter Paret's Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age and other specialist surveys of unconventional warfare: Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. Omitted are other Asian voices of varying historical and geographical pedigrees. Nonetheless, by examining Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, readers should be able to discern what a more careful consideration of Asian perspectives could yield. Table 1 illustrates the subtle contrasts between Western IW and Asian IO approaches which this article intends to show.\nTaking a foundational approach to sketching Asian IO, this article will begin by surveying the predominantly American interpretation of IW in terms of a number of IW characteristics that should be opened up to critical contrast to Asian ways. The American interpretation of IW will be analyzed in terms of five characteristics: liberal democratic modernization, cyber delinquency, bureaucratic confusion, cyber power, and soft power. Subsequently, via Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a more Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately redescribed as IO. To generalize, an Asian IO approach is ideologically agnostic and unlikely to distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it distinguish strategy from tactics; moreover, it will indulge in subterfuge.\n## Western Approaches to IW: Information Capability via Liberal Democratic Modernization, Cyber Delinquency, Bureaucratic Confusion, and Cyber Power and Soft Power Following Clausewitzian thought on military strategy, the utility of information in war may be understood to be heavily dependent upon intellectual powers that are up to the task of deploying information adroitly according to constant changes in capabilities and “out of the box” challenges. Edward Luttwak's treatment of Chang\n\n|  Dimensions for comparison | Western approaches | Asian approaches  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Governing ideology as basis for information power | Liberal democratic modernization | Ideologically agnostic modernization  |\n|  Order and civil-military distinctions | Distinguishing delinquency in peacetime and offense in wartime; hesitation over questions of legality | Vagary and gray legal, political terrain as an advantage for mounting cyber attack; no peacetime; or wartime distinctions  |\n|  Bureaucracy and chain of command | Clarity of targeted system required to plan attack and/or defense | Targeted systems, as well as friendly systems, may be centralized and opaque so long as attack and defense can be mounted to maximum effect  |\n|  Power | Delineated levels of power application and escalation possible, and advisable | Power can be obscured and chameleonic  |\n|  Martial spirit | Deep penetration to uncover enemy plans, and to disrupt operations either before they commence or when they are underway; concern with legality; seeing the enemy more important than deception | Physical war as last resort; the acme of “fighting” is to defeat the enemy’s plans first, via calculated deception, and through unexpected angles; embrace asymmetry; anonymity; and contagion as advantages  |\nNote. IO = information operations; IW = information warfare.\nstrategy in terms of the conscious use of paradox in military execution illustrates this. Strategy, to Luttwak, is always an exercise in selecting information to maximize one's purpose, but this in turn requires factoring in the unexpected as undertaken by one's equally breathing and thinking adversary.¹³ As more scholars attempt to keep up with the \"information revolution\" associated with the penetration of computers into business networking and consumer lifestyles, it is to be expected that international relations and security in \"the digital age\" remains an underexplored area.¹⁴ Part of the problem lies in the lack of communication between disciplines and, worse, between different frequencies within the same subfield of a discipline. Such is the problem with treating information as part of strategy. Information is critical to all domains of knowledge inquiry.\n## Assumptions of Superiority in Advanced Liberal Democratic Modernization\nTaking these complexities to heart, an early groundbreaking work in the study of IW was grandiosely titled *In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information*\nAge. The editors and lead authors, John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, chose the metaphor of the Greek Goddess Athena over Mars, the God of War, for the reason that Athena stood for the superior use of information as knowledge to civilize people; moreover, she embodied the virtues of Athenian government, especially democracy. One can see how such a conception also perfectly mirrors the primary mission of American foreign policy. This liberal democratic influence, married to a technological vision of modernization, is carried further in Arquilla and Ronfeldt's choice of authors for their Foreword, Alvin and Heidi Toffler. The Tofflers are well known for their futurism studies, as well as their thesis about the three waves of technological civilization. The first wave concerned the agricultural revolution whereby certain peoples organized government and economy to systematically exploit natural food sources for sustaining human life. The second wave witnessed the application of electromechanical principles to provide inanimate sources of energy for human industry. The third wave enabled humanity to manipulate scientific principles to create whole new energy sources and even life forms. This made the \"Revolution in Military Affairs” (RMA) possible by the late twentieth century. To the Tofflers, the implications of the RMA would be on par with those generated by microbiological technology, genetics and cloning, and nuclear physics. Knowledge “has moved from a peripheral to a central position where ideas, innovation, values, imagination, symbols and imagery, not just computer data, play more and more important roles.”\nWhereas in the past, information in military strategy referred to morale, leadership, courage, and strategic insight, in today's terms, intangible information also includes “what is inside our databanks as well as the skulls of our soldiers. They include the power of software, the ability to blindside an opponent's information technology, the superiority of information collection and dissemination, the compatibility of information-enhancing tools, and much more.” This was framed by the Tofflers' reading that “America is the source of the most stunning knowledge-enhancing technologies, and most of its workforce is engaged in one or another form of knowledge work ... Nevertheless, the United States still has a residual sector of the economy based on low-skill muscle-work. And the US military reflects a similar duality.” The Tofflers acknowledge that while the United States currently possesses “some very big ‘media howitzers' that nobody else has” in the form of Hollywood and CNN:“ ... any idea that the US government or its military should attempt to rationalize or to impose broad controls on the US media in the interest of a coherent information warfare doctrine is anachronistic and counterproductive. The further a country advances toward Third Wave economic and social systems, the less likely central censorship or control will work. Third Wave economies thrive on open ideas and information systems, the irrepressible Internet being the most obvious example.”\nFreedom of information flow should theoretically lead to the unleashing of the ideological power of “open society” and “open government” as concepts. Woven\nthrough the writings of the Tofflers, David Gompert, and other narratives within Athena's Camp is a derogatory attitude toward authoritarian states such as China, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba, the erstwhile USSR, and even Singapore.\nAt the time of writing, the latest evangelizer of Internet freedom is Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister and founder of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders). On one hand, he claims clinically that technology is not necessarily predestined to support or yield liberty but in the case of the Internet, the precedents of its use have opened up the possibilities of a struggle:“Yet, all the same, the distortions [of Internet usage] are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most fantastic means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed peoples, who have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the Internet provides power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can be disseminated worldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult to hide a public demonstration, an act of repression or a violation of human rights.In authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion and civil society. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.”\nA battle is continually being waged to harness the Internet in the service of either authoritarian politics or its liberal protagonists, but one that liberals ought to win, in Kouchner's view. The first wave of the Arab Spring Revolutions of 2010--2012 have borne out Kouchner's predictions, but the ongoing bittersweet postscript in Egypt and Libya have dulled popular expectations that “Facebook revolutions” can be sustained in their political gains. These contradictory trends mean that IW will be inevitably politicized according to some of these “default, western” ideological assumptions. In fact, the link between liberal democracy and IW actually inhibits further exploration of IW as a comprehensive strategy since it limits debate and exploration to the uses liberal democracies make of it. The recent practices of undeclared IW by Russia and China, and some purport North Korea and Iran as well, undermine the liberal claims to the IW discourse. It is a mistake for IW thinkers to assume there is a preferential kinship between IW and any particular ideology.\n### IW's Roots in Cyber Delinquency\nCyber delinquency is a very recent label used to categorize criminal activities produced directly through the Internet. Yet, like the presumed linkage between liberalism and IW, this deserves unpacking. As a source of information, the Internet was designed for accessibility by its myriad contributors. Yet, in the twenty years since its public debut, it has been treated by many observers as an evolving “jungle” of abuse and source of harm to “innocent” democratically faithful users. Most\nnational legislation on computer crimes takes aim at persons who attempt unauthorized access to databases and other sites on the Internet. If “breaking and entering” without consent is criminal in the terrestrial world, it appears that cyberspace has taken on earthly characteristics, especially when observers and governments debate the prospect of governance of the Internet. Interestingly, the phrase “computer hacker,” or simply “hacker” has taken on the connotation of a night robber who forces his way into the inner sanctum of a home or office and steals its valuable contents. This is an unproblematic assumption from the perspective of law enforcement officials, but misses an important feature of the Internet era society according to a prominent scholar of the Internet, Manuel Castells.\nCastells argues that the so-called culture of freedom embedded in the Internet depends upon the interplay of roles between four virtual cultures arising from online interaction: “These cultural layers are hierarchically disposed: the techno-meritocratic culture becomes specified as a hacker culture by building rules and customs into networks of cooperation aimed at technological projects. The virtual communitarian culture adds a social dimension to technological sharing, by making the Internet a medium of selective social interaction and symbolic belonging. The entrepreneurial culture works on top of the hacker culture, and on the communitarian culture, to diffuse Internet practices in all domains of society by way of moneymaking. Without the techno-meritocratic culture, hackers would simply be a specific countercultural community of geeks and nerds.” Richard Power, one of the first observers of Internet security to author a book on digital crime, echoes his view. In his many visits to and interviews with cybersecurity analysts, Power observes that hacking begins with a deep-seated curiosity about computer systems. How capable is a computer, a software, or a particular database unless it is tested? Furthermore, as Power's research indicates, curiosity is bound up with professional desire to prove one's competence in discovering the vulnerabilities of connected computers, as well as in savoring an ego trip toward becoming the “master of online access.” These ambitions might also lead computer hackers to embrace a highly presumptuous, and even delusional, form of social heroism endeavoring to protect the ordinary user from rapacious corporations and governments. Power goes so far as to distinguish the hacker from the virus writer.\nThere is a great deal of intelligence and skill coupled to social and political potential in cyberspace crimes. Between 1997 and 2000, roughly coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the advent of the Internet, the top four criminal activities online were, in descending order of importance: virus attacks, insider abuse of web access, unauthorized access to databases by insiders, and denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. By 2009--2010, the US government reported that these categories appeared to have diminished in volume, and the new top four categories were “non-delivery of payment or merchandise,” Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)-related scams such as impersonating the Bureau online, “identity theft” and “computer crimes.” Since 1997, the US Department of Justice and the FBI have become more refined in their data capture. But it is also significant that between 2008 and 2009, there was a 22.3\npercent jump in Internet crimes complaints. The 2010 Internet Crime Report reiterated the pervasiveness of Internet crime. After 2010, both American agencies have discontinued annual Internet Crime Reports, preferring instead to issue periodic and crime-specific alerts. These criminal activities suggest that the Internet has evolved in tandem with real-world human nature to enable the extension of offline crimes into online activities. One could of course go on and cite the quality and intensity of cyberspace fraud that ranges from the disgruntled employee who attacks his own corporation, to the frequency of curiosity-driven sabotage of telecommunications companies, as well as the first widespread DDOS attacks against Yahoo, eBay, CNN, and Amazon.com in 2000. But this is, if Castells, Power, and other scholars are to be taken seriously, intrinsic to the human side of the web. Just as human enlightenment is to be expanded through the Internet and its applications, human beings can likewise use it to inflict pain and destruction. These predicaments are little different from those arising from the abuse of public spaces for hate crimes or supplying energy utilities at inflated rates to fleece consumers within a nation-state.\nHence, one cannot assume that cyber delinquency is simply just that—crime. Internet-based delinquency affords multiple new arenas for trials of strength among persons participating in and building an information society. Whenever authorities investigate “hacktivism,” the more enlightened among them often spot an opportunity to turn the perpetrator around toward new online uses that harmonize with pre-existing political interests. It is not surprising that, just as in espionage, governments rarely advertise the fact that online saboteurs can just as easily be turned to the service of covert national missions against real and imagined enemies. Alexander Klimburg has highlighted the roles of “Patriot Hackers” in the Chinese and Russian cyberwar “armies.” Most books on IW or cyberwar often use the commanding verb “imagine” to introduce the discussions of what hackers and virus creators could do if they penetrated international boundaries online. The world's first interstate cyberwar nearly broke out in tandem with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s military intervention in Kosovo in 1999. What eventually happened was a series of localized skirmishes between anti-Serb and pro-Serb Internet users employing propaganda e-mails and website postings. The US government hesitated before unleashing its cyber attack on Serbian banks, government and military systems to coincide with the physical aerial bombing campaign on the grounds of self-restraint. The US Department of Defense (US DoD) had concluded that IW against Serbia might invoke charges from third parties, as well as Serbians, that the Americans had willfully committed war crimes and other violations against United States and international law on cybercrimes. Additionally, it was reported that Serbian military computer systems were too dispersed, and had the Serbs attacked first, the chances of accurately verifying the sources of those attacks would be low. The unofficial revelations in June 2012 of President Obama's green light for preemptive cyber attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities suggest that the United States may have revised its doctrinal treatment of cyberwar as cyber delinquency. Of course,\nas it was widely reported in 1999, when NATO aircraft accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as part of their campaign, Chinese netizens behaved in an uninhibited fashion to send streams of spam into American mailboxes. By the time the next major Sino--American military incident occurred in April 2001, over the mid-air collision between a Chinese jet fighter and a US reconnaissance plane, Chinese hackers “unilaterally” defaced several US government sites. This coincided with the appearance of a number of smart viruses originating from Chinese users. Furthermore, the silence from Beijing regarding these actions hinted at the growing sophistication of its IW doctrine. Henceforth, any strategic doctrine should pay heed to the implications of the fungibility of cyber delinquency for defense purposes.\n### E-promise, Bureaucratic Confusion\nWhen the conceptual promise of “E-government” was derived with the advent of the Internet, the clarion call from information age gurus and journalists was to speed up, open up, and render government ever more transparent and responsive to its clients—the public at large. An Economist commentary in 2000 suggested that if web retailers and Internet service providers set the benchmark for virtual services, consumers would definitely not put up with “slum standards in the public sector.” The reason why governments have traditionally been slow to respond to public demands is due to the need to coordinate action across multiple agencies and to verify identities and other stored information about the citizenry. In tandem with this information-rich development, the public sector organization has been “problematized” as a rich target for IW.\nChristopher Paul, in scrutinizing the US government's predicament, observes that “the novelty of IO [Information Operations] was a combination of the recognition of the information age importance and vulnerability of adversary (and friendly) information and information systems, plus a desire for a coordinated, integrated approach to attacking and defending those data and systems.” This bureaucratic feature of IO implies that strengths and weaknesses are interchangeable. There is also the implication that organizations are only as strong as the weakest link in their chain of command. The idea of the bureaucracy as a system simply means that pulverizing a linchpin of it can trigger its wholesale collapse.\nIn the mostly American dominated literature on IW, there have been a number of books and articles that critically analyze the problems with defining mission foci among a number of overlapping governmental agencies tasked with prosecuting IW, and with identifying vulnerabilities in target organizations for IW. Walter Jajko's “Critical Commentary on the Department of Defense Authorities for Information Operations” published ten years ago in the journal Comparative Strategy called attention to the bureaucratic weaknesses in the American effort. While most of Jajko's piece deals with the specifics of US organizational tasking, some highlights are worth noting here to facilitate the discussion of the Asian supplement to IW theorizing. Jajko argued that the definitional vagary of IW, or IO, could potentially hamper governmental coordination but praised the US DoD for adopting an all-inclusive definition that could encompass\ncivilian activities as well as provide direction at the national level: “actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems, while defending one's own information and information systems.” Yet, he goes on to lament that while the US DoD provides some guidance on offensive and defensive IW doctrines, there is no presidential directive for doing so on a national level. This was somewhat addressed by a secret presidential directive signed by the Obama Administration in mid-2009 creating a White House office for a “Cyberczar” as well as a corresponding Pentagon-housed military command for cyberspace. Nevertheless, Jajko labels the reversibility of information/Internet dependence and accessibility a vulnerability for military planners.\nTraditional service cultures within the Army, Navy, and Air Force also tended to treat IO as “adjunct operations” supporting physical missions in their respective domains of land, sea, and air. Furthermore, IW doctrine is pursued only according to each service's intrinsic interpretations. Moreover, there is, attending to each service interpretation, the lack of clarity over whether to target strictly military enemies, or whether there should be any operational distinction between actual and potential enemies. US DoD guidelines up till 2002 were analyzed as being open-ended and vague in implying that peacetime, precrisis offensive IO could well prove useful to war planning and may be conducted “inside and outside of the traditional battlespace to shape it and prepare the way for future operations.” As of 2013, it remains unclear if any of these issues have been addressed institutionally by the three US armed services, but Jajko's commentary deserves its place as a form of “pre-theorizing” of IW as bureaucratic streamlining.\nBooks by Christopher Paul and Alexander, Kott et al. not only echo Jajko's analyses, but also go on to address the possibilities of targeting the adversary's precise organizational decision-making processes and chain of command. Yet, as the contributors to Kott et al. note “the challenge is that most of the time we cannot observe the elements of the structures in the organization. Instead, we can obtain the intelligence due to the actions and activities of the organization.” The thrust of the various contributors to Kott et al.'s volume is that traditional modes of intelligence operations, under familiar labels such as penetrating the enemy's operations security, planting moles, playing deception through PSYOPS, and the accumulation of open-source political intelligence are all essential to displacing the many weak links in the adversary's bureaucratic decision-making process. Paul appreciates that these penetration efforts represent strategy at work but warns that IO straddle the black, the white, and the gray, implying that PSYOPS involve deploying untruths and half-truths, and hence should be used sparingly. In these ways, American scholars point to a fundamental problem in any information-reliant and complex governing environment: how should IW become a multipronged and nimble information operation?\n### Cyber Power for IW\nThe promise of Internet-enabled long range computer attacks has spurred fevered imaginations to propose the integrated concept of national cyber power. Alex\nKlimburg has defined cyber power in three dimensions: policy coordination across government in the manner sketched in the preceding subsection; coherence of policy across a nation-state's participation in international organizations and legal regimes; and the cooperation of nonstate actors in a national mission.^{44} This is a laudable policy recommendation for making strategy, but it is also a rear view perspective analogous to speculating the size of air force arsenals, chemical, and biological weapons in the manner of foot soldiers, armored personnel carriers, and combat ships. There is scant attention toward the subtleties of force, and impact multiplication, arising from any physically miniscule form of power. The power of computer analysts armed with skills for hacking, and capabilities for code breaking and cipher alteration through mathematical speculation, cannot be quantified. Yet another set of complementary perspectives is fronted by the writings of Adam Liff, Dale Peterson, and Thomas Rid. Liff tried very hard in his 2012 article to stimulate analysis of cyberwar along the premise of Bernard Brodie's^{45} post-1945 speculation upon the impact of atomic weapons on war. Liff contends that cyberwarfare should be understood as the “cost-inducing use of computer network attacks” against an enemy's vital military and civilian infrastructures with coercive intentions.^{46} He claims it is a political bargaining process between two or more actors where costs are decisive in shaping outcomes. This is elaborated by his conjectures upon cyberweapons as the ideal asymmetrical ideal; the difficulty of attributing attacks for certain; cyberweapons as an offensive force multiplier; and the possibility of cyberdeterrence.^{47} Dale Peterson goes further into the mode of specifying cyberweapons in three tiers: simple, moderate level, and complex.^{48} Each of these types correspond to the degree of damage they are intended to inflict, ranging from disruption of normal service, to disablement of specific components of a targeted system, to a thorough transformation by stealth of a targeted industrial system to the extent that the latter is hijacked or programmed to be remotely controlled by the attacker. Peterson goes on to discuss the architecture of an industrial control system and how a cyberweapon can be reverse engineered in tandem with the intricacies of the original design of that system.^{49} Finally, Thomas Rid has proposed that cyber weapons can be “helpfully” employed for “sabotage” campaigns short of the violence associated with outright war.^{50} Such distinctions depend on the ability to draw fine lines between the Clausewitzian conception of war as absolute violence and targeted destruction suited to limited objectives. In pondering cyber power through the rational choice frames of conventional kinetic and nuclear weaponry, these authors are bound by an imperfect hindsight that neglects the possibilities of structural human and philosophical vagaries that may deeply characterize those parts of IW employing cyber means.\n### Soft Power as IW\nA fourth characteristic of the existing literature on IW stems from Joseph Nye's concept of soft power as the ability to get others to want what one wants through voluntary attraction.^{51} In Nye's original formulation, soft power was thought to\nbe important as the new currency of American great power status in a post-Cold War era characterized by economic interdependence and a communications revolution that has shrunk the globe in political terms. Starting with Nye and Owens' article published in 1996 in Foreign Affairs magazine, titled “America's Information Edge,” the idea that American public diplomacy ought to be integrated into a coherent grand strategy of information that connected the dots between Hollywood films, US universities, the US Constitution, US popular culture, civic culture, and America's corporate mastery of the electronic communications market, captured the imagination of governments and think tanks worldwide. Arquilla and Ronfeldt included it in their gamut of tools in preparing the nation for information age threats but elaborated no further as to how soft power could actually assist warfare.\nLeigh Armistead's book, Information Operations: Warfare and the Hard Reality of Soft Power, has at least attempted to persuade the military to embrace the new power currency as a means to deal with the spectrum of post-Cold War “new threats” ranging from rogue states (the then Baathist Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and Myanmar) to rogue nonstate actors, such as separatist groups, exiled groups, and Al Qaeda. To Armistead, the new threats could not be simply bombed out of existence, or neutralized through direct armed occupation; they could only be eliminated through a battle for hearts and minds. Unless carefully redefined, PSYOPS and MILDEC are too crude in the era of globalization since foreign public opinion can verify information credibility through access to Internet sources and satellite-based round-the-clock global news on both television and Internet. Armistead's approach is unhelpful since it takes a kitchen sink approach to strategy, implying information is all important but hardly detailing how it integrates into grand strategy.\nBut as Armistead points out, the invocation of soft power returns the discussion to whether peacetime and wartime distinctions in information strategy are operationally relevant. Presumably, militaries committed to IW or IO need to automatically fold domestic public opinion and private sector entities into a holistic effort. Soft power therefore merits inclusion as a point of reflection because of its civilian face, which is crucial for mitigating armed conflict. Some might also argue that the power of ideas embedded in the structures of knowledge and everyday practice could well constrict a rival's choices, leading toward the achievement of one's goals without ever firing a shot. Should one then consider dismissing IW in its strictest definition in favor of invoking the “magic” of soft power?\nUnfortunately, Nye has himself muddled the soft power component in IO when he recently argued that cyber power was the larger concept encompassing soft power. According to Nye, cyber power refers to the contextual power arising from resources deployable within cyberspace. He then goes on to argue that cyber power can be both hard (e.g. “denial of service attacks,” “government control over companies,” and “bombing of routers and cutting of cables”) and soft (e.g. “public diplomacy campaign,” “setting norms and standards,” and “protests to name and shame cyber providers”). Since cyberspace is an “imperfect [global] commons,” both hard and soft cyber power should be used as appropriate. While governments\nin cyberspace remain the most potent wielders of cyber power, the diffusion of cyber technologies ensure that nonstate actors can increasingly exploit asymmetrical contests to their advantage vis-à-vis governments. But this angle of approach reflects nothing more than Nye's inability to provide a definitive formulation of IO through the lens of soft power—after all, if the power of ideas is paramount in a networked world, why does the United States need to contemplate physical denial as an aspect of exercising cyber power? As many observers have pointed out in the wake of eroding American economic competitiveness in Africa and Latin America vis-à-vis China, and mounting criticism of drone-enabled assassinations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen, soft power through IO needs to deploy social sensitivity in the minds of the proverbial boots on the ground.\n## Asian Strategic Thought on IO\nIn contrast to the aforementioned strands of cyberwarfare thinking, certain Asian theorists and practitioners have not tried to delineate between the physical, the permissible and democratic, and the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. Asian strategic thought has long been viewed as both a complement to and a contrast against western theorizing. But it has been underappreciated in operationally remolding western-originated strategy. Before one proceeds any further in adducing an Asian supplement via a sampled reading of the works of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, the invocation of Asian thinkers must be justified. The thesis of a culturally filtered Asian military revolution must be treated seriously if one is to break out of the mold of treating the West as the only source of military strategy. Peter Lorge has made a compelling case that Asian military strategy cannot be regarded as historically inferior simply because Asia appeared to be laggard in embracing a military revolution characterized by gunpowder, guns, and war-making machines powered by inanimate energy sources. Asian guns were available earlier than the assumed military revolution in Europe; they were not widely deployed simply because the Asian theater and cultural mores of the time militated against their use. But, more importantly, there are some distinct and intriguing parallels between Asian political philosophies that emphasize undoing the enemy's strategies by sowing chaos and the pre-digital western strategic thought of individuals like Machiavelli and Clausewitz. Considering that IOs prior to the advent of the Internet have already been partially treated as a worthy subject, there is every reason to study past wisdom for their bearing on the current information age.\n### Sun Tzu\nAs a cumulative collection of didactic texts on military strategy dating back more than 2,500 years, Sun Tzu's Art of War (Sunzi Bingfa) has captured the imagination of strategic studies scholars beyond China and Japan, even though many scholars believe it to have been inspired by the Sung Dynasty's (tenth to thirteenth centuries)\ndesperate attempt to think their way out of their strategic enclosure by “barbarian powers.” An official translation of the Art of War published by Beijing-based Foreign Languages Press in 1999 describes this work as “representing the quintessence of Chinese military thinking, [and] it summarizes the rich experiences of ancient wars and analyses them from political, economic, social and cultural angles.” Interestingly, these translators also echo the standard culturalist interpretation of Sun Tzu's tract as treating “war as ill-boding and perilous, insisting that the purpose of studying war is to end war.”\nWar is treated as an inherently philosophical enterprise that reflects upon human virtue and cultivation of superior intellect. In Sun Tzu's opening chapter “Making Assessments,” he identifies five fundamental factors of war: moral influence, weather, distance and terrain, command, and doctrine. Of these, his reading of moral influence, cryptically referred to as Dao or “the Way” in Sun Tzu's original parlance, carries particular Daoist and Confucian connotations. Moral influence is “that which causes people to think in line with their sovereign so that they will follow him through every vicissitude, whether to live or to die, without fear of mortal peril.” Information in Sun Tzu's mental framework emerges as a paradigm of correctly investing the energies of the state and its people in harmonized attainment of the national objective through either peace or war. War might be a miscalculation if it ultimately ruins the state and its people, so it must be embarked upon only after in-depth consideration of all its factors, with “moral influence” being the leading one. The general ought also to be skilled in balancing the seemingly contradictory values of compassion for his soldiers with courage in battle. Boldness should not be confused with recklessness. Calculating information is also critical to treating war as a game of deception: “feign incapability when in fact capable; feign inactivity when ready to strike; appear to be far away when actually nearby, and vice versa. When the enemy is greedy for gains, hand out a bait to lure him; when he is in disorder, attack and overcome him ... if he is given to anger, provoke him.” In Chapter 3 “Attacking by Stratagem,” Sun Tzu counsels that “to fight a hundred battles and win each and every one of them is not the wisest thing to do. To break the enemy's resistance without fighting is.”\nInsofar as Sun Tzu speaks directly to IW in our time, his counsel is to read the opportunity costs of waging war correctly, and never end up with greater losses than those envisioned in the opening gambit. Essentially, IW is folded into what we term IO as an art of reading the proverbial “tea leaves” of achieving national goals using the right policy instruments adapted to circumstances.\nLiterally, one should follow the Way of the Dao. Although Sun Tzu does not explicitly address the distinction between peacetime and wartime, there is frequent intimation that the two periods exist on a seamless continuum of preparation for the eventuality of combat. To be victorious in the event of war, one's military must be deployed advantageously, akin to the momentum found in nature: torrential water moving boulders, falcons falling upon hapless prey, and so forth. Because mental preparations must draw on parallels to the forces of nature, and nature in turn\nprivileges harmony among its forces, Sun Tzu denigrates any form of chaos (luan), whether in strategic planning, logistics, failure to treat physical terrain as an ally, or in the absence of unwavering charismatic inspiration of one's troops. Conversely, Sun Tzu extolled the possibilities of sowing luan within one's enemy.\nAs such, Sun Tzu appears to embrace espionage as a lofty form of IO in his time. Here, it is worth quoting in full: “The enlightened sovereign and the capable commander conquer the enemy at every move and achieve successes far surpassing those of ordinary people because they possess ‘foreknowledge.' This ‘foreknowledge' cannot be obtained from ghosts or spirits, nor from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor from astrological calculations. It can only come from men who know the enemy situation.” This is from the Art of War's closing Chapter 13, titled “Using Spies.” Sun Tzu specifies in some detail five types of spy: the native agent, the internal agent, the converted agent, the expendable agent, and the surviving agent. The details need not concern us; all involve the need to penetrate the walls of the enemy's inner sanctums of government and put on a veneer of sincerely empathizing with the enemy, in order to listen in on their most subtle intentions. There is no right or wrong time for espionage—“so delicate and so secretive is espionage that there is nowhere you cannot put it to good use.” In employing spies, the overriding goal of gaining “foreknowledge” must always drive action. Fully deniable cyberspace intrusions are highly necessary if one takes this advice seriously. One, of course, might pose the question as to whether gaining “foreknowledge” does not undercut adherence to the cosmic harmony that the Way promotes in harmonizing interstate relations.\n### Mao Zedong\nMao is easily the second most important Asian military thinker found in war studies syllabi. His stature is partly derived from association with the contemporary postcolonial politics of East Asia. It also stems from the fact that Mao's ideological immersion in Marxism--Leninism was indigenized in the fledgling Chinese Communist Party, followed by constant harassment from “class enemies,” as well as the Japanese during the Pacific War. Mao's brand of armed rural revolutionary war was hatched in the vast and often inhospitable countryside, in mountains, valleys, and secluded areas. He had to appraise the Chinese strategic environment virtually from scratch as a political outsider to the then ruling Guomindang's dominance in the teeming urban population centers. The Chinese Civil War was scripted into a war between the “righteous” have-nots against the “nefarious” haves. In many ways, Mao's thinking on military affairs possessed a do-it-yourself quality, though he was also drawn to ideologies bound to be attractive to the underdog in a revolutionary struggle.\nAs John Shy and Thomas Collier have aptly noted in their survey of the subject of revolutionary war, Mao stands out as one of the rare thinkers postulating that “strategic theory has meaning only in terms of the concrete political, social, and international circumstances at the moment in which theory is being elucidated.” In Mao's\nvision of using flexible means toward achieving one's goals, theory and practice should be conjoined. In this regard, political warfare qua IW qua revolutionary warfare qua armed struggle should be components in a fluid spectrum of means used to attain revolutionary objectives. In his essay, “The Military Problem” written under very difficult physical circumstances, Mao exhorts his comrades to place the party and the masses on a war footing. The latter phrase did not presage a long list of tasks. Mao's thrust was instead to encourage the enemy troops to defect and join the Red Army rank and file, “to intensify political training,” in Mao's translated words. The challenge in his informational strategy was to ensure that despite the relative material poverty of the Red Army, the Guomindang soldiers would find it morally rewarding to join the righteous cause of fighting for revolution against their former masters. The Red Army would thus gain mass through the conversion of the enemy's ranks:“Apart from the role played by the party, the reason the Red Army can sustain itself without collapse in spite of such a poor standard of material life and incessant engagements, is its practice of democracy. The officers do not beat the men; officers and men receive equal treatment; soldiers enjoy freedom of assembly and speech; cumbersome formalities and ceremonies are done away with; and the account books are open to the inspection of all ... They [the captured soldiers] feel that, though in material life they are worse off in the Red Army than in the White [Guomindang] army, spiritually they are liberated. The fact that the same soldier who was not brave in the enemy army yesterday becomes very brave in the Red Army today shows precisely the impact of democracy. The Red Army is like a furnace in which all captured soldiers are melted down and transformed the moment they come over.”\nUnder this rubric, PSYOPS is treated as both substitute and supplement for the strategies of mass and technological augmentation. In this way, Mao has inherited Sun Tzu's precept of executing one's military campaign with the Dao of harmonizing the people and their rulers. This likewise extends into propaganda tasks other than fighting. In Mao's words, proper war fighting should transcend “the purely military viewpoint” and the military “should also shoulder such important tasks as agitating the masses, organizing them, arming them, and helping them to set up revolutionary political power, and even establishing organizations of the Communist Party.” That Mao's undeclared targets are the winning of the populace's “hearts and minds,” and the subversion of the enemy's political command, is obvious in the disproportionate emphasis placed upon informational strategies in his writings. Even when dealing with specific military strategies, his emphasis remains steadfastly fixed upon correctly appraising the terrain and foreknowledge gleaned of the enemy forces. His clarion call is for the flexibility of means to be reconciled with some semblance of centralized command at every level. Mao was set “against fixed operational fronts and positional warfare, and for fluid operational fronts and mobile warfare; against the mere routing of the enemy, and for a war of annihilation;\nagainst the principle of striking with both fists, and for the principle of striking with one fist ... ”^{72}\nMao's concept of People's War essentially converts the asymmetry of the militarily weaker protagonist into unconventional strengths used to defeat the militarily stronger.^{73} Taking account of the enemy tactically means learning where the disaffected majority of the population lives and earns its livelihood. People have to be aroused to rebel against their oppressors. In Cold War vintage vocabulary, Mao envisioned that imperialists and their lackeys tend to gravitate toward the positional control of urban centers and main lines of communication. A successful people's war should therefore convert the countryside with its people and physical resources into a revolutionary force to engulf the exploitative capitalist centers from the countryside. How might this be extrapolated into IO? There is one telling commentary published in the People's Liberation Army Daily on June 25, 1996, which has since been extensively reproduced on the Internet as a sign of Chinese thinking:“A people's war in the context of information warfare is carried out by hundreds of millions of people using open-type modern information systems. Because the traditional mode of industrial production has changed from centralization to dispersion and commercial activities have expanded from urban areas to rural areas, the working method and mode of interaction in the original sense are increasingly information-based. Political mobilization for war must rely on information technology to become effective, for example by generating and distributing political mobilization software via the Internet, sending patriotic e-mail messages, and setting up databases for traditional education. This way, modern technical media can be fully utilized and the openness and diffusion effect of the Internet can be expanded, to help political mobilization exert its subtle influence.In short, the meaning and implications of a people's war have profoundly changed in the information age, and the chance of people taking the initiative and randomly participating in the war has increased. The ethnic signature and geographic mark on an information war are more pronounced and the application of strategies is more secretive and unpredictable.^{74}”\nOne might add that a People's War can in fact take on additional characteristics of anonymity and contagion in the Internet age.^{75} Moreover, the didactic spirit of this passage is a direct twist on the liberal democratic modernization spiel embedded in western IW as espoused for instance by the Tofflers. Finally, one might interpret grand strategic possibilities for an ongoing People's War involving large numbers of Chinese government co-opted college graduates equipped with computer skills tasked to conduct Web-based infiltration and deception across sovereign borders. This might be dubbed an IO sub-strategy of loose unison in the service of a collective national interest. The declared establishment of an American Cybercorps is equally likely to draw on such transnational possibilities of pursuing grand strategy across the World Wide Web, as well as to retaliate against People's War intrusions conducted by rival powers and non-state actors.\nVo Nguyen Giap\nGeneral Giap is often considered the military brain behind the military successes against both French and American forces in the First and Second Indochina wars. His relevance to our discussion falls under the shadow of Mao. While Mao postulated strategy in the light of Chinese geopolitical and ideological circumstances, Giap adapted its execution in a much smaller theater of war against technologically superior enemies. One might also draw a straight line affirming the lineage between Sun Tzu and Giap. Cognizant of Sun Tzu's admonition to the ruler and commander to ensure concord between a people and their government, Giap identified the French imperialist stature after World War II in terms of its “weak point [lying] in the unjust character of his war. As a result, he was internally divided, not supported by the people of his own country, and did not enjoy the sympathy of world opinion.” Furthermore, “his army was strong at the beginning but its fighting spirit was deteriorating.”^{76}\nIn contrast, the Vietnamese revolutionary forces enjoyed the advantage of tapping into a ragtag untested guerrilla army that had tasted independence at the conclusion of the Japanese Occupation; they could also count on the sympathy of newly liberated peoples elsewhere. Based upon such assessments, Giap was willing to join his comrades in strategizing a protracted war to wear down French material strength by deploying the spiritual and symbolic strengths of the Vietnamese. Giap has admitted to spending time in Mao's camps in southern China in the early 1940s, observing and learning from his communist brethren how to fight successfully as the weaker party. From this experience, Giap helped the Party formulate the overlapping concepts of resistance war, anti-imperialist war, and war for national liberation. These slogans were meant to capture the loyalties of as broad a segment of Vietnamese society as possible for an armed and unified anti-French front. This broad coalition would also discursively alienate collaborators and compel Vietnamese with wavering loyalties to take sides in a “just war.”^{77}\nAlong with consolidating the political front, Giap noted that “guerrilla war must multiply. To keep itself in life and to develop, guerrilla warfare necessarily has to develop into mobile warfare. This is a general law.”^{78} Giap subsequently elaborated this guerrilla strategy into a three-stage scenario with: first, the “stage of contention,” second, the “stage of equilibrium;” and third, the “stage of counter-offensive.” In the stage of contention, one's forces were both numerically and materially weaker than the enemy's. Small-scale attacks on enemy outposts and the killing or capturing of a handful of enemy soldiers counted for important political effects. At every turn, guerrillas were expected to trade ground for safety through retreat into the jungles. With time and steadily growing confidence and supplies, hit-and-run attacks would give way to pitched battles with the enemy. Once the base areas had attained a level of security from large-scale harassment by enemy troops, the people's army could then transit from mere guerrilla attacks to concerted regimental and battalion scale campaigns against the enemy.^{79}\nWhat, then, is Giap's contribution to a non-Western reading of IO? Certainly, PSYOPS and other propaganda maneuvers to marshal political loyalties in support of one's cause were crucial to constituting the base for subsequent stages. As a communist, Giap interpreted Marx, Lenin, and Mao correctly in preparing armed struggle through political engineering. His guerrilla pronouncements suggested that the weaker party in a conflict should always bide its time, staging attacks commensurate with its deployable resources at any given point in time to demonstrate the lively presence of opposition. Incrementally, gains achieved through harassment would build momentum toward full-scale assault.^{80} This is especially relevant to the exploitability of Internet-based IO—the simple and random acts of hacking displace the enemy's security systems and its state of tranquility; consequently, when the enemy's information systems prove ever more vulnerable, more decisive DOS attacks, virus injections, and spam waves can be deployed to paralyze him. In this regard, both North Korea and Iran should merit serious study as paradigmatic cases of asymmetrical IO practitioners in the light of their ongoing postures of strategic defiance against a number of great military powers.\n## Conclusion: The Shape of an Asian Perspective to IW—Advocating the Characteristics of Continuity in IO\nYin and Taylor's initial work exploring an Asian approach to IO helpfully focuses attention on existing doctrines employed by China, Taiwan, Japan, and Thailand, but they are pessimistic about the relative backwardness of Asian capabilities.^{81} They assert that Asia will be “playing catch up to the West” for some time to come. Jacqueline Newmyer has even asserted that one should expect to witness a “Revolution in Military Affairs with Chinese Characteristics” as the People's Liberation Army attempts to westernize its IW capabilities.^{82} This article has argued otherwise through a thickly inferred reading of a sample of Asian strategists. While western strategizing for IW has opened up avenues for pondering the time and space complexities inherent in IO, this opening allows scholars and practitioners alike to mine non-Western, and specifically, Asian strategic thought to discover fresh insights into how asymmetrically powerful IO can be if one wishes to look beyond the glamour of high-technology dominance in conceptualizing information as a military weapon.\nFirst, as Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap suggest, there is a premium to be placed upon harmonizing trust between governments and peoples in executing any form of information strategy for defense. There is no specific need for any state to be a liberal democratic high-technology power in order to maximize the potential of information as a military resource. In fact, the Asian thinkers sampled here suggest that some degree of centralized absolutism should be practiced to conduct IW successfully. Asian strategists appear to privilege unity in transmitting political messages, as opposed to the emphasis on putting democratic soft power on an immutable pedestal for foreign consumption. More importantly, Asian thinkers embrace a form of soft power that is mostly internally directed to consolidate one's own domestic military\nfront as an ideological cudgel, enabling one to then summon almost infinite sacrifices in blood and treasure.\nSecond, Asian thinkers appreciate the offensive and defensive utilities of vagary. This addresses the dual nature of cyber delinquency. Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap referred to this as flexibility in fighting with a weaker hand, asserting presence by converting a population, as well as dispatching spies as information seekers. In Sun Tzu's writings, we see the importance of secrecy of foreknowledge mixed with outward guile. For Mao and Giap, flexibility was meant to displace the enemy's comfort zone insofar as the enemy applied premeditated doctrines. The Asian thinkers treated here make little or no distinction between peacetime or wartime activity; politics and its goals dictate the agency, scale, and timing of IO. This has been misinterpreted by Newmyer as a historical phenomenon specific only to the era of China's ancient warring kingdoms.\nThird, the matter of PSYOPS links western thought to its Asian counterpart. Targeting the political minds responsible for determining the central strategic direction of the war, or any political confrontation, is as important as dealing with the technological threat posed by one's adversaries. In the case of Mao and Giap, whom many assume interpreted Sun Tzu for the modern Asian military audience, high technology should not obscure the relative importance of subverting the enemy's confidence. This is a soft target which can always be exploited by a technologically weaker adversary without even resorting to a physical clash of arms.\nUltimately then, people's war for the information age will be no less unpredictable than the Cold War version. IW appears to have borrowed too much from conventional understandings of war fighting. IO is the broader, more important discipline to read or to deflect an enemy without distinguishing between peacetime and wartime. As a sign that Asian IO theory is perhaps gaining traction, the Obama Administration has responded to the exposure of Chinese cyber provocations in February 2013 by avoiding official attribution to Beijing and deflecting calls for straightforward retaliation, instead it is seeking ways to warn the unnamed state-sponsored intruders of the risks of collateral economic and political damages to their interdependent relationship. Chris Johnson of the Central Intelligence Agency neatly summed up the policy predicament on this occasion: “The problem so far is that we have rhetoric, and we have Cyber Command, and not much in between.”\nThe author wishes to thank participants at the first Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College Seminar in 2010 in Singapore for the opportunity to present a preliminary version of this article.

This article ventures an Asian perspective that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. This article will pan out by first critically analyzing the predominantly American interpretation of IW as a set of five characteristics that can be contrasted to an Asian rival. Subsequently, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a generic Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately termed information operations (IO). These Asian IO features will be teased out through a reading of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. An Asian IO approach will not distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it place a premium on liberal democratic ideology as a basis for information superiority.\nWith the advent of cyberspace, information warfare (IW) boggles the military mind with its self-revelation as a weapon of mass disruption. Paralysis, rather than physical destruction, appears to be the outcome. Recent incidents between 2007 and 2013 illustrate the slippery interface between war and peace through the conflation of terrestrial order and disorder, cyberspatial chaos, and the lack of clarity of the source of the attack. In April 2007, the world's first full-scale cyberattack targeted the Republic of Estonia. The cause was publicly speculated by Estonian politicians and public opinion as an offline one: Russian residents in the former Soviet republic were vehemently taking to the streets and media to protest the government's removal of a Soviet era military memorial in the Estonian capital Tallinn. It did not help matters that since Estonia declared “independence” from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, relations between Russia and Estonia had been either stagnant or strained. The attacks occurred in the context of Estonia being the most wired nation-state in Europe, with an estimated 90 percent of all domestic financial transactions being carried out online, and some 70 percent of tax returns being filed through the Internet. The so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks disrupted most “peacetime” economic life in the country and virtually paralyzed the government in Tallinn. Estonian defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo admitted that the hardest part about responding was the inability to verify the source of the attacks:“Some of those countries [e.g. Russia, Moldova, Ukraine] have many more serious problems than cybersecurity and cybercrime legislation. Secondly, sometimes there are only claims that people are acting from those geographic locations. We can't prove that. Like there are safe havens for terrorism—I mean, Afghanistan is one example, Yemen is emerging. We don't know about Nigeria. There are very many more safe havens in cyberspace than in real space.”\nWhat is interesting here is the conventional disorientation within which a government official assesses his country's first cyberwar. The same conundrum about the source of an attack was manipulated by Israel, North Korea, China, Russia, and nonstate groups named Anonymous and LulzSec, between 2007 and 2011 to launch attacks against commercial companies, foreign governments, and political parties on the pretexts of either private or undeclared vendettas. In 2006, the Bush Administration began inserting malware into Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz in order to map its computer vulnerabilities; since 2009, the Obama Administration had followed up with full-scale attacks to slow down the Iranian nuclear effort. Experts dubbed the cyberweapon “Stuxnet.” The United States was fingered as the source of Stuxnet, developed with Israeli collaboration, only after a journalist interviewed unnamed officials willing to leak the story. In August 2012, the computers at Saudi oil company Aramco were struck by a virus that systematically erased data on three-quarters of their databanks, replacing the data with an image of a burning American flag. No oil was spilled, nor burned, in this “attack” but computer experts flown in\nby the Saudis, including those from Symantec, ventured that this virus—dubbed “Shamoon” after a word embedded in its code—was the work of Iranian agents. These experts concluded that the data erasing command within Shamoon, dubbed “Wiper,” clearly imitated another virus named “Flame” that had mysteriously attacked Iranian oil companies right up till May 2012.4 Was Flame therefore a variant and an accessory to Stuxnet, and therefore attributable to Washington's virtual war against Tehran? If the attacking virus was replicated, who was the more culpable electronic combatant: the initiator or the imitator-cum-retaliator? In February 2013, a private web security company, Mandiant, publicly blamed the Chinese army unit 61398, situated in Shanghai, for a spate of cyber vandalism and theft at Google, Microsoft, RSA, and The New York Times, among other American corporations. The Chinese foreign ministry ingenuously countered that their country were equally at the receiving end of cyber attacks from unnamed states.5 The same Chinese spokesperson conveniently omitted any mention of domestic Internet vigilantes, as well as alienated, unemployed, computer literate college graduates within the People's Republic. This article ventures that generating open-ended paralysis and manipulating this vagary behind the source of an attack could well be strategy in itself. This is the core of an Asian prescription for information operations (IO).\nFor starters, some terminological clarification is needed to indicate the maneuverable space within IO in contrast to IW. IW has been treated by its foremost American proponents as a paradigmatic displacement of conventional offline warfighting. But the reasons for such a claim are actually rather weak if one considers non-western approaches to informational components of warfare. For a working definition, this article shall define IW as the use of symbolic resources to penetrate the enemy's secrecy and confidence for the purpose of winning a war on one's own terms. The proximate concept of IO refers to that entire range of symbolic resources straddling both military and civilian spheres that are aimed at achieving national objectives in both peacetime and wartime. These include psychological operations (PSYOPS), military deception (MILDEC), electronic countermeasures warfare, and public diplomacy. IW remains IO's predecessor.\nThe aim of this article is to supply an Asian perspective on IO that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. The appeal of pondering an Asian perspective lies in opening up the military mind to insights from a different civilization with its attendant particularistic philosophies. Civilizations are desirable sources of ideas given the fact that they are accumulations of wisdom and praxis across time and space directed by conscious human endeavor. This human endeavor aspires to distinguish one section of humanity from the rest.6 Attitudes toward understanding IO in all its complexities can therefore be enhanced through interaction with a non-western body of pre-digital wisdom. The deployment of information for strategic uses is in all probability culturally filtered. The agent deploying information to convert or confuse others is exercising a power over the creation of meaning. This is a point reiterated prominently by social constructivists in political science, international relations, and in linguistics.7 It will consequently be argued that an\nAsian way of IO does not try to delineate the physical, the permissible, and democratic elements from the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. This is a call for dialogue with non-western strategy rather than an ideological confrontation. To some extent, the survey produced by James Yin and Philip Taylor of four Asian countries' existing equivalents of IW doctrines and capabilities breaks ground for the current enterprise.^{8} That said, Yin and Taylor have merely described the existing state of operational profiles of Asian IW and imputed an Asian perspective to them. This cannot be adequate since critics might argue that the existing state of Asian IW doctrines are merely adaptations of western models of PSYOPS from the Cold War and later. It is also quite revealing that in 1955, with Cold War insurgencies in East Asia rising to fever pitch, Edward Katzenbach and Gene Hanrahan commented that Mao Zedong's revolutionary appeal among Southeast Asian communists lies in its “monopoly of patience” and its corollary that the strategy of the superior military mind “has very little to do with technological superiority.”^{9} Given space constraints within an article-length reflection, I sample only three Asian strategic thinkers who are prominent in classic strategic studies readers such as Peter Paret's Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age^{10} and other specialist surveys of unconventional warfare:^{11} Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. Omitted are other Asian voices of varying historical and geographical pedigrees. Nonetheless, by examining Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, readers should be able to discern what a more careful consideration of Asian perspectives could yield. Table 1 illustrates the subtle contrasts between Western IW and Asian IO approaches which this article intends to show.\nTaking a foundational approach to sketching Asian IO, this article will begin by surveying the predominantly American interpretation of IW in terms of a number of IW characteristics that should be opened up to critical contrast to Asian ways. The American interpretation of IW will be analyzed in terms of five characteristics: liberal democratic modernization, cyber delinquency, bureaucratic confusion, cyber power, and soft power. Subsequently, via Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a more Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately redescribed as IO. To generalize, an Asian IO approach is ideologically agnostic and unlikely to distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it distinguish strategy from tactics; moreover, it will indulge in subterfuge.\n## Western Approaches to IW: Information Capability via Liberal Democratic Modernization, Cyber Delinquency, Bureaucratic Confusion, and Cyber Power and Soft Power\nFollowing Clausewitzian thought on military strategy, the utility of information in war may be understood to be heavily dependent upon intellectual powers that are up to the task of deploying information adroitly according to constant changes in capabilities and “out of the box” challenges.^{12} Edward Luttwak's treatment of\nChang\n603\nTable I. Contrasts between \"Western\" IW and \"Asian\" IO Approaches.\n|  Dimensions for comparison | Western approaches | Asian approaches  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Governing ideology as basis for information power | Liberal democratic modernization | Ideologically agnostic modernization  |\n|  Order and civil-military distinctions | Distinguishing delinquency in peacetime and offense in wartime; hesitation over questions of legality | Vagary and gray legal, political terrain as an advantage for mounting cyber attack; no peacetime; or wartime distinctions  |\n|  Bureaucracy and chain of command | Clarity of targeted system required to plan attack and/or defense | Targeted systems, as well as friendly systems, may be centralized and opaque so long as attack and defense can be mounted to maximum effect  |\n|  Power | Delineated levels of power application and escalation possible, and advisable | Power can be obscured and chameleonic  |\n|  Martial spirit | Deep penetration to uncover enemy plans, and to disrupt operations either before they commence or when they are underway; concern with legality; seeing the enemy more important than deception | Physical war as last resort; the acme of “fighting” is to defeat the enemy’s plans first, via calculated deception, and through unexpected angles; embrace asymmetry; anonymity; and contagion as advantages  |\nNote. IO = information operations; IW = information warfare.\nstrategy in terms of the conscious use of paradox in military execution illustrates this. Strategy, to Luttwak, is always an exercise in selecting information to maximize one's purpose, but this in turn requires factoring in the unexpected as undertaken by one's equally breathing and thinking adversary.¹³ As more scholars attempt to keep up with the \"information revolution\" associated with the penetration of computers into business networking and consumer lifestyles, it is to be expected that international relations and security in \"the digital age\" remains an underexplored area.¹⁴ Part of the problem lies in the lack of communication between disciplines and, worse, between different frequencies within the same subfield of a discipline. Such is the problem with treating information as part of strategy. Information is critical to all domains of knowledge inquiry.\n## Assumptions of Superiority in Advanced Liberal Democratic Modernization\nTaking these complexities to heart, an early groundbreaking work in the study of IW was grandiosely titled *In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information*\nAge. The editors and lead authors, John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, chose the metaphor of the Greek Goddess Athena over Mars, the God of War, for the reason that Athena stood for the superior use of information as knowledge to civilize people; moreover, she embodied the virtues of Athenian government, especially democracy. One can see how such a conception also perfectly mirrors the primary mission of American foreign policy. This liberal democratic influence, married to a technological vision of modernization, is carried further in Arquilla and Ronfeldt's choice of authors for their Foreword, Alvin and Heidi Toffler. The Tofflers are well known for their futurism studies, as well as their thesis about the three waves of technological civilization. The first wave concerned the agricultural revolution whereby certain peoples organized government and economy to systematically exploit natural food sources for sustaining human life. The second wave witnessed the application of electromechanical principles to provide inanimate sources of energy for human industry. The third wave enabled humanity to manipulate scientific principles to create whole new energy sources and even life forms. This made the \"Revolution in Military Affairs” (RMA) possible by the late twentieth century. To the Tofflers, the implications of the RMA would be on par with those generated by microbiological technology, genetics and cloning, and nuclear physics. Knowledge “has moved from a peripheral to a central position where ideas, innovation, values, imagination, symbols and imagery, not just computer data, play more and more important roles.”\nWhereas in the past, information in military strategy referred to morale, leadership, courage, and strategic insight, in today's terms, intangible information also includes “what is inside our databanks as well as the skulls of our soldiers. They include the power of software, the ability to blindside an opponent's information technology, the superiority of information collection and dissemination, the compatibility of information-enhancing tools, and much more.” This was framed by the Tofflers' reading that “America is the source of the most stunning knowledge-enhancing technologies, and most of its workforce is engaged in one or another form of knowledge work ... Nevertheless, the United States still has a residual sector of the economy based on low-skill muscle-work. And the US military reflects a similar duality.” The Tofflers acknowledge that while the United States currently possesses “some very big ‘media howitzers' that nobody else has” in the form of Hollywood and CNN:“ ... any idea that the US government or its military should attempt to rationalize or to impose broad controls on the US media in the interest of a coherent information warfare doctrine is anachronistic and counterproductive. The further a country advances toward Third Wave economic and social systems, the less likely central censorship or control will work. Third Wave economies thrive on open ideas and information systems, the irrepressible Internet being the most obvious example.”\nFreedom of information flow should theoretically lead to the unleashing of the ideological power of “open society” and “open government” as concepts. Woven\nthrough the writings of the Tofflers, David Gompert, and other narratives within Athena's Camp is a derogatory attitude toward authoritarian states such as China, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba, the erstwhile USSR, and even Singapore.\nAt the time of writing, the latest evangelizer of Internet freedom is Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister and founder of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders). On one hand, he claims clinically that technology is not necessarily predestined to support or yield liberty but in the case of the Internet, the precedents of its use have opened up the possibilities of a struggle:“Yet, all the same, the distortions [of Internet usage] are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most fantastic means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed peoples, who have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the Internet provides power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can be disseminated worldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult to hide a public demonstration, an act of repression or a violation of human rights.In authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion and civil society. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.”\nA battle is continually being waged to harness the Internet in the service of either authoritarian politics or its liberal protagonists, but one that liberals ought to win, in Kouchner's view. The first wave of the Arab Spring Revolutions of 2010--2012 have borne out Kouchner's predictions, but the ongoing bittersweet postscript in Egypt and Libya have dulled popular expectations that “Facebook revolutions” can be sustained in their political gains. These contradictory trends mean that IW will be inevitably politicized according to some of these “default, western” ideological assumptions. In fact, the link between liberal democracy and IW actually inhibits further exploration of IW as a comprehensive strategy since it limits debate and exploration to the uses liberal democracies make of it. The recent practices of undeclared IW by Russia and China, and some purport North Korea and Iran as well, undermine the liberal claims to the IW discourse. It is a mistake for IW thinkers to assume there is a preferential kinship between IW and any particular ideology.\n### IW's Roots in Cyber Delinquency\nCyber delinquency is a very recent label used to categorize criminal activities produced directly through the Internet. Yet, like the presumed linkage between liberalism and IW, this deserves unpacking. As a source of information, the Internet was designed for accessibility by its myriad contributors. Yet, in the twenty years since its public debut, it has been treated by many observers as an evolving “jungle” of abuse and source of harm to “innocent” democratically faithful users. Most\nnational legislation on computer crimes takes aim at persons who attempt unauthorized access to databases and other sites on the Internet. If “breaking and entering” without consent is criminal in the terrestrial world, it appears that cyberspace has taken on earthly characteristics, especially when observers and governments debate the prospect of governance of the Internet. Interestingly, the phrase “computer hacker,” or simply “hacker” has taken on the connotation of a night robber who forces his way into the inner sanctum of a home or office and steals its valuable contents. This is an unproblematic assumption from the perspective of law enforcement officials, but misses an important feature of the Internet era society according to a prominent scholar of the Internet, Manuel Castells.\nCastells argues that the so-called culture of freedom embedded in the Internet depends upon the interplay of roles between four virtual cultures arising from online interaction: “These cultural layers are hierarchically disposed: the techno-meritocratic culture becomes specified as a hacker culture by building rules and customs into networks of cooperation aimed at technological projects. The virtual communitarian culture adds a social dimension to technological sharing, by making the Internet a medium of selective social interaction and symbolic belonging. The entrepreneurial culture works on top of the hacker culture, and on the communitarian culture, to diffuse Internet practices in all domains of society by way of moneymaking. Without the techno-meritocratic culture, hackers would simply be a specific countercultural community of geeks and nerds.” Richard Power, one of the first observers of Internet security to author a book on digital crime, echoes his view. In his many visits to and interviews with cybersecurity analysts, Power observes that hacking begins with a deep-seated curiosity about computer systems. How capable is a computer, a software, or a particular database unless it is tested? Furthermore, as Power's research indicates, curiosity is bound up with professional desire to prove one's competence in discovering the vulnerabilities of connected computers, as well as in savoring an ego trip toward becoming the “master of online access.” These ambitions might also lead computer hackers to embrace a highly presumptuous, and even delusional, form of social heroism endeavoring to protect the ordinary user from rapacious corporations and governments. Power goes so far as to distinguish the hacker from the virus writer.\nThere is a great deal of intelligence and skill coupled to social and political potential in cyberspace crimes. Between 1997 and 2000, roughly coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the advent of the Internet, the top four criminal activities online were, in descending order of importance: virus attacks, insider abuse of web access, unauthorized access to databases by insiders, and denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. By 2009--2010, the US government reported that these categories appeared to have diminished in volume, and the new top four categories were “non-delivery of payment or merchandise,” Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)-related scams such as impersonating the Bureau online, “identity theft” and “computer crimes.” Since 1997, the US Department of Justice and the FBI have become more refined in their data capture. But it is also significant that between 2008 and 2009, there was a 22.3\npercent jump in Internet crimes complaints. The 2010 Internet Crime Report reiterated the pervasiveness of Internet crime. After 2010, both American agencies have discontinued annual Internet Crime Reports, preferring instead to issue periodic and crime-specific alerts. These criminal activities suggest that the Internet has evolved in tandem with real-world human nature to enable the extension of offline crimes into online activities. One could of course go on and cite the quality and intensity of cyberspace fraud that ranges from the disgruntled employee who attacks his own corporation, to the frequency of curiosity-driven sabotage of telecommunications companies, as well as the first widespread DDOS attacks against Yahoo, eBay, CNN, and Amazon.com in 2000. But this is, if Castells, Power, and other scholars are to be taken seriously, intrinsic to the human side of the web. Just as human enlightenment is to be expanded through the Internet and its applications, human beings can likewise use it to inflict pain and destruction. These predicaments are little different from those arising from the abuse of public spaces for hate crimes or supplying energy utilities at inflated rates to fleece consumers within a nation-state.\nHence, one cannot assume that cyber delinquency is simply just that—crime. Internet-based delinquency affords multiple new arenas for trials of strength among persons participating in and building an information society. Whenever authorities investigate “hacktivism,” the more enlightened among them often spot an opportunity to turn the perpetrator around toward new online uses that harmonize with pre-existing political interests. It is not surprising that, just as in espionage, governments rarely advertise the fact that online saboteurs can just as easily be turned to the service of covert national missions against real and imagined enemies. Alexander Klimburg has highlighted the roles of “Patriot Hackers” in the Chinese and Russian cyberwar “armies.” Most books on IW or cyberwar often use the commanding verb “imagine” to introduce the discussions of what hackers and virus creators could do if they penetrated international boundaries online. The world's first interstate cyberwar nearly broke out in tandem with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s military intervention in Kosovo in 1999. What eventually happened was a series of localized skirmishes between anti-Serb and pro-Serb Internet users employing propaganda e-mails and website postings. The US government hesitated before unleashing its cyber attack on Serbian banks, government and military systems to coincide with the physical aerial bombing campaign on the grounds of self-restraint. The US Department of Defense (US DoD) had concluded that IW against Serbia might invoke charges from third parties, as well as Serbians, that the Americans had willfully committed war crimes and other violations against United States and international law on cybercrimes. Additionally, it was reported that Serbian military computer systems were too dispersed, and had the Serbs attacked first, the chances of accurately verifying the sources of those attacks would be low. The unofficial revelations in June 2012 of President Obama's green light for preemptive cyber attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities suggest that the United States may have revised its doctrinal treatment of cyberwar as cyber delinquency. Of course,\nas it was widely reported in 1999, when NATO aircraft accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as part of their campaign, Chinese netizens behaved in an uninhibited fashion to send streams of spam into American mailboxes. By the time the next major Sino--American military incident occurred in April 2001, over the mid-air collision between a Chinese jet fighter and a US reconnaissance plane, Chinese hackers “unilaterally” defaced several US government sites. This coincided with the appearance of a number of smart viruses originating from Chinese users. Furthermore, the silence from Beijing regarding these actions hinted at the growing sophistication of its IW doctrine. Henceforth, any strategic doctrine should pay heed to the implications of the fungibility of cyber delinquency for defense purposes.\n### E-promise, Bureaucratic Confusion\nWhen the conceptual promise of “E-government” was derived with the advent of the Internet, the clarion call from information age gurus and journalists was to speed up, open up, and render government ever more transparent and responsive to its clients—the public at large. An Economist commentary in 2000 suggested that if web retailers and Internet service providers set the benchmark for virtual services, consumers would definitely not put up with “slum standards in the public sector.” The reason why governments have traditionally been slow to respond to public demands is due to the need to coordinate action across multiple agencies and to verify identities and other stored information about the citizenry. In tandem with this information-rich development, the public sector organization has been “problematized” as a rich target for IW.\nChristopher Paul, in scrutinizing the US government's predicament, observes that “the novelty of IO [Information Operations] was a combination of the recognition of the information age importance and vulnerability of adversary (and friendly) information and information systems, plus a desire for a coordinated, integrated approach to attacking and defending those data and systems.” This bureaucratic feature of IO implies that strengths and weaknesses are interchangeable. There is also the implication that organizations are only as strong as the weakest link in their chain of command. The idea of the bureaucracy as a system simply means that pulverizing a linchpin of it can trigger its wholesale collapse.\nIn the mostly American dominated literature on IW, there have been a number of books and articles that critically analyze the problems with defining mission foci among a number of overlapping governmental agencies tasked with prosecuting IW, and with identifying vulnerabilities in target organizations for IW. Walter Jajko's “Critical Commentary on the Department of Defense Authorities for Information Operations” published ten years ago in the journal Comparative Strategy called attention to the bureaucratic weaknesses in the American effort. While most of Jajko's piece deals with the specifics of US organizational tasking, some highlights are worth noting here to facilitate the discussion of the Asian supplement to IW theorizing. Jajko argued that the definitional vagary of IW, or IO, could potentially hamper governmental coordination but praised the US DoD for adopting an all-inclusive definition that could encompass\ncivilian activities as well as provide direction at the national level: “actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems, while defending one's own information and information systems.” Yet, he goes on to lament that while the US DoD provides some guidance on offensive and defensive IW doctrines, there is no presidential directive for doing so on a national level. This was somewhat addressed by a secret presidential directive signed by the Obama Administration in mid-2009 creating a White House office for a “Cyberczar” as well as a corresponding Pentagon-housed military command for cyberspace. Nevertheless, Jajko labels the reversibility of information/Internet dependence and accessibility a vulnerability for military planners.\nTraditional service cultures within the Army, Navy, and Air Force also tended to treat IO as “adjunct operations” supporting physical missions in their respective domains of land, sea, and air. Furthermore, IW doctrine is pursued only according to each service's intrinsic interpretations. Moreover, there is, attending to each service interpretation, the lack of clarity over whether to target strictly military enemies, or whether there should be any operational distinction between actual and potential enemies. US DoD guidelines up till 2002 were analyzed as being open-ended and vague in implying that peacetime, precrisis offensive IO could well prove useful to war planning and may be conducted “inside and outside of the traditional battlespace to shape it and prepare the way for future operations.” As of 2013, it remains unclear if any of these issues have been addressed institutionally by the three US armed services, but Jajko's commentary deserves its place as a form of “pre-theorizing” of IW as bureaucratic streamlining.\nBooks by Christopher Paul and Alexander, Kott et al. not only echo Jajko's analyses, but also go on to address the possibilities of targeting the adversary's precise organizational decision-making processes and chain of command. Yet, as the contributors to Kott et al. note “the challenge is that most of the time we cannot observe the elements of the structures in the organization. Instead, we can obtain the intelligence due to the actions and activities of the organization.” The thrust of the various contributors to Kott et al.'s volume is that traditional modes of intelligence operations, under familiar labels such as penetrating the enemy's operations security, planting moles, playing deception through PSYOPS, and the accumulation of open-source political intelligence are all essential to displacing the many weak links in the adversary's bureaucratic decision-making process. Paul appreciates that these penetration efforts represent strategy at work but warns that IO straddle the black, the white, and the gray, implying that PSYOPS involve deploying untruths and half-truths, and hence should be used sparingly. In these ways, American scholars point to a fundamental problem in any information-reliant and complex governing environment: how should IW become a multipronged and nimble information operation?\n### Cyber Power for IW\nThe promise of Internet-enabled long range computer attacks has spurred fevered imaginations to propose the integrated concept of national cyber power. Alex\nKlimburg has defined cyber power in three dimensions: policy coordination across government in the manner sketched in the preceding subsection; coherence of policy across a nation-state's participation in international organizations and legal regimes; and the cooperation of nonstate actors in a national mission.^{44} This is a laudable policy recommendation for making strategy, but it is also a rear view perspective analogous to speculating the size of air force arsenals, chemical, and biological weapons in the manner of foot soldiers, armored personnel carriers, and combat ships. There is scant attention toward the subtleties of force, and impact multiplication, arising from any physically miniscule form of power. The power of computer analysts armed with skills for hacking, and capabilities for code breaking and cipher alteration through mathematical speculation, cannot be quantified. Yet another set of complementary perspectives is fronted by the writings of Adam Liff, Dale Peterson, and Thomas Rid. Liff tried very hard in his 2012 article to stimulate analysis of cyberwar along the premise of Bernard Brodie's^{45} post-1945 speculation upon the impact of atomic weapons on war. Liff contends that cyberwarfare should be understood as the “cost-inducing use of computer network attacks” against an enemy's vital military and civilian infrastructures with coercive intentions.^{46} He claims it is a political bargaining process between two or more actors where costs are decisive in shaping outcomes. This is elaborated by his conjectures upon cyberweapons as the ideal asymmetrical ideal; the difficulty of attributing attacks for certain; cyberweapons as an offensive force multiplier; and the possibility of cyberdeterrence.^{47} Dale Peterson goes further into the mode of specifying cyberweapons in three tiers: simple, moderate level, and complex.^{48} Each of these types correspond to the degree of damage they are intended to inflict, ranging from disruption of normal service, to disablement of specific components of a targeted system, to a thorough transformation by stealth of a targeted industrial system to the extent that the latter is hijacked or programmed to be remotely controlled by the attacker. Peterson goes on to discuss the architecture of an industrial control system and how a cyberweapon can be reverse engineered in tandem with the intricacies of the original design of that system.^{49} Finally, Thomas Rid has proposed that cyber weapons can be “helpfully” employed for “sabotage” campaigns short of the violence associated with outright war.^{50} Such distinctions depend on the ability to draw fine lines between the Clausewitzian conception of war as absolute violence and targeted destruction suited to limited objectives. In pondering cyber power through the rational choice frames of conventional kinetic and nuclear weaponry, these authors are bound by an imperfect hindsight that neglects the possibilities of structural human and philosophical vagaries that may deeply characterize those parts of IW employing cyber means.\n### Soft Power as IW\nA fourth characteristic of the existing literature on IW stems from Joseph Nye's concept of soft power as the ability to get others to want what one wants through voluntary attraction.^{51} In Nye's original formulation, soft power was thought to\nbe important as the new currency of American great power status in a post-Cold War era characterized by economic interdependence and a communications revolution that has shrunk the globe in political terms. Starting with Nye and Owens' article published in 1996 in Foreign Affairs magazine, titled “America's Information Edge,” the idea that American public diplomacy ought to be integrated into a coherent grand strategy of information that connected the dots between Hollywood films, US universities, the US Constitution, US popular culture, civic culture, and America's corporate mastery of the electronic communications market, captured the imagination of governments and think tanks worldwide. Arquilla and Ronfeldt included it in their gamut of tools in preparing the nation for information age threats but elaborated no further as to how soft power could actually assist warfare.\nLeigh Armistead's book, Information Operations: Warfare and the Hard Reality of Soft Power, has at least attempted to persuade the military to embrace the new power currency as a means to deal with the spectrum of post-Cold War “new threats” ranging from rogue states (the then Baathist Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and Myanmar) to rogue nonstate actors, such as separatist groups, exiled groups, and Al Qaeda. To Armistead, the new threats could not be simply bombed out of existence, or neutralized through direct armed occupation; they could only be eliminated through a battle for hearts and minds. Unless carefully redefined, PSYOPS and MILDEC are too crude in the era of globalization since foreign public opinion can verify information credibility through access to Internet sources and satellite-based round-the-clock global news on both television and Internet. Armistead's approach is unhelpful since it takes a kitchen sink approach to strategy, implying information is all important but hardly detailing how it integrates into grand strategy.\nBut as Armistead points out, the invocation of soft power returns the discussion to whether peacetime and wartime distinctions in information strategy are operationally relevant. Presumably, militaries committed to IW or IO need to automatically fold domestic public opinion and private sector entities into a holistic effort. Soft power therefore merits inclusion as a point of reflection because of its civilian face, which is crucial for mitigating armed conflict. Some might also argue that the power of ideas embedded in the structures of knowledge and everyday practice could well constrict a rival's choices, leading toward the achievement of one's goals without ever firing a shot. Should one then consider dismissing IW in its strictest definition in favor of invoking the “magic” of soft power?\nUnfortunately, Nye has himself muddled the soft power component in IO when he recently argued that cyber power was the larger concept encompassing soft power. According to Nye, cyber power refers to the contextual power arising from resources deployable within cyberspace. He then goes on to argue that cyber power can be both hard (e.g. “denial of service attacks,” “government control over companies,” and “bombing of routers and cutting of cables”) and soft (e.g. “public diplomacy campaign,” “setting norms and standards,” and “protests to name and shame cyber providers”). Since cyberspace is an “imperfect [global] commons,” both hard and soft cyber power should be used as appropriate. While governments\nin cyberspace remain the most potent wielders of cyber power, the diffusion of cyber technologies ensure that nonstate actors can increasingly exploit asymmetrical contests to their advantage vis-à-vis governments. But this angle of approach reflects nothing more than Nye's inability to provide a definitive formulation of IO through the lens of soft power—after all, if the power of ideas is paramount in a networked world, why does the United States need to contemplate physical denial as an aspect of exercising cyber power? As many observers have pointed out in the wake of eroding American economic competitiveness in Africa and Latin America vis-à-vis China, and mounting criticism of drone-enabled assassinations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen, soft power through IO needs to deploy social sensitivity in the minds of the proverbial boots on the ground.\n## Asian Strategic Thought on IO\nIn contrast to the aforementioned strands of cyberwarfare thinking, certain Asian theorists and practitioners have not tried to delineate between the physical, the permissible and democratic, and the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. Asian strategic thought has long been viewed as both a complement to and a contrast against western theorizing. But it has been underappreciated in operationally remolding western-originated strategy. Before one proceeds any further in adducing an Asian supplement via a sampled reading of the works of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, the invocation of Asian thinkers must be justified. The thesis of a culturally filtered Asian military revolution must be treated seriously if one is to break out of the mold of treating the West as the only source of military strategy. Peter Lorge has made a compelling case that Asian military strategy cannot be regarded as historically inferior simply because Asia appeared to be laggard in embracing a military revolution characterized by gunpowder, guns, and war-making machines powered by inanimate energy sources. Asian guns were available earlier than the assumed military revolution in Europe; they were not widely deployed simply because the Asian theater and cultural mores of the time militated against their use. But, more importantly, there are some distinct and intriguing parallels between Asian political philosophies that emphasize undoing the enemy's strategies by sowing chaos and the pre-digital western strategic thought of individuals like Machiavelli and Clausewitz. Considering that IOs prior to the advent of the Internet have already been partially treated as a worthy subject, there is every reason to study past wisdom for their bearing on the current information age.\n### Sun Tzu\nAs a cumulative collection of didactic texts on military strategy dating back more than 2,500 years, Sun Tzu's Art of War (Sunzi Bingfa) has captured the imagination of strategic studies scholars beyond China and Japan, even though many scholars believe it to have been inspired by the Sung Dynasty's (tenth to thirteenth centuries)\ndesperate attempt to think their way out of their strategic enclosure by “barbarian powers.” An official translation of the Art of War published by Beijing-based Foreign Languages Press in 1999 describes this work as “representing the quintessence of Chinese military thinking, [and] it summarizes the rich experiences of ancient wars and analyses them from political, economic, social and cultural angles.” Interestingly, these translators also echo the standard culturalist interpretation of Sun Tzu's tract as treating “war as ill-boding and perilous, insisting that the purpose of studying war is to end war.”\nWar is treated as an inherently philosophical enterprise that reflects upon human virtue and cultivation of superior intellect. In Sun Tzu's opening chapter “Making Assessments,” he identifies five fundamental factors of war: moral influence, weather, distance and terrain, command, and doctrine. Of these, his reading of moral influence, cryptically referred to as Dao or “the Way” in Sun Tzu's original parlance, carries particular Daoist and Confucian connotations. Moral influence is “that which causes people to think in line with their sovereign so that they will follow him through every vicissitude, whether to live or to die, without fear of mortal peril.” Information in Sun Tzu's mental framework emerges as a paradigm of correctly investing the energies of the state and its people in harmonized attainment of the national objective through either peace or war. War might be a miscalculation if it ultimately ruins the state and its people, so it must be embarked upon only after in-depth consideration of all its factors, with “moral influence” being the leading one. The general ought also to be skilled in balancing the seemingly contradictory values of compassion for his soldiers with courage in battle. Boldness should not be confused with recklessness. Calculating information is also critical to treating war as a game of deception: “feign incapability when in fact capable; feign inactivity when ready to strike; appear to be far away when actually nearby, and vice versa. When the enemy is greedy for gains, hand out a bait to lure him; when he is in disorder, attack and overcome him ... if he is given to anger, provoke him.” In Chapter 3 “Attacking by Stratagem,” Sun Tzu counsels that “to fight a hundred battles and win each and every one of them is not the wisest thing to do. To break the enemy's resistance without fighting is.”\nInsofar as Sun Tzu speaks directly to IW in our time, his counsel is to read the opportunity costs of waging war correctly, and never end up with greater losses than those envisioned in the opening gambit. Essentially, IW is folded into what we term IO as an art of reading the proverbial “tea leaves” of achieving national goals using the right policy instruments adapted to circumstances.\nLiterally, one should follow the Way of the Dao. Although Sun Tzu does not explicitly address the distinction between peacetime and wartime, there is frequent intimation that the two periods exist on a seamless continuum of preparation for the eventuality of combat. To be victorious in the event of war, one's military must be deployed advantageously, akin to the momentum found in nature: torrential water moving boulders, falcons falling upon hapless prey, and so forth. Because mental preparations must draw on parallels to the forces of nature, and nature in turn\nprivileges harmony among its forces, Sun Tzu denigrates any form of chaos (luan), whether in strategic planning, logistics, failure to treat physical terrain as an ally, or in the absence of unwavering charismatic inspiration of one's troops. Conversely, Sun Tzu extolled the possibilities of sowing luan within one's enemy.\nAs such, Sun Tzu appears to embrace espionage as a lofty form of IO in his time. Here, it is worth quoting in full: “The enlightened sovereign and the capable commander conquer the enemy at every move and achieve successes far surpassing those of ordinary people because they possess ‘foreknowledge.' This ‘foreknowledge' cannot be obtained from ghosts or spirits, nor from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor from astrological calculations. It can only come from men who know the enemy situation.” This is from the Art of War's closing Chapter 13, titled “Using Spies.” Sun Tzu specifies in some detail five types of spy: the native agent, the internal agent, the converted agent, the expendable agent, and the surviving agent. The details need not concern us; all involve the need to penetrate the walls of the enemy's inner sanctums of government and put on a veneer of sincerely empathizing with the enemy, in order to listen in on their most subtle intentions. There is no right or wrong time for espionage—“so delicate and so secretive is espionage that there is nowhere you cannot put it to good use.” In employing spies, the overriding goal of gaining “foreknowledge” must always drive action. Fully deniable cyberspace intrusions are highly necessary if one takes this advice seriously. One, of course, might pose the question as to whether gaining “foreknowledge” does not undercut adherence to the cosmic harmony that the Way promotes in harmonizing interstate relations.\n### Mao Zedong\nMao is easily the second most important Asian military thinker found in war studies syllabi. His stature is partly derived from association with the contemporary postcolonial politics of East Asia. It also stems from the fact that Mao's ideological immersion in Marxism--Leninism was indigenized in the fledgling Chinese Communist Party, followed by constant harassment from “class enemies,” as well as the Japanese during the Pacific War. Mao's brand of armed rural revolutionary war was hatched in the vast and often inhospitable countryside, in mountains, valleys, and secluded areas. He had to appraise the Chinese strategic environment virtually from scratch as a political outsider to the then ruling Guomindang's dominance in the teeming urban population centers. The Chinese Civil War was scripted into a war between the “righteous” have-nots against the “nefarious” haves. In many ways, Mao's thinking on military affairs possessed a do-it-yourself quality, though he was also drawn to ideologies bound to be attractive to the underdog in a revolutionary struggle.\nAs John Shy and Thomas Collier have aptly noted in their survey of the subject of revolutionary war, Mao stands out as one of the rare thinkers postulating that “strategic theory has meaning only in terms of the concrete political, social, and international circumstances at the moment in which theory is being elucidated.” In Mao's\nvision of using flexible means toward achieving one's goals, theory and practice should be conjoined. In this regard, political warfare qua IW qua revolutionary warfare qua armed struggle should be components in a fluid spectrum of means used to attain revolutionary objectives. In his essay, “The Military Problem” written under very difficult physical circumstances, Mao exhorts his comrades to place the party and the masses on a war footing. The latter phrase did not presage a long list of tasks. Mao's thrust was instead to encourage the enemy troops to defect and join the Red Army rank and file, “to intensify political training,” in Mao's translated words. The challenge in his informational strategy was to ensure that despite the relative material poverty of the Red Army, the Guomindang soldiers would find it morally rewarding to join the righteous cause of fighting for revolution against their former masters. The Red Army would thus gain mass through the conversion of the enemy's ranks:“Apart from the role played by the party, the reason the Red Army can sustain itself without collapse in spite of such a poor standard of material life and incessant engagements, is its practice of democracy. The officers do not beat the men; officers and men receive equal treatment; soldiers enjoy freedom of assembly and speech; cumbersome formalities and ceremonies are done away with; and the account books are open to the inspection of all ... They [the captured soldiers] feel that, though in material life they are worse off in the Red Army than in the White [Guomindang] army, spiritually they are liberated. The fact that the same soldier who was not brave in the enemy army yesterday becomes very brave in the Red Army today shows precisely the impact of democracy. The Red Army is like a furnace in which all captured soldiers are melted down and transformed the moment they come over.”\nUnder this rubric, PSYOPS is treated as both substitute and supplement for the strategies of mass and technological augmentation. In this way, Mao has inherited Sun Tzu's precept of executing one's military campaign with the Dao of harmonizing the people and their rulers. This likewise extends into propaganda tasks other than fighting. In Mao's words, proper war fighting should transcend “the purely military viewpoint” and the military “should also shoulder such important tasks as agitating the masses, organizing them, arming them, and helping them to set up revolutionary political power, and even establishing organizations of the Communist Party.” That Mao's undeclared targets are the winning of the populace's “hearts and minds,” and the subversion of the enemy's political command, is obvious in the disproportionate emphasis placed upon informational strategies in his writings. Even when dealing with specific military strategies, his emphasis remains steadfastly fixed upon correctly appraising the terrain and foreknowledge gleaned of the enemy forces. His clarion call is for the flexibility of means to be reconciled with some semblance of centralized command at every level. Mao was set “against fixed operational fronts and positional warfare, and for fluid operational fronts and mobile warfare; against the mere routing of the enemy, and for a war of annihilation;\nagainst the principle of striking with both fists, and for the principle of striking with one fist ... ”^{72}\nMao's concept of People's War essentially converts the asymmetry of the militarily weaker protagonist into unconventional strengths used to defeat the militarily stronger.^{73} Taking account of the enemy tactically means learning where the disaffected majority of the population lives and earns its livelihood. People have to be aroused to rebel against their oppressors. In Cold War vintage vocabulary, Mao envisioned that imperialists and their lackeys tend to gravitate toward the positional control of urban centers and main lines of communication. A successful people's war should therefore convert the countryside with its people and physical resources into a revolutionary force to engulf the exploitative capitalist centers from the countryside. How might this be extrapolated into IO? There is one telling commentary published in the People's Liberation Army Daily on June 25, 1996, which has since been extensively reproduced on the Internet as a sign of Chinese thinking:“A people's war in the context of information warfare is carried out by hundreds of millions of people using open-type modern information systems. Because the traditional mode of industrial production has changed from centralization to dispersion and commercial activities have expanded from urban areas to rural areas, the working method and mode of interaction in the original sense are increasingly information-based. Political mobilization for war must rely on information technology to become effective, for example by generating and distributing political mobilization software via the Internet, sending patriotic e-mail messages, and setting up databases for traditional education. This way, modern technical media can be fully utilized and the openness and diffusion effect of the Internet can be expanded, to help political mobilization exert its subtle influence.In short, the meaning and implications of a people's war have profoundly changed in the information age, and the chance of people taking the initiative and randomly participating in the war has increased. The ethnic signature and geographic mark on an information war are more pronounced and the application of strategies is more secretive and unpredictable.^{74}”\nOne might add that a People's War can in fact take on additional characteristics of anonymity and contagion in the Internet age.^{75} Moreover, the didactic spirit of this passage is a direct twist on the liberal democratic modernization spiel embedded in western IW as espoused for instance by the Tofflers. Finally, one might interpret grand strategic possibilities for an ongoing People's War involving large numbers of Chinese government co-opted college graduates equipped with computer skills tasked to conduct Web-based infiltration and deception across sovereign borders. This might be dubbed an IO sub-strategy of loose unison in the service of a collective national interest. The declared establishment of an American Cybercorps is equally likely to draw on such transnational possibilities of pursuing grand strategy across the World Wide Web, as well as to retaliate against People's War intrusions conducted by rival powers and non-state actors.\nVo Nguyen Giap\nGeneral Giap is often considered the military brain behind the military successes against both French and American forces in the First and Second Indochina wars. His relevance to our discussion falls under the shadow of Mao. While Mao postulated strategy in the light of Chinese geopolitical and ideological circumstances, Giap adapted its execution in a much smaller theater of war against technologically superior enemies. One might also draw a straight line affirming the lineage between Sun Tzu and Giap. Cognizant of Sun Tzu's admonition to the ruler and commander to ensure concord between a people and their government, Giap identified the French imperialist stature after World War II in terms of its “weak point [lying] in the unjust character of his war. As a result, he was internally divided, not supported by the people of his own country, and did not enjoy the sympathy of world opinion.” Furthermore, “his army was strong at the beginning but its fighting spirit was deteriorating.”^{76}\nIn contrast, the Vietnamese revolutionary forces enjoyed the advantage of tapping into a ragtag untested guerrilla army that had tasted independence at the conclusion of the Japanese Occupation; they could also count on the sympathy of newly liberated peoples elsewhere. Based upon such assessments, Giap was willing to join his comrades in strategizing a protracted war to wear down French material strength by deploying the spiritual and symbolic strengths of the Vietnamese. Giap has admitted to spending time in Mao's camps in southern China in the early 1940s, observing and learning from his communist brethren how to fight successfully as the weaker party. From this experience, Giap helped the Party formulate the overlapping concepts of resistance war, anti-imperialist war, and war for national liberation. These slogans were meant to capture the loyalties of as broad a segment of Vietnamese society as possible for an armed and unified anti-French front. This broad coalition would also discursively alienate collaborators and compel Vietnamese with wavering loyalties to take sides in a “just war.”^{77}\nAlong with consolidating the political front, Giap noted that “guerrilla war must multiply. To keep itself in life and to develop, guerrilla warfare necessarily has to develop into mobile warfare. This is a general law.”^{78} Giap subsequently elaborated this guerrilla strategy into a three-stage scenario with: first, the “stage of contention,” second, the “stage of equilibrium;” and third, the “stage of counter-offensive.” In the stage of contention, one's forces were both numerically and materially weaker than the enemy's. Small-scale attacks on enemy outposts and the killing or capturing of a handful of enemy soldiers counted for important political effects. At every turn, guerrillas were expected to trade ground for safety through retreat into the jungles. With time and steadily growing confidence and supplies, hit-and-run attacks would give way to pitched battles with the enemy. Once the base areas had attained a level of security from large-scale harassment by enemy troops, the people's army could then transit from mere guerrilla attacks to concerted regimental and battalion scale campaigns against the enemy.^{79}\nWhat, then, is Giap's contribution to a non-Western reading of IO? Certainly, PSYOPS and other propaganda maneuvers to marshal political loyalties in support of one's cause were crucial to constituting the base for subsequent stages. As a communist, Giap interpreted Marx, Lenin, and Mao correctly in preparing armed struggle through political engineering. His guerrilla pronouncements suggested that the weaker party in a conflict should always bide its time, staging attacks commensurate with its deployable resources at any given point in time to demonstrate the lively presence of opposition. Incrementally, gains achieved through harassment would build momentum toward full-scale assault.^{80} This is especially relevant to the exploitability of Internet-based IO—the simple and random acts of hacking displace the enemy's security systems and its state of tranquility; consequently, when the enemy's information systems prove ever more vulnerable, more decisive DOS attacks, virus injections, and spam waves can be deployed to paralyze him. In this regard, both North Korea and Iran should merit serious study as paradigmatic cases of asymmetrical IO practitioners in the light of their ongoing postures of strategic defiance against a number of great military powers.\n## Conclusion: The Shape of an Asian Perspective to IW—Advocating the Characteristics of Continuity in IO\nYin and Taylor's initial work exploring an Asian approach to IO helpfully focuses attention on existing doctrines employed by China, Taiwan, Japan, and Thailand, but they are pessimistic about the relative backwardness of Asian capabilities.^{81} They assert that Asia will be “playing catch up to the West” for some time to come. Jacqueline Newmyer has even asserted that one should expect to witness a “Revolution in Military Affairs with Chinese Characteristics” as the People's Liberation Army attempts to westernize its IW capabilities.^{82} This article has argued otherwise through a thickly inferred reading of a sample of Asian strategists. While western strategizing for IW has opened up avenues for pondering the time and space complexities inherent in IO, this opening allows scholars and practitioners alike to mine non-Western, and specifically, Asian strategic thought to discover fresh insights into how asymmetrically powerful IO can be if one wishes to look beyond the glamour of high-technology dominance in conceptualizing information as a military weapon.\nFirst, as Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap suggest, there is a premium to be placed upon harmonizing trust between governments and peoples in executing any form of information strategy for defense. There is no specific need for any state to be a liberal democratic high-technology power in order to maximize the potential of information as a military resource. In fact, the Asian thinkers sampled here suggest that some degree of centralized absolutism should be practiced to conduct IW successfully. Asian strategists appear to privilege unity in transmitting political messages, as opposed to the emphasis on putting democratic soft power on an immutable pedestal for foreign consumption. More importantly, Asian thinkers embrace a form of soft power that is mostly internally directed to consolidate one's own domestic military\nfront as an ideological cudgel, enabling one to then summon almost infinite sacrifices in blood and treasure.\nSecond, Asian thinkers appreciate the offensive and defensive utilities of vagary. This addresses the dual nature of cyber delinquency. Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap referred to this as flexibility in fighting with a weaker hand, asserting presence by converting a population, as well as dispatching spies as information seekers. In Sun Tzu's writings, we see the importance of secrecy of foreknowledge mixed with outward guile. For Mao and Giap, flexibility was meant to displace the enemy's comfort zone insofar as the enemy applied premeditated doctrines. The Asian thinkers treated here make little or no distinction between peacetime or wartime activity; politics and its goals dictate the agency, scale, and timing of IO. This has been misinterpreted by Newmyer as a historical phenomenon specific only to the era of China's ancient warring kingdoms.\nThird, the matter of PSYOPS links western thought to its Asian counterpart. Targeting the political minds responsible for determining the central strategic direction of the war, or any political confrontation, is as important as dealing with the technological threat posed by one's adversaries. In the case of Mao and Giap, whom many assume interpreted Sun Tzu for the modern Asian military audience, high technology should not obscure the relative importance of subverting the enemy's confidence. This is a soft target which can always be exploited by a technologically weaker adversary without even resorting to a physical clash of arms.\nUltimately then, people's war for the information age will be no less unpredictable than the Cold War version. IW appears to have borrowed too much from conventional understandings of war fighting. IO is the broader, more important discipline to read or to deflect an enemy without distinguishing between peacetime and wartime. As a sign that Asian IO theory is perhaps gaining traction, the Obama Administration has responded to the exposure of Chinese cyber provocations in February 2013 by avoiding official attribution to Beijing and deflecting calls for straightforward retaliation, instead it is seeking ways to warn the unnamed state-sponsored intruders of the risks of collateral economic and political damages to their interdependent relationship. Chris Johnson of the Central Intelligence Agency neatly summed up the policy predicament on this occasion: “The problem so far is that we have rhetoric, and we have Cyber Command, and not much in between.”\nThe author wishes to thank participants at the first Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College Seminar in 2010 in Singapore for the opportunity to present a preliminary version of this article.

This article ventures an Asian perspective that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. This article will pan out by first critically analyzing the predominantly American interpretation of IW as a set of five characteristics that can be contrasted to an Asian rival. Subsequently, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a generic Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately termed information operations (IO). These Asian IO features will be teased out through a reading of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. An Asian IO approach will not distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it place a premium on liberal democratic ideology as a basis for information superiority.\nWith the advent of cyberspace, information warfare (IW) boggles the military mind with its self-revelation as a weapon of mass disruption. Paralysis, rather than physical destruction, appears to be the outcome. Recent incidents between 2007 and 2013 illustrate the slippery interface between war and peace through the conflation of terrestrial order and disorder, cyberspatial chaos, and the lack of clarity of the source of the attack. In April 2007, the world's first full-scale cyberattack targeted the Republic of Estonia. The cause was publicly speculated by Estonian politicians and public opinion as an offline one: Russian residents in the former Soviet republic were vehemently taking to the streets and media to protest the government's removal of a Soviet era military memorial in the Estonian capital Tallinn. It did not help matters that since Estonia declared “independence” from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, relations between Russia and Estonia had been either stagnant or strained. The attacks occurred in the context of Estonia being the most wired nation-state in Europe, with an estimated 90 percent of all domestic financial transactions being carried out online, and some 70 percent of tax returns being filed through the Internet. The so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks disrupted most “peacetime” economic life in the country and virtually paralyzed the government in Tallinn. Estonian defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo admitted that the hardest part about responding was the inability to verify the source of the attacks:“Some of those countries [e.g. Russia, Moldova, Ukraine] have many more serious problems than cybersecurity and cybercrime legislation. Secondly, sometimes there are only claims that people are acting from those geographic locations. We can't prove that. Like there are safe havens for terrorism—I mean, Afghanistan is one example, Yemen is emerging. We don't know about Nigeria. There are very many more safe havens in cyberspace than in real space.”\nWhat is interesting here is the conventional disorientation within which a government official assesses his country's first cyberwar. The same conundrum about the source of an attack was manipulated by Israel, North Korea, China, Russia, and nonstate groups named Anonymous and LulzSec, between 2007 and 2011 to launch attacks against commercial companies, foreign governments, and political parties on the pretexts of either private or undeclared vendettas. In 2006, the Bush Administration began inserting malware into Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz in order to map its computer vulnerabilities; since 2009, the Obama Administration had followed up with full-scale attacks to slow down the Iranian nuclear effort. Experts dubbed the cyberweapon “Stuxnet.” The United States was fingered as the source of Stuxnet, developed with Israeli collaboration, only after a journalist interviewed unnamed officials willing to leak the story. In August 2012, the computers at Saudi oil company Aramco were struck by a virus that systematically erased data on three-quarters of their databanks, replacing the data with an image of a burning American flag. No oil was spilled, nor burned, in this “attack” but computer experts flown in\nby the Saudis, including those from Symantec, ventured that this virus—dubbed “Shamoon” after a word embedded in its code—was the work of Iranian agents. These experts concluded that the data erasing command within Shamoon, dubbed “Wiper,” clearly imitated another virus named “Flame” that had mysteriously attacked Iranian oil companies right up till May 2012.4 Was Flame therefore a variant and an accessory to Stuxnet, and therefore attributable to Washington's virtual war against Tehran? If the attacking virus was replicated, who was the more culpable electronic combatant: the initiator or the imitator-cum-retaliator? In February 2013, a private web security company, Mandiant, publicly blamed the Chinese army unit 61398, situated in Shanghai, for a spate of cyber vandalism and theft at Google, Microsoft, RSA, and The New York Times, among other American corporations. The Chinese foreign ministry ingenuously countered that their country were equally at the receiving end of cyber attacks from unnamed states.5 The same Chinese spokesperson conveniently omitted any mention of domestic Internet vigilantes, as well as alienated, unemployed, computer literate college graduates within the People's Republic. This article ventures that generating open-ended paralysis and manipulating this vagary behind the source of an attack could well be strategy in itself. This is the core of an Asian prescription for information operations (IO).\nFor starters, some terminological clarification is needed to indicate the maneuverable space within IO in contrast to IW. IW has been treated by its foremost American proponents as a paradigmatic displacement of conventional offline warfighting. But the reasons for such a claim are actually rather weak if one considers non-western approaches to informational components of warfare. For a working definition, this article shall define IW as the use of symbolic resources to penetrate the enemy's secrecy and confidence for the purpose of winning a war on one's own terms. The proximate concept of IO refers to that entire range of symbolic resources straddling both military and civilian spheres that are aimed at achieving national objectives in both peacetime and wartime. These include psychological operations (PSYOPS), military deception (MILDEC), electronic countermeasures warfare, and public diplomacy. IW remains IO's predecessor.\nThe aim of this article is to supply an Asian perspective on IO that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. The appeal of pondering an Asian perspective lies in opening up the military mind to insights from a different civilization with its attendant particularistic philosophies. Civilizations are desirable sources of ideas given the fact that they are accumulations of wisdom and praxis across time and space directed by conscious human endeavor. This human endeavor aspires to distinguish one section of humanity from the rest.6 Attitudes toward understanding IO in all its complexities can therefore be enhanced through interaction with a non-western body of pre-digital wisdom. The deployment of information for strategic uses is in all probability culturally filtered. The agent deploying information to convert or confuse others is exercising a power over the creation of meaning. This is a point reiterated prominently by social constructivists in political science, international relations, and in linguistics.7 It will consequently be argued that an\nAsian way of IO does not try to delineate the physical, the permissible, and democratic elements from the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. This is a call for dialogue with non-western strategy rather than an ideological confrontation. To some extent, the survey produced by James Yin and Philip Taylor of four Asian countries' existing equivalents of IW doctrines and capabilities breaks ground for the current enterprise.^{8} That said, Yin and Taylor have merely described the existing state of operational profiles of Asian IW and imputed an Asian perspective to them. This cannot be adequate since critics might argue that the existing state of Asian IW doctrines are merely adaptations of western models of PSYOPS from the Cold War and later. It is also quite revealing that in 1955, with Cold War insurgencies in East Asia rising to fever pitch, Edward Katzenbach and Gene Hanrahan commented that Mao Zedong's revolutionary appeal among Southeast Asian communists lies in its “monopoly of patience” and its corollary that the strategy of the superior military mind “has very little to do with technological superiority.”^{9} Given space constraints within an article-length reflection, I sample only three Asian strategic thinkers who are prominent in classic strategic studies readers such as Peter Paret's Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age^{10} and other specialist surveys of unconventional warfare:^{11} Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. Omitted are other Asian voices of varying historical and geographical pedigrees. Nonetheless, by examining Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, readers should be able to discern what a more careful consideration of Asian perspectives could yield. Table 1 illustrates the subtle contrasts between Western IW and Asian IO approaches which this article intends to show.\nTaking a foundational approach to sketching Asian IO, this article will begin by surveying the predominantly American interpretation of IW in terms of a number of IW characteristics that should be opened up to critical contrast to Asian ways. The American interpretation of IW will be analyzed in terms of five characteristics: liberal democratic modernization, cyber delinquency, bureaucratic confusion, cyber power, and soft power. Subsequently, via Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a more Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately redescribed as IO. To generalize, an Asian IO approach is ideologically agnostic and unlikely to distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it distinguish strategy from tactics; moreover, it will indulge in subterfuge.\n## Western Approaches to IW: Information Capability via Liberal Democratic Modernization, Cyber Delinquency, Bureaucratic Confusion, and Cyber Power and Soft Power\nFollowing Clausewitzian thought on military strategy, the utility of information in war may be understood to be heavily dependent upon intellectual powers that are up to the task of deploying information adroitly according to constant changes in capabilities and “out of the box” challenges.^{12} Edward Luttwak's treatment of\nChang\n603\nTable I. Contrasts between \"Western\" IW and \"Asian\" IO Approaches.\n|  Dimensions for comparison | Western approaches | Asian approaches  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Governing ideology as basis for information power | Liberal democratic modernization | Ideologically agnostic modernization  |\n|  Order and civil-military distinctions | Distinguishing delinquency in peacetime and offense in wartime; hesitation over questions of legality | Vagary and gray legal, political terrain as an advantage for mounting cyber attack; no peacetime; or wartime distinctions  |\n|  Bureaucracy and chain of command | Clarity of targeted system required to plan attack and/or defense | Targeted systems, as well as friendly systems, may be centralized and opaque so long as attack and defense can be mounted to maximum effect  |\n|  Power | Delineated levels of power application and escalation possible, and advisable | Power can be obscured and chameleonic  |\n|  Martial spirit | Deep penetration to uncover enemy plans, and to disrupt operations either before they commence or when they are underway; concern with legality; seeing the enemy more important than deception | Physical war as last resort; the acme of “fighting” is to defeat the enemy’s plans first, via calculated deception, and through unexpected angles; embrace asymmetry; anonymity; and contagion as advantages  |\nNote. IO = information operations; IW = information warfare.\nstrategy in terms of the conscious use of paradox in military execution illustrates this. Strategy, to Luttwak, is always an exercise in selecting information to maximize one's purpose, but this in turn requires factoring in the unexpected as undertaken by one's equally breathing and thinking adversary.¹³ As more scholars attempt to keep up with the \"information revolution\" associated with the penetration of computers into business networking and consumer lifestyles, it is to be expected that international relations and security in \"the digital age\" remains an underexplored area.¹⁴ Part of the problem lies in the lack of communication between disciplines and, worse, between different frequencies within the same subfield of a discipline. Such is the problem with treating information as part of strategy. Information is critical to all domains of knowledge inquiry.\n## Assumptions of Superiority in Advanced Liberal Democratic Modernization\nTaking these complexities to heart, an early groundbreaking work in the study of IW was grandiosely titled *In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information*\nAge. The editors and lead authors, John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, chose the metaphor of the Greek Goddess Athena over Mars, the God of War, for the reason that Athena stood for the superior use of information as knowledge to civilize people; moreover, she embodied the virtues of Athenian government, especially democracy. One can see how such a conception also perfectly mirrors the primary mission of American foreign policy. This liberal democratic influence, married to a technological vision of modernization, is carried further in Arquilla and Ronfeldt's choice of authors for their Foreword, Alvin and Heidi Toffler. The Tofflers are well known for their futurism studies, as well as their thesis about the three waves of technological civilization. The first wave concerned the agricultural revolution whereby certain peoples organized government and economy to systematically exploit natural food sources for sustaining human life. The second wave witnessed the application of electromechanical principles to provide inanimate sources of energy for human industry. The third wave enabled humanity to manipulate scientific principles to create whole new energy sources and even life forms. This made the \"Revolution in Military Affairs” (RMA) possible by the late twentieth century. To the Tofflers, the implications of the RMA would be on par with those generated by microbiological technology, genetics and cloning, and nuclear physics. Knowledge “has moved from a peripheral to a central position where ideas, innovation, values, imagination, symbols and imagery, not just computer data, play more and more important roles.”\nWhereas in the past, information in military strategy referred to morale, leadership, courage, and strategic insight, in today's terms, intangible information also includes “what is inside our databanks as well as the skulls of our soldiers. They include the power of software, the ability to blindside an opponent's information technology, the superiority of information collection and dissemination, the compatibility of information-enhancing tools, and much more.” This was framed by the Tofflers' reading that “America is the source of the most stunning knowledge-enhancing technologies, and most of its workforce is engaged in one or another form of knowledge work ... Nevertheless, the United States still has a residual sector of the economy based on low-skill muscle-work. And the US military reflects a similar duality.” The Tofflers acknowledge that while the United States currently possesses “some very big ‘media howitzers' that nobody else has” in the form of Hollywood and CNN:“ ... any idea that the US government or its military should attempt to rationalize or to impose broad controls on the US media in the interest of a coherent information warfare doctrine is anachronistic and counterproductive. The further a country advances toward Third Wave economic and social systems, the less likely central censorship or control will work. Third Wave economies thrive on open ideas and information systems, the irrepressible Internet being the most obvious example.”\nFreedom of information flow should theoretically lead to the unleashing of the ideological power of “open society” and “open government” as concepts. Woven\nthrough the writings of the Tofflers, David Gompert, and other narratives within Athena's Camp is a derogatory attitude toward authoritarian states such as China, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba, the erstwhile USSR, and even Singapore.\nAt the time of writing, the latest evangelizer of Internet freedom is Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister and founder of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders). On one hand, he claims clinically that technology is not necessarily predestined to support or yield liberty but in the case of the Internet, the precedents of its use have opened up the possibilities of a struggle:“Yet, all the same, the distortions [of Internet usage] are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most fantastic means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed peoples, who have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the Internet provides power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can be disseminated worldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult to hide a public demonstration, an act of repression or a violation of human rights.In authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion and civil society. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.”\nA battle is continually being waged to harness the Internet in the service of either authoritarian politics or its liberal protagonists, but one that liberals ought to win, in Kouchner's view. The first wave of the Arab Spring Revolutions of 2010--2012 have borne out Kouchner's predictions, but the ongoing bittersweet postscript in Egypt and Libya have dulled popular expectations that “Facebook revolutions” can be sustained in their political gains. These contradictory trends mean that IW will be inevitably politicized according to some of these “default, western” ideological assumptions. In fact, the link between liberal democracy and IW actually inhibits further exploration of IW as a comprehensive strategy since it limits debate and exploration to the uses liberal democracies make of it. The recent practices of undeclared IW by Russia and China, and some purport North Korea and Iran as well, undermine the liberal claims to the IW discourse. It is a mistake for IW thinkers to assume there is a preferential kinship between IW and any particular ideology.\n### IW's Roots in Cyber Delinquency\nCyber delinquency is a very recent label used to categorize criminal activities produced directly through the Internet. Yet, like the presumed linkage between liberalism and IW, this deserves unpacking. As a source of information, the Internet was designed for accessibility by its myriad contributors. Yet, in the twenty years since its public debut, it has been treated by many observers as an evolving “jungle” of abuse and source of harm to “innocent” democratically faithful users. Most\nnational legislation on computer crimes takes aim at persons who attempt unauthorized access to databases and other sites on the Internet. If “breaking and entering” without consent is criminal in the terrestrial world, it appears that cyberspace has taken on earthly characteristics, especially when observers and governments debate the prospect of governance of the Internet. Interestingly, the phrase “computer hacker,” or simply “hacker” has taken on the connotation of a night robber who forces his way into the inner sanctum of a home or office and steals its valuable contents. This is an unproblematic assumption from the perspective of law enforcement officials, but misses an important feature of the Internet era society according to a prominent scholar of the Internet, Manuel Castells.\nCastells argues that the so-called culture of freedom embedded in the Internet depends upon the interplay of roles between four virtual cultures arising from online interaction: “These cultural layers are hierarchically disposed: the techno-meritocratic culture becomes specified as a hacker culture by building rules and customs into networks of cooperation aimed at technological projects. The virtual communitarian culture adds a social dimension to technological sharing, by making the Internet a medium of selective social interaction and symbolic belonging. The entrepreneurial culture works on top of the hacker culture, and on the communitarian culture, to diffuse Internet practices in all domains of society by way of moneymaking. Without the techno-meritocratic culture, hackers would simply be a specific countercultural community of geeks and nerds.” Richard Power, one of the first observers of Internet security to author a book on digital crime, echoes his view. In his many visits to and interviews with cybersecurity analysts, Power observes that hacking begins with a deep-seated curiosity about computer systems. How capable is a computer, a software, or a particular database unless it is tested? Furthermore, as Power's research indicates, curiosity is bound up with professional desire to prove one's competence in discovering the vulnerabilities of connected computers, as well as in savoring an ego trip toward becoming the “master of online access.” These ambitions might also lead computer hackers to embrace a highly presumptuous, and even delusional, form of social heroism endeavoring to protect the ordinary user from rapacious corporations and governments. Power goes so far as to distinguish the hacker from the virus writer.\nThere is a great deal of intelligence and skill coupled to social and political potential in cyberspace crimes. Between 1997 and 2000, roughly coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the advent of the Internet, the top four criminal activities online were, in descending order of importance: virus attacks, insider abuse of web access, unauthorized access to databases by insiders, and denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. By 2009--2010, the US government reported that these categories appeared to have diminished in volume, and the new top four categories were “non-delivery of payment or merchandise,” Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)-related scams such as impersonating the Bureau online, “identity theft” and “computer crimes.” Since 1997, the US Department of Justice and the FBI have become more refined in their data capture. But it is also significant that between 2008 and 2009, there was a 22.3\npercent jump in Internet crimes complaints. The 2010 Internet Crime Report reiterated the pervasiveness of Internet crime. After 2010, both American agencies have discontinued annual Internet Crime Reports, preferring instead to issue periodic and crime-specific alerts. These criminal activities suggest that the Internet has evolved in tandem with real-world human nature to enable the extension of offline crimes into online activities. One could of course go on and cite the quality and intensity of cyberspace fraud that ranges from the disgruntled employee who attacks his own corporation, to the frequency of curiosity-driven sabotage of telecommunications companies, as well as the first widespread DDOS attacks against Yahoo, eBay, CNN, and Amazon.com in 2000. But this is, if Castells, Power, and other scholars are to be taken seriously, intrinsic to the human side of the web. Just as human enlightenment is to be expanded through the Internet and its applications, human beings can likewise use it to inflict pain and destruction. These predicaments are little different from those arising from the abuse of public spaces for hate crimes or supplying energy utilities at inflated rates to fleece consumers within a nation-state.\nHence, one cannot assume that cyber delinquency is simply just that—crime. Internet-based delinquency affords multiple new arenas for trials of strength among persons participating in and building an information society. Whenever authorities investigate “hacktivism,” the more enlightened among them often spot an opportunity to turn the perpetrator around toward new online uses that harmonize with pre-existing political interests. It is not surprising that, just as in espionage, governments rarely advertise the fact that online saboteurs can just as easily be turned to the service of covert national missions against real and imagined enemies. Alexander Klimburg has highlighted the roles of “Patriot Hackers” in the Chinese and Russian cyberwar “armies.” Most books on IW or cyberwar often use the commanding verb “imagine” to introduce the discussions of what hackers and virus creators could do if they penetrated international boundaries online. The world's first interstate cyberwar nearly broke out in tandem with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s military intervention in Kosovo in 1999. What eventually happened was a series of localized skirmishes between anti-Serb and pro-Serb Internet users employing propaganda e-mails and website postings. The US government hesitated before unleashing its cyber attack on Serbian banks, government and military systems to coincide with the physical aerial bombing campaign on the grounds of self-restraint. The US Department of Defense (US DoD) had concluded that IW against Serbia might invoke charges from third parties, as well as Serbians, that the Americans had willfully committed war crimes and other violations against United States and international law on cybercrimes. Additionally, it was reported that Serbian military computer systems were too dispersed, and had the Serbs attacked first, the chances of accurately verifying the sources of those attacks would be low. The unofficial revelations in June 2012 of President Obama's green light for preemptive cyber attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities suggest that the United States may have revised its doctrinal treatment of cyberwar as cyber delinquency. Of course,\nas it was widely reported in 1999, when NATO aircraft accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as part of their campaign, Chinese netizens behaved in an uninhibited fashion to send streams of spam into American mailboxes. By the time the next major Sino--American military incident occurred in April 2001, over the mid-air collision between a Chinese jet fighter and a US reconnaissance plane, Chinese hackers “unilaterally” defaced several US government sites. This coincided with the appearance of a number of smart viruses originating from Chinese users. Furthermore, the silence from Beijing regarding these actions hinted at the growing sophistication of its IW doctrine. Henceforth, any strategic doctrine should pay heed to the implications of the fungibility of cyber delinquency for defense purposes.\n### E-promise, Bureaucratic Confusion\nWhen the conceptual promise of “E-government” was derived with the advent of the Internet, the clarion call from information age gurus and journalists was to speed up, open up, and render government ever more transparent and responsive to its clients—the public at large. An Economist commentary in 2000 suggested that if web retailers and Internet service providers set the benchmark for virtual services, consumers would definitely not put up with “slum standards in the public sector.” The reason why governments have traditionally been slow to respond to public demands is due to the need to coordinate action across multiple agencies and to verify identities and other stored information about the citizenry. In tandem with this information-rich development, the public sector organization has been “problematized” as a rich target for IW.\nChristopher Paul, in scrutinizing the US government's predicament, observes that “the novelty of IO [Information Operations] was a combination of the recognition of the information age importance and vulnerability of adversary (and friendly) information and information systems, plus a desire for a coordinated, integrated approach to attacking and defending those data and systems.” This bureaucratic feature of IO implies that strengths and weaknesses are interchangeable. There is also the implication that organizations are only as strong as the weakest link in their chain of command. The idea of the bureaucracy as a system simply means that pulverizing a linchpin of it can trigger its wholesale collapse.\nIn the mostly American dominated literature on IW, there have been a number of books and articles that critically analyze the problems with defining mission foci among a number of overlapping governmental agencies tasked with prosecuting IW, and with identifying vulnerabilities in target organizations for IW. Walter Jajko's “Critical Commentary on the Department of Defense Authorities for Information Operations” published ten years ago in the journal Comparative Strategy called attention to the bureaucratic weaknesses in the American effort. While most of Jajko's piece deals with the specifics of US organizational tasking, some highlights are worth noting here to facilitate the discussion of the Asian supplement to IW theorizing. Jajko argued that the definitional vagary of IW, or IO, could potentially hamper governmental coordination but praised the US DoD for adopting an all-inclusive definition that could encompass\ncivilian activities as well as provide direction at the national level: “actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems, while defending one's own information and information systems.” Yet, he goes on to lament that while the US DoD provides some guidance on offensive and defensive IW doctrines, there is no presidential directive for doing so on a national level. This was somewhat addressed by a secret presidential directive signed by the Obama Administration in mid-2009 creating a White House office for a “Cyberczar” as well as a corresponding Pentagon-housed military command for cyberspace. Nevertheless, Jajko labels the reversibility of information/Internet dependence and accessibility a vulnerability for military planners.\nTraditional service cultures within the Army, Navy, and Air Force also tended to treat IO as “adjunct operations” supporting physical missions in their respective domains of land, sea, and air. Furthermore, IW doctrine is pursued only according to each service's intrinsic interpretations. Moreover, there is, attending to each service interpretation, the lack of clarity over whether to target strictly military enemies, or whether there should be any operational distinction between actual and potential enemies. US DoD guidelines up till 2002 were analyzed as being open-ended and vague in implying that peacetime, precrisis offensive IO could well prove useful to war planning and may be conducted “inside and outside of the traditional battlespace to shape it and prepare the way for future operations.” As of 2013, it remains unclear if any of these issues have been addressed institutionally by the three US armed services, but Jajko's commentary deserves its place as a form of “pre-theorizing” of IW as bureaucratic streamlining.\nBooks by Christopher Paul and Alexander, Kott et al. not only echo Jajko's analyses, but also go on to address the possibilities of targeting the adversary's precise organizational decision-making processes and chain of command. Yet, as the contributors to Kott et al. note “the challenge is that most of the time we cannot observe the elements of the structures in the organization. Instead, we can obtain the intelligence due to the actions and activities of the organization.” The thrust of the various contributors to Kott et al.'s volume is that traditional modes of intelligence operations, under familiar labels such as penetrating the enemy's operations security, planting moles, playing deception through PSYOPS, and the accumulation of open-source political intelligence are all essential to displacing the many weak links in the adversary's bureaucratic decision-making process. Paul appreciates that these penetration efforts represent strategy at work but warns that IO straddle the black, the white, and the gray, implying that PSYOPS involve deploying untruths and half-truths, and hence should be used sparingly. In these ways, American scholars point to a fundamental problem in any information-reliant and complex governing environment: how should IW become a multipronged and nimble information operation?\n### Cyber Power for IW\nThe promise of Internet-enabled long range computer attacks has spurred fevered imaginations to propose the integrated concept of national cyber power. Alex\nKlimburg has defined cyber power in three dimensions: policy coordination across government in the manner sketched in the preceding subsection; coherence of policy across a nation-state's participation in international organizations and legal regimes; and the cooperation of nonstate actors in a national mission.^{44} This is a laudable policy recommendation for making strategy, but it is also a rear view perspective analogous to speculating the size of air force arsenals, chemical, and biological weapons in the manner of foot soldiers, armored personnel carriers, and combat ships. There is scant attention toward the subtleties of force, and impact multiplication, arising from any physically miniscule form of power. The power of computer analysts armed with skills for hacking, and capabilities for code breaking and cipher alteration through mathematical speculation, cannot be quantified. Yet another set of complementary perspectives is fronted by the writings of Adam Liff, Dale Peterson, and Thomas Rid. Liff tried very hard in his 2012 article to stimulate analysis of cyberwar along the premise of Bernard Brodie's^{45} post-1945 speculation upon the impact of atomic weapons on war. Liff contends that cyberwarfare should be understood as the “cost-inducing use of computer network attacks” against an enemy's vital military and civilian infrastructures with coercive intentions.^{46} He claims it is a political bargaining process between two or more actors where costs are decisive in shaping outcomes. This is elaborated by his conjectures upon cyberweapons as the ideal asymmetrical ideal; the difficulty of attributing attacks for certain; cyberweapons as an offensive force multiplier; and the possibility of cyberdeterrence.^{47} Dale Peterson goes further into the mode of specifying cyberweapons in three tiers: simple, moderate level, and complex.^{48} Each of these types correspond to the degree of damage they are intended to inflict, ranging from disruption of normal service, to disablement of specific components of a targeted system, to a thorough transformation by stealth of a targeted industrial system to the extent that the latter is hijacked or programmed to be remotely controlled by the attacker. Peterson goes on to discuss the architecture of an industrial control system and how a cyberweapon can be reverse engineered in tandem with the intricacies of the original design of that system.^{49} Finally, Thomas Rid has proposed that cyber weapons can be “helpfully” employed for “sabotage” campaigns short of the violence associated with outright war.^{50} Such distinctions depend on the ability to draw fine lines between the Clausewitzian conception of war as absolute violence and targeted destruction suited to limited objectives. In pondering cyber power through the rational choice frames of conventional kinetic and nuclear weaponry, these authors are bound by an imperfect hindsight that neglects the possibilities of structural human and philosophical vagaries that may deeply characterize those parts of IW employing cyber means.\n### Soft Power as IW\nA fourth characteristic of the existing literature on IW stems from Joseph Nye's concept of soft power as the ability to get others to want what one wants through voluntary attraction.^{51} In Nye's original formulation, soft power was thought to\nbe important as the new currency of American great power status in a post-Cold War era characterized by economic interdependence and a communications revolution that has shrunk the globe in political terms. Starting with Nye and Owens' article published in 1996 in Foreign Affairs magazine, titled “America's Information Edge,” the idea that American public diplomacy ought to be integrated into a coherent grand strategy of information that connected the dots between Hollywood films, US universities, the US Constitution, US popular culture, civic culture, and America's corporate mastery of the electronic communications market, captured the imagination of governments and think tanks worldwide. Arquilla and Ronfeldt included it in their gamut of tools in preparing the nation for information age threats but elaborated no further as to how soft power could actually assist warfare.\nLeigh Armistead's book, Information Operations: Warfare and the Hard Reality of Soft Power, has at least attempted to persuade the military to embrace the new power currency as a means to deal with the spectrum of post-Cold War “new threats” ranging from rogue states (the then Baathist Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and Myanmar) to rogue nonstate actors, such as separatist groups, exiled groups, and Al Qaeda. To Armistead, the new threats could not be simply bombed out of existence, or neutralized through direct armed occupation; they could only be eliminated through a battle for hearts and minds. Unless carefully redefined, PSYOPS and MILDEC are too crude in the era of globalization since foreign public opinion can verify information credibility through access to Internet sources and satellite-based round-the-clock global news on both television and Internet. Armistead's approach is unhelpful since it takes a kitchen sink approach to strategy, implying information is all important but hardly detailing how it integrates into grand strategy.\nBut as Armistead points out, the invocation of soft power returns the discussion to whether peacetime and wartime distinctions in information strategy are operationally relevant. Presumably, militaries committed to IW or IO need to automatically fold domestic public opinion and private sector entities into a holistic effort. Soft power therefore merits inclusion as a point of reflection because of its civilian face, which is crucial for mitigating armed conflict. Some might also argue that the power of ideas embedded in the structures of knowledge and everyday practice could well constrict a rival's choices, leading toward the achievement of one's goals without ever firing a shot. Should one then consider dismissing IW in its strictest definition in favor of invoking the “magic” of soft power?\nUnfortunately, Nye has himself muddled the soft power component in IO when he recently argued that cyber power was the larger concept encompassing soft power. According to Nye, cyber power refers to the contextual power arising from resources deployable within cyberspace. He then goes on to argue that cyber power can be both hard (e.g. “denial of service attacks,” “government control over companies,” and “bombing of routers and cutting of cables”) and soft (e.g. “public diplomacy campaign,” “setting norms and standards,” and “protests to name and shame cyber providers”). Since cyberspace is an “imperfect [global] commons,” both hard and soft cyber power should be used as appropriate. While governments\nin cyberspace remain the most potent wielders of cyber power, the diffusion of cyber technologies ensure that nonstate actors can increasingly exploit asymmetrical contests to their advantage vis-à-vis governments. But this angle of approach reflects nothing more than Nye's inability to provide a definitive formulation of IO through the lens of soft power—after all, if the power of ideas is paramount in a networked world, why does the United States need to contemplate physical denial as an aspect of exercising cyber power? As many observers have pointed out in the wake of eroding American economic competitiveness in Africa and Latin America vis-à-vis China, and mounting criticism of drone-enabled assassinations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen, soft power through IO needs to deploy social sensitivity in the minds of the proverbial boots on the ground.\n## Asian Strategic Thought on IO\nIn contrast to the aforementioned strands of cyberwarfare thinking, certain Asian theorists and practitioners have not tried to delineate between the physical, the permissible and democratic, and the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. Asian strategic thought has long been viewed as both a complement to and a contrast against western theorizing. But it has been underappreciated in operationally remolding western-originated strategy. Before one proceeds any further in adducing an Asian supplement via a sampled reading of the works of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, the invocation of Asian thinkers must be justified. The thesis of a culturally filtered Asian military revolution must be treated seriously if one is to break out of the mold of treating the West as the only source of military strategy. Peter Lorge has made a compelling case that Asian military strategy cannot be regarded as historically inferior simply because Asia appeared to be laggard in embracing a military revolution characterized by gunpowder, guns, and war-making machines powered by inanimate energy sources. Asian guns were available earlier than the assumed military revolution in Europe; they were not widely deployed simply because the Asian theater and cultural mores of the time militated against their use. But, more importantly, there are some distinct and intriguing parallels between Asian political philosophies that emphasize undoing the enemy's strategies by sowing chaos and the pre-digital western strategic thought of individuals like Machiavelli and Clausewitz. Considering that IOs prior to the advent of the Internet have already been partially treated as a worthy subject, there is every reason to study past wisdom for their bearing on the current information age.\n### Sun Tzu\nAs a cumulative collection of didactic texts on military strategy dating back more than 2,500 years, Sun Tzu's Art of War (Sunzi Bingfa) has captured the imagination of strategic studies scholars beyond China and Japan, even though many scholars believe it to have been inspired by the Sung Dynasty's (tenth to thirteenth centuries)\ndesperate attempt to think their way out of their strategic enclosure by “barbarian powers.” An official translation of the Art of War published by Beijing-based Foreign Languages Press in 1999 describes this work as “representing the quintessence of Chinese military thinking, [and] it summarizes the rich experiences of ancient wars and analyses them from political, economic, social and cultural angles.” Interestingly, these translators also echo the standard culturalist interpretation of Sun Tzu's tract as treating “war as ill-boding and perilous, insisting that the purpose of studying war is to end war.”\nWar is treated as an inherently philosophical enterprise that reflects upon human virtue and cultivation of superior intellect. In Sun Tzu's opening chapter “Making Assessments,” he identifies five fundamental factors of war: moral influence, weather, distance and terrain, command, and doctrine. Of these, his reading of moral influence, cryptically referred to as Dao or “the Way” in Sun Tzu's original parlance, carries particular Daoist and Confucian connotations. Moral influence is “that which causes people to think in line with their sovereign so that they will follow him through every vicissitude, whether to live or to die, without fear of mortal peril.” Information in Sun Tzu's mental framework emerges as a paradigm of correctly investing the energies of the state and its people in harmonized attainment of the national objective through either peace or war. War might be a miscalculation if it ultimately ruins the state and its people, so it must be embarked upon only after in-depth consideration of all its factors, with “moral influence” being the leading one. The general ought also to be skilled in balancing the seemingly contradictory values of compassion for his soldiers with courage in battle. Boldness should not be confused with recklessness. Calculating information is also critical to treating war as a game of deception: “feign incapability when in fact capable; feign inactivity when ready to strike; appear to be far away when actually nearby, and vice versa. When the enemy is greedy for gains, hand out a bait to lure him; when he is in disorder, attack and overcome him ... if he is given to anger, provoke him.” In Chapter 3 “Attacking by Stratagem,” Sun Tzu counsels that “to fight a hundred battles and win each and every one of them is not the wisest thing to do. To break the enemy's resistance without fighting is.”\nInsofar as Sun Tzu speaks directly to IW in our time, his counsel is to read the opportunity costs of waging war correctly, and never end up with greater losses than those envisioned in the opening gambit. Essentially, IW is folded into what we term IO as an art of reading the proverbial “tea leaves” of achieving national goals using the right policy instruments adapted to circumstances.\nLiterally, one should follow the Way of the Dao. Although Sun Tzu does not explicitly address the distinction between peacetime and wartime, there is frequent intimation that the two periods exist on a seamless continuum of preparation for the eventuality of combat. To be victorious in the event of war, one's military must be deployed advantageously, akin to the momentum found in nature: torrential water moving boulders, falcons falling upon hapless prey, and so forth. Because mental preparations must draw on parallels to the forces of nature, and nature in turn\nprivileges harmony among its forces, Sun Tzu denigrates any form of chaos (luan), whether in strategic planning, logistics, failure to treat physical terrain as an ally, or in the absence of unwavering charismatic inspiration of one's troops. Conversely, Sun Tzu extolled the possibilities of sowing luan within one's enemy.\nAs such, Sun Tzu appears to embrace espionage as a lofty form of IO in his time. Here, it is worth quoting in full: “The enlightened sovereign and the capable commander conquer the enemy at every move and achieve successes far surpassing those of ordinary people because they possess ‘foreknowledge.' This ‘foreknowledge' cannot be obtained from ghosts or spirits, nor from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor from astrological calculations. It can only come from men who know the enemy situation.” This is from the Art of War's closing Chapter 13, titled “Using Spies.” Sun Tzu specifies in some detail five types of spy: the native agent, the internal agent, the converted agent, the expendable agent, and the surviving agent. The details need not concern us; all involve the need to penetrate the walls of the enemy's inner sanctums of government and put on a veneer of sincerely empathizing with the enemy, in order to listen in on their most subtle intentions. There is no right or wrong time for espionage—“so delicate and so secretive is espionage that there is nowhere you cannot put it to good use.” In employing spies, the overriding goal of gaining “foreknowledge” must always drive action. Fully deniable cyberspace intrusions are highly necessary if one takes this advice seriously. One, of course, might pose the question as to whether gaining “foreknowledge” does not undercut adherence to the cosmic harmony that the Way promotes in harmonizing interstate relations.\n### Mao Zedong\nMao is easily the second most important Asian military thinker found in war studies syllabi. His stature is partly derived from association with the contemporary postcolonial politics of East Asia. It also stems from the fact that Mao's ideological immersion in Marxism--Leninism was indigenized in the fledgling Chinese Communist Party, followed by constant harassment from “class enemies,” as well as the Japanese during the Pacific War. Mao's brand of armed rural revolutionary war was hatched in the vast and often inhospitable countryside, in mountains, valleys, and secluded areas. He had to appraise the Chinese strategic environment virtually from scratch as a political outsider to the then ruling Guomindang's dominance in the teeming urban population centers. The Chinese Civil War was scripted into a war between the “righteous” have-nots against the “nefarious” haves. In many ways, Mao's thinking on military affairs possessed a do-it-yourself quality, though he was also drawn to ideologies bound to be attractive to the underdog in a revolutionary struggle.\nAs John Shy and Thomas Collier have aptly noted in their survey of the subject of revolutionary war, Mao stands out as one of the rare thinkers postulating that “strategic theory has meaning only in terms of the concrete political, social, and international circumstances at the moment in which theory is being elucidated.” In Mao's\nvision of using flexible means toward achieving one's goals, theory and practice should be conjoined. In this regard, political warfare qua IW qua revolutionary warfare qua armed struggle should be components in a fluid spectrum of means used to attain revolutionary objectives. In his essay, “The Military Problem” written under very difficult physical circumstances, Mao exhorts his comrades to place the party and the masses on a war footing. The latter phrase did not presage a long list of tasks. Mao's thrust was instead to encourage the enemy troops to defect and join the Red Army rank and file, “to intensify political training,” in Mao's translated words. The challenge in his informational strategy was to ensure that despite the relative material poverty of the Red Army, the Guomindang soldiers would find it morally rewarding to join the righteous cause of fighting for revolution against their former masters. The Red Army would thus gain mass through the conversion of the enemy's ranks:“Apart from the role played by the party, the reason the Red Army can sustain itself without collapse in spite of such a poor standard of material life and incessant engagements, is its practice of democracy. The officers do not beat the men; officers and men receive equal treatment; soldiers enjoy freedom of assembly and speech; cumbersome formalities and ceremonies are done away with; and the account books are open to the inspection of all ... They [the captured soldiers] feel that, though in material life they are worse off in the Red Army than in the White [Guomindang] army, spiritually they are liberated. The fact that the same soldier who was not brave in the enemy army yesterday becomes very brave in the Red Army today shows precisely the impact of democracy. The Red Army is like a furnace in which all captured soldiers are melted down and transformed the moment they come over.”\nUnder this rubric, PSYOPS is treated as both substitute and supplement for the strategies of mass and technological augmentation. In this way, Mao has inherited Sun Tzu's precept of executing one's military campaign with the Dao of harmonizing the people and their rulers. This likewise extends into propaganda tasks other than fighting. In Mao's words, proper war fighting should transcend “the purely military viewpoint” and the military “should also shoulder such important tasks as agitating the masses, organizing them, arming them, and helping them to set up revolutionary political power, and even establishing organizations of the Communist Party.” That Mao's undeclared targets are the winning of the populace's “hearts and minds,” and the subversion of the enemy's political command, is obvious in the disproportionate emphasis placed upon informational strategies in his writings. Even when dealing with specific military strategies, his emphasis remains steadfastly fixed upon correctly appraising the terrain and foreknowledge gleaned of the enemy forces. His clarion call is for the flexibility of means to be reconciled with some semblance of centralized command at every level. Mao was set “against fixed operational fronts and positional warfare, and for fluid operational fronts and mobile warfare; against the mere routing of the enemy, and for a war of annihilation;\nagainst the principle of striking with both fists, and for the principle of striking with one fist ... ”^{72}\nMao's concept of People's War essentially converts the asymmetry of the militarily weaker protagonist into unconventional strengths used to defeat the militarily stronger.^{73} Taking account of the enemy tactically means learning where the disaffected majority of the population lives and earns its livelihood. People have to be aroused to rebel against their oppressors. In Cold War vintage vocabulary, Mao envisioned that imperialists and their lackeys tend to gravitate toward the positional control of urban centers and main lines of communication. A successful people's war should therefore convert the countryside with its people and physical resources into a revolutionary force to engulf the exploitative capitalist centers from the countryside. How might this be extrapolated into IO? There is one telling commentary published in the People's Liberation Army Daily on June 25, 1996, which has since been extensively reproduced on the Internet as a sign of Chinese thinking:“A people's war in the context of information warfare is carried out by hundreds of millions of people using open-type modern information systems. Because the traditional mode of industrial production has changed from centralization to dispersion and commercial activities have expanded from urban areas to rural areas, the working method and mode of interaction in the original sense are increasingly information-based. Political mobilization for war must rely on information technology to become effective, for example by generating and distributing political mobilization software via the Internet, sending patriotic e-mail messages, and setting up databases for traditional education. This way, modern technical media can be fully utilized and the openness and diffusion effect of the Internet can be expanded, to help political mobilization exert its subtle influence.In short, the meaning and implications of a people's war have profoundly changed in the information age, and the chance of people taking the initiative and randomly participating in the war has increased. The ethnic signature and geographic mark on an information war are more pronounced and the application of strategies is more secretive and unpredictable.^{74}”\nOne might add that a People's War can in fact take on additional characteristics of anonymity and contagion in the Internet age.^{75} Moreover, the didactic spirit of this passage is a direct twist on the liberal democratic modernization spiel embedded in western IW as espoused for instance by the Tofflers. Finally, one might interpret grand strategic possibilities for an ongoing People's War involving large numbers of Chinese government co-opted college graduates equipped with computer skills tasked to conduct Web-based infiltration and deception across sovereign borders. This might be dubbed an IO sub-strategy of loose unison in the service of a collective national interest. The declared establishment of an American Cybercorps is equally likely to draw on such transnational possibilities of pursuing grand strategy across the World Wide Web, as well as to retaliate against People's War intrusions conducted by rival powers and non-state actors.\nVo Nguyen Giap\nGeneral Giap is often considered the military brain behind the military successes against both French and American forces in the First and Second Indochina wars. His relevance to our discussion falls under the shadow of Mao. While Mao postulated strategy in the light of Chinese geopolitical and ideological circumstances, Giap adapted its execution in a much smaller theater of war against technologically superior enemies. One might also draw a straight line affirming the lineage between Sun Tzu and Giap. Cognizant of Sun Tzu's admonition to the ruler and commander to ensure concord between a people and their government, Giap identified the French imperialist stature after World War II in terms of its “weak point [lying] in the unjust character of his war. As a result, he was internally divided, not supported by the people of his own country, and did not enjoy the sympathy of world opinion.” Furthermore, “his army was strong at the beginning but its fighting spirit was deteriorating.”^{76}\nIn contrast, the Vietnamese revolutionary forces enjoyed the advantage of tapping into a ragtag untested guerrilla army that had tasted independence at the conclusion of the Japanese Occupation; they could also count on the sympathy of newly liberated peoples elsewhere. Based upon such assessments, Giap was willing to join his comrades in strategizing a protracted war to wear down French material strength by deploying the spiritual and symbolic strengths of the Vietnamese. Giap has admitted to spending time in Mao's camps in southern China in the early 1940s, observing and learning from his communist brethren how to fight successfully as the weaker party. From this experience, Giap helped the Party formulate the overlapping concepts of resistance war, anti-imperialist war, and war for national liberation. These slogans were meant to capture the loyalties of as broad a segment of Vietnamese society as possible for an armed and unified anti-French front. This broad coalition would also discursively alienate collaborators and compel Vietnamese with wavering loyalties to take sides in a “just war.”^{77}\nAlong with consolidating the political front, Giap noted that “guerrilla war must multiply. To keep itself in life and to develop, guerrilla warfare necessarily has to develop into mobile warfare. This is a general law.”^{78} Giap subsequently elaborated this guerrilla strategy into a three-stage scenario with: first, the “stage of contention,” second, the “stage of equilibrium;” and third, the “stage of counter-offensive.” In the stage of contention, one's forces were both numerically and materially weaker than the enemy's. Small-scale attacks on enemy outposts and the killing or capturing of a handful of enemy soldiers counted for important political effects. At every turn, guerrillas were expected to trade ground for safety through retreat into the jungles. With time and steadily growing confidence and supplies, hit-and-run attacks would give way to pitched battles with the enemy. Once the base areas had attained a level of security from large-scale harassment by enemy troops, the people's army could then transit from mere guerrilla attacks to concerted regimental and battalion scale campaigns against the enemy.^{79}\nWhat, then, is Giap's contribution to a non-Western reading of IO? Certainly, PSYOPS and other propaganda maneuvers to marshal political loyalties in support of one's cause were crucial to constituting the base for subsequent stages. As a communist, Giap interpreted Marx, Lenin, and Mao correctly in preparing armed struggle through political engineering. His guerrilla pronouncements suggested that the weaker party in a conflict should always bide its time, staging attacks commensurate with its deployable resources at any given point in time to demonstrate the lively presence of opposition. Incrementally, gains achieved through harassment would build momentum toward full-scale assault.^{80} This is especially relevant to the exploitability of Internet-based IO—the simple and random acts of hacking displace the enemy's security systems and its state of tranquility; consequently, when the enemy's information systems prove ever more vulnerable, more decisive DOS attacks, virus injections, and spam waves can be deployed to paralyze him. In this regard, both North Korea and Iran should merit serious study as paradigmatic cases of asymmetrical IO practitioners in the light of their ongoing postures of strategic defiance against a number of great military powers.\n## Conclusion: The Shape of an Asian Perspective to IW—Advocating the Characteristics of Continuity in IO\nYin and Taylor's initial work exploring an Asian approach to IO helpfully focuses attention on existing doctrines employed by China, Taiwan, Japan, and Thailand, but they are pessimistic about the relative backwardness of Asian capabilities.^{81} They assert that Asia will be “playing catch up to the West” for some time to come. Jacqueline Newmyer has even asserted that one should expect to witness a “Revolution in Military Affairs with Chinese Characteristics” as the People's Liberation Army attempts to westernize its IW capabilities.^{82} This article has argued otherwise through a thickly inferred reading of a sample of Asian strategists. While western strategizing for IW has opened up avenues for pondering the time and space complexities inherent in IO, this opening allows scholars and practitioners alike to mine non-Western, and specifically, Asian strategic thought to discover fresh insights into how asymmetrically powerful IO can be if one wishes to look beyond the glamour of high-technology dominance in conceptualizing information as a military weapon.\nFirst, as Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap suggest, there is a premium to be placed upon harmonizing trust between governments and peoples in executing any form of information strategy for defense. There is no specific need for any state to be a liberal democratic high-technology power in order to maximize the potential of information as a military resource. In fact, the Asian thinkers sampled here suggest that some degree of centralized absolutism should be practiced to conduct IW successfully. Asian strategists appear to privilege unity in transmitting political messages, as opposed to the emphasis on putting democratic soft power on an immutable pedestal for foreign consumption. More importantly, Asian thinkers embrace a form of soft power that is mostly internally directed to consolidate one's own domestic military\nfront as an ideological cudgel, enabling one to then summon almost infinite sacrifices in blood and treasure.\nSecond, Asian thinkers appreciate the offensive and defensive utilities of vagary. This addresses the dual nature of cyber delinquency. Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap referred to this as flexibility in fighting with a weaker hand, asserting presence by converting a population, as well as dispatching spies as information seekers. In Sun Tzu's writings, we see the importance of secrecy of foreknowledge mixed with outward guile. For Mao and Giap, flexibility was meant to displace the enemy's comfort zone insofar as the enemy applied premeditated doctrines. The Asian thinkers treated here make little or no distinction between peacetime or wartime activity; politics and its goals dictate the agency, scale, and timing of IO. This has been misinterpreted by Newmyer as a historical phenomenon specific only to the era of China's ancient warring kingdoms.\nThird, the matter of PSYOPS links western thought to its Asian counterpart. Targeting the political minds responsible for determining the central strategic direction of the war, or any political confrontation, is as important as dealing with the technological threat posed by one's adversaries. In the case of Mao and Giap, whom many assume interpreted Sun Tzu for the modern Asian military audience, high technology should not obscure the relative importance of subverting the enemy's confidence. This is a soft target which can always be exploited by a technologically weaker adversary without even resorting to a physical clash of arms.\nUltimately then, people's war for the information age will be no less unpredictable than the Cold War version. IW appears to have borrowed too much from conventional understandings of war fighting. IO is the broader, more important discipline to read or to deflect an enemy without distinguishing between peacetime and wartime. As a sign that Asian IO theory is perhaps gaining traction, the Obama Administration has responded to the exposure of Chinese cyber provocations in February 2013 by avoiding official attribution to Beijing and deflecting calls for straightforward retaliation, instead it is seeking ways to warn the unnamed state-sponsored intruders of the risks of collateral economic and political damages to their interdependent relationship. Chris Johnson of the Central Intelligence Agency neatly summed up the policy predicament on this occasion: “The problem so far is that we have rhetoric, and we have Cyber Command, and not much in between.”\nThe author wishes to thank participants at the first Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College Seminar in 2010 in Singapore for the opportunity to present a preliminary version of this article.

The Case for an Asian Perspective on Information Operations Alan Chong¹ Armed Forces &amp; Society 2014, Vol. 40(4) 599-624 © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permission: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav DOI: 10.1177/0095327X13483444 afs.sagepub.com SAGE ¹ S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore ## Corresponding Author: Alan Chong, S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Block S4, Level B4, Nanyang Avenue, Singapore. 639798 Email: iscschong@ntu.edu.sg ## Abstract While information warfare (IW) has been treated by its foremost western proponents as a strategic revolution, the reasons for such a claim are actually rather weak if one considers how non-western approaches to the informational components of warfare have put forth their positions within a multidimensional context of strategy. This article ventures an Asian perspective that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. This article will pan out by first critically analyzing the predominantly American interpretation of IW as a set of five characteristics that can be contrasted to an Asian rival. Subsequently, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a generic Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately termed information operations (IO). These Asian IO features will be teased out through a reading of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. An Asian IO approach will not distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it place a premium on liberal democratic ideology as a basis for information superiority.\nWith the advent of cyberspace, information warfare (IW) boggles the military mind with its self-revelation as a weapon of mass disruption. Paralysis, rather than physical destruction, appears to be the outcome. Recent incidents between 2007 and 2013 illustrate the slippery interface between war and peace through the conflation of terrestrial order and disorder, cyberspatial chaos, and the lack of clarity of the source of the attack. In April 2007, the world's first full-scale cyberattack targeted the Republic of Estonia. The cause was publicly speculated by Estonian politicians and public opinion as an offline one: Russian residents in the former Soviet republic were vehemently taking to the streets and media to protest the government's removal of a Soviet era military memorial in the Estonian capital Tallinn. It did not help matters that since Estonia declared “independence” from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, relations between Russia and Estonia had been either stagnant or strained. The attacks occurred in the context of Estonia being the most wired nation-state in Europe, with an estimated 90 percent of all domestic financial transactions being carried out online, and some 70 percent of tax returns being filed through the Internet. The so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks disrupted most “peacetime” economic life in the country and virtually paralyzed the government in Tallinn. Estonian defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo admitted that the hardest part about responding was the inability to verify the source of the attacks:“Some of those countries [e.g. Russia, Moldova, Ukraine] have many more serious problems than cybersecurity and cybercrime legislation. Secondly, sometimes there are only claims that people are acting from those geographic locations. We can't prove that. Like there are safe havens for terrorism—I mean, Afghanistan is one example, Yemen is emerging. We don't know about Nigeria. There are very many more safe havens in cyberspace than in real space.”\nWhat is interesting here is the conventional disorientation within which a government official assesses his country's first cyberwar. The same conundrum about the source of an attack was manipulated by Israel, North Korea, China, Russia, and nonstate groups named Anonymous and LulzSec, between 2007 and 2011 to launch attacks against commercial companies, foreign governments, and political parties on the pretexts of either private or undeclared vendettas. In 2006, the Bush Administration began inserting malware into Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz in order to map its computer vulnerabilities; since 2009, the Obama Administration had followed up with full-scale attacks to slow down the Iranian nuclear effort. Experts dubbed the cyberweapon “Stuxnet.” The United States was fingered as the source of Stuxnet, developed with Israeli collaboration, only after a journalist interviewed unnamed officials willing to leak the story. In August 2012, the computers at Saudi oil company Aramco were struck by a virus that systematically erased data on three-quarters of their databanks, replacing the data with an image of a burning American flag. No oil was spilled, nor burned, in this “attack” but computer experts flown in by the Saudis, including those from Symantec, ventured that this virus—dubbed “Shamoon” after a word embedded in its code—was the work of Iranian agents. These experts concluded that the data erasing command within Shamoon, dubbed “Wiper,” clearly imitated another virus named “Flame” that had mysteriously attacked Iranian oil companies right up till May 2012.4 Was Flame therefore a variant and an accessory to Stuxnet, and therefore attributable to Washington's virtual war against Tehran? If the attacking virus was replicated, who was the more culpable electronic combatant: the initiator or the imitator-cum-retaliator? In February 2013, a private web security company, Mandiant, publicly blamed the Chinese army unit 61398, situated in Shanghai, for a spate of cyber vandalism and theft at Google, Microsoft, RSA, and The New York Times, among other American corporations. The Chinese foreign ministry ingenuously countered that their country were equally at the receiving end of cyber attacks from unnamed states.5 The same Chinese spokesperson conveniently omitted any mention of domestic Internet vigilantes, as well as alienated, unemployed, computer literate college graduates within the People's Republic. This article ventures that generating open-ended paralysis and manipulating this vagary behind the source of an attack could well be strategy in itself. This is the core of an Asian prescription for information operations (IO).\nFor starters, some terminological clarification is needed to indicate the maneuverable space within IO in contrast to IW. IW has been treated by its foremost American proponents as a paradigmatic displacement of conventional offline warfighting. But the reasons for such a claim are actually rather weak if one considers non-western approaches to informational components of warfare. For a working definition, this article shall define IW as the use of symbolic resources to penetrate the enemy's secrecy and confidence for the purpose of winning a war on one's own terms. The proximate concept of IO refers to that entire range of symbolic resources straddling both military and civilian spheres that are aimed at achieving national objectives in both peacetime and wartime. These include psychological operations (PSYOPS), military deception (MILDEC), electronic countermeasures warfare, and public diplomacy. IW remains IO's predecessor.\nThe aim of this article is to supply an Asian perspective on IO that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. The appeal of pondering an Asian perspective lies in opening up the military mind to insights from a different civilization with its attendant particularistic philosophies. Civilizations are desirable sources of ideas given the fact that they are accumulations of wisdom and praxis across time and space directed by conscious human endeavor. This human endeavor aspires to distinguish one section of humanity from the rest.6 Attitudes toward understanding IO in all its complexities can therefore be enhanced through interaction with a non-western body of pre-digital wisdom. The deployment of information for strategic uses is in all probability culturally filtered. The agent deploying information to convert or confuse others is exercising a power over the creation of meaning. This is a point reiterated prominently by social constructivists in political science, international relations, and in linguistics.7 It will consequently be argued that an Asian way of IO does not try to delineate the physical, the permissible, and democratic elements from the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. This is a call for dialogue with non-western strategy rather than an ideological confrontation. To some extent, the survey produced by James Yin and Philip Taylor of four Asian countries' existing equivalents of IW doctrines and capabilities breaks ground for the current enterprise. That said, Yin and Taylor have merely described the existing state of operational profiles of Asian IW and imputed an Asian perspective to them. This cannot be adequate since critics might argue that the existing state of Asian IW doctrines are merely adaptations of western models of PSYOPS from the Cold War and later. It is also quite revealing that in 1955, with Cold War insurgencies in East Asia rising to fever pitch, Edward Katzenbach and Gene Hanrahan commented that Mao Zedong's revolutionary appeal among Southeast Asian communists lies in its “monopoly of patience” and its corollary that the strategy of the superior military mind “has very little to do with technological superiority.” Given space constraints within an article-length reflection, I sample only three Asian strategic thinkers who are prominent in classic strategic studies readers such as Peter Paret's Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age and other specialist surveys of unconventional warfare: Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. Omitted are other Asian voices of varying historical and geographical pedigrees. Nonetheless, by examining Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, readers should be able to discern what a more careful consideration of Asian perspectives could yield. Table 1 illustrates the subtle contrasts between Western IW and Asian IO approaches which this article intends to show.\nTaking a foundational approach to sketching Asian IO, this article will begin by surveying the predominantly American interpretation of IW in terms of a number of IW characteristics that should be opened up to critical contrast to Asian ways. The American interpretation of IW will be analyzed in terms of five characteristics: liberal democratic modernization, cyber delinquency, bureaucratic confusion, cyber power, and soft power. Subsequently, via Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a more Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately redescribed as IO. To generalize, an Asian IO approach is ideologically agnostic and unlikely to distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it distinguish strategy from tactics; moreover, it will indulge in subterfuge.\n## Western Approaches to IW: Information Capability via Liberal Democratic Modernization, Cyber Delinquency, Bureaucratic Confusion, and Cyber Power and Soft Power Following Clausewitzian thought on military strategy, the utility of information in war may be understood to be heavily dependent upon intellectual powers that are up to the task of deploying information adroitly according to constant changes in capabilities and “out of the box” challenges. Edward Luttwak's treatment of Chang\n\n|  Dimensions for comparison | Western approaches | Asian approaches  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Governing ideology as basis for information power | Liberal democratic modernization | Ideologically agnostic modernization  |\n|  Order and civil-military distinctions | Distinguishing delinquency in peacetime and offense in wartime; hesitation over questions of legality | Vagary and gray legal, political terrain as an advantage for mounting cyber attack; no peacetime; or wartime distinctions  |\n|  Bureaucracy and chain of command | Clarity of targeted system required to plan attack and/or defense | Targeted systems, as well as friendly systems, may be centralized and opaque so long as attack and defense can be mounted to maximum effect  |\n|  Power | Delineated levels of power application and escalation possible, and advisable | Power can be obscured and chameleonic  |\n|  Martial spirit | Deep penetration to uncover enemy plans, and to disrupt operations either before they commence or when they are underway; concern with legality; seeing the enemy more important than deception | Physical war as last resort; the acme of “fighting” is to defeat the enemy’s plans first, via calculated deception, and through unexpected angles; embrace asymmetry; anonymity; and contagion as advantages  |\nNote. IO = information operations; IW = information warfare.\nstrategy in terms of the conscious use of paradox in military execution illustrates this. Strategy, to Luttwak, is always an exercise in selecting information to maximize one's purpose, but this in turn requires factoring in the unexpected as undertaken by one's equally breathing and thinking adversary.¹³ As more scholars attempt to keep up with the \"information revolution\" associated with the penetration of computers into business networking and consumer lifestyles, it is to be expected that international relations and security in \"the digital age\" remains an underexplored area.¹⁴ Part of the problem lies in the lack of communication between disciplines and, worse, between different frequencies within the same subfield of a discipline. Such is the problem with treating information as part of strategy. Information is critical to all domains of knowledge inquiry.\n## Assumptions of Superiority in Advanced Liberal Democratic Modernization\nTaking these complexities to heart, an early groundbreaking work in the study of IW was grandiosely titled *In Athena's Camp: Preparing for Conflict in the Information*\nAge. The editors and lead authors, John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, chose the metaphor of the Greek Goddess Athena over Mars, the God of War, for the reason that Athena stood for the superior use of information as knowledge to civilize people; moreover, she embodied the virtues of Athenian government, especially democracy. One can see how such a conception also perfectly mirrors the primary mission of American foreign policy. This liberal democratic influence, married to a technological vision of modernization, is carried further in Arquilla and Ronfeldt's choice of authors for their Foreword, Alvin and Heidi Toffler. The Tofflers are well known for their futurism studies, as well as their thesis about the three waves of technological civilization. The first wave concerned the agricultural revolution whereby certain peoples organized government and economy to systematically exploit natural food sources for sustaining human life. The second wave witnessed the application of electromechanical principles to provide inanimate sources of energy for human industry. The third wave enabled humanity to manipulate scientific principles to create whole new energy sources and even life forms. This made the \"Revolution in Military Affairs” (RMA) possible by the late twentieth century. To the Tofflers, the implications of the RMA would be on par with those generated by microbiological technology, genetics and cloning, and nuclear physics. Knowledge “has moved from a peripheral to a central position where ideas, innovation, values, imagination, symbols and imagery, not just computer data, play more and more important roles.”\nWhereas in the past, information in military strategy referred to morale, leadership, courage, and strategic insight, in today's terms, intangible information also includes “what is inside our databanks as well as the skulls of our soldiers. They include the power of software, the ability to blindside an opponent's information technology, the superiority of information collection and dissemination, the compatibility of information-enhancing tools, and much more.” This was framed by the Tofflers' reading that “America is the source of the most stunning knowledge-enhancing technologies, and most of its workforce is engaged in one or another form of knowledge work ... Nevertheless, the United States still has a residual sector of the economy based on low-skill muscle-work. And the US military reflects a similar duality.” The Tofflers acknowledge that while the United States currently possesses “some very big ‘media howitzers' that nobody else has” in the form of Hollywood and CNN:“ ... any idea that the US government or its military should attempt to rationalize or to impose broad controls on the US media in the interest of a coherent information warfare doctrine is anachronistic and counterproductive. The further a country advances toward Third Wave economic and social systems, the less likely central censorship or control will work. Third Wave economies thrive on open ideas and information systems, the irrepressible Internet being the most obvious example.”\nFreedom of information flow should theoretically lead to the unleashing of the ideological power of “open society” and “open government” as concepts. Woven\nthrough the writings of the Tofflers, David Gompert, and other narratives within Athena's Camp is a derogatory attitude toward authoritarian states such as China, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba, the erstwhile USSR, and even Singapore.\nAt the time of writing, the latest evangelizer of Internet freedom is Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister and founder of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders). On one hand, he claims clinically that technology is not necessarily predestined to support or yield liberty but in the case of the Internet, the precedents of its use have opened up the possibilities of a struggle:“Yet, all the same, the distortions [of Internet usage] are the exception rather than the rule. The Internet is above all the most fantastic means of breaking down the walls and boundaries that close us off from each other. For the oppressed peoples, who have been deprived of their right to self-expression and the right to choose their own future, the Internet provides power beyond their wildest hopes. In minutes, news and images recorded on a telephone can be disseminated worldwide in cyberspace. It is increasingly difficult to hide a public demonstration, an act of repression or a violation of human rights.In authoritarian and repressive countries, mobile telephones and the Internet have given rise to public opinion and civil society. They have also given citizens a critical means of expression, despite all the restrictions.”\nA battle is continually being waged to harness the Internet in the service of either authoritarian politics or its liberal protagonists, but one that liberals ought to win, in Kouchner's view. The first wave of the Arab Spring Revolutions of 2010--2012 have borne out Kouchner's predictions, but the ongoing bittersweet postscript in Egypt and Libya have dulled popular expectations that “Facebook revolutions” can be sustained in their political gains. These contradictory trends mean that IW will be inevitably politicized according to some of these “default, western” ideological assumptions. In fact, the link between liberal democracy and IW actually inhibits further exploration of IW as a comprehensive strategy since it limits debate and exploration to the uses liberal democracies make of it. The recent practices of undeclared IW by Russia and China, and some purport North Korea and Iran as well, undermine the liberal claims to the IW discourse. It is a mistake for IW thinkers to assume there is a preferential kinship between IW and any particular ideology.\n### IW's Roots in Cyber Delinquency\nCyber delinquency is a very recent label used to categorize criminal activities produced directly through the Internet. Yet, like the presumed linkage between liberalism and IW, this deserves unpacking. As a source of information, the Internet was designed for accessibility by its myriad contributors. Yet, in the twenty years since its public debut, it has been treated by many observers as an evolving “jungle” of abuse and source of harm to “innocent” democratically faithful users. Most\nnational legislation on computer crimes takes aim at persons who attempt unauthorized access to databases and other sites on the Internet. If “breaking and entering” without consent is criminal in the terrestrial world, it appears that cyberspace has taken on earthly characteristics, especially when observers and governments debate the prospect of governance of the Internet. Interestingly, the phrase “computer hacker,” or simply “hacker” has taken on the connotation of a night robber who forces his way into the inner sanctum of a home or office and steals its valuable contents. This is an unproblematic assumption from the perspective of law enforcement officials, but misses an important feature of the Internet era society according to a prominent scholar of the Internet, Manuel Castells.\nCastells argues that the so-called culture of freedom embedded in the Internet depends upon the interplay of roles between four virtual cultures arising from online interaction: “These cultural layers are hierarchically disposed: the techno-meritocratic culture becomes specified as a hacker culture by building rules and customs into networks of cooperation aimed at technological projects. The virtual communitarian culture adds a social dimension to technological sharing, by making the Internet a medium of selective social interaction and symbolic belonging. The entrepreneurial culture works on top of the hacker culture, and on the communitarian culture, to diffuse Internet practices in all domains of society by way of moneymaking. Without the techno-meritocratic culture, hackers would simply be a specific countercultural community of geeks and nerds.” Richard Power, one of the first observers of Internet security to author a book on digital crime, echoes his view. In his many visits to and interviews with cybersecurity analysts, Power observes that hacking begins with a deep-seated curiosity about computer systems. How capable is a computer, a software, or a particular database unless it is tested? Furthermore, as Power's research indicates, curiosity is bound up with professional desire to prove one's competence in discovering the vulnerabilities of connected computers, as well as in savoring an ego trip toward becoming the “master of online access.” These ambitions might also lead computer hackers to embrace a highly presumptuous, and even delusional, form of social heroism endeavoring to protect the ordinary user from rapacious corporations and governments. Power goes so far as to distinguish the hacker from the virus writer.\nThere is a great deal of intelligence and skill coupled to social and political potential in cyberspace crimes. Between 1997 and 2000, roughly coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the advent of the Internet, the top four criminal activities online were, in descending order of importance: virus attacks, insider abuse of web access, unauthorized access to databases by insiders, and denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. By 2009--2010, the US government reported that these categories appeared to have diminished in volume, and the new top four categories were “non-delivery of payment or merchandise,” Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)-related scams such as impersonating the Bureau online, “identity theft” and “computer crimes.” Since 1997, the US Department of Justice and the FBI have become more refined in their data capture. But it is also significant that between 2008 and 2009, there was a 22.3\npercent jump in Internet crimes complaints. The 2010 Internet Crime Report reiterated the pervasiveness of Internet crime. After 2010, both American agencies have discontinued annual Internet Crime Reports, preferring instead to issue periodic and crime-specific alerts. These criminal activities suggest that the Internet has evolved in tandem with real-world human nature to enable the extension of offline crimes into online activities. One could of course go on and cite the quality and intensity of cyberspace fraud that ranges from the disgruntled employee who attacks his own corporation, to the frequency of curiosity-driven sabotage of telecommunications companies, as well as the first widespread DDOS attacks against Yahoo, eBay, CNN, and Amazon.com in 2000. But this is, if Castells, Power, and other scholars are to be taken seriously, intrinsic to the human side of the web. Just as human enlightenment is to be expanded through the Internet and its applications, human beings can likewise use it to inflict pain and destruction. These predicaments are little different from those arising from the abuse of public spaces for hate crimes or supplying energy utilities at inflated rates to fleece consumers within a nation-state.\nHence, one cannot assume that cyber delinquency is simply just that—crime. Internet-based delinquency affords multiple new arenas for trials of strength among persons participating in and building an information society. Whenever authorities investigate “hacktivism,” the more enlightened among them often spot an opportunity to turn the perpetrator around toward new online uses that harmonize with pre-existing political interests. It is not surprising that, just as in espionage, governments rarely advertise the fact that online saboteurs can just as easily be turned to the service of covert national missions against real and imagined enemies. Alexander Klimburg has highlighted the roles of “Patriot Hackers” in the Chinese and Russian cyberwar “armies.” Most books on IW or cyberwar often use the commanding verb “imagine” to introduce the discussions of what hackers and virus creators could do if they penetrated international boundaries online. The world's first interstate cyberwar nearly broke out in tandem with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s military intervention in Kosovo in 1999. What eventually happened was a series of localized skirmishes between anti-Serb and pro-Serb Internet users employing propaganda e-mails and website postings. The US government hesitated before unleashing its cyber attack on Serbian banks, government and military systems to coincide with the physical aerial bombing campaign on the grounds of self-restraint. The US Department of Defense (US DoD) had concluded that IW against Serbia might invoke charges from third parties, as well as Serbians, that the Americans had willfully committed war crimes and other violations against United States and international law on cybercrimes. Additionally, it was reported that Serbian military computer systems were too dispersed, and had the Serbs attacked first, the chances of accurately verifying the sources of those attacks would be low. The unofficial revelations in June 2012 of President Obama's green light for preemptive cyber attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities suggest that the United States may have revised its doctrinal treatment of cyberwar as cyber delinquency. Of course,\nas it was widely reported in 1999, when NATO aircraft accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as part of their campaign, Chinese netizens behaved in an uninhibited fashion to send streams of spam into American mailboxes. By the time the next major Sino--American military incident occurred in April 2001, over the mid-air collision between a Chinese jet fighter and a US reconnaissance plane, Chinese hackers “unilaterally” defaced several US government sites. This coincided with the appearance of a number of smart viruses originating from Chinese users. Furthermore, the silence from Beijing regarding these actions hinted at the growing sophistication of its IW doctrine. Henceforth, any strategic doctrine should pay heed to the implications of the fungibility of cyber delinquency for defense purposes.\n### E-promise, Bureaucratic Confusion\nWhen the conceptual promise of “E-government” was derived with the advent of the Internet, the clarion call from information age gurus and journalists was to speed up, open up, and render government ever more transparent and responsive to its clients—the public at large. An Economist commentary in 2000 suggested that if web retailers and Internet service providers set the benchmark for virtual services, consumers would definitely not put up with “slum standards in the public sector.” The reason why governments have traditionally been slow to respond to public demands is due to the need to coordinate action across multiple agencies and to verify identities and other stored information about the citizenry. In tandem with this information-rich development, the public sector organization has been “problematized” as a rich target for IW.\nChristopher Paul, in scrutinizing the US government's predicament, observes that “the novelty of IO [Information Operations] was a combination of the recognition of the information age importance and vulnerability of adversary (and friendly) information and information systems, plus a desire for a coordinated, integrated approach to attacking and defending those data and systems.” This bureaucratic feature of IO implies that strengths and weaknesses are interchangeable. There is also the implication that organizations are only as strong as the weakest link in their chain of command. The idea of the bureaucracy as a system simply means that pulverizing a linchpin of it can trigger its wholesale collapse.\nIn the mostly American dominated literature on IW, there have been a number of books and articles that critically analyze the problems with defining mission foci among a number of overlapping governmental agencies tasked with prosecuting IW, and with identifying vulnerabilities in target organizations for IW. Walter Jajko's “Critical Commentary on the Department of Defense Authorities for Information Operations” published ten years ago in the journal Comparative Strategy called attention to the bureaucratic weaknesses in the American effort. While most of Jajko's piece deals with the specifics of US organizational tasking, some highlights are worth noting here to facilitate the discussion of the Asian supplement to IW theorizing. Jajko argued that the definitional vagary of IW, or IO, could potentially hamper governmental coordination but praised the US DoD for adopting an all-inclusive definition that could encompass\ncivilian activities as well as provide direction at the national level: “actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems, while defending one's own information and information systems.” Yet, he goes on to lament that while the US DoD provides some guidance on offensive and defensive IW doctrines, there is no presidential directive for doing so on a national level. This was somewhat addressed by a secret presidential directive signed by the Obama Administration in mid-2009 creating a White House office for a “Cyberczar” as well as a corresponding Pentagon-housed military command for cyberspace. Nevertheless, Jajko labels the reversibility of information/Internet dependence and accessibility a vulnerability for military planners.\nTraditional service cultures within the Army, Navy, and Air Force also tended to treat IO as “adjunct operations” supporting physical missions in their respective domains of land, sea, and air. Furthermore, IW doctrine is pursued only according to each service's intrinsic interpretations. Moreover, there is, attending to each service interpretation, the lack of clarity over whether to target strictly military enemies, or whether there should be any operational distinction between actual and potential enemies. US DoD guidelines up till 2002 were analyzed as being open-ended and vague in implying that peacetime, precrisis offensive IO could well prove useful to war planning and may be conducted “inside and outside of the traditional battlespace to shape it and prepare the way for future operations.” As of 2013, it remains unclear if any of these issues have been addressed institutionally by the three US armed services, but Jajko's commentary deserves its place as a form of “pre-theorizing” of IW as bureaucratic streamlining.\nBooks by Christopher Paul and Alexander, Kott et al. not only echo Jajko's analyses, but also go on to address the possibilities of targeting the adversary's precise organizational decision-making processes and chain of command. Yet, as the contributors to Kott et al. note “the challenge is that most of the time we cannot observe the elements of the structures in the organization. Instead, we can obtain the intelligence due to the actions and activities of the organization.” The thrust of the various contributors to Kott et al.'s volume is that traditional modes of intelligence operations, under familiar labels such as penetrating the enemy's operations security, planting moles, playing deception through PSYOPS, and the accumulation of open-source political intelligence are all essential to displacing the many weak links in the adversary's bureaucratic decision-making process. Paul appreciates that these penetration efforts represent strategy at work but warns that IO straddle the black, the white, and the gray, implying that PSYOPS involve deploying untruths and half-truths, and hence should be used sparingly. In these ways, American scholars point to a fundamental problem in any information-reliant and complex governing environment: how should IW become a multipronged and nimble information operation?\n### Cyber Power for IW\nThe promise of Internet-enabled long range computer attacks has spurred fevered imaginations to propose the integrated concept of national cyber power. Alex\nKlimburg has defined cyber power in three dimensions: policy coordination across government in the manner sketched in the preceding subsection; coherence of policy across a nation-state's participation in international organizations and legal regimes; and the cooperation of nonstate actors in a national mission.^{44} This is a laudable policy recommendation for making strategy, but it is also a rear view perspective analogous to speculating the size of air force arsenals, chemical, and biological weapons in the manner of foot soldiers, armored personnel carriers, and combat ships. There is scant attention toward the subtleties of force, and impact multiplication, arising from any physically miniscule form of power. The power of computer analysts armed with skills for hacking, and capabilities for code breaking and cipher alteration through mathematical speculation, cannot be quantified. Yet another set of complementary perspectives is fronted by the writings of Adam Liff, Dale Peterson, and Thomas Rid. Liff tried very hard in his 2012 article to stimulate analysis of cyberwar along the premise of Bernard Brodie's^{45} post-1945 speculation upon the impact of atomic weapons on war. Liff contends that cyberwarfare should be understood as the “cost-inducing use of computer network attacks” against an enemy's vital military and civilian infrastructures with coercive intentions.^{46} He claims it is a political bargaining process between two or more actors where costs are decisive in shaping outcomes. This is elaborated by his conjectures upon cyberweapons as the ideal asymmetrical ideal; the difficulty of attributing attacks for certain; cyberweapons as an offensive force multiplier; and the possibility of cyberdeterrence.^{47} Dale Peterson goes further into the mode of specifying cyberweapons in three tiers: simple, moderate level, and complex.^{48} Each of these types correspond to the degree of damage they are intended to inflict, ranging from disruption of normal service, to disablement of specific components of a targeted system, to a thorough transformation by stealth of a targeted industrial system to the extent that the latter is hijacked or programmed to be remotely controlled by the attacker. Peterson goes on to discuss the architecture of an industrial control system and how a cyberweapon can be reverse engineered in tandem with the intricacies of the original design of that system.^{49} Finally, Thomas Rid has proposed that cyber weapons can be “helpfully” employed for “sabotage” campaigns short of the violence associated with outright war.^{50} Such distinctions depend on the ability to draw fine lines between the Clausewitzian conception of war as absolute violence and targeted destruction suited to limited objectives. In pondering cyber power through the rational choice frames of conventional kinetic and nuclear weaponry, these authors are bound by an imperfect hindsight that neglects the possibilities of structural human and philosophical vagaries that may deeply characterize those parts of IW employing cyber means.\n### Soft Power as IW\nA fourth characteristic of the existing literature on IW stems from Joseph Nye's concept of soft power as the ability to get others to want what one wants through voluntary attraction.^{51} In Nye's original formulation, soft power was thought to\nbe important as the new currency of American great power status in a post-Cold War era characterized by economic interdependence and a communications revolution that has shrunk the globe in political terms. Starting with Nye and Owens' article published in 1996 in Foreign Affairs magazine, titled “America's Information Edge,” the idea that American public diplomacy ought to be integrated into a coherent grand strategy of information that connected the dots between Hollywood films, US universities, the US Constitution, US popular culture, civic culture, and America's corporate mastery of the electronic communications market, captured the imagination of governments and think tanks worldwide. Arquilla and Ronfeldt included it in their gamut of tools in preparing the nation for information age threats but elaborated no further as to how soft power could actually assist warfare.\nLeigh Armistead's book, Information Operations: Warfare and the Hard Reality of Soft Power, has at least attempted to persuade the military to embrace the new power currency as a means to deal with the spectrum of post-Cold War “new threats” ranging from rogue states (the then Baathist Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and Myanmar) to rogue nonstate actors, such as separatist groups, exiled groups, and Al Qaeda. To Armistead, the new threats could not be simply bombed out of existence, or neutralized through direct armed occupation; they could only be eliminated through a battle for hearts and minds. Unless carefully redefined, PSYOPS and MILDEC are too crude in the era of globalization since foreign public opinion can verify information credibility through access to Internet sources and satellite-based round-the-clock global news on both television and Internet. Armistead's approach is unhelpful since it takes a kitchen sink approach to strategy, implying information is all important but hardly detailing how it integrates into grand strategy.\nBut as Armistead points out, the invocation of soft power returns the discussion to whether peacetime and wartime distinctions in information strategy are operationally relevant. Presumably, militaries committed to IW or IO need to automatically fold domestic public opinion and private sector entities into a holistic effort. Soft power therefore merits inclusion as a point of reflection because of its civilian face, which is crucial for mitigating armed conflict. Some might also argue that the power of ideas embedded in the structures of knowledge and everyday practice could well constrict a rival's choices, leading toward the achievement of one's goals without ever firing a shot. Should one then consider dismissing IW in its strictest definition in favor of invoking the “magic” of soft power?\nUnfortunately, Nye has himself muddled the soft power component in IO when he recently argued that cyber power was the larger concept encompassing soft power. According to Nye, cyber power refers to the contextual power arising from resources deployable within cyberspace. He then goes on to argue that cyber power can be both hard (e.g. “denial of service attacks,” “government control over companies,” and “bombing of routers and cutting of cables”) and soft (e.g. “public diplomacy campaign,” “setting norms and standards,” and “protests to name and shame cyber providers”). Since cyberspace is an “imperfect [global] commons,” both hard and soft cyber power should be used as appropriate. While governments\nin cyberspace remain the most potent wielders of cyber power, the diffusion of cyber technologies ensure that nonstate actors can increasingly exploit asymmetrical contests to their advantage vis-à-vis governments. But this angle of approach reflects nothing more than Nye's inability to provide a definitive formulation of IO through the lens of soft power—after all, if the power of ideas is paramount in a networked world, why does the United States need to contemplate physical denial as an aspect of exercising cyber power? As many observers have pointed out in the wake of eroding American economic competitiveness in Africa and Latin America vis-à-vis China, and mounting criticism of drone-enabled assassinations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen, soft power through IO needs to deploy social sensitivity in the minds of the proverbial boots on the ground.\n## Asian Strategic Thought on IO\nIn contrast to the aforementioned strands of cyberwarfare thinking, certain Asian theorists and practitioners have not tried to delineate between the physical, the permissible and democratic, and the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. Asian strategic thought has long been viewed as both a complement to and a contrast against western theorizing. But it has been underappreciated in operationally remolding western-originated strategy. Before one proceeds any further in adducing an Asian supplement via a sampled reading of the works of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, the invocation of Asian thinkers must be justified. The thesis of a culturally filtered Asian military revolution must be treated seriously if one is to break out of the mold of treating the West as the only source of military strategy. Peter Lorge has made a compelling case that Asian military strategy cannot be regarded as historically inferior simply because Asia appeared to be laggard in embracing a military revolution characterized by gunpowder, guns, and war-making machines powered by inanimate energy sources. Asian guns were available earlier than the assumed military revolution in Europe; they were not widely deployed simply because the Asian theater and cultural mores of the time militated against their use. But, more importantly, there are some distinct and intriguing parallels between Asian political philosophies that emphasize undoing the enemy's strategies by sowing chaos and the pre-digital western strategic thought of individuals like Machiavelli and Clausewitz. Considering that IOs prior to the advent of the Internet have already been partially treated as a worthy subject, there is every reason to study past wisdom for their bearing on the current information age.\n### Sun Tzu\nAs a cumulative collection of didactic texts on military strategy dating back more than 2,500 years, Sun Tzu's Art of War (Sunzi Bingfa) has captured the imagination of strategic studies scholars beyond China and Japan, even though many scholars believe it to have been inspired by the Sung Dynasty's (tenth to thirteenth centuries)\ndesperate attempt to think their way out of their strategic enclosure by “barbarian powers.” An official translation of the Art of War published by Beijing-based Foreign Languages Press in 1999 describes this work as “representing the quintessence of Chinese military thinking, [and] it summarizes the rich experiences of ancient wars and analyses them from political, economic, social and cultural angles.” Interestingly, these translators also echo the standard culturalist interpretation of Sun Tzu's tract as treating “war as ill-boding and perilous, insisting that the purpose of studying war is to end war.”\nWar is treated as an inherently philosophical enterprise that reflects upon human virtue and cultivation of superior intellect. In Sun Tzu's opening chapter “Making Assessments,” he identifies five fundamental factors of war: moral influence, weather, distance and terrain, command, and doctrine. Of these, his reading of moral influence, cryptically referred to as Dao or “the Way” in Sun Tzu's original parlance, carries particular Daoist and Confucian connotations. Moral influence is “that which causes people to think in line with their sovereign so that they will follow him through every vicissitude, whether to live or to die, without fear of mortal peril.” Information in Sun Tzu's mental framework emerges as a paradigm of correctly investing the energies of the state and its people in harmonized attainment of the national objective through either peace or war. War might be a miscalculation if it ultimately ruins the state and its people, so it must be embarked upon only after in-depth consideration of all its factors, with “moral influence” being the leading one. The general ought also to be skilled in balancing the seemingly contradictory values of compassion for his soldiers with courage in battle. Boldness should not be confused with recklessness. Calculating information is also critical to treating war as a game of deception: “feign incapability when in fact capable; feign inactivity when ready to strike; appear to be far away when actually nearby, and vice versa. When the enemy is greedy for gains, hand out a bait to lure him; when he is in disorder, attack and overcome him ... if he is given to anger, provoke him.” In Chapter 3 “Attacking by Stratagem,” Sun Tzu counsels that “to fight a hundred battles and win each and every one of them is not the wisest thing to do. To break the enemy's resistance without fighting is.”\nInsofar as Sun Tzu speaks directly to IW in our time, his counsel is to read the opportunity costs of waging war correctly, and never end up with greater losses than those envisioned in the opening gambit. Essentially, IW is folded into what we term IO as an art of reading the proverbial “tea leaves” of achieving national goals using the right policy instruments adapted to circumstances.\nLiterally, one should follow the Way of the Dao. Although Sun Tzu does not explicitly address the distinction between peacetime and wartime, there is frequent intimation that the two periods exist on a seamless continuum of preparation for the eventuality of combat. To be victorious in the event of war, one's military must be deployed advantageously, akin to the momentum found in nature: torrential water moving boulders, falcons falling upon hapless prey, and so forth. Because mental preparations must draw on parallels to the forces of nature, and nature in turn\nprivileges harmony among its forces, Sun Tzu denigrates any form of chaos (luan), whether in strategic planning, logistics, failure to treat physical terrain as an ally, or in the absence of unwavering charismatic inspiration of one's troops. Conversely, Sun Tzu extolled the possibilities of sowing luan within one's enemy.\nAs such, Sun Tzu appears to embrace espionage as a lofty form of IO in his time. Here, it is worth quoting in full: “The enlightened sovereign and the capable commander conquer the enemy at every move and achieve successes far surpassing those of ordinary people because they possess ‘foreknowledge.' This ‘foreknowledge' cannot be obtained from ghosts or spirits, nor from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor from astrological calculations. It can only come from men who know the enemy situation.” This is from the Art of War's closing Chapter 13, titled “Using Spies.” Sun Tzu specifies in some detail five types of spy: the native agent, the internal agent, the converted agent, the expendable agent, and the surviving agent. The details need not concern us; all involve the need to penetrate the walls of the enemy's inner sanctums of government and put on a veneer of sincerely empathizing with the enemy, in order to listen in on their most subtle intentions. There is no right or wrong time for espionage—“so delicate and so secretive is espionage that there is nowhere you cannot put it to good use.” In employing spies, the overriding goal of gaining “foreknowledge” must always drive action. Fully deniable cyberspace intrusions are highly necessary if one takes this advice seriously. One, of course, might pose the question as to whether gaining “foreknowledge” does not undercut adherence to the cosmic harmony that the Way promotes in harmonizing interstate relations.\n### Mao Zedong\nMao is easily the second most important Asian military thinker found in war studies syllabi. His stature is partly derived from association with the contemporary postcolonial politics of East Asia. It also stems from the fact that Mao's ideological immersion in Marxism--Leninism was indigenized in the fledgling Chinese Communist Party, followed by constant harassment from “class enemies,” as well as the Japanese during the Pacific War. Mao's brand of armed rural revolutionary war was hatched in the vast and often inhospitable countryside, in mountains, valleys, and secluded areas. He had to appraise the Chinese strategic environment virtually from scratch as a political outsider to the then ruling Guomindang's dominance in the teeming urban population centers. The Chinese Civil War was scripted into a war between the “righteous” have-nots against the “nefarious” haves. In many ways, Mao's thinking on military affairs possessed a do-it-yourself quality, though he was also drawn to ideologies bound to be attractive to the underdog in a revolutionary struggle.\nAs John Shy and Thomas Collier have aptly noted in their survey of the subject of revolutionary war, Mao stands out as one of the rare thinkers postulating that “strategic theory has meaning only in terms of the concrete political, social, and international circumstances at the moment in which theory is being elucidated.” In Mao's\nvision of using flexible means toward achieving one's goals, theory and practice should be conjoined. In this regard, political warfare qua IW qua revolutionary warfare qua armed struggle should be components in a fluid spectrum of means used to attain revolutionary objectives. In his essay, “The Military Problem” written under very difficult physical circumstances, Mao exhorts his comrades to place the party and the masses on a war footing. The latter phrase did not presage a long list of tasks. Mao's thrust was instead to encourage the enemy troops to defect and join the Red Army rank and file, “to intensify political training,” in Mao's translated words. The challenge in his informational strategy was to ensure that despite the relative material poverty of the Red Army, the Guomindang soldiers would find it morally rewarding to join the righteous cause of fighting for revolution against their former masters. The Red Army would thus gain mass through the conversion of the enemy's ranks:“Apart from the role played by the party, the reason the Red Army can sustain itself without collapse in spite of such a poor standard of material life and incessant engagements, is its practice of democracy. The officers do not beat the men; officers and men receive equal treatment; soldiers enjoy freedom of assembly and speech; cumbersome formalities and ceremonies are done away with; and the account books are open to the inspection of all ... They [the captured soldiers] feel that, though in material life they are worse off in the Red Army than in the White [Guomindang] army, spiritually they are liberated. The fact that the same soldier who was not brave in the enemy army yesterday becomes very brave in the Red Army today shows precisely the impact of democracy. The Red Army is like a furnace in which all captured soldiers are melted down and transformed the moment they come over.”\nUnder this rubric, PSYOPS is treated as both substitute and supplement for the strategies of mass and technological augmentation. In this way, Mao has inherited Sun Tzu's precept of executing one's military campaign with the Dao of harmonizing the people and their rulers. This likewise extends into propaganda tasks other than fighting. In Mao's words, proper war fighting should transcend “the purely military viewpoint” and the military “should also shoulder such important tasks as agitating the masses, organizing them, arming them, and helping them to set up revolutionary political power, and even establishing organizations of the Communist Party.” That Mao's undeclared targets are the winning of the populace's “hearts and minds,” and the subversion of the enemy's political command, is obvious in the disproportionate emphasis placed upon informational strategies in his writings. Even when dealing with specific military strategies, his emphasis remains steadfastly fixed upon correctly appraising the terrain and foreknowledge gleaned of the enemy forces. His clarion call is for the flexibility of means to be reconciled with some semblance of centralized command at every level. Mao was set “against fixed operational fronts and positional warfare, and for fluid operational fronts and mobile warfare; against the mere routing of the enemy, and for a war of annihilation;\nagainst the principle of striking with both fists, and for the principle of striking with one fist ... ”^{72}\nMao's concept of People's War essentially converts the asymmetry of the militarily weaker protagonist into unconventional strengths used to defeat the militarily stronger.^{73} Taking account of the enemy tactically means learning where the disaffected majority of the population lives and earns its livelihood. People have to be aroused to rebel against their oppressors. In Cold War vintage vocabulary, Mao envisioned that imperialists and their lackeys tend to gravitate toward the positional control of urban centers and main lines of communication. A successful people's war should therefore convert the countryside with its people and physical resources into a revolutionary force to engulf the exploitative capitalist centers from the countryside. How might this be extrapolated into IO? There is one telling commentary published in the People's Liberation Army Daily on June 25, 1996, which has since been extensively reproduced on the Internet as a sign of Chinese thinking:“A people's war in the context of information warfare is carried out by hundreds of millions of people using open-type modern information systems. Because the traditional mode of industrial production has changed from centralization to dispersion and commercial activities have expanded from urban areas to rural areas, the working method and mode of interaction in the original sense are increasingly information-based. Political mobilization for war must rely on information technology to become effective, for example by generating and distributing political mobilization software via the Internet, sending patriotic e-mail messages, and setting up databases for traditional education. This way, modern technical media can be fully utilized and the openness and diffusion effect of the Internet can be expanded, to help political mobilization exert its subtle influence.In short, the meaning and implications of a people's war have profoundly changed in the information age, and the chance of people taking the initiative and randomly participating in the war has increased. The ethnic signature and geographic mark on an information war are more pronounced and the application of strategies is more secretive and unpredictable.^{74}”\nOne might add that a People's War can in fact take on additional characteristics of anonymity and contagion in the Internet age.^{75} Moreover, the didactic spirit of this passage is a direct twist on the liberal democratic modernization spiel embedded in western IW as espoused for instance by the Tofflers. Finally, one might interpret grand strategic possibilities for an ongoing People's War involving large numbers of Chinese government co-opted college graduates equipped with computer skills tasked to conduct Web-based infiltration and deception across sovereign borders. This might be dubbed an IO sub-strategy of loose unison in the service of a collective national interest. The declared establishment of an American Cybercorps is equally likely to draw on such transnational possibilities of pursuing grand strategy across the World Wide Web, as well as to retaliate against People's War intrusions conducted by rival powers and non-state actors.\nVo Nguyen Giap\nGeneral Giap is often considered the military brain behind the military successes against both French and American forces in the First and Second Indochina wars. His relevance to our discussion falls under the shadow of Mao. While Mao postulated strategy in the light of Chinese geopolitical and ideological circumstances, Giap adapted its execution in a much smaller theater of war against technologically superior enemies. One might also draw a straight line affirming the lineage between Sun Tzu and Giap. Cognizant of Sun Tzu's admonition to the ruler and commander to ensure concord between a people and their government, Giap identified the French imperialist stature after World War II in terms of its “weak point [lying] in the unjust character of his war. As a result, he was internally divided, not supported by the people of his own country, and did not enjoy the sympathy of world opinion.” Furthermore, “his army was strong at the beginning but its fighting spirit was deteriorating.”^{76}\nIn contrast, the Vietnamese revolutionary forces enjoyed the advantage of tapping into a ragtag untested guerrilla army that had tasted independence at the conclusion of the Japanese Occupation; they could also count on the sympathy of newly liberated peoples elsewhere. Based upon such assessments, Giap was willing to join his comrades in strategizing a protracted war to wear down French material strength by deploying the spiritual and symbolic strengths of the Vietnamese. Giap has admitted to spending time in Mao's camps in southern China in the early 1940s, observing and learning from his communist brethren how to fight successfully as the weaker party. From this experience, Giap helped the Party formulate the overlapping concepts of resistance war, anti-imperialist war, and war for national liberation. These slogans were meant to capture the loyalties of as broad a segment of Vietnamese society as possible for an armed and unified anti-French front. This broad coalition would also discursively alienate collaborators and compel Vietnamese with wavering loyalties to take sides in a “just war.”^{77}\nAlong with consolidating the political front, Giap noted that “guerrilla war must multiply. To keep itself in life and to develop, guerrilla warfare necessarily has to develop into mobile warfare. This is a general law.”^{78} Giap subsequently elaborated this guerrilla strategy into a three-stage scenario with: first, the “stage of contention,” second, the “stage of equilibrium;” and third, the “stage of counter-offensive.” In the stage of contention, one's forces were both numerically and materially weaker than the enemy's. Small-scale attacks on enemy outposts and the killing or capturing of a handful of enemy soldiers counted for important political effects. At every turn, guerrillas were expected to trade ground for safety through retreat into the jungles. With time and steadily growing confidence and supplies, hit-and-run attacks would give way to pitched battles with the enemy. Once the base areas had attained a level of security from large-scale harassment by enemy troops, the people's army could then transit from mere guerrilla attacks to concerted regimental and battalion scale campaigns against the enemy.^{79}\nWhat, then, is Giap's contribution to a non-Western reading of IO? Certainly, PSYOPS and other propaganda maneuvers to marshal political loyalties in support of one's cause were crucial to constituting the base for subsequent stages. As a communist, Giap interpreted Marx, Lenin, and Mao correctly in preparing armed struggle through political engineering. His guerrilla pronouncements suggested that the weaker party in a conflict should always bide its time, staging attacks commensurate with its deployable resources at any given point in time to demonstrate the lively presence of opposition. Incrementally, gains achieved through harassment would build momentum toward full-scale assault.^{80} This is especially relevant to the exploitability of Internet-based IO—the simple and random acts of hacking displace the enemy's security systems and its state of tranquility; consequently, when the enemy's information systems prove ever more vulnerable, more decisive DOS attacks, virus injections, and spam waves can be deployed to paralyze him. In this regard, both North Korea and Iran should merit serious study as paradigmatic cases of asymmetrical IO practitioners in the light of their ongoing postures of strategic defiance against a number of great military powers.\n## Conclusion: The Shape of an Asian Perspective to IW—Advocating the Characteristics of Continuity in IO\nYin and Taylor's initial work exploring an Asian approach to IO helpfully focuses attention on existing doctrines employed by China, Taiwan, Japan, and Thailand, but they are pessimistic about the relative backwardness of Asian capabilities.^{81} They assert that Asia will be “playing catch up to the West” for some time to come. Jacqueline Newmyer has even asserted that one should expect to witness a “Revolution in Military Affairs with Chinese Characteristics” as the People's Liberation Army attempts to westernize its IW capabilities.^{82} This article has argued otherwise through a thickly inferred reading of a sample of Asian strategists. While western strategizing for IW has opened up avenues for pondering the time and space complexities inherent in IO, this opening allows scholars and practitioners alike to mine non-Western, and specifically, Asian strategic thought to discover fresh insights into how asymmetrically powerful IO can be if one wishes to look beyond the glamour of high-technology dominance in conceptualizing information as a military weapon.\nFirst, as Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap suggest, there is a premium to be placed upon harmonizing trust between governments and peoples in executing any form of information strategy for defense. There is no specific need for any state to be a liberal democratic high-technology power in order to maximize the potential of information as a military resource. In fact, the Asian thinkers sampled here suggest that some degree of centralized absolutism should be practiced to conduct IW successfully. Asian strategists appear to privilege unity in transmitting political messages, as opposed to the emphasis on putting democratic soft power on an immutable pedestal for foreign consumption. More importantly, Asian thinkers embrace a form of soft power that is mostly internally directed to consolidate one's own domestic military\nfront as an ideological cudgel, enabling one to then summon almost infinite sacrifices in blood and treasure.\nSecond, Asian thinkers appreciate the offensive and defensive utilities of vagary. This addresses the dual nature of cyber delinquency. Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap referred to this as flexibility in fighting with a weaker hand, asserting presence by converting a population, as well as dispatching spies as information seekers. In Sun Tzu's writings, we see the importance of secrecy of foreknowledge mixed with outward guile. For Mao and Giap, flexibility was meant to displace the enemy's comfort zone insofar as the enemy applied premeditated doctrines. The Asian thinkers treated here make little or no distinction between peacetime or wartime activity; politics and its goals dictate the agency, scale, and timing of IO. This has been misinterpreted by Newmyer as a historical phenomenon specific only to the era of China's ancient warring kingdoms.\nThird, the matter of PSYOPS links western thought to its Asian counterpart. Targeting the political minds responsible for determining the central strategic direction of the war, or any political confrontation, is as important as dealing with the technological threat posed by one's adversaries. In the case of Mao and Giap, whom many assume interpreted Sun Tzu for the modern Asian military audience, high technology should not obscure the relative importance of subverting the enemy's confidence. This is a soft target which can always be exploited by a technologically weaker adversary without even resorting to a physical clash of arms.\nUltimately then, people's war for the information age will be no less unpredictable than the Cold War version. IW appears to have borrowed too much from conventional understandings of war fighting. IO is the broader, more important discipline to read or to deflect an enemy without distinguishing between peacetime and wartime. As a sign that Asian IO theory is perhaps gaining traction, the Obama Administration has responded to the exposure of Chinese cyber provocations in February 2013 by avoiding official attribution to Beijing and deflecting calls for straightforward retaliation, instead it is seeking ways to warn the unnamed state-sponsored intruders of the risks of collateral economic and political damages to their interdependent relationship. Chris Johnson of the Central Intelligence Agency neatly summed up the policy predicament on this occasion: “The problem so far is that we have rhetoric, and we have Cyber Command, and not much in between.”\nThe author wishes to thank participants at the first Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College Seminar in 2010 in Singapore for the opportunity to present a preliminary version of this article.

    "abstract": "While information warfare (IW) has been treated by its foremost western proponents as a strategic revolution, the reasons for such a claim are actually rather weak if one considers how non-western approaches to the informational components of warfare have put forth their positions within a multidimensional context of strategy. This article ventures an Asian perspective that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. This article will pan out by first critically analyzing the predominantly American interpretation of IW as a set of five characteristics that can be contrasted to an Asian rival. Subsequently, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a generic Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately termed information operations (IO). These Asian IO features will be teased out through a reading of Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. An Asian IO approach will not distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it place a premium on liberal democratic ideology as a basis for information superiority. With the advent of cyberspace, information warfare (IW) boggles the military mind with its self-revelation as a weapon of mass disruption. Paralysis, rather than physical destruction, appears to be the outcome. Recent incidents between 2007 and 2013 illustrate the slippery interface between war and peace through the conflation of terrestrial order and disorder, cyberspatial chaos, and the lack of clarity of the source of the attack. In April 2007, the world's first full-scale cyberattack targeted the Republic of Estonia. The cause was publicly speculated by Estonian politicians and public opinion as an offline one: Russian residents in the former Soviet republic were vehemently taking to the streets and media to protest the government's removal of a Soviet era military memorial in the Estonian capital Tallinn. It did not help matters that since Estonia declared “independence” from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991, relations between Russia and Estonia had been either stagnant or strained. The attacks occurred in the context of Estonia being the most wired nation-state in Europe, with an estimated 90 percent of all domestic financial transactions being carried out online, and some 70 percent of tax returns being filed through the Internet. The so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks disrupted most “peacetime” economic life in the country and virtually paralyzed the government in Tallinn. Estonian defense minister Jaak Aaviksoo admitted that the hardest part about responding was the inability to verify the source of the attacks:“Some of those countries [e.g. Russia, Moldova, Ukraine] have many more serious problems than cybersecurity and cybercrime legislation. Secondly, sometimes there are only claims that people are acting from those geographic locations. We can't prove that. Like there are safe havens for terrorism—I mean, Afghanistan is one example, Yemen is emerging. We don't know about Nigeria. There are very many more safe havens in cyberspace than in real space.” What is interesting here is the conventional disorientation within which a government official assesses his country's first cyberwar. The same conundrum about the source of an attack was manipulated by Israel, North Korea, China, Russia, and nonstate groups named Anonymous and LulzSec, between 2007 and 2011 to launch attacks against commercial companies, foreign governments, and political parties on the pretexts of either private or undeclared vendettas. In 2006, the Bush Administration began inserting malware into Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz in order to map its computer vulnerabilities; since 2009, the Obama Administration had followed up with full-scale attacks to slow down the Iranian nuclear effort. Experts dubbed the cyberweapon “Stuxnet.” The United States was fingered as the source of Stuxnet, developed with Israeli collaboration, only after a journalist interviewed unnamed officials willing to leak the story. In August 2012, the computers at Saudi oil company Aramco were struck by a virus that systematically erased data on three-quarters of their databanks, replacing the data with an image of a burning American flag. No oil was spilled, nor burned, in this “attack” but computer experts flown in by the Saudis, including those from Symantec, ventured that this virus—dubbed “Shamoon” after a word embedded in its code—was the work of Iranian agents. These experts concluded that the data erasing command within Shamoon, dubbed “Wiper,” clearly imitated another virus named “Flame” that had mysteriously attacked Iranian oil companies right up till May 2012.4 Was Flame therefore a variant and an accessory to Stuxnet, and therefore attributable to Washington's virtual war against Tehran? If the attacking virus was replicated, who was the more culpable electronic combatant: the initiator or the imitator-cum-retaliator? In February 2013, a private web security company, Mandiant, publicly blamed the Chinese army unit 61398, situated in Shanghai, for a spate of cyber vandalism and theft at Google, Microsoft, RSA, and The New York Times, among other American corporations. The Chinese foreign ministry ingenuously countered that their country were equally at the receiving end of cyber attacks from unnamed states.5 The same Chinese spokesperson conveniently omitted any mention of domestic Internet vigilantes, as well as alienated, unemployed, computer literate college graduates within the People's Republic. This article ventures that generating open-ended paralysis and manipulating this vagary behind the source of an attack could well be strategy in itself. This is the core of an Asian prescription for information operations (IO). For starters, some terminological clarification is needed to indicate the maneuverable space within IO in contrast to IW. IW has been treated by its foremost American proponents as a paradigmatic displacement of conventional offline warfighting. But the reasons for such a claim are actually rather weak if one considers non-western approaches to informational components of warfare. For a working definition, this article shall define IW as the use of symbolic resources to penetrate the enemy's secrecy and confidence for the purpose of winning a war on one's own terms. The proximate concept of IO refers to that entire range of symbolic resources straddling both military and civilian spheres that are aimed at achieving national objectives in both peacetime and wartime. These include psychological operations (PSYOPS), military deception (MILDEC), electronic countermeasures warfare, and public diplomacy. IW remains IO's predecessor. The aim of this article is to supply an Asian perspective on IO that can potentially offer a more nuanced contribution to the study of IW. The appeal of pondering an Asian perspective lies in opening up the military mind to insights from a different civilization with its attendant particularistic philosophies. Civilizations are desirable sources of ideas given the fact that they are accumulations of wisdom and praxis across time and space directed by conscious human endeavor. This human endeavor aspires to distinguish one section of humanity from the rest.6 Attitudes toward understanding IO in all its complexities can therefore be enhanced through interaction with a non-western body of pre-digital wisdom. The deployment of information for strategic uses is in all probability culturally filtered. The agent deploying information to convert or confuse others is exercising a power over the creation of meaning. This is a point reiterated prominently by social constructivists in political science, international relations, and in linguistics.7 It will consequently be argued that an Asian way of IO does not try to delineate the physical, the permissible, and democratic elements from the intangible, nonpermissible, and nondemocratic. This is a call for dialogue with non-western strategy rather than an ideological confrontation. To some extent, the survey produced by James Yin and Philip Taylor of four Asian countries' existing equivalents of IW doctrines and capabilities breaks ground for the current enterprise.^{8} That said, Yin and Taylor have merely described the existing state of operational profiles of Asian IW and imputed an Asian perspective to them. This cannot be adequate since critics might argue that the existing state of Asian IW doctrines are merely adaptations of western models of PSYOPS from the Cold War and later. It is also quite revealing that in 1955, with Cold War insurgencies in East Asia rising to fever pitch, Edward Katzenbach and Gene Hanrahan commented that Mao Zedong's revolutionary appeal among Southeast Asian communists lies in its “monopoly of patience” and its corollary that the strategy of the superior military mind “has very little to do with technological superiority.”^{9} Given space constraints within an article-length reflection, I sample only three Asian strategic thinkers who are prominent in classic strategic studies readers such as Peter Paret's Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age^{10} and other specialist surveys of unconventional warfare:^{11} Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap. Omitted are other Asian voices of varying historical and geographical pedigrees. Nonetheless, by examining Sun Tzu, Mao Zedong, and Vo Nguyen Giap, readers should be able to discern what a more careful consideration of Asian perspectives could yield. Table 1 illustrates the subtle contrasts between Western IW and Asian IO approaches which this article intends to show. Taking a foundational approach to sketching Asian IO, this article will begin by surveying the predominantly American interpretation of IW in terms of a number of IW characteristics that should be opened up to critical contrast to Asian ways. The American interpretation of IW will be analyzed in terms of five characteristics: liberal democratic modernization, cyber delinquency, bureaucratic confusion, cyber power, and soft power. Subsequently, via Sun Tzu, Mao, and Giap, we will elaborate a list of features likely to characterize a more Asian IW approach, which I will argue, is more appropriately redescribed as IO. To generalize, an Asian IO approach is ideologically agnostic and unlikely to distinguish wartime and peacetime applications, and neither will it distinguish strategy from tactics; moreover, it will indulge in subterfuge.",
