It reviews the civil-military interagency cooperation and aims to identify factors that could jeopardize it. First, it provides a theoretical background for the research and then according to interviews and surveys, the factors with the highest negative impact are recognized. Based on this research, the most significant challenges in bridging the gap between civilian and military worlds seems to be power and budget struggles and a lack of political direction on cyber matters from leaders.\n# KEYWORDS\nCyber defense; cyber power; cyber security; civil-military; cyberspace\n# Introduction\nCyber power has become a pressing issue for many nation states since the militarization of cyberspace has already begun and it is one of the latest additions to the power family tree (Dunn Caverty, 2018, p. 306). The trend of offensive cyberspace operations conducted by nation-states or state-sponsored groups together with the rise of serious cyber attacks on critical infrastructures¹ naturally increase political and military interest in cyber power and relevant state capabilities. It also calls for a review of a national approach to defense in cyberspace, where defense is no longer just a military issue and to gain a real cyber power and cyber effectiveness is possible only through the whole-of-government (civilian and military) cooperation.\nNowadays, cyber threats are very serious. While contemporary cyber attacks are usually still happening rather on a smaller scale or with lower impact, they may quickly rise to an enormous problem for national security and defense. We could have seen it recently when a lot of minor cyber attacks at high frequency were targeting health care facilities during the\nCONTACT Roman Pačka\n\\odot\n roman.packa@gmail.com\n\\odot\n Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University, Joštova 218/10, 602 00 Brno, Czech Republic.\n© 2021 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nglobal COVID-19 crisis (INTERPOL, 2020) and they seriously threatened the national security of several countries. The trend of escalating cyber maneuvers and the increasing prominence of cyber operations within the military is also apparent. It has already caused the development of offensive state cyber capabilities in many European and NATO countries. The modern warfare is currently shaped by new disruptive technologies and the militarization of cyberspace (Gomez, 2016; Smeets, 2018).\nThe visible product of the militarization is the cyberspace itself. It has officially become the next domain for warfighting according to NATO (NATO, 2016), placing it alongside the traditional battlegrounds of air, land, and sea. This means every state should be able to defend itself in cyberspace and move toward creating military effects in, through, and from cyberspace. However, cyberspace is very different military domain because it is the only domain created by a man and it is highly technical. Therefore, the cyberspace is heavily dependent on heterogeneous, typically civilian, players with different preferences. It is complex, hard to visualize, and constantly changing. Finally, the cyberspace is clearly a nongeographical domain, which also requires a shift of understanding for military commanders (Ablon et al. 2019, p. 8).\nDue to its unique nature, military and nonmilitary (civilian) spheres blur or erode more easily than in traditional (physical) domains. In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor. Nevertheless, the cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries. Specific challenges, such as the problem of attribution and anonymity, or the asymmetric characteristics of cyberspace results in the current situation where nation states must ensure a close civil-military collaboration within a state to achieve and gain cyber power.\nOn the one hand, this strong need for coordinated civil-military inter-agency teamwork exists to protect the nation against serious cyber threats and produce cyber effects. On the other hand, there is also a deficiency of experience and practice with that on both sides, and sometimes even the willingness to cooperate lacks as these two worlds (military and civilian/nonmilitary) are quite different and somewhat isolated. A few state actors such as Netherlands or the Czech Republic have already noticed the issue. From the military perspective, the new Dutch strategic vision for defense released by Dutch Ministry of Defence (MvD, Ministerie van Defensie) focuses on their partners outside the military organization and is going to devote greater attention to the role and task of the military in this gray zone of “strategic competition” between war and peace (MvD, 2020, p. 23). Next, the (civilian) national cyber security strategy of the Czech Republic for the years 2021--2025 created by their national cyber security authority\n(NUKIB, Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost) also calls for a common approach to cyber security and defense within the country and the improvement of the collaboration model and information sharing between military and nonmilitary actors (NUKIB, 2020, pp. 10--11).\nHence, this article intends to initiate and contribute to the discussion on civil-military interagency cooperation by considering possible factors that could spoil the establishing of an efficient integrated governmental framework for cyber defense. The article does not deal with the private sector or academia institutions such as universities nor think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It strictly focuses on the governmental interagency cooperation and response system and elaborates on factors that could affect or jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense between key state civilian (nonmilitary) and military entities, such as agencies responsible for CIIP (e.g. national Computer Security Incident Response Teams—CSIRTs), intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and departments of defense, including military cyber operations unit.\nOur main premise is that the ability of a nation state to gain cyber power leads through the efficient whole-of-government approach (so-called integrated government capability) as it is a crucial basis for achieving any power and control in cyberspace. Therefore, the article identifies the most significant barriers preventing this approach.\nResearchers are fully aware of the difficulty with the concept of cyber power, that systematic (empirical) analyses of the topic do not yet exist, and that the body of literature on cyber-power is small and fragmented. Hence, this article narrowly focuses only on the subset of the topic of cyber power and serves as another piece to the debate. It could also be a basis for further academic research or a source of inspiration for policy makers.\nData in this article are—with respect to the character of researched experts—valid mostly for the NATO countries. Recent development in this area is important from the global point of view. Firstly, due to the fact that NATO is the strongest military alliance in the contemporary world and it improves its cyber capabilities. Secondly, development in NATO countries can serve as a model for development in other parts of the world. And thirdly, recent trends in NATO have an indirect impact on the behavior of its adversaries in cyberspace.\n## Integrated government capability as an enabler for cyber power\nThe cyber is an instrument of national power and national states already use cyber means to advance their objectives (Willett, 2019, p. 86). The term “cyber power” has become common in security and strategy discourse (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 43) and it includes all forms of power in which\npower relations occur wholly or in part in or through cyberspace. However, cyber power is not created simply to exist, but rather to support other elements of national power—political, diplomatic, informational, military, and economic' (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 44).\nAccording to Klimburg (2011, p. 43), a nation's cyber power has three dimensions: (1) coordination of operational and policy aspects across governmental structures, (2) coherency of policy through international alliances and legal frameworks, and (3) cooperation of non-state cyber actors. In sum, this so-called Klimburg's Integrated capability model includes: Integrated government capability; Integrated systems capability; and Integrated national capability (Dunn Cavelty, 2018, p. 309). Klimburg claims that while the first two dimensions are important, the integrated national capability must be primarily reached because a major portion of a state's cyber capabilities lies outside direct government control. It is therefore essential to create this “whole-of-nation” cyber capability within a nation state.\nNevertheless, to follow this whole of nation approach is quite challenging for many nation states that are currently developing their cyber defensive and offensive capabilities. Hence, it is reasonable to argue with Klimburg that some nation states simply cannot create an efficient cooperation in cyberspace outside the government, while struggling with their own internal governmental part (so-called “whole-of-government” approach). For many of them, it is about the need to get the basics right first, which means to achieve the central coordination across governmental structures—integrated government capability. The ability of the government to deliver joint action which entails to attack and defend in cyberspace, to draft policy positions, and to share operational resources (Klimburg, 2011, pp. 173--174). In cyberspace, achieving this kind of coordination could be quite challenging for many nation states, because it includes the need for an efficient civil-military cooperation. A field that has been overlooked or marginalized for decades.\nThe issue of civil-military cooperation has already many aspects, specifics, and barriers in traditional operational domains, but in cyberspace, it has even more difficulties. To simply put, it could be hard to achieve efficient cooperation between military and nonmilitary organizations when governments are struggling at a strategic level to work out how to combine the capabilities of their armed forces with other instruments of national power (Inkster, 2017, p. 29). Even if the nation states and their specific civilian security (police, intelligence agencies and others) and military organizations could hold enough resources to theoretically gain cyber power, it is not entirely clear that they will have the ability to do it and perform efficient joint operations in cyberspace. For example, Bebber\n(2017, p. 427) mentions that there is a problem between a potential cyber power and a cyber effectiveness. Unlocking the power inherent in national capacities and different government actors to affect outcomes in the national interest is the key to cyber effectiveness and real cyber power (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 40). Thus, there is a difference between the available human and material resources and how they are utilized by the nation state to generate effects and support national political ends in and through cyberspace.\nFor nation states, it means to predominantly focus on joint cooperation on cyber defense, which is a multidisciplinary task that includes civilian and military state organization efforts. Only through the delivery of joint, defensive and offensive cyber operations and actions, the nation states could efficiently support their strategic security interests and achieve cyber power.\n## United by necessity: the militarization of cyberspace drives a need for civil—military cooperation on cyber defense\nAs Dunn Cavelty (2018, p. 309) points out, Klimburg's integrated capability model is consciously taking cyber power out of the context of projecting national interests coercively and adds a strong defensive cyber security element. Such a view highlights that cyber power and cyber security are intricately linked. However, Dunn Cavelty also adds that a true cyber power also needs to be able to “defend” against cyber threats. In today's view, it means to conduct cyber offensive and defensive military operations rather than a reactive and preventive approach embodied in cyber security. To simply put, there cannot be any true cyber power without a proper (civilian) cyber security and (military) cyber defense. These two environments must be inherently connected, and they must complement each other.\nEven though cyber security and cyber defense are dissimilar concepts and their definitions and theories often vary, they are still closely connected (Pačka, 2015). In this article, cyber security focuses on preventive and reactive measures in its nature, while the cyber defense could be more proactive and it allows to use military capacity and armed forces^{4}. Paraphrasing Clausewitz (1989), cyber defense could be the continuation of ensuring cyber security by other means, such as defensive and offensive cyber operations.\nNation states ensure their cyber security to improve the security and resilience of national infrastructures and services already for decades. Regarding the cyber defense, the governments all over the world has just started to build its capacity a few years ago. Specifically, they usually create\nrband new military cyber units and strive to defend the nation against the most serious cyber threats (Smeets). The issue of civil-military inter-agency cooperation on cyber defense is therefore relatively new. Not surprisingly, while there are numerous guidelines for cooperation between law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and national CSIRTs in cyber security (e.g. ENISA ; Pačka ; Skierka .), there is an insufficient practice and no handbook on cyber defense cooperation issue (Pačka), pp. 93--94).\nThe state practice could be quite challenging in that sense. There are factors such as the tendency of armies across the world to separate themselves from the rest of the nonmilitary security apparatus or the impossibility to ensure defense in cyberspace properly by a military actor alone by itself. In sum, synergy and cooperation with the rest of the national security actors who tackle cyber threats should be secured and exercised regularly. Given the fact that most of the cyberspace can be considered dual-use, it is simply difficult to separate the military and civilian realms (Droege), pp. 570, 576) and any harsh distinction simply does not work.\nAlthough, it is imminent that the segregation is present. It often rests on the assumption that the military and civilian agenda within the national security apparatus is distinct and should be kept distinct. According to Heinl, p. 38), this approach is caused historically. In the past, there was not a generally compelling need to engage civilian security authorities and agencies in military matters. Even large cyber attacks were usually not so significant to reach a threshold that would have activated the armed forces' response in previous years. Some authors (see Dunn Cavelty ; Wallace) persistently argued that the military role in cyberspace outside the context of armed conflict should be limited (Bigelow), p. 3), e.g. on the protection of military networks and information systems. Heinl contends that this was an understandable posture at that time. Even today, most cyber threats are directed against civilian (public or private) systems and networks and therefore have to be dealt (up to a certain threshold) by the targeted organizations themselves or by nonmilitary authorities responsible for cyber security or cyber crime (national CSIRTs, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies, if needed).\nFurthermore, the military's exact role and responsibilities in national cyber security or defense might remain vague from the institutional perspective. A long-term institutional practice within nation states supports this approach. When countries and its institutions usually define new roles and responsibilities of the armed forces or civilian authorities anywhere (including cyberspace), they look for analogies from the physical world and translate them as literally as possible. It means there could be a long-lasting consensus that armed forces should have a limited role in cyber crises\noutside of armed conflict (Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 72--73) and they want to just maintain the status quo, where military and civilian security or defense agencies are still somewhat isolated.\nNowadays, the debate has evolved significantly, especially due to increasing evidence of state or state-sponsored attacks on civilian cyberspace infrastructure (Bigelow, 2019, p. 3). The increased militarization of cyberspace is also an apparent trend these days (Gomez, 2016), and regular and irregular warfare are slowly losing their distinction due to the unique nature of cyberspace. Traditional norms of warfare, definitions of combatants and noncombatants, and even what constitutes military action or national casus belli are being turned upside down (TRADOC G-2, 2017, p. 20). It means the military role can simply no longer be limited to the traditional approach of engaging primarily in an armed conflict. It is particularly challenging to ensure national security and defense or even to wage a war without cooperation between military and nonmilitary (civilian) worlds these days. The cyber defense is about working with existing military, civilian, police, central and other structures, cooperation, and mixing missions of different actors with the same goal.\nHence, an advisable starting point for all nation states is to strive to set up an efficient cooperation between civilian authorities and agencies responsible for cyber security and armed forces with the mandate to conduct cyber defense operations. This cooperation framework should always start with the joint protection of those assets that are most essential for the country—critical (information) infrastructure. This is an especially important issue since civilian infrastructures are legitimate targets in case of serious cyber attacks or an armed conflict. And on the other hand, militaries as defenders of last resort for these infrastructures do not have the capacity to be familiar, let alone proficient, in the functioning of civilian networks (Tatar et al. 2017, p. 7).\n### CIIP as the core issue for cooperation\nCritical infrastructure protection (CIP) as a concept and practice was first explicitly articulated in the 1990s. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, CIP moved to the center of domestic security doctrine (Collier & Lakoff, 2008, p. 35), not only in the United States but also in other countries. Besides the physical protection of the critical infrastructure, cyber security has also become a significant issue in today's world. Cyber threats to the critical infrastructure emanate from a wide spectrum of prospective perpetrators: state-sponsored espionage and sabotage, international terrorism, domestic militants, malevolent hacktivists, or even disaffected insiders (Rudner, 2013, p. 453).\nThe broadening of this concept has created a new term—critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP). As for the critical infrastructure, even a disruption of critical information infrastructure could result in human death, injuries, or physical damage and its threatening could have a debilitating effect on the security of a given nation, its economy, and the public's safety or health. CIIP is therefore generally acknowledged to be an indispensable component of national security policy (Suter, 2007, p. 1) and this ability to ensure CIIP is critical regarding the cyber power of the nation state.\nNevertheless, today's common practice is that civilian authorities are responsible for coordinating cyber security incident response within the critical infrastructure and armed forces are being used only as an instrument of last resort in an armed conflict. It is important to realize that the CIIP is already a part of the cyber defense and it needs to be supported by cross-organizational collaboration to be effective. It is a joint endeavor (Skopik et al. 2016, p. 157). According to Heinl (2016, p. 38), the military has the responsibility for national security, which presumably includes the defense of the most extreme cyber threats to critical infrastructure. This common thread (at least in Europe) of limiting the role of the military in cyber security response (Boecke et al. 2015, p. 73) therefore calls for a comprehensive approach to civil-military cooperation on both—the cyber security and defense to achieve integrated government capacity. However, the main issue is still that while the military has usually little or no role in the protection of critical infrastructure during peacetime, it would be an enormously challenging task, during, e.g, the war or other cyber-enabled conflict. Hence, ensuring the CIIP only when some major crisis occurs could put the military forces in an uncomfortable position.\nIt is proposed that the CIIP should be a vital kernel for the cooperation on cyber defense between relevant civilian (nonmilitary) and military agencies within a state security apparatus. There is an apparent need to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks from both sides because any of these attacks can have the potential to threaten the national security and stability. For example, given the special nature of cyberspace, it is usually hard to attribute the attacker or the source of the attack in real-time. Attribution of cyber attacks is simply not an easy task. There are technical issues which complicate identifying cyber attackers (Yannakogeorgos, 2013, p. 2). At the beginning of nearly all cyber attacks, the culprit is unknown, and it is always reasonable to comprehend that it can be a state, state-sponsored group, terrorist, an activist, or just some criminal actor. Therefore, governments must approach the response to each serious cyber attack targeting the critical information infrastructure very seriously.\nTherefore, a strong demand for mutual collaboration, cooperation, and information sharing among all relevant civilian and military spheres is\n#\nR.

As it is apparent also from this research, the practice of crisis response, joint operations, training, and exercises between state civilian and military agencies often lacks and there are still numerous factors that could affect or jeopardize this kind of cooperation in the future.\n# Factors possibly jeopardizing civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense\nMany factors could render the cooperation between a diverse spectrum of civilian and military agencies problematic. While cyber-specific factors that could jeopardize cooperation have not been identified yet, the focus is on general factors that influence civil-military cooperation (e.g., in conflict resolution) and might also apply to cyber defense. Specifically, the identified factors are inspired and based on the work of Olson and Gregorian (2007) and complemented by the literature review and analysis. Only factors that could suit the cyber realm have been picked and modified for research purposes. All factors are divided into two main categories—political and organizational—with the possibility to identify other factors during the research (Table 1).\n# Political factors\nThe first factor is called incompatible objectives. Despite the common objective to ensure national (cyber) security, each national actor (civilian or military) could hold differing, and sometimes, mutually contradictory policy goals (Olson &amp; Gregorian, 2007, p. 7). Given the fact that each national organization has a different role in the national (cyber) security and defense system, it is quite logical and there could be a small deviation. Nevertheless, the ensuring of national security begins internally with all responsible national actors and their interagency cooperation. In an increasingly complex, multi-dimensional policy world, therefore the government must promote cooperation rather than competition among the various stakeholders (Whittaker et al., 2010, p. 32). If policy goals are excessively incompatible, it could result in conflict or friction among national organizations.\nThe second factor stands for conflicting definitions. Even different definitions could jeopardize cooperation. Many authors (see Futter, 2018, p. 201; Galinec et al. 2017, p. 274) state, little consensus exists about what the term ‘cyber' includes, refers to, or how it is being used. Regarding the terms of cyber security and cyber defense, the situation is similar. Since there are no ‘one-fits-all' definitions, there could be disputes between national actors about the nature or scope or meaning of the terms. These differing definitions could then lead to differing approaches on how to achieve efficient cyber defense and lead to a decrease in cooperation efficiency.\nConflicting theories could also endanger cooperation. Civilian and military institutions could have trouble coordinating at the operational, tactical, or strategic level, or even agreeing on an analysis of the problem, often because they are guided by radically different theories or assumptions about what causes problems or crises and how it can be resolved (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 9). This conceptual problem is closely related to the previous factor and contains conflicting theories on how to effectively ensure national cyber security and defense. It may cover a lot of issues, such as a discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in CIIP. While some institutions (e.g. national CSIRTs) strive to patch it immediately to secure the system, others (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement units, and others) attempt to exploit it and use it against the attacker (see Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 74--75; Pačka, 2019, pp. 71--74).\nThe last political factor represents a lack of political guidance, because the successes of each institution alone guarantee nothing in a large-scale national cyber crisis. Lack of political guidance, willpower, and support at the governmental level cannot be simply substituted. Already in 2014, Lewis (2014, p. 566) stated that whether the cyber issue reaches the top level of political leadership depends on factors such as personal interest, a direct experience of malicious cyber action, media attention or the salience of cybersecurity on their national and international agendas. Even the cyber agenda became very political in recent years, factors such as the depth of knowledge about the problem could be still an issue for politicians and other leaders. Lehto and Limnéll (2020, pp. 139, 146) therefore suggests that streamlining and strengthening strategic leadership are key aspects in making sure the cyber vision is achieved. The strong cyber leadership also prevent state agencies from operating solely in their siloes and based only on their objectives and needs. Hence, the lack of political guidance may result in many problems with the coordination. For example, insufficient resources, duplication of activities, uncertain rules of engagement in cyberspace, absence of ‘referees' to resolve competing positions, and unclear national law or jurisdictional boundaries between civilian and military\ninstitutions. Despite NATO officially recognizes cyberspace as the domain of warfare, it could still be a serious concern in many NATO countries. For example, according to the statement of retired Gen. Keith Alexander, even the United States (the pioneer of cyber warfare) still lacked “clear rules of engagement” for conducting offensive cyber operations three years ago (Lyngaas, 2018). Hence, the lack of political guidance represents another factor that could negatively influence civil-military cooperation.\n### Organizational factors\nStructural barriers could be a strong organizational factor since rigid organizational structures represent a big obstacle to any kind of cooperation. Bureaucratic and daily operational constraints tend to stifle cooperation or any innovation and favor the status quo (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 11). In cyber realm, we could say that generally in smaller countries organizations tend to be less hierarchical and rigid. As people know each other personally, they tend to trust others more than in impersonal interactions, and greater flexibility enables them to share information swiftly. However, even in these smaller countries some barriers between civilian and military organizations naturally persists (Pernik & Tuohy, 2014, p. 4, 6). Hence, the factor could have a serious impact on civil-military cooperation in cyberspace as well.\nNext, organizational culture is a recognized term that describes unwritten norms, rules, and customs in an establishment. The literature suggests (see Arnaud & Tinoco, 2013, p. 37) that organizational culture differs between industries as well as professions. The civilian and military culture is no exception and may cause friction within the national interagency cooperation. There is a general tendency among all organizations and sometimes even across units within the same organization to adopt substantially different planning and implementation terminology or to describe different processes and outcomes even when employing the same terminology (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 11). On the other hand, cultural interoperability among organizations stems from interagency understanding, trust, and confidence that require close and ongoing training, liaisons, and exchanges (Pernik & Tuohy, 2014, p. 3). Different organizational cultures could simply represent an important factor in the issue of civil-military cooperation. Moreover, the lack of knowledge about one another's organizational identity in the meaning of traditions, culture, images, and fundamental goals are represented in this factor.\nEven organizational independence could be for certain (civilian or military) organizations a higher priority than coordination with other organizations as they are not prepared to follow the lead of another organization (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 13). Some institutions could see cooperation\nas a fundamental threat to their operational flexibility. While cooperation is perceived as the key to cyber security and defense, the factor of preferring independence to cooperation could be an essential one.\nAs a significant factor appears also a competition for resources. State organizations such as ministries might not cooperate especially when there is a political system with strong line ministries, departmentalization, and silo arrangements. Coordination is therefore often limited to minimal coordination (Christensen et al. 2015) and sometimes it could also lead to competition. The competition could be about different resources such as status, power, recognition, financial resources and influence (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 14). It is worth to mention that all state organizations are fully aware of cyber security and defense being one of the fastest growing fields today. It means there is still a space to set new standards, define new roles, and deliver new tasks. In this regard, some of them could also compete to take over some responsibilities from other agencies. This unhealthy competition might also result in not sharing of responsibility, agenda, or information and intelligence about cyber threats with other partners within the state.\nWhile abundant state practice in conventional warfare exists, cyber defense is a relatively new and very specific area in which a lack of proven models and inexperience is often apparent. Difficulties arise when both civilian and military institutions are stretched beyond their traditional areas of expertise (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 15), such as traditional warfighting, intelligence gathering, law-enforcing, or CIP. In the field of cyber defense, lack of best practices and guidelines (see Pačka, 2019, pp. 93--94) might lead to many wrong strategic decisions and choosing a flawed attitude toward cooperation.\nFinally, idiosyncratic or personality factors could play a key role in cyber defense cooperation. Some states might rely heavily on individuals with considerable power and specific attitudes. Stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are not uncommon within and across organizations. Sometimes the willingness to cooperate arises from personal likes or dislikes (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 16). This unprofessional behavior might lead to a decrease or cooperation between state organizations.\n## Scope and method\nThe article deals with the topic of cyber power that could nation states achieve through the development of integrated government capacity. The empirical part of the research focuses on one of the main problems in today's whole of government approach in cyberspace—the issue of the cooperation between civilian and military institutions on cyber defense. It is focused particularly on central government departments, agencies, and\nother civilian or military state institutions that are predominantly involved in ensuring cyber defense. Whole of nation approach that includes society, private sector companies, NGOs, or academia is not the focus of the study, but it is considered as the next step in achieving cyber power.\nNamely, the study focuses on the dynamics between: the civilian entities responsible for CIIP (e.g. agencies that usually operate so-called national CSIRTs),law enforcement units,military and civilian intelligence agenciesand departments of defense, including the army and special cyber command units.\nThe research has a mixed design, which includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. To measure all the factors, the researchers use quantitative data from surveys (see below) and then they use qualitative data from interviews that provide rich descriptions of the phenomena and generate new premises. An approach is primarily inductive (Corbin & Strauss, 2008), which means the research moves from the specific experiences and practice of respondents to the general to explain the phenomena and identify major challenges in civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense within a state.\nThe methods of data collection are document analysis, in-depth semi-structured interviews, and surveys. Getting the right participants is critical to the success of the research and simultaneously it constitutes the main limitation of the study. The willingness to participate and the consent of all participants have not been an issue since the confidentiality is ensured and outcomes are sanitized. However, it turned out that there is only a limited number of experts and practitioners who deals with this specific topic and could have been reached by researchers at the same time. Therefore, the researchers focus on a smaller amount of participants but did a more detailed interviews. It also means that participants were purposively selected by the judgment of the researchers because sampling for proportionality is not the concern of this research (Morse, 2007). Only participants who could have offered valuable insight and high-quality answers into the topic were selected. Respondent-driven sampling (also known as snowball sampling) has also been used to involve more experts and practitioners from the civilian and military spheres in the research. All respondents came from NATO countries as this research is relevant mainly for the transatlantic area. At the time of this research these participants were serving in the military, working for intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies, CSIRTs or relevant ministries. Some of them were also experts\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED SECURITY RESEARCH\n449\nTable 2.

The semistructured interviews have been conducted online or face to face and the surveys have been completed in the same way.\nThe empirical research was to address the following question:\nWhat factors could significantly jeopardize civil-military interagency cooperation toward cyber defense within a nation-state?\nBased on the literature review and an analysis of the authors, ten factors of political and organizational nature that could have a strong influence on civil-military cooperation have been identified and then discussed with the respondents during the interviews and surveys. All respondents waged and deliberated each factor, shared their personal views on how important and relevant each factor is, and highlighted it on the impact scale (negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme). Finally, they had an option to add further factors or categories (Table 2).\nBased on these findings, factors with the highest impact (scoring moderate—high to extreme) on civil-military cooperation in cyber defense were recognized and highlighted. Finally, these findings also shed light and form a discussion on the second question:\nHow nation states could gain cyber power through the integrated government capacity?\nConducting this research will help states and their institutions to make better decisions about their approach to cooperation on cyber defense. It could also serve as a basis for future academic research and debate.\n## Findings\nAccording to 13 interviews and surveys with experts and practitioners from civilian and military agencies related to cyber defense, the most significant factors jeopardizing the cooperation on cyber defense are as follows (see Table 3). The findings confirm the necessity of the factors we identified and generate new premises that deserve further attention.\n## Political factors\n### Incompatible objectives (impact: moderate—high)\nMost of the respondents scored this factor as essential and claim that all national institutions or agencies must understand that the state has one\n#\nR.

The root cause of the problem here might not necessarily be related to cyber security and defense but rather to the ability and recognition of these topics being a cross-government issue. Building on that, it also turns out that the objectives may not necessarily be incompatible in some cases, but their priorities may differ. It means the cooperation in this area is for some institutions simply not nearly as important as for others.\nNext, some respondents directly highlighted particularly the contrast between the military intelligence (as part of both the military and intelligence community) and cyber security community (national CSIRTs). They added that the problem might lie in the natural isolationist approach of intelligence agencies in general. Moreover, they stated that this approach is not relevant only to civil-military cooperation. It is sometimes relevant even to military and intel-military cooperation, i.e., between military intelligence agencies and the \"green army.\"\n# Conflicting definitions (impact: low—moderate)\nThis factor has almost the lowest score among respondents. Respondents had claimed that the challenge could be easily overcome by combined training and joint cyber exercises and operations. Promoting dialogue and open discussion among the civilian and military community may also solve this problem. Some of the respondents added that conflicting definitions affect primarily policymakers, not (civilian or military) cyber practitioners (at the operational level). In reality, they should figure out these differences fast, adapt to them, and then cooperate effectively.\nIt means it is less of an issue. The lack of definitions should not hinder progress or cooperation. The aphorism \"Perfect is the enemy of good\" has also been used in the interviews. Those differing views might be useful and (if properly managed) contribute to a constructive and more sustainable consensus between organizations.\nIn sum, it seems that a lack of convergence between terminologies used by civilian and military actors does not represent an additional barrier to civil-military cooperation.\n### Conflicting theories (impact: moderate)\nThe factor of conflicting theories has a moderate impact and similar answers as the previous one. Some of the respondents do not perceive it as an immense problem that requires extensional attention at the national level. At a higher level of crisis (i.e. state of emergency), there should be clear national response structures and procedures that can be activated. Below that, although, there may be disagreement and discussion on “who owns the problem” and thus how to coordinate appropriately the full set of resources. However, the most important is to have a common and shared purpose according to respondents. Conflicting theories may have an impact, but well-developed professionals should be able to reach a consensus.\nRespondents also said it is a common feature of the state itself and it is linked to the factor of incompatible objectives. Each actor within the state security system has a slightly different goal and could be guided by different theories or assumptions. Moreover, certain areas of cyber security and defense such as vulnerability weaponizing will always be disputable and it is not necessarily just a civilian-military problem, but also intelligence vs. defensive mandate agencies; or intelligence agencies and law enforcement vs. national CSIRTs.\n### Lack of political guidance (impact: high—extreme)\nThe lack of political guidance and unclear laws in cyber defense is the most critical factor in the research. Most participants agreed that there cannot be any effective action and unity of effort without a clear high-level political guidance supported by an appropriate legal framework and adequate oversight. In states where this situation occurs, it is the root cause of the problem of friction between the civilian and military spheres. Without clear roles and responsibilities and overall strategic guidance, different actors (civilian or military) have less ability to execute in complementary manners.\nNevertheless, some of the military practitioners also pointed out that the factor is relevant especially during peacetime. In times of war or other conflicts, in which armed forces are empowered to perform actions that they would normally not be permitted to do, the impact of this factor would be reduced. In these cases, there is no time or need for extensive political guidance or strict compliance with the national law. Armed forces have\nclear procedures to deal with such situations and they are ready to cooperate closely even with civilian security organizations and others.\n### Organizational factors\n### Structural barriers (impact: moderate—high)\nThis factor seems to be significant. According to some respondents, bureaucracy and operational constraints can make especially the initial cooperation hard. However, once organizational relationships are built, it is much easier to deepen them. In contrast, many others remain in favor of maintaining the status quo. Especially those whom the main responsibility is different than cyber, might still impede cooperation, as they don't see priority in cyber and don't want to innovate. In some states, the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative “from the bottom” (from the operational level). Some military practitioners have also highlighted the problem of horizontal vs. vertical cooperation in the armed forces. They have apparently the necessary internal procedures to cooperate effectively among military units of all kinds (both vertically and horizontally) in place. However, regarding the horizontal cooperation outside the military world, the military often lacks adequate procedures and processes on how to cooperate swiftly and effectively with civilian (nonmilitary) organizations.\n### Organizational cultures (impact: low—moderate)\nSurprisingly, different organizational cultures are perceived by the respondents as the least relevant factor. Only a minority of respondents feel the differences between military and civilian culture as a big obstacle for cooperation. Most of them reported that cultures nowadays can be respected, and they can be learned. Furthermore, all these differences could be more beneficial than restraining. Mutual knowledge is a matter of communication and cooperation, and both worlds would and probably could improve their organization using gained knowledge and experience from its counterparts.\nBoth experts and practitioners from civilian and military spheres agreed that this challenge can be overcome easily by simply working more together. Next, since it is still relatively rare to see specific career paths for military cyber operators, many on active duty will leave and join the industry and civilian public sector, which does serve to increase the understanding of each other's culture, organizational identity, and so on. Even though different cultures exist, the far bigger factor is apparently overall policy differences rather than cultural differences.\nOrganizational independence (impact: moderate)\nIndependence as a higher priority than cooperation is also not seen as an essential factor. Almost all respondents agreed that in most cases, this is not an issue. Although, few of them mentioned the problem of the isolationistic approach of intelligence agencies again. They also shared some of their personal experiences that underpin the presumption of some agencies to prefer independence and operational flexibility to cooperation in (both civilian and military) intelligence agencies.\n### Competition for resources (impact: high)\nAnother high scoring factor is competition for financial resources, status, power, recognition, and influence. Nearly all respondents saw the factor as a relevant barrier and almost all of them ranked the impact as “high.” The competition for resources is an issue especially in an environment where the national roles and responsibilities in cyber security and defense are still not clarified properly. It leads to the situation in which every institution is trying to get a piece of the cyber agenda for itself. This competition could jeopardize the cooperation a lot. Some respondents have also stated that it is mainly a matter of a strategic (not operational) level of cooperation between institutions and the problem is not exclusive to civilian and military cooperation again.\n### Inexperience and lack of proven models (impact: moderate—high)\nThe lack of proven models and inexperience seems to be a very relevant factor in the cyber security and defense area. It is no wonder since it is still a relatively new area for both civilian and military institutions. Some respondents even called the current situation as a startup era of cyber defense. Especially for more rigid military institutions, it could have an extremely negative impact until the necessary practice and experience are gained. According to some, one of the main obstacles in this issue could be also a lack of general cyber awareness and education of “non-specialists” and leaders at all levels. The major problem with cyber defense for a “nonspecialist” is that it's hard to visualize. The way to overcome this could be, e.g. cyber security exercises, tailored especially for high-level management. Finally, respondents see this factor as a great opportunity to start a discussion among all civilian and military institutions. It could be the motivation for some states to create an effective national system of cyber defense from scratch.\n### Idiosyncratic/personality factors (impact: moderate—high)\nThe last factor has a moderate to high impact. The human factor in collaboration on cyber defense is apparently as important as everywhere else. Although cyberspace is a technology-driven world, people are still at the\ncore of it and they are vulnerable to idiosyncratic disputes. Not surprisingly, those respondents who had a real-life experience with it had scored higher than those without it. Some of them have also added that this factor is especially important in the phase of initiation and establishment of cooperation between entities. On the other hand, given the bureaucracy and the way how state institutions work, this effect might be marginalized in the long term. It means that the impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes can be minimized over policy design in the cyber defense and related security areas.\n## Conclusion: factors jeopardizing the development of integrated government capability identified\nThere are many ways how governments can gain, achieve and project cyber power. For example, Healey (2016) claims that still too much emphasis is currently placed on the success or failure of offensive and defensive capabilities, rather than other factors and on long-term national security outcomes. It is apparent that these capabilities are and will be very closely linked to the concept of cyber power, and that both policy (decision) makers and academics are interested in it for obvious reasons. Next, it is also possible to argue that an efficient cyber defense is the focal prerequisite for gaining and increasing power in cyberspace, since it is almost impossible to project power in cyberspace when the nation states have insufficient military power. However, this hard-cyber power approach to winning in cyberspace through military domination is plausibly short-sighted. Nation states should really aim to incorporate many other variables into their grand strategies and policies in cyberspace and use a holistic approach to the integrated government capacity to achieve cyber power. Therefore, this article focused on the identification of factors that could jeopardize integrated government capacity (or so-called whole of government approach) in cyber defense and more specifically the focus was narrowed down to the field of civil-military interagency cooperation within a nation state.\nResearch has demonstrated that in today's hyper-connected world, the traditional state practice just fades away. Global uncomfortable changes in warfare domains gradually force states to rethink many aspects of their military strategies and policies, including cyber defense. With cyber threats evolving into new, complex forms, the lack of fresh, modern solutions at the national level becomes a handicap and will make it difficult for the nation state to project its cyber power.\nWith the understanding of the extensiveness of the cyber issue and its dynamic nature, six critical areas have been identified where further consideration is needed. The area could strongly affect the establishment of\nintegrated government capacity or a strategic framework for cyber power in general.\nAccording to findings, the most important factors (for the lowest to highest impact) are:Idiosyncratic/Personality factors;Incompatible objectives;Structural barriers;Inexperience and lack of proven models;Competition for resources;Lack of guidance by political leaders.\nThe impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are apparent even in the world of cyber defense. According to practice, rationality is simply not always present. Subjective elements, such as human factors, could easily undermine the will and trust between agencies and make cooperation impossible. Hence, nation states should pay attention even to this factor which seems to be minor, but like everywhere else, it could grow into a big issue. On the other hand, the effect of the factor could be minimized through policy design in the cyber defense and security areas.\nNext, the incompatible objectives of each state agency could bring a lot of problems to the cooperation on cyber defense. Cyberspace itself is a cross-cutting domain and ensuring cyber defense means to deal with a cross-government issue. There is still a lack of common understanding among decision-makers or chiefs of relevant agencies and departments that the issue is a national topic, nor the responsibility of one or a few agencies in the state. A consensus on cyber defense should be reached across military and nonmilitary institutions and joint prioritization should be done as well on the governmental level. Especially, the intelligence agencies should be more open to cooperation with other relevant actors and leave their traditional isolationist approach within the state security apparatus.\nStructural barriers to cooperation, such as bureaucracy and operational constraints, can make cooperation hard as well. Maintaining the status quo and a lack of willingness to change the agenda or perform new activities and tasks is another issue that could easily jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense. These barriers are also seen as hardly removable as the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative. Decisions should come from the top in this regard. It is primarily a military issue and the army's way of conducting business. The problem of facilitating horizontal cooperation outside the military world is evident and should be overcome to ensure cyber defense more effectively and on time.\nLack of experience and shortage of best practice is an unsurprisingly an essential factor that could negatively impact the cooperation on cyber defense. It could be an enormous problem especially for the more rigid military, but in contrast, it could be a great opportunity to approach the challenge and establish a new and effectively functioning system of cyber defense cooperation between civilians and military spheres.\nIt is also perceived from the practice that state agencies or ministries are not an exception regarding power and budget struggles. With countries focusing on the new challenges posed by cyber threats and developing their capabilities to tackle them, there is also a new opportunity to gain more political power or financial resources from the state budget. These struggles are not exclusive to civilian and military dichotomy; however, they could easily result in a rivalry between state agencies. It is not perhaps exclusive to cyber security and defense only but could be happening in other trending agendas such as hybrid warfare or space security.\nThe most significant challenge in bridging the obvious gap between civilian and military actors seems to be the lack of political direction and a clear vision on cyber matters from political leaders. It is sometimes a result of scattering the national responsibility for cyber defense among too many civilian and military institutions, together with the lack of enlightened politicians eager to lead in cyber defense effectively. The main issue here could be that leaders must meticulously review all existing policies in the context of cyber defense to ensure cyber defense properly.\nFinally, a lot of respondents also mentioned the importance of the legal and ethical aspects of this kind of cooperation. Legal elements complement political and organizational factors and they are also implied within them to some extent. Cyber defense as a mechanism of responding to the sheer scale of cyber threats is not just a technical discipline, it is linked to a vast range of legal and ethical issues. Therefore, the cyber defense principles, measures, and responsibilities of each actor must be enshrined in the law to protect society from abuses of power and guarantee citizens their rights and freedoms. However, besides that, it also helps to set clear responsibilities of official authorities dealing with cyber defense and it provides a solid ground for the cooperation. In contrast, the lack of relevant legislation or legal vagueness makes setbacks for any kind of cooperation.\nAll these factors could seriously jeopardize the unity of effort at the governmental level and overall cooperation in cyber defense. Therefore, nation states should continuously review their system of collaboration among relevant state military nonmilitary actors and focus on these sets of factors. In practice, it is obvious that all negative factors could be overcome or prevented only when a clear vision and leadership eclipse the self-interest of agencies. States and their decision-makers should approach cyber defense\nas a new agenda where creating a symbiotic relationship across both civilian and military agencies is necessary. The classic distinctions between military and civilian worlds are simply less clear-cut in cyber defense. If the nation state has an ambition to gain and project cyber power, it should make the joint cyber defense a cornerstone of plans for future development and strategic orientation. A unification of differing perceptions of the mission and each other's role within the cyber defense system is needed to establish a fully functioning integrated government capacity. A culture of shared responsibility must be inherent too.\nBased on the findings, it is also possible to make some recommendations for a proper working model of cooperation on cyber defense. It should be based on governmental level actions such as: regular joint cyber defense exercises at both technical and strategic level; operational situational awareness and intensive information sharing and exchange; clarifying the exact roles and responsibilities in the national (cyber) defense system and making cyber leaders from all relevant decision-makers and head of agencies. Especially the enlightened leaders can manage and drive their institution to become a better counterpart for cooperation.",

It reviews the civil-military interagency cooperation and aims to identify factors that could jeopardize it. First, it provides a theoretical background for the research and then according to interviews and surveys, the factors with the highest negative impact are recognized. Based on this research, the most significant challenges in bridging the gap between civilian and military worlds seems to be power and budget struggles and a lack of political direction on cyber matters from leaders.\n# KEYWORDS\nCyber defense; cyber power; cyber security; civil-military; cyberspace\n# Introduction\nCyber power has become a pressing issue for many nation states since the militarization of cyberspace has already begun and it is one of the latest additions to the power family tree (Dunn Caverty, 2018, p. 306). The trend of offensive cyberspace operations conducted by nation-states or state-sponsored groups together with the rise of serious cyber attacks on critical infrastructures¹ naturally increase political and military interest in cyber power and relevant state capabilities. It also calls for a review of a national approach to defense in cyberspace, where defense is no longer just a military issue and to gain a real cyber power and cyber effectiveness is possible only through the whole-of-government (civilian and military) cooperation.\nNowadays, cyber threats are very serious. While contemporary cyber attacks are usually still happening rather on a smaller scale or with lower impact, they may quickly rise to an enormous problem for national security and defense. We could have seen it recently when a lot of minor cyber attacks at high frequency were targeting health care facilities during the\nCONTACT Roman Pačka\n\\odot\n roman.packa@gmail.com\n\\odot\n Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University, Joštova 218/10, 602 00 Brno, Czech Republic.\n© 2021 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nglobal COVID-19 crisis  and they seriously threatened the national security of several countries. The trend of escalating cyber maneuvers and the increasing prominence of cyber operations within the military is also apparent. It has already caused the development of offensive state cyber capabilities in many European and NATO countries. The modern warfare is currently shaped by new disruptive technologies and the militarization of cyberspace .\nThe visible product of the militarization is the cyberspace itself. It has officially become the next domain for warfighting according to NATO , placing it alongside the traditional battlegrounds of air, land, and sea. This means every state should be able to defend itself in cyberspace and move toward creating military effects in, through, and from cyberspace. However, cyberspace is very different military domain because it is the only domain created by a man and it is highly technical. Therefore, the cyberspace is heavily dependent on heterogeneous, typically civilian, players with different preferences. It is complex, hard to visualize, and constantly changing. Finally, the cyberspace is clearly a nongeographical domain, which also requires a shift of understanding for military commanders .\nDue to its unique nature, military and nonmilitary (civilian) spheres blur or erode more easily than in traditional (physical) domains. In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor. Nevertheless, the cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries. Specific challenges, such as the problem of attribution and anonymity, or the asymmetric characteristics of cyberspace results in the current situation where nation states must ensure a close civil-military collaboration within a state to achieve and gain cyber power.\nOn the one hand, this strong need for coordinated civil-military inter-agency teamwork exists to protect the nation against serious cyber threats and produce cyber effects. On the other hand, there is also a deficiency of experience and practice with that on both sides, and sometimes even the willingness to cooperate lacks as these two worlds (military and civilian/nonmilitary) are quite different and somewhat isolated. A few state actors such as Netherlands or the Czech Republic have already noticed the issue. From the military perspective, the new Dutch strategic vision for defense released by Dutch Ministry of Defence (MvD, Ministerie van Defensie) focuses on their partners outside the military organization and is going to devote greater attention to the role and task of the military in this gray zone of “strategic competition” between war and peace . Next, the (civilian) national cyber security strategy of the Czech Republic for the years 2021--2025 created by their national cyber security authority\n(NUKIB, Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost) also calls for a common approach to cyber security and defense within the country and the improvement of the collaboration model and information sharing between military and nonmilitary actors .\nHence, this article intends to initiate and contribute to the discussion on civil-military interagency cooperation by considering possible factors that could spoil the establishing of an efficient integrated governmental framework for cyber defense. The article does not deal with the private sector or academia institutions such as universities nor think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It strictly focuses on the governmental interagency cooperation and response system and elaborates on factors that could affect or jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense between key state civilian (nonmilitary) and military entities, such as agencies responsible for CIIP (e.g. national Computer Security Incident Response Teams—CSIRTs), intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and departments of defense, including military cyber operations unit.\nOur main premise is that the ability of a nation state to gain cyber power leads through the efficient whole-of-government approach (so-called integrated government capability) as it is a crucial basis for achieving any power and control in cyberspace. Therefore, the article identifies the most significant barriers preventing this approach.\nResearchers are fully aware of the difficulty with the concept of cyber power, that systematic (empirical) analyses of the topic do not yet exist, and that the body of literature on cyber-power is small and fragmented. Hence, this article narrowly focuses only on the subset of the topic of cyber power and serves as another piece to the debate. It could also be a basis for further academic research or a source of inspiration for policy makers.\nData in this article are—with respect to the character of researched experts—valid mostly for the NATO countries. Recent development in this area is important from the global point of view. Firstly, due to the fact that NATO is the strongest military alliance in the contemporary world and it improves its cyber capabilities. Secondly, development in NATO countries can serve as a model for development in other parts of the world. And thirdly, recent trends in NATO have an indirect impact on the behavior of its adversaries in cyberspace.\n## Integrated government capability as an enabler for cyber power\nThe cyber is an instrument of national power and national states already use cyber means to advance their objectives . The term “cyber power” has become common in security and strategy discourse  and it includes all forms of power in which\npower relations occur wholly or in part in or through cyberspace. However, cyber power is not created simply to exist, but rather to support other elements of national power—political, diplomatic, informational, military, and economic' .\nAccording to Klimburg (2011, p. 43), a nation's cyber power has three dimensions: (1) coordination of operational and policy aspects across governmental structures, (2) coherency of policy through international alliances and legal frameworks, and (3) cooperation of non-state cyber actors. In sum, this so-called Klimburg's Integrated capability model includes: Integrated government capability; Integrated systems capability; and Integrated national capability (Dunn Cavelty, 2018, p. 309). Klimburg claims that while the first two dimensions are important, the integrated national capability must be primarily reached because a major portion of a state's cyber capabilities lies outside direct government control. It is therefore essential to create this “whole-of-nation” cyber capability within a nation state.\nNevertheless, to follow this whole of nation approach is quite challenging for many nation states that are currently developing their cyber defensive and offensive capabilities. Hence, it is reasonable to argue with Klimburg that some nation states simply cannot create an efficient cooperation in cyberspace outside the government, while struggling with their own internal governmental part (so-called “whole-of-government” approach). For many of them, it is about the need to get the basics right first, which means to achieve the central coordination across governmental structures—integrated government capability. The ability of the government to deliver joint action which entails to attack and defend in cyberspace, to draft policy positions, and to share operational resources . In cyberspace, achieving this kind of coordination could be quite challenging for many nation states, because it includes the need for an efficient civil-military cooperation. A field that has been overlooked or marginalized for decades.\nThe issue of civil-military cooperation has already many aspects, specifics, and barriers in traditional operational domains, but in cyberspace, it has even more difficulties. To simply put, it could be hard to achieve efficient cooperation between military and nonmilitary organizations when governments are struggling at a strategic level to work out how to combine the capabilities of their armed forces with other instruments of national power . Even if the nation states and their specific civilian security (police, intelligence agencies and others) and military organizations could hold enough resources to theoretically gain cyber power, it is not entirely clear that they will have the ability to do it and perform efficient joint operations in cyberspace. For example, Bebber\n(2017, p. 427) mentions that there is a problem between a potential cyber power and a cyber effectiveness. Unlocking the power inherent in national capacities and different government actors to affect outcomes in the national interest is the key to cyber effectiveness and real cyber power . Thus, there is a difference between the available human and material resources and how they are utilized by the nation state to generate effects and support national political ends in and through cyberspace.\nFor nation states, it means to predominantly focus on joint cooperation on cyber defense, which is a multidisciplinary task that includes civilian and military state organization efforts. Only through the delivery of joint, defensive and offensive cyber operations and actions, the nation states could efficiently support their strategic security interests and achieve cyber power.\n## United by necessity: the militarization of cyberspace drives a need for civil—military cooperation on cyber defense\nAs Dunn Cavelty (2018, p. 309) points out, Klimburg's integrated capability model is consciously taking cyber power out of the context of projecting national interests coercively and adds a strong defensive cyber security element. Such a view highlights that cyber power and cyber security are intricately linked. However, Dunn Cavelty also adds that a true cyber power also needs to be able to “defend” against cyber threats. In today's view, it means to conduct cyber offensive and defensive military operations rather than a reactive and preventive approach embodied in cyber security. To simply put, there cannot be any true cyber power without a proper (civilian) cyber security and (military) cyber defense. These two environments must be inherently connected, and they must complement each other.\nEven though cyber security and cyber defense are dissimilar concepts and their definitions and theories often vary, they are still closely connected (Pačka, 2015). In this article, cyber security focuses on preventive and reactive measures in its nature, while the cyber defense could be more proactive and it allows to use military capacity and armed forces^{4}. Paraphrasing Clausewitz (1989), cyber defense could be the continuation of ensuring cyber security by other means, such as defensive and offensive cyber operations.\nNation states ensure their cyber security to improve the security and resilience of national infrastructures and services already for decades. Regarding the cyber defense, the governments all over the world has just started to build its capacity a few years ago. Specifically, they usually create\nrband new military cyber units and strive to defend the nation against the most serious cyber threats (Smeets). The issue of civil-military inter-agency cooperation on cyber defense is therefore relatively new. Not surprisingly, while there are numerous guidelines for cooperation between law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and national CSIRTs in cyber security (e.g. ENISA ; Pačka ; Skierka .), there is an insufficient practice and no handbook on cyber defense cooperation issue (Pačka), pp. 93--94).\nThe state practice could be quite challenging in that sense. There are factors such as the tendency of armies across the world to separate themselves from the rest of the nonmilitary security apparatus or the impossibility to ensure defense in cyberspace properly by a military actor alone by itself. In sum, synergy and cooperation with the rest of the national security actors who tackle cyber threats should be secured and exercised regularly. Given the fact that most of the cyberspace can be considered dual-use, it is simply difficult to separate the military and civilian realms (Droege), pp. 570, 576) and any harsh distinction simply does not work.\nAlthough, it is imminent that the segregation is present. It often rests on the assumption that the military and civilian agenda within the national security apparatus is distinct and should be kept distinct. According to Heinl, p. 38), this approach is caused historically. In the past, there was not a generally compelling need to engage civilian security authorities and agencies in military matters. Even large cyber attacks were usually not so significant to reach a threshold that would have activated the armed forces' response in previous years. Some authors (see Dunn Cavelty ; Wallace) persistently argued that the military role in cyberspace outside the context of armed conflict should be limited (Bigelow), p. 3), e.g. on the protection of military networks and information systems. Heinl contends that this was an understandable posture at that time. Even today, most cyber threats are directed against civilian (public or private) systems and networks and therefore have to be dealt (up to a certain threshold) by the targeted organizations themselves or by nonmilitary authorities responsible for cyber security or cyber crime (national CSIRTs, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies, if needed).\nFurthermore, the military's exact role and responsibilities in national cyber security or defense might remain vague from the institutional perspective. A long-term institutional practice within nation states supports this approach. When countries and its institutions usually define new roles and responsibilities of the armed forces or civilian authorities anywhere (including cyberspace), they look for analogies from the physical world and translate them as literally as possible. It means there could be a long-lasting consensus that armed forces should have a limited role in cyber crises\noutside of armed conflict  and they want to just maintain the status quo, where military and civilian security or defense agencies are still somewhat isolated.\nNowadays, the debate has evolved significantly, especially due to increasing evidence of state or state-sponsored attacks on civilian cyberspace infrastructure . The increased militarization of cyberspace is also an apparent trend these days , and regular and irregular warfare are slowly losing their distinction due to the unique nature of cyberspace. Traditional norms of warfare, definitions of combatants and noncombatants, and even what constitutes military action or national casus belli are being turned upside down (TRADOC G-2, 2017, p. 20). It means the military role can simply no longer be limited to the traditional approach of engaging primarily in an armed conflict. It is particularly challenging to ensure national security and defense or even to wage a war without cooperation between military and nonmilitary (civilian) worlds these days. The cyber defense is about working with existing military, civilian, police, central and other structures, cooperation, and mixing missions of different actors with the same goal.\nHence, an advisable starting point for all nation states is to strive to set up an efficient cooperation between civilian authorities and agencies responsible for cyber security and armed forces with the mandate to conduct cyber defense operations. This cooperation framework should always start with the joint protection of those assets that are most essential for the country—critical (information) infrastructure. This is an especially important issue since civilian infrastructures are legitimate targets in case of serious cyber attacks or an armed conflict. And on the other hand, militaries as defenders of last resort for these infrastructures do not have the capacity to be familiar, let alone proficient, in the functioning of civilian networks .\n### CIIP as the core issue for cooperation\nCritical infrastructure protection (CIP) as a concept and practice was first explicitly articulated in the 1990s. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, CIP moved to the center of domestic security doctrine , not only in the United States but also in other countries. Besides the physical protection of the critical infrastructure, cyber security has also become a significant issue in today's world. Cyber threats to the critical infrastructure emanate from a wide spectrum of prospective perpetrators: state-sponsored espionage and sabotage, international terrorism, domestic militants, malevolent hacktivists, or even disaffected insiders .\nThe broadening of this concept has created a new term—critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP). As for the critical infrastructure, even a disruption of critical information infrastructure could result in human death, injuries, or physical damage and its threatening could have a debilitating effect on the security of a given nation, its economy, and the public's safety or health. CIIP is therefore generally acknowledged to be an indispensable component of national security policy  and this ability to ensure CIIP is critical regarding the cyber power of the nation state.\nNevertheless, today's common practice is that civilian authorities are responsible for coordinating cyber security incident response within the critical infrastructure and armed forces are being used only as an instrument of last resort in an armed conflict. It is important to realize that the CIIP is already a part of the cyber defense and it needs to be supported by cross-organizational collaboration to be effective. It is a joint endeavor . According to Heinl (2016, p. 38), the military has the responsibility for national security, which presumably includes the defense of the most extreme cyber threats to critical infrastructure. This common thread (at least in Europe) of limiting the role of the military in cyber security response  therefore calls for a comprehensive approach to civil-military cooperation on both—the cyber security and defense to achieve integrated government capacity. However, the main issue is still that while the military has usually little or no role in the protection of critical infrastructure during peacetime, it would be an enormously challenging task, during, e.g, the war or other cyber-enabled conflict. Hence, ensuring the CIIP only when some major crisis occurs could put the military forces in an uncomfortable position.\nIt is proposed that the CIIP should be a vital kernel for the cooperation on cyber defense between relevant civilian (nonmilitary) and military agencies within a state security apparatus. There is an apparent need to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks from both sides because any of these attacks can have the potential to threaten the national security and stability. For example, given the special nature of cyberspace, it is usually hard to attribute the attacker or the source of the attack in real-time. Attribution of cyber attacks is simply not an easy task. There are technical issues which complicate identifying cyber attackers . At the beginning of nearly all cyber attacks, the culprit is unknown, and it is always reasonable to comprehend that it can be a state, state-sponsored group, terrorist, an activist, or just some criminal actor. Therefore, governments must approach the response to each serious cyber attack targeting the critical information infrastructure very seriously.\nTherefore, a strong demand for mutual collaboration, cooperation, and information sharing among all relevant civilian and military spheres is\n#\nR. PACKA AND M. MARES\nTable 1. Political and organizational factors.\n|  Political factors | Organizational factors  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Incompatible objectives | Structural barriers  |\n|  Conflicting Definitions | Organizational Cultures  |\n|  Conflicting Theories | Organizational Independence  |\n|  Lack of guidance by political leaders | Competition for Resources  |\n|   | Inexperience and Lack of Proven Models  |\n|   | Idiosyncratic/Personality Factors  |\nlogical. As it is apparent also from this research, the practice of crisis response, joint operations, training, and exercises between state civilian and military agencies often lacks and there are still numerous factors that could affect or jeopardize this kind of cooperation in the future.\n# Factors possibly jeopardizing civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense\nMany factors could render the cooperation between a diverse spectrum of civilian and military agencies problematic. While cyber-specific factors that could jeopardize cooperation have not been identified yet, the focus is on general factors that influence civil-military cooperation (e.g., in conflict resolution) and might also apply to cyber defense. Specifically, the identified factors are inspired and based on the work of Olson and Gregorian (2007) and complemented by the literature review and analysis. Only factors that could suit the cyber realm have been picked and modified for research purposes. All factors are divided into two main categories—political and organizational—with the possibility to identify other factors during the research (Table 1).\n# Political factors\nThe first factor is called incompatible objectives. Despite the common objective to ensure national (cyber) security, each national actor (civilian or military) could hold differing, and sometimes, mutually contradictory policy goals (Olson &amp; Gregorian, 2007, p. 7). Given the fact that each national organization has a different role in the national (cyber) security and defense system, it is quite logical and there could be a small deviation. Nevertheless, the ensuring of national security begins internally with all responsible national actors and their interagency cooperation. In an increasingly complex, multi-dimensional policy world, therefore the government must promote cooperation rather than competition among the various stakeholders . If policy goals are excessively incompatible, it could result in conflict or friction among national organizations.\nThe second factor stands for conflicting definitions. Even different definitions could jeopardize cooperation. Many authors (see Futter, 2018, p. 201; Galinec et al. 2017, p. 274) state, little consensus exists about what the term ‘cyber' includes, refers to, or how it is being used. Regarding the terms of cyber security and cyber defense, the situation is similar. Since there are no ‘one-fits-all' definitions, there could be disputes between national actors about the nature or scope or meaning of the terms. These differing definitions could then lead to differing approaches on how to achieve efficient cyber defense and lead to a decrease in cooperation efficiency.\nConflicting theories could also endanger cooperation. Civilian and military institutions could have trouble coordinating at the operational, tactical, or strategic level, or even agreeing on an analysis of the problem, often because they are guided by radically different theories or assumptions about what causes problems or crises and how it can be resolved . This conceptual problem is closely related to the previous factor and contains conflicting theories on how to effectively ensure national cyber security and defense. It may cover a lot of issues, such as a discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in CIIP. While some institutions (e.g. national CSIRTs) strive to patch it immediately to secure the system, others (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement units, and others) attempt to exploit it and use it against the attacker (see Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 74--75; Pačka, 2019, pp. 71--74).\nThe last political factor represents a lack of political guidance, because the successes of each institution alone guarantee nothing in a large-scale national cyber crisis. Lack of political guidance, willpower, and support at the governmental level cannot be simply substituted. Already in 2014, Lewis (2014, p. 566) stated that whether the cyber issue reaches the top level of political leadership depends on factors such as personal interest, a direct experience of malicious cyber action, media attention or the salience of cybersecurity on their national and international agendas. Even the cyber agenda became very political in recent years, factors such as the depth of knowledge about the problem could be still an issue for politicians and other leaders. Lehto and Limnéll (2020, pp. 139, 146) therefore suggests that streamlining and strengthening strategic leadership are key aspects in making sure the cyber vision is achieved. The strong cyber leadership also prevent state agencies from operating solely in their siloes and based only on their objectives and needs. Hence, the lack of political guidance may result in many problems with the coordination. For example, insufficient resources, duplication of activities, uncertain rules of engagement in cyberspace, absence of ‘referees' to resolve competing positions, and unclear national law or jurisdictional boundaries between civilian and military\ninstitutions. Despite NATO officially recognizes cyberspace as the domain of warfare, it could still be a serious concern in many NATO countries. For example, according to the statement of retired Gen. Keith Alexander, even the United States (the pioneer of cyber warfare) still lacked “clear rules of engagement” for conducting offensive cyber operations three years ago . Hence, the lack of political guidance represents another factor that could negatively influence civil-military cooperation.\n### Organizational factors\nStructural barriers could be a strong organizational factor since rigid organizational structures represent a big obstacle to any kind of cooperation. Bureaucratic and daily operational constraints tend to stifle cooperation or any innovation and favor the status quo . In cyber realm, we could say that generally in smaller countries organizations tend to be less hierarchical and rigid. As people know each other personally, they tend to trust others more than in impersonal interactions, and greater flexibility enables them to share information swiftly. However, even in these smaller countries some barriers between civilian and military organizations naturally persists . Hence, the factor could have a serious impact on civil-military cooperation in cyberspace as well.\nNext, organizational culture is a recognized term that describes unwritten norms, rules, and customs in an establishment. The literature suggests (see Arnaud & Tinoco, 2013, p. 37) that organizational culture differs between industries as well as professions. The civilian and military culture is no exception and may cause friction within the national interagency cooperation. There is a general tendency among all organizations and sometimes even across units within the same organization to adopt substantially different planning and implementation terminology or to describe different processes and outcomes even when employing the same terminology . On the other hand, cultural interoperability among organizations stems from interagency understanding, trust, and confidence that require close and ongoing training, liaisons, and exchanges . Different organizational cultures could simply represent an important factor in the issue of civil-military cooperation. Moreover, the lack of knowledge about one another's organizational identity in the meaning of traditions, culture, images, and fundamental goals are represented in this factor.\nEven organizational independence could be for certain (civilian or military) organizations a higher priority than coordination with other organizations as they are not prepared to follow the lead of another organization . Some institutions could see cooperation\nas a fundamental threat to their operational flexibility. While cooperation is perceived as the key to cyber security and defense, the factor of preferring independence to cooperation could be an essential one.\nAs a significant factor appears also a competition for resources. State organizations such as ministries might not cooperate especially when there is a political system with strong line ministries, departmentalization, and silo arrangements. Coordination is therefore often limited to minimal coordination  and sometimes it could also lead to competition. The competition could be about different resources such as status, power, recognition, financial resources and influence . It is worth to mention that all state organizations are fully aware of cyber security and defense being one of the fastest growing fields today. It means there is still a space to set new standards, define new roles, and deliver new tasks. In this regard, some of them could also compete to take over some responsibilities from other agencies. This unhealthy competition might also result in not sharing of responsibility, agenda, or information and intelligence about cyber threats with other partners within the state.\nWhile abundant state practice in conventional warfare exists, cyber defense is a relatively new and very specific area in which a lack of proven models and inexperience is often apparent. Difficulties arise when both civilian and military institutions are stretched beyond their traditional areas of expertise , such as traditional warfighting, intelligence gathering, law-enforcing, or CIP. In the field of cyber defense, lack of best practices and guidelines (see Pačka, 2019, pp. 93--94) might lead to many wrong strategic decisions and choosing a flawed attitude toward cooperation.\nFinally, idiosyncratic or personality factors could play a key role in cyber defense cooperation. Some states might rely heavily on individuals with considerable power and specific attitudes. Stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are not uncommon within and across organizations. Sometimes the willingness to cooperate arises from personal likes or dislikes . This unprofessional behavior might lead to a decrease or cooperation between state organizations.\n## Scope and method\nThe article deals with the topic of cyber power that could nation states achieve through the development of integrated government capacity. The empirical part of the research focuses on one of the main problems in today's whole of government approach in cyberspace—the issue of the cooperation between civilian and military institutions on cyber defense. It is focused particularly on central government departments, agencies, and\nother civilian or military state institutions that are predominantly involved in ensuring cyber defense. Whole of nation approach that includes society, private sector companies, NGOs, or academia is not the focus of the study, but it is considered as the next step in achieving cyber power.\nNamely, the study focuses on the dynamics between: the civilian entities responsible for CIIP (e.g. agencies that usually operate so-called national CSIRTs),law enforcement units,military and civilian intelligence agenciesand departments of defense, including the army and special cyber command units.\nThe research has a mixed design, which includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. To measure all the factors, the researchers use quantitative data from surveys (see below) and then they use qualitative data from interviews that provide rich descriptions of the phenomena and generate new premises. An approach is primarily inductive , which means the research moves from the specific experiences and practice of respondents to the general to explain the phenomena and identify major challenges in civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense within a state.\nThe methods of data collection are document analysis, in-depth semi-structured interviews, and surveys. Getting the right participants is critical to the success of the research and simultaneously it constitutes the main limitation of the study. The willingness to participate and the consent of all participants have not been an issue since the confidentiality is ensured and outcomes are sanitized. However, it turned out that there is only a limited number of experts and practitioners who deals with this specific topic and could have been reached by researchers at the same time. Therefore, the researchers focus on a smaller amount of participants but did a more detailed interviews. It also means that participants were purposively selected by the judgment of the researchers because sampling for proportionality is not the concern of this research . Only participants who could have offered valuable insight and high-quality answers into the topic were selected. Respondent-driven sampling (also known as snowball sampling) has also been used to involve more experts and practitioners from the civilian and military spheres in the research. All respondents came from NATO countries as this research is relevant mainly for the transatlantic area. At the time of this research these participants were serving in the military, working for intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies, CSIRTs or relevant ministries. Some of them were also experts\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED SECURITY RESEARCH\n\n|  Scale | Negligible | Low | Moderate | High | Extreme  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Value | 0 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 1  |\nworking for the intergovernmental organization. The data collection period ran during the years 2019 and mid-2020. The semistructured interviews have been conducted online or face to face and the surveys have been completed in the same way.\nThe empirical research was to address the following question:\nWhat factors could significantly jeopardize civil-military interagency cooperation toward cyber defense within a nation-state?\nBased on the literature review and an analysis of the authors, ten factors of political and organizational nature that could have a strong influence on civil-military cooperation have been identified and then discussed with the respondents during the interviews and surveys. All respondents waged and deliberated each factor, shared their personal views on how important and relevant each factor is, and highlighted it on the impact scale (negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme). Finally, they had an option to add further factors or categories (Table 2).\nBased on these findings, factors with the highest impact (scoring moderate—high to extreme) on civil-military cooperation in cyber defense were recognized and highlighted. Finally, these findings also shed light and form a discussion on the second question:\nHow nation states could gain cyber power through the integrated government capacity?\nConducting this research will help states and their institutions to make better decisions about their approach to cooperation on cyber defense. It could also serve as a basis for future academic research and debate.\n## Findings\nAccording to 13 interviews and surveys with experts and practitioners from civilian and military agencies related to cyber defense, the most significant factors jeopardizing the cooperation on cyber defense are as follows (see Table 3). The findings confirm the necessity of the factors we identified and generate new premises that deserve further attention.\n## Political factors\n### Incompatible objectives (impact: moderate—high)\nMost of the respondents scored this factor as essential and claim that all national institutions or agencies must understand that the state has one\n#\nR. PACKA AND M. MARES\nTable 3. Results of the research.\n|   | Level of impact  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Score | Scale  |\n|  Political factors |  |   |\n|  Incompatible objectives | 0.643 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Conflicting definitions | 0.392 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Conflicting theories | 0.531 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Lack of guidance by political leaders | 0.843 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Organizational factors |  |   |\n|  Structural barriers | 0.688 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Organizational cultures | 0.321 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Organizational independence | 0.469 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Competition for resources | 0.750 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Inexperience and lack of proven models | 0.688 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Idiosyncratic or personality factors | 0.625 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\ncommon goal and their objectives cannot be incompatible. The root cause of the problem here might not necessarily be related to cyber security and defense but rather to the ability and recognition of these topics being a cross-government issue. Building on that, it also turns out that the objectives may not necessarily be incompatible in some cases, but their priorities may differ. It means the cooperation in this area is for some institutions simply not nearly as important as for others.\nNext, some respondents directly highlighted particularly the contrast between the military intelligence (as part of both the military and intelligence community) and cyber security community (national CSIRTs). They added that the problem might lie in the natural isolationist approach of intelligence agencies in general. Moreover, they stated that this approach is not relevant only to civil-military cooperation. It is sometimes relevant even to military and intel-military cooperation, i.e., between military intelligence agencies and the \"green army.\"\n# Conflicting definitions (impact: low—moderate)\nThis factor has almost the lowest score among respondents. Respondents had claimed that the challenge could be easily overcome by combined training and joint cyber exercises and operations. Promoting dialogue and open discussion among the civilian and military community may also solve this problem. Some of the respondents added that conflicting definitions affect primarily policymakers, not (civilian or military) cyber practitioners (at the operational level). In reality, they should figure out these differences fast, adapt to them, and then cooperate effectively.\nIt means it is less of an issue. The lack of definitions should not hinder progress or cooperation. The aphorism \"Perfect is the enemy of good\" has also been used in the interviews. Those differing views might be useful and (if properly managed) contribute to a constructive and more sustainable consensus between organizations.\nIn sum, it seems that a lack of convergence between terminologies used by civilian and military actors does not represent an additional barrier to civil-military cooperation.\n### Conflicting theories (impact: moderate)\nThe factor of conflicting theories has a moderate impact and similar answers as the previous one. Some of the respondents do not perceive it as an immense problem that requires extensional attention at the national level. At a higher level of crisis (i.e. state of emergency), there should be clear national response structures and procedures that can be activated. Below that, although, there may be disagreement and discussion on “who owns the problem” and thus how to coordinate appropriately the full set of resources. However, the most important is to have a common and shared purpose according to respondents. Conflicting theories may have an impact, but well-developed professionals should be able to reach a consensus.\nRespondents also said it is a common feature of the state itself and it is linked to the factor of incompatible objectives. Each actor within the state security system has a slightly different goal and could be guided by different theories or assumptions. Moreover, certain areas of cyber security and defense such as vulnerability weaponizing will always be disputable and it is not necessarily just a civilian-military problem, but also intelligence vs. defensive mandate agencies; or intelligence agencies and law enforcement vs. national CSIRTs.\n### Lack of political guidance (impact: high—extreme)\nThe lack of political guidance and unclear laws in cyber defense is the most critical factor in the research. Most participants agreed that there cannot be any effective action and unity of effort without a clear high-level political guidance supported by an appropriate legal framework and adequate oversight. In states where this situation occurs, it is the root cause of the problem of friction between the civilian and military spheres. Without clear roles and responsibilities and overall strategic guidance, different actors (civilian or military) have less ability to execute in complementary manners.\nNevertheless, some of the military practitioners also pointed out that the factor is relevant especially during peacetime. In times of war or other conflicts, in which armed forces are empowered to perform actions that they would normally not be permitted to do, the impact of this factor would be reduced. In these cases, there is no time or need for extensive political guidance or strict compliance with the national law. Armed forces have\nclear procedures to deal with such situations and they are ready to cooperate closely even with civilian security organizations and others.\n### Organizational factors\n### Structural barriers (impact: moderate—high)\nThis factor seems to be significant. According to some respondents, bureaucracy and operational constraints can make especially the initial cooperation hard. However, once organizational relationships are built, it is much easier to deepen them. In contrast, many others remain in favor of maintaining the status quo. Especially those whom the main responsibility is different than cyber, might still impede cooperation, as they don't see priority in cyber and don't want to innovate. In some states, the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative “from the bottom” (from the operational level). Some military practitioners have also highlighted the problem of horizontal vs. vertical cooperation in the armed forces. They have apparently the necessary internal procedures to cooperate effectively among military units of all kinds (both vertically and horizontally) in place. However, regarding the horizontal cooperation outside the military world, the military often lacks adequate procedures and processes on how to cooperate swiftly and effectively with civilian (nonmilitary) organizations.\n### Organizational cultures (impact: low—moderate)\nSurprisingly, different organizational cultures are perceived by the respondents as the least relevant factor. Only a minority of respondents feel the differences between military and civilian culture as a big obstacle for cooperation. Most of them reported that cultures nowadays can be respected, and they can be learned. Furthermore, all these differences could be more beneficial than restraining. Mutual knowledge is a matter of communication and cooperation, and both worlds would and probably could improve their organization using gained knowledge and experience from its counterparts.\nBoth experts and practitioners from civilian and military spheres agreed that this challenge can be overcome easily by simply working more together. Next, since it is still relatively rare to see specific career paths for military cyber operators, many on active duty will leave and join the industry and civilian public sector, which does serve to increase the understanding of each other's culture, organizational identity, and so on. Even though different cultures exist, the far bigger factor is apparently overall policy differences rather than cultural differences.\nOrganizational independence (impact: moderate)\nIndependence as a higher priority than cooperation is also not seen as an essential factor. Almost all respondents agreed that in most cases, this is not an issue. Although, few of them mentioned the problem of the isolationistic approach of intelligence agencies again. They also shared some of their personal experiences that underpin the presumption of some agencies to prefer independence and operational flexibility to cooperation in (both civilian and military) intelligence agencies.\n### Competition for resources (impact: high)\nAnother high scoring factor is competition for financial resources, status, power, recognition, and influence. Nearly all respondents saw the factor as a relevant barrier and almost all of them ranked the impact as “high.” The competition for resources is an issue especially in an environment where the national roles and responsibilities in cyber security and defense are still not clarified properly. It leads to the situation in which every institution is trying to get a piece of the cyber agenda for itself. This competition could jeopardize the cooperation a lot. Some respondents have also stated that it is mainly a matter of a strategic (not operational) level of cooperation between institutions and the problem is not exclusive to civilian and military cooperation again.\n### Inexperience and lack of proven models (impact: moderate—high)\nThe lack of proven models and inexperience seems to be a very relevant factor in the cyber security and defense area. It is no wonder since it is still a relatively new area for both civilian and military institutions. Some respondents even called the current situation as a startup era of cyber defense. Especially for more rigid military institutions, it could have an extremely negative impact until the necessary practice and experience are gained. According to some, one of the main obstacles in this issue could be also a lack of general cyber awareness and education of “non-specialists” and leaders at all levels. The major problem with cyber defense for a “nonspecialist” is that it's hard to visualize. The way to overcome this could be, e.g. cyber security exercises, tailored especially for high-level management. Finally, respondents see this factor as a great opportunity to start a discussion among all civilian and military institutions. It could be the motivation for some states to create an effective national system of cyber defense from scratch.\n### Idiosyncratic/personality factors (impact: moderate—high)\nThe last factor has a moderate to high impact. The human factor in collaboration on cyber defense is apparently as important as everywhere else. Although cyberspace is a technology-driven world, people are still at the\ncore of it and they are vulnerable to idiosyncratic disputes. Not surprisingly, those respondents who had a real-life experience with it had scored higher than those without it. Some of them have also added that this factor is especially important in the phase of initiation and establishment of cooperation between entities. On the other hand, given the bureaucracy and the way how state institutions work, this effect might be marginalized in the long term. It means that the impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes can be minimized over policy design in the cyber defense and related security areas.\n## Conclusion: factors jeopardizing the development of integrated government capability identified\nThere are many ways how governments can gain, achieve and project cyber power. For example, Healey (2016) claims that still too much emphasis is currently placed on the success or failure of offensive and defensive capabilities, rather than other factors and on long-term national security outcomes. It is apparent that these capabilities are and will be very closely linked to the concept of cyber power, and that both policy (decision) makers and academics are interested in it for obvious reasons. Next, it is also possible to argue that an efficient cyber defense is the focal prerequisite for gaining and increasing power in cyberspace, since it is almost impossible to project power in cyberspace when the nation states have insufficient military power. However, this hard-cyber power approach to winning in cyberspace through military domination is plausibly short-sighted. Nation states should really aim to incorporate many other variables into their grand strategies and policies in cyberspace and use a holistic approach to the integrated government capacity to achieve cyber power. Therefore, this article focused on the identification of factors that could jeopardize integrated government capacity (or so-called whole of government approach) in cyber defense and more specifically the focus was narrowed down to the field of civil-military interagency cooperation within a nation state.\nResearch has demonstrated that in today's hyper-connected world, the traditional state practice just fades away. Global uncomfortable changes in warfare domains gradually force states to rethink many aspects of their military strategies and policies, including cyber defense. With cyber threats evolving into new, complex forms, the lack of fresh, modern solutions at the national level becomes a handicap and will make it difficult for the nation state to project its cyber power.\nWith the understanding of the extensiveness of the cyber issue and its dynamic nature, six critical areas have been identified where further consideration is needed. The area could strongly affect the establishment of\nintegrated government capacity or a strategic framework for cyber power in general.\nAccording to findings, the most important factors (for the lowest to highest impact) are:Idiosyncratic/Personality factors;Incompatible objectives;Structural barriers;Inexperience and lack of proven models;Competition for resources;Lack of guidance by political leaders.\nThe impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are apparent even in the world of cyber defense. According to practice, rationality is simply not always present. Subjective elements, such as human factors, could easily undermine the will and trust between agencies and make cooperation impossible. Hence, nation states should pay attention even to this factor which seems to be minor, but like everywhere else, it could grow into a big issue. On the other hand, the effect of the factor could be minimized through policy design in the cyber defense and security areas.\nNext, the incompatible objectives of each state agency could bring a lot of problems to the cooperation on cyber defense. Cyberspace itself is a cross-cutting domain and ensuring cyber defense means to deal with a cross-government issue. There is still a lack of common understanding among decision-makers or chiefs of relevant agencies and departments that the issue is a national topic, nor the responsibility of one or a few agencies in the state. A consensus on cyber defense should be reached across military and nonmilitary institutions and joint prioritization should be done as well on the governmental level. Especially, the intelligence agencies should be more open to cooperation with other relevant actors and leave their traditional isolationist approach within the state security apparatus.\nStructural barriers to cooperation, such as bureaucracy and operational constraints, can make cooperation hard as well. Maintaining the status quo and a lack of willingness to change the agenda or perform new activities and tasks is another issue that could easily jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense. These barriers are also seen as hardly removable as the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative. Decisions should come from the top in this regard. It is primarily a military issue and the army's way of conducting business. The problem of facilitating horizontal cooperation outside the military world is evident and should be overcome to ensure cyber defense more effectively and on time.\nLack of experience and shortage of best practice is an unsurprisingly an essential factor that could negatively impact the cooperation on cyber defense. It could be an enormous problem especially for the more rigid military, but in contrast, it could be a great opportunity to approach the challenge and establish a new and effectively functioning system of cyber defense cooperation between civilians and military spheres.\nIt is also perceived from the practice that state agencies or ministries are not an exception regarding power and budget struggles. With countries focusing on the new challenges posed by cyber threats and developing their capabilities to tackle them, there is also a new opportunity to gain more political power or financial resources from the state budget. These struggles are not exclusive to civilian and military dichotomy; however, they could easily result in a rivalry between state agencies. It is not perhaps exclusive to cyber security and defense only but could be happening in other trending agendas such as hybrid warfare or space security.\nThe most significant challenge in bridging the obvious gap between civilian and military actors seems to be the lack of political direction and a clear vision on cyber matters from political leaders. It is sometimes a result of scattering the national responsibility for cyber defense among too many civilian and military institutions, together with the lack of enlightened politicians eager to lead in cyber defense effectively. The main issue here could be that leaders must meticulously review all existing policies in the context of cyber defense to ensure cyber defense properly.\nFinally, a lot of respondents also mentioned the importance of the legal and ethical aspects of this kind of cooperation. Legal elements complement political and organizational factors and they are also implied within them to some extent. Cyber defense as a mechanism of responding to the sheer scale of cyber threats is not just a technical discipline, it is linked to a vast range of legal and ethical issues. Therefore, the cyber defense principles, measures, and responsibilities of each actor must be enshrined in the law to protect society from abuses of power and guarantee citizens their rights and freedoms. However, besides that, it also helps to set clear responsibilities of official authorities dealing with cyber defense and it provides a solid ground for the cooperation. In contrast, the lack of relevant legislation or legal vagueness makes setbacks for any kind of cooperation.\nAll these factors could seriously jeopardize the unity of effort at the governmental level and overall cooperation in cyber defense. Therefore, nation states should continuously review their system of collaboration among relevant state military nonmilitary actors and focus on these sets of factors. In practice, it is obvious that all negative factors could be overcome or prevented only when a clear vision and leadership eclipse the self-interest of agencies. States and their decision-makers should approach cyber defense\nas a new agenda where creating a symbiotic relationship across both civilian and military agencies is necessary. The classic distinctions between military and civilian worlds are simply less clear-cut in cyber defense. If the nation state has an ambition to gain and project cyber power, it should make the joint cyber defense a cornerstone of plans for future development and strategic orientation. A unification of differing perceptions of the mission and each other's role within the cyber defense system is needed to establish a fully functioning integrated government capacity. A culture of shared responsibility must be inherent too.\nBased on the findings, it is also possible to make some recommendations for a proper working model of cooperation on cyber defense. It should be based on governmental level actions such as: regular joint cyber defense exercises at both technical and strategic level; operational situational awareness and intensive information sharing and exchange; clarifying the exact roles and responsibilities in the national (cyber) defense system and making cyber leaders from all relevant decision-makers and head of agencies. Especially the enlightened leaders can manage and drive their institution to become a better counterpart for cooperation.",

It reviews the civil-military interagency cooperation and aims to identify factors that could jeopardize it. First, it provides a theoretical background for the research and then according to interviews and surveys, the factors with the highest negative impact are recognized. Based on this research, the most significant challenges in bridging the gap between civilian and military worlds seems to be power and budget struggles and a lack of political direction on cyber matters from leaders.\n# KEYWORDS\nCyber defense; cyber power; cyber security; civil-military; cyberspace",
    "# Introduction": "Cyber power has become a pressing issue for many nation states since the militarization of cyberspace has already begun and it is one of the latest additions to the power family tree (Dunn Caverty, 2018, p. 306). The trend of offensive cyberspace operations conducted by nation-states or state-sponsored groups together with the rise of serious cyber attacks on critical infrastructures¹ naturally increase political and military interest in cyber power and relevant state capabilities. It also calls for a review of a national approach to defense in cyberspace, where defense is no longer just a military issue and to gain a real cyber power and cyber effectiveness is possible only through the whole-of-government (civilian and military) cooperation.\nNowadays, cyber threats are very serious. While contemporary cyber attacks are usually still happening rather on a smaller scale or with lower impact, they may quickly rise to an enormous problem for national security and defense. We could have seen it recently when a lot of minor cyber attacks at high frequency were targeting health care facilities during the\nCONTACT Roman Pačka\n\\odot\n roman.packa@gmail.com\n\\odot\n Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University, Joštova 218/10, 602 00 Brno, Czech Republic.\n© 2021 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nglobal COVID-19 crisis  and they seriously threatened the national security of several countries. The trend of escalating cyber maneuvers and the increasing prominence of cyber operations within the military is also apparent. It has already caused the development of offensive state cyber capabilities in many European and NATO countries. The modern warfare is currently shaped by new disruptive technologies and the militarization of cyberspace .\nThe visible product of the militarization is the cyberspace itself. It has officially become the next domain for warfighting according to NATO , placing it alongside the traditional battlegrounds of air, land, and sea. This means every state should be able to defend itself in cyberspace and move toward creating military effects in, through, and from cyberspace. However, cyberspace is very different military domain because it is the only domain created by a man and it is highly technical. Therefore, the cyberspace is heavily dependent on heterogeneous, typically civilian, players with different preferences. It is complex, hard to visualize, and constantly changing. Finally, the cyberspace is clearly a nongeographical domain, which also requires a shift of understanding for military commanders .\nDue to its unique nature, military and nonmilitary (civilian) spheres blur or erode more easily than in traditional (physical) domains. In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor. Nevertheless, the cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries. Specific challenges, such as the problem of attribution and anonymity, or the asymmetric characteristics of cyberspace results in the current situation where nation states must ensure a close civil-military collaboration within a state to achieve and gain cyber power.\nOn the one hand, this strong need for coordinated civil-military inter-agency teamwork exists to protect the nation against serious cyber threats and produce cyber effects. On the other hand, there is also a deficiency of experience and practice with that on both sides, and sometimes even the willingness to cooperate lacks as these two worlds (military and civilian/nonmilitary) are quite different and somewhat isolated. A few state actors such as Netherlands or the Czech Republic have already noticed the issue. From the military perspective, the new Dutch strategic vision for defense released by Dutch Ministry of Defence (MvD, Ministerie van Defensie) focuses on their partners outside the military organization and is going to devote greater attention to the role and task of the military in this gray zone of “strategic competition” between war and peace . Next, the (civilian) national cyber security strategy of the Czech Republic for the years 2021--2025 created by their national cyber security authority\n(NUKIB, Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost) also calls for a common approach to cyber security and defense within the country and the improvement of the collaboration model and information sharing between military and nonmilitary actors .\nHence, this article intends to initiate and contribute to the discussion on civil-military interagency cooperation by considering possible factors that could spoil the establishing of an efficient integrated governmental framework for cyber defense. The article does not deal with the private sector or academia institutions such as universities nor think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It strictly focuses on the governmental interagency cooperation and response system and elaborates on factors that could affect or jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense between key state civilian (nonmilitary) and military entities, such as agencies responsible for CIIP (e.g. national Computer Security Incident Response Teams—CSIRTs), intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and departments of defense, including military cyber operations unit.\nOur main premise is that the ability of a nation state to gain cyber power leads through the efficient whole-of-government approach (so-called integrated government capability) as it is a crucial basis for achieving any power and control in cyberspace. Therefore, the article identifies the most significant barriers preventing this approach.\nResearchers are fully aware of the difficulty with the concept of cyber power, that systematic (empirical) analyses of the topic do not yet exist, and that the body of literature on cyber-power is small and fragmented. Hence, this article narrowly focuses only on the subset of the topic of cyber power and serves as another piece to the debate. It could also be a basis for further academic research or a source of inspiration for policy makers.\nData in this article are—with respect to the character of researched experts—valid mostly for the NATO countries. Recent development in this area is important from the global point of view. Firstly, due to the fact that NATO is the strongest military alliance in the contemporary world and it improves its cyber capabilities. Secondly, development in NATO countries can serve as a model for development in other parts of the world. And thirdly, recent trends in NATO have an indirect impact on the behavior of its adversaries in cyberspace.",
    "# Factors possibly jeopardizing civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense": "Many factors could render the cooperation between a diverse spectrum of civilian and military agencies problematic. While cyber-specific factors that could jeopardize cooperation have not been identified yet, the focus is on general factors that influence civil-military cooperation (e.g., in conflict resolution) and might also apply to cyber defense. Specifically, the identified factors are inspired and based on the work of Olson and Gregorian (2007) and complemented by the literature review and analysis. Only factors that could suit the cyber realm have been picked and modified for research purposes. All factors are divided into two main categories—political and organizational—with the possibility to identify other factors during the research (Table 1).",
    "# Political factors": "The first factor is called incompatible objectives. Despite the common objective to ensure national (cyber) security, each national actor (civilian or military) could hold differing, and sometimes, mutually contradictory policy goals (Olson &amp; Gregorian, 2007, p. 7). Given the fact that each national organization has a different role in the national (cyber) security and defense system, it is quite logical and there could be a small deviation. Nevertheless, the ensuring of national security begins internally with all responsible national actors and their interagency cooperation. In an increasingly complex, multi-dimensional policy world, therefore the government must promote cooperation rather than competition among the various stakeholders . If policy goals are excessively incompatible, it could result in conflict or friction among national organizations.\nThe second factor stands for conflicting definitions. Even different definitions could jeopardize cooperation. Many authors (see Futter, 2018, p. 201; Galinec et al. 2017, p. 274) state, little consensus exists about what the term ‘cyber' includes, refers to, or how it is being used. Regarding the terms of cyber security and cyber defense, the situation is similar. Since there are no ‘one-fits-all' definitions, there could be disputes between national actors about the nature or scope or meaning of the terms. These differing definitions could then lead to differing approaches on how to achieve efficient cyber defense and lead to a decrease in cooperation efficiency.\nConflicting theories could also endanger cooperation. Civilian and military institutions could have trouble coordinating at the operational, tactical, or strategic level, or even agreeing on an analysis of the problem, often because they are guided by radically different theories or assumptions about what causes problems or crises and how it can be resolved . This conceptual problem is closely related to the previous factor and contains conflicting theories on how to effectively ensure national cyber security and defense. It may cover a lot of issues, such as a discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in CIIP. While some institutions (e.g. national CSIRTs) strive to patch it immediately to secure the system, others (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement units, and others) attempt to exploit it and use it against the attacker (see Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 74--75; Pačka, 2019, pp. 71--74).\nThe last political factor represents a lack of political guidance, because the successes of each institution alone guarantee nothing in a large-scale national cyber crisis. Lack of political guidance, willpower, and support at the governmental level cannot be simply substituted. Already in 2014, Lewis (2014, p. 566) stated that whether the cyber issue reaches the top level of political leadership depends on factors such as personal interest, a direct experience of malicious cyber action, media attention or the salience of cybersecurity on their national and international agendas. Even the cyber agenda became very political in recent years, factors such as the depth of knowledge about the problem could be still an issue for politicians and other leaders. Lehto and Limnéll (2020, pp. 139, 146) therefore suggests that streamlining and strengthening strategic leadership are key aspects in making sure the cyber vision is achieved. The strong cyber leadership also prevent state agencies from operating solely in their siloes and based only on their objectives and needs. Hence, the lack of political guidance may result in many problems with the coordination. For example, insufficient resources, duplication of activities, uncertain rules of engagement in cyberspace, absence of ‘referees' to resolve competing positions, and unclear national law or jurisdictional boundaries between civilian and military\ninstitutions. Despite NATO officially recognizes cyberspace as the domain of warfare, it could still be a serious concern in many NATO countries. For example, according to the statement of retired Gen. Keith Alexander, even the United States (the pioneer of cyber warfare) still lacked “clear rules of engagement” for conducting offensive cyber operations three years ago . Hence, the lack of political guidance represents another factor that could negatively influence civil-military cooperation.\n### Organizational factors\nStructural barriers could be a strong organizational factor since rigid organizational structures represent a big obstacle to any kind of cooperation. Bureaucratic and daily operational constraints tend to stifle cooperation or any innovation and favor the status quo . In cyber realm, we could say that generally in smaller countries organizations tend to be less hierarchical and rigid. As people know each other personally, they tend to trust others more than in impersonal interactions, and greater flexibility enables them to share information swiftly. However, even in these smaller countries some barriers between civilian and military organizations naturally persists . Hence, the factor could have a serious impact on civil-military cooperation in cyberspace as well.\nNext, organizational culture is a recognized term that describes unwritten norms, rules, and customs in an establishment. The literature suggests (see Arnaud & Tinoco, 2013, p. 37) that organizational culture differs between industries as well as professions. The civilian and military culture is no exception and may cause friction within the national interagency cooperation. There is a general tendency among all organizations and sometimes even across units within the same organization to adopt substantially different planning and implementation terminology or to describe different processes and outcomes even when employing the same terminology . On the other hand, cultural interoperability among organizations stems from interagency understanding, trust, and confidence that require close and ongoing training, liaisons, and exchanges . Different organizational cultures could simply represent an important factor in the issue of civil-military cooperation. Moreover, the lack of knowledge about one another's organizational identity in the meaning of traditions, culture, images, and fundamental goals are represented in this factor.\nEven organizational independence could be for certain (civilian or military) organizations a higher priority than coordination with other organizations as they are not prepared to follow the lead of another organization . Some institutions could see cooperation\nas a fundamental threat to their operational flexibility. While cooperation is perceived as the key to cyber security and defense, the factor of preferring independence to cooperation could be an essential one.\nAs a significant factor appears also a competition for resources. State organizations such as ministries might not cooperate especially when there is a political system with strong line ministries, departmentalization, and silo arrangements. Coordination is therefore often limited to minimal coordination  and sometimes it could also lead to competition. The competition could be about different resources such as status, power, recognition, financial resources and influence . It is worth to mention that all state organizations are fully aware of cyber security and defense being one of the fastest growing fields today. It means there is still a space to set new standards, define new roles, and deliver new tasks. In this regard, some of them could also compete to take over some responsibilities from other agencies. This unhealthy competition might also result in not sharing of responsibility, agenda, or information and intelligence about cyber threats with other partners within the state.\nWhile abundant state practice in conventional warfare exists, cyber defense is a relatively new and very specific area in which a lack of proven models and inexperience is often apparent. Difficulties arise when both civilian and military institutions are stretched beyond their traditional areas of expertise , such as traditional warfighting, intelligence gathering, law-enforcing, or CIP. In the field of cyber defense, lack of best practices and guidelines (see Pačka, 2019, pp. 93--94) might lead to many wrong strategic decisions and choosing a flawed attitude toward cooperation.\nFinally, idiosyncratic or personality factors could play a key role in cyber defense cooperation. Some states might rely heavily on individuals with considerable power and specific attitudes. Stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are not uncommon within and across organizations. Sometimes the willingness to cooperate arises from personal likes or dislikes . This unprofessional behavior might lead to a decrease or cooperation between state organizations.\n## Scope and method\nThe article deals with the topic of cyber power that could nation states achieve through the development of integrated government capacity. The empirical part of the research focuses on one of the main problems in today's whole of government approach in cyberspace—the issue of the cooperation between civilian and military institutions on cyber defense. It is focused particularly on central government departments, agencies, and\nother civilian or military state institutions that are predominantly involved in ensuring cyber defense. Whole of nation approach that includes society, private sector companies, NGOs, or academia is not the focus of the study, but it is considered as the next step in achieving cyber power.\nNamely, the study focuses on the dynamics between: the civilian entities responsible for CIIP (e.g. agencies that usually operate so-called national CSIRTs),law enforcement units,military and civilian intelligence agenciesand departments of defense, including the army and special cyber command units.\nThe research has a mixed design, which includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. To measure all the factors, the researchers use quantitative data from surveys (see below) and then they use qualitative data from interviews that provide rich descriptions of the phenomena and generate new premises. An approach is primarily inductive , which means the research moves from the specific experiences and practice of respondents to the general to explain the phenomena and identify major challenges in civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense within a state.\nThe methods of data collection are document analysis, in-depth semi-structured interviews, and surveys. Getting the right participants is critical to the success of the research and simultaneously it constitutes the main limitation of the study. The willingness to participate and the consent of all participants have not been an issue since the confidentiality is ensured and outcomes are sanitized. However, it turned out that there is only a limited number of experts and practitioners who deals with this specific topic and could have been reached by researchers at the same time. Therefore, the researchers focus on a smaller amount of participants but did a more detailed interviews. It also means that participants were purposively selected by the judgment of the researchers because sampling for proportionality is not the concern of this research . Only participants who could have offered valuable insight and high-quality answers into the topic were selected. Respondent-driven sampling (also known as snowball sampling) has also been used to involve more experts and practitioners from the civilian and military spheres in the research. All respondents came from NATO countries as this research is relevant mainly for the transatlantic area. At the time of this research these participants were serving in the military, working for intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies, CSIRTs or relevant ministries. Some of them were also experts\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED SECURITY RESEARCH\n|  Scale | Negligible | Low | Moderate | High | Extreme  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Value | 0 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 1  |\nworking for the intergovernmental organization. The data collection period ran during the years 2019 and mid-2020. The semistructured interviews have been conducted online or face to face and the surveys have been completed in the same way.\nThe empirical research was to address the following question:\nWhat factors could significantly jeopardize civil-military interagency cooperation toward cyber defense within a nation-state?\nBased on the literature review and an analysis of the authors, ten factors of political and organizational nature that could have a strong influence on civil-military cooperation have been identified and then discussed with the respondents during the interviews and surveys. All respondents waged and deliberated each factor, shared their personal views on how important and relevant each factor is, and highlighted it on the impact scale (negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme). Finally, they had an option to add further factors or categories (Table 2).\nBased on these findings, factors with the highest impact (scoring moderate—high to extreme) on civil-military cooperation in cyber defense were recognized and highlighted. Finally, these findings also shed light and form a discussion on the second question:\nHow nation states could gain cyber power through the integrated government capacity?\nConducting this research will help states and their institutions to make better decisions about their approach to cooperation on cyber defense. It could also serve as a basis for future academic research and debate.\n## Findings\nAccording to 13 interviews and surveys with experts and practitioners from civilian and military agencies related to cyber defense, the most significant factors jeopardizing the cooperation on cyber defense are as follows (see Table 3). The findings confirm the necessity of the factors we identified and generate new premises that deserve further attention.\n## Political factors\n### Incompatible objectives (impact: moderate—high)\nMost of the respondents scored this factor as essential and claim that all national institutions or agencies must understand that the state has one\n#\nR.

The root cause of the problem here might not necessarily be related to cyber security and defense but rather to the ability and recognition of these topics being a cross-government issue. Building on that, it also turns out that the objectives may not necessarily be incompatible in some cases, but their priorities may differ. It means the cooperation in this area is for some institutions simply not nearly as important as for others.\nNext, some respondents directly highlighted particularly the contrast between the military intelligence (as part of both the military and intelligence community) and cyber security community (national CSIRTs). They added that the problem might lie in the natural isolationist approach of intelligence agencies in general. Moreover, they stated that this approach is not relevant only to civil-military cooperation. It is sometimes relevant even to military and intel-military cooperation, i.e., between military intelligence agencies and the \"green army.\"",
    "# Conflicting definitions (impact: low—moderate)": "This factor has almost the lowest score among respondents. Respondents had claimed that the challenge could be easily overcome by combined training and joint cyber exercises and operations. Promoting dialogue and open discussion among the civilian and military community may also solve this problem. Some of the respondents added that conflicting definitions affect primarily policymakers, not (civilian or military) cyber practitioners (at the operational level). In reality, they should figure out these differences fast, adapt to them, and then cooperate effectively.\nIt means it is less of an issue. The lack of definitions should not hinder progress or cooperation. The aphorism \"Perfect is the enemy of good\" has also been used in the interviews. Those differing views might be useful and (if properly managed) contribute to a constructive and more sustainable consensus between organizations.\nIn sum, it seems that a lack of convergence between terminologies used by civilian and military actors does not represent an additional barrier to civil-military cooperation.\n### Conflicting theories (impact: moderate)\nThe factor of conflicting theories has a moderate impact and similar answers as the previous one. Some of the respondents do not perceive it as an immense problem that requires extensional attention at the national level. At a higher level of crisis (i.e. state of emergency), there should be clear national response structures and procedures that can be activated. Below that, although, there may be disagreement and discussion on “who owns the problem” and thus how to coordinate appropriately the full set of resources. However, the most important is to have a common and shared purpose according to respondents. Conflicting theories may have an impact, but well-developed professionals should be able to reach a consensus.\nRespondents also said it is a common feature of the state itself and it is linked to the factor of incompatible objectives. Each actor within the state security system has a slightly different goal and could be guided by different theories or assumptions. Moreover, certain areas of cyber security and defense such as vulnerability weaponizing will always be disputable and it is not necessarily just a civilian-military problem, but also intelligence vs. defensive mandate agencies; or intelligence agencies and law enforcement vs. national CSIRTs.\n### Lack of political guidance (impact: high—extreme)\nThe lack of political guidance and unclear laws in cyber defense is the most critical factor in the research. Most participants agreed that there cannot be any effective action and unity of effort without a clear high-level political guidance supported by an appropriate legal framework and adequate oversight. In states where this situation occurs, it is the root cause of the problem of friction between the civilian and military spheres. Without clear roles and responsibilities and overall strategic guidance, different actors (civilian or military) have less ability to execute in complementary manners.\nNevertheless, some of the military practitioners also pointed out that the factor is relevant especially during peacetime. In times of war or other conflicts, in which armed forces are empowered to perform actions that they would normally not be permitted to do, the impact of this factor would be reduced. In these cases, there is no time or need for extensive political guidance or strict compliance with the national law. Armed forces have\nclear procedures to deal with such situations and they are ready to cooperate closely even with civilian security organizations and others.\n### Organizational factors\n### Structural barriers (impact: moderate—high)\nThis factor seems to be significant. According to some respondents, bureaucracy and operational constraints can make especially the initial cooperation hard. However, once organizational relationships are built, it is much easier to deepen them. In contrast, many others remain in favor of maintaining the status quo. Especially those whom the main responsibility is different than cyber, might still impede cooperation, as they don't see priority in cyber and don't want to innovate. In some states, the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative “from the bottom” (from the operational level). Some military practitioners have also highlighted the problem of horizontal vs. vertical cooperation in the armed forces. They have apparently the necessary internal procedures to cooperate effectively among military units of all kinds (both vertically and horizontally) in place. However, regarding the horizontal cooperation outside the military world, the military often lacks adequate procedures and processes on how to cooperate swiftly and effectively with civilian (nonmilitary) organizations.\n### Organizational cultures (impact: low—moderate)\nSurprisingly, different organizational cultures are perceived by the respondents as the least relevant factor. Only a minority of respondents feel the differences between military and civilian culture as a big obstacle for cooperation. Most of them reported that cultures nowadays can be respected, and they can be learned. Furthermore, all these differences could be more beneficial than restraining. Mutual knowledge is a matter of communication and cooperation, and both worlds would and probably could improve their organization using gained knowledge and experience from its counterparts.\nBoth experts and practitioners from civilian and military spheres agreed that this challenge can be overcome easily by simply working more together. Next, since it is still relatively rare to see specific career paths for military cyber operators, many on active duty will leave and join the industry and civilian public sector, which does serve to increase the understanding of each other's culture, organizational identity, and so on. Even though different cultures exist, the far bigger factor is apparently overall policy differences rather than cultural differences.\nOrganizational independence (impact: moderate)\nIndependence as a higher priority than cooperation is also not seen as an essential factor. Almost all respondents agreed that in most cases, this is not an issue. Although, few of them mentioned the problem of the isolationistic approach of intelligence agencies again. They also shared some of their personal experiences that underpin the presumption of some agencies to prefer independence and operational flexibility to cooperation in (both civilian and military) intelligence agencies.\n### Competition for resources (impact: high)\nAnother high scoring factor is competition for financial resources, status, power, recognition, and influence. Nearly all respondents saw the factor as a relevant barrier and almost all of them ranked the impact as “high.” The competition for resources is an issue especially in an environment where the national roles and responsibilities in cyber security and defense are still not clarified properly. It leads to the situation in which every institution is trying to get a piece of the cyber agenda for itself. This competition could jeopardize the cooperation a lot. Some respondents have also stated that it is mainly a matter of a strategic (not operational) level of cooperation between institutions and the problem is not exclusive to civilian and military cooperation again.\n### Inexperience and lack of proven models (impact: moderate—high)\nThe lack of proven models and inexperience seems to be a very relevant factor in the cyber security and defense area. It is no wonder since it is still a relatively new area for both civilian and military institutions. Some respondents even called the current situation as a startup era of cyber defense. Especially for more rigid military institutions, it could have an extremely negative impact until the necessary practice and experience are gained. According to some, one of the main obstacles in this issue could be also a lack of general cyber awareness and education of “non-specialists” and leaders at all levels. The major problem with cyber defense for a “nonspecialist” is that it's hard to visualize. The way to overcome this could be, e.g. cyber security exercises, tailored especially for high-level management. Finally, respondents see this factor as a great opportunity to start a discussion among all civilian and military institutions. It could be the motivation for some states to create an effective national system of cyber defense from scratch.\n### Idiosyncratic/personality factors (impact: moderate—high)\nThe last factor has a moderate to high impact. The human factor in collaboration on cyber defense is apparently as important as everywhere else. Although cyberspace is a technology-driven world, people are still at the\ncore of it and they are vulnerable to idiosyncratic disputes. Not surprisingly, those respondents who had a real-life experience with it had scored higher than those without it. Some of them have also added that this factor is especially important in the phase of initiation and establishment of cooperation between entities. On the other hand, given the bureaucracy and the way how state institutions work, this effect might be marginalized in the long term. It means that the impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes can be minimized over policy design in the cyber defense and related security areas.",
    "## Conclusion: factors jeopardizing the development of integrated government capability identified": "There are many ways how governments can gain, achieve and project cyber power. For example, Healey (2016) claims that still too much emphasis is currently placed on the success or failure of offensive and defensive capabilities, rather than other factors and on long-term national security outcomes. It is apparent that these capabilities are and will be very closely linked to the concept of cyber power, and that both policy (decision) makers and academics are interested in it for obvious reasons. Next, it is also possible to argue that an efficient cyber defense is the focal prerequisite for gaining and increasing power in cyberspace, since it is almost impossible to project power in cyberspace when the nation states have insufficient military power. However, this hard-cyber power approach to winning in cyberspace through military domination is plausibly short-sighted. Nation states should really aim to incorporate many other variables into their grand strategies and policies in cyberspace and use a holistic approach to the integrated government capacity to achieve cyber power. Therefore, this article focused on the identification of factors that could jeopardize integrated government capacity (or so-called whole of government approach) in cyber defense and more specifically the focus was narrowed down to the field of civil-military interagency cooperation within a nation state.\nResearch has demonstrated that in today's hyper-connected world, the traditional state practice just fades away. Global uncomfortable changes in warfare domains gradually force states to rethink many aspects of their military strategies and policies, including cyber defense. With cyber threats evolving into new, complex forms, the lack of fresh, modern solutions at the national level becomes a handicap and will make it difficult for the nation state to project its cyber power.\nWith the understanding of the extensiveness of the cyber issue and its dynamic nature, six critical areas have been identified where further consideration is needed. The area could strongly affect the establishment of\nintegrated government capacity or a strategic framework for cyber power in general.\nAccording to findings, the most important factors (for the lowest to highest impact) are:Idiosyncratic/Personality factors;Incompatible objectives;Structural barriers;Inexperience and lack of proven models;Competition for resources;Lack of guidance by political leaders.\nThe impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are apparent even in the world of cyber defense. According to practice, rationality is simply not always present. Subjective elements, such as human factors, could easily undermine the will and trust between agencies and make cooperation impossible. Hence, nation states should pay attention even to this factor which seems to be minor, but like everywhere else, it could grow into a big issue. On the other hand, the effect of the factor could be minimized through policy design in the cyber defense and security areas.\nNext, the incompatible objectives of each state agency could bring a lot of problems to the cooperation on cyber defense. Cyberspace itself is a cross-cutting domain and ensuring cyber defense means to deal with a cross-government issue. There is still a lack of common understanding among decision-makers or chiefs of relevant agencies and departments that the issue is a national topic, nor the responsibility of one or a few agencies in the state. A consensus on cyber defense should be reached across military and nonmilitary institutions and joint prioritization should be done as well on the governmental level. Especially, the intelligence agencies should be more open to cooperation with other relevant actors and leave their traditional isolationist approach within the state security apparatus.\nStructural barriers to cooperation, such as bureaucracy and operational constraints, can make cooperation hard as well. Maintaining the status quo and a lack of willingness to change the agenda or perform new activities and tasks is another issue that could easily jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense. These barriers are also seen as hardly removable as the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative. Decisions should come from the top in this regard. It is primarily a military issue and the army's way of conducting business. The problem of facilitating horizontal cooperation outside the military world is evident and should be overcome to ensure cyber defense more effectively and on time.\nLack of experience and shortage of best practice is an unsurprisingly an essential factor that could negatively impact the cooperation on cyber defense. It could be an enormous problem especially for the more rigid military, but in contrast, it could be a great opportunity to approach the challenge and establish a new and effectively functioning system of cyber defense cooperation between civilians and military spheres.\nIt is also perceived from the practice that state agencies or ministries are not an exception regarding power and budget struggles. With countries focusing on the new challenges posed by cyber threats and developing their capabilities to tackle them, there is also a new opportunity to gain more political power or financial resources from the state budget. These struggles are not exclusive to civilian and military dichotomy; however, they could easily result in a rivalry between state agencies. It is not perhaps exclusive to cyber security and defense only but could be happening in other trending agendas such as hybrid warfare or space security.\nThe most significant challenge in bridging the obvious gap between civilian and military actors seems to be the lack of political direction and a clear vision on cyber matters from political leaders. It is sometimes a result of scattering the national responsibility for cyber defense among too many civilian and military institutions, together with the lack of enlightened politicians eager to lead in cyber defense effectively. The main issue here could be that leaders must meticulously review all existing policies in the context of cyber defense to ensure cyber defense properly.\nFinally, a lot of respondents also mentioned the importance of the legal and ethical aspects of this kind of cooperation. Legal elements complement political and organizational factors and they are also implied within them to some extent. Cyber defense as a mechanism of responding to the sheer scale of cyber threats is not just a technical discipline, it is linked to a vast range of legal and ethical issues. Therefore, the cyber defense principles, measures, and responsibilities of each actor must be enshrined in the law to protect society from abuses of power and guarantee citizens their rights and freedoms. However, besides that, it also helps to set clear responsibilities of official authorities dealing with cyber defense and it provides a solid ground for the cooperation. In contrast, the lack of relevant legislation or legal vagueness makes setbacks for any kind of cooperation.\nAll these factors could seriously jeopardize the unity of effort at the governmental level and overall cooperation in cyber defense. Therefore, nation states should continuously review their system of collaboration among relevant state military nonmilitary actors and focus on these sets of factors. In practice, it is obvious that all negative factors could be overcome or prevented only when a clear vision and leadership eclipse the self-interest of agencies. States and their decision-makers should approach cyber defense\nas a new agenda where creating a symbiotic relationship across both civilian and military agencies is necessary. The classic distinctions between military and civilian worlds are simply less clear-cut in cyber defense. If the nation state has an ambition to gain and project cyber power, it should make the joint cyber defense a cornerstone of plans for future development and strategic orientation. A unification of differing perceptions of the mission and each other's role within the cyber defense system is needed to establish a fully functioning integrated government capacity. A culture of shared responsibility must be inherent too.\nBased on the findings, it is also possible to make some recommendations for a proper working model of cooperation on cyber defense. It should be based on governmental level actions such as: regular joint cyber defense exercises at both technical and strategic level; operational situational awareness and intensive information sharing and exchange; clarifying the exact roles and responsibilities in the national (cyber) defense system and making cyber leaders from all relevant decision-makers and head of agencies. Especially the enlightened leaders can manage and drive their institution to become a better counterpart for cooperation."

    "## Notes\nCyber operations enabled Russia to interfere in the United States' 2016 elections, China to steal blueprints for the United States' F-35 fighters, and the United States to disrupt Iran's nuclear program (DeVore & Lee, 2017, pp. 40--41).NATO is a political and military alliance, whose essential and enduring purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means. Collective defense is at the heart of the Alliance and creates a spirit of solidarity and cohesion among its members. NATO also embodies the transatlantic link by which the security of North America is tied to that of Europe's. It is an intergovernmental organization that provides a forum where members can consult on any issue they may choose to raise and take decisions on political and military matters affecting their security (NATO, 2021).In this study, the term „civil “means all government nonmilitary security institutions and agencies including law enforcement and intelligence agencies.National CSIRTs (Computer Security Incident Response Teams) have the responsibility to act as the national point of contact for domestic incident response stakeholders and for other CSIRTs around the world. National CSIRTs help coordinate incident response at the national and international levels (Skierka et al. 2015, p. 8).\nR. PAČKA AND M. MAREŠ\n5. For example, when a state is faced with the cyber threat or cyber attack, that creates a necessity of self-defense.\n6. Dedicated units are being created across NATO countries, either with a unified cyber command, as in France and the United States, or with a devoted cyber force, like in Germany (Desforges &amp; Mazzucchi, 2019).\n## Funding\nThis article was written at Masaryk University with the support of the Specific University Research Grant provided by The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [code MUNI/A/1324/2020].\n## ORCID\nRoman Pačka © http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8113-4961\nMiroslav Mareš © http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7102-3205\n## References\nAblon, L., Binnendijk, A., Hodgson, Q.

It reviews the civil-military interagency cooperation and aims to identify factors that could jeopardize it. First, it provides a theoretical background for the research and then according to interviews and surveys, the factors with the highest negative impact are recognized. Based on this research, the most significant challenges in bridging the gap between civilian and military worlds seems to be power and budget struggles and a lack of political direction on cyber matters from leaders.\n# KEYWORDS\nCyber defense; cyber power; cyber security; civil-military; cyberspace\n# Introduction\nCyber power has become a pressing issue for many nation states since the militarization of cyberspace has already begun and it is one of the latest additions to the power family tree (Dunn Caverty, 2018, p. 306). The trend of offensive cyberspace operations conducted by nation-states or state-sponsored groups together with the rise of serious cyber attacks on critical infrastructures¹ naturally increase political and military interest in cyber power and relevant state capabilities. It also calls for a review of a national approach to defense in cyberspace, where defense is no longer just a military issue and to gain a real cyber power and cyber effectiveness is possible only through the whole-of-government (civilian and military) cooperation.\nNowadays, cyber threats are very serious. While contemporary cyber attacks are usually still happening rather on a smaller scale or with lower impact, they may quickly rise to an enormous problem for national security and defense. We could have seen it recently when a lot of minor cyber attacks at high frequency were targeting health care facilities during the\nCONTACT Roman Pačka\n\\odot\n roman.packa@gmail.com\n\\odot\n Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University, Joštova 218/10, 602 00 Brno, Czech Republic.\n© 2021 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nglobal COVID-19 crisis  and they seriously threatened the national security of several countries. The trend of escalating cyber maneuvers and the increasing prominence of cyber operations within the military is also apparent. It has already caused the development of offensive state cyber capabilities in many European and NATO countries. The modern warfare is currently shaped by new disruptive technologies and the militarization of cyberspace .\nThe visible product of the militarization is the cyberspace itself. It has officially become the next domain for warfighting according to NATO , placing it alongside the traditional battlegrounds of air, land, and sea. This means every state should be able to defend itself in cyberspace and move toward creating military effects in, through, and from cyberspace. However, cyberspace is very different military domain because it is the only domain created by a man and it is highly technical. Therefore, the cyberspace is heavily dependent on heterogeneous, typically civilian, players with different preferences. It is complex, hard to visualize, and constantly changing. Finally, the cyberspace is clearly a nongeographical domain, which also requires a shift of understanding for military commanders .\nDue to its unique nature, military and nonmilitary (civilian) spheres blur or erode more easily than in traditional (physical) domains. In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor. Nevertheless, the cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries. Specific challenges, such as the problem of attribution and anonymity, or the asymmetric characteristics of cyberspace results in the current situation where nation states must ensure a close civil-military collaboration within a state to achieve and gain cyber power.\nOn the one hand, this strong need for coordinated civil-military inter-agency teamwork exists to protect the nation against serious cyber threats and produce cyber effects. On the other hand, there is also a deficiency of experience and practice with that on both sides, and sometimes even the willingness to cooperate lacks as these two worlds (military and civilian/nonmilitary) are quite different and somewhat isolated. A few state actors such as Netherlands or the Czech Republic have already noticed the issue. From the military perspective, the new Dutch strategic vision for defense released by Dutch Ministry of Defence (MvD, Ministerie van Defensie) focuses on their partners outside the military organization and is going to devote greater attention to the role and task of the military in this gray zone of “strategic competition” between war and peace . Next, the (civilian) national cyber security strategy of the Czech Republic for the years 2021--2025 created by their national cyber security authority\n(NUKIB, Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost) also calls for a common approach to cyber security and defense within the country and the improvement of the collaboration model and information sharing between military and nonmilitary actors .\nHence, this article intends to initiate and contribute to the discussion on civil-military interagency cooperation by considering possible factors that could spoil the establishing of an efficient integrated governmental framework for cyber defense. The article does not deal with the private sector or academia institutions such as universities nor think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It strictly focuses on the governmental interagency cooperation and response system and elaborates on factors that could affect or jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense between key state civilian (nonmilitary) and military entities, such as agencies responsible for CIIP (e.g. national Computer Security Incident Response Teams—CSIRTs), intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and departments of defense, including military cyber operations unit.\nOur main premise is that the ability of a nation state to gain cyber power leads through the efficient whole-of-government approach (so-called integrated government capability) as it is a crucial basis for achieving any power and control in cyberspace. Therefore, the article identifies the most significant barriers preventing this approach.\nResearchers are fully aware of the difficulty with the concept of cyber power, that systematic (empirical) analyses of the topic do not yet exist, and that the body of literature on cyber-power is small and fragmented. Hence, this article narrowly focuses only on the subset of the topic of cyber power and serves as another piece to the debate. It could also be a basis for further academic research or a source of inspiration for policy makers.\nData in this article are—with respect to the character of researched experts—valid mostly for the NATO countries. Recent development in this area is important from the global point of view. Firstly, due to the fact that NATO is the strongest military alliance in the contemporary world and it improves its cyber capabilities. Secondly, development in NATO countries can serve as a model for development in other parts of the world. And thirdly, recent trends in NATO have an indirect impact on the behavior of its adversaries in cyberspace.\n## Integrated government capability as an enabler for cyber power\nThe cyber is an instrument of national power and national states already use cyber means to advance their objectives . The term “cyber power” has become common in security and strategy discourse  and it includes all forms of power in which\npower relations occur wholly or in part in or through cyberspace. However, cyber power is not created simply to exist, but rather to support other elements of national power—political, diplomatic, informational, military, and economic' .\nAccording to Klimburg (2011, p. 43), a nation's cyber power has three dimensions: (1) coordination of operational and policy aspects across governmental structures, (2) coherency of policy through international alliances and legal frameworks, and (3) cooperation of non-state cyber actors. In sum, this so-called Klimburg's Integrated capability model includes: Integrated government capability; Integrated systems capability; and Integrated national capability (Dunn Cavelty, 2018, p. 309). Klimburg claims that while the first two dimensions are important, the integrated national capability must be primarily reached because a major portion of a state's cyber capabilities lies outside direct government control. It is therefore essential to create this “whole-of-nation” cyber capability within a nation state.\nNevertheless, to follow this whole of nation approach is quite challenging for many nation states that are currently developing their cyber defensive and offensive capabilities. Hence, it is reasonable to argue with Klimburg that some nation states simply cannot create an efficient cooperation in cyberspace outside the government, while struggling with their own internal governmental part (so-called “whole-of-government” approach). For many of them, it is about the need to get the basics right first, which means to achieve the central coordination across governmental structures—integrated government capability. The ability of the government to deliver joint action which entails to attack and defend in cyberspace, to draft policy positions, and to share operational resources . In cyberspace, achieving this kind of coordination could be quite challenging for many nation states, because it includes the need for an efficient civil-military cooperation. A field that has been overlooked or marginalized for decades.\nThe issue of civil-military cooperation has already many aspects, specifics, and barriers in traditional operational domains, but in cyberspace, it has even more difficulties. To simply put, it could be hard to achieve efficient cooperation between military and nonmilitary organizations when governments are struggling at a strategic level to work out how to combine the capabilities of their armed forces with other instruments of national power . Even if the nation states and their specific civilian security (police, intelligence agencies and others) and military organizations could hold enough resources to theoretically gain cyber power, it is not entirely clear that they will have the ability to do it and perform efficient joint operations in cyberspace. For example, Bebber\n(2017, p. 427) mentions that there is a problem between a potential cyber power and a cyber effectiveness. Unlocking the power inherent in national capacities and different government actors to affect outcomes in the national interest is the key to cyber effectiveness and real cyber power . Thus, there is a difference between the available human and material resources and how they are utilized by the nation state to generate effects and support national political ends in and through cyberspace.\nFor nation states, it means to predominantly focus on joint cooperation on cyber defense, which is a multidisciplinary task that includes civilian and military state organization efforts. Only through the delivery of joint, defensive and offensive cyber operations and actions, the nation states could efficiently support their strategic security interests and achieve cyber power.\n## United by necessity: the militarization of cyberspace drives a need for civil—military cooperation on cyber defense\nAs Dunn Cavelty (2018, p. 309) points out, Klimburg's integrated capability model is consciously taking cyber power out of the context of projecting national interests coercively and adds a strong defensive cyber security element. Such a view highlights that cyber power and cyber security are intricately linked. However, Dunn Cavelty also adds that a true cyber power also needs to be able to “defend” against cyber threats. In today's view, it means to conduct cyber offensive and defensive military operations rather than a reactive and preventive approach embodied in cyber security. To simply put, there cannot be any true cyber power without a proper (civilian) cyber security and (military) cyber defense. These two environments must be inherently connected, and they must complement each other.\nEven though cyber security and cyber defense are dissimilar concepts and their definitions and theories often vary, they are still closely connected (Pačka, 2015). In this article, cyber security focuses on preventive and reactive measures in its nature, while the cyber defense could be more proactive and it allows to use military capacity and armed forces^{4}. Paraphrasing Clausewitz (1989), cyber defense could be the continuation of ensuring cyber security by other means, such as defensive and offensive cyber operations.\nNation states ensure their cyber security to improve the security and resilience of national infrastructures and services already for decades. Regarding the cyber defense, the governments all over the world has just started to build its capacity a few years ago. Specifically, they usually create\nrband new military cyber units and strive to defend the nation against the most serious cyber threats (Smeets). The issue of civil-military inter-agency cooperation on cyber defense is therefore relatively new. Not surprisingly, while there are numerous guidelines for cooperation between law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and national CSIRTs in cyber security (e.g. ENISA ; Pačka ; Skierka .), there is an insufficient practice and no handbook on cyber defense cooperation issue (Pačka), pp. 93--94).\nThe state practice could be quite challenging in that sense. There are factors such as the tendency of armies across the world to separate themselves from the rest of the nonmilitary security apparatus or the impossibility to ensure defense in cyberspace properly by a military actor alone by itself. In sum, synergy and cooperation with the rest of the national security actors who tackle cyber threats should be secured and exercised regularly. Given the fact that most of the cyberspace can be considered dual-use, it is simply difficult to separate the military and civilian realms (Droege), pp. 570, 576) and any harsh distinction simply does not work.\nAlthough, it is imminent that the segregation is present. It often rests on the assumption that the military and civilian agenda within the national security apparatus is distinct and should be kept distinct. According to Heinl, p. 38), this approach is caused historically. In the past, there was not a generally compelling need to engage civilian security authorities and agencies in military matters. Even large cyber attacks were usually not so significant to reach a threshold that would have activated the armed forces' response in previous years. Some authors (see Dunn Cavelty ; Wallace) persistently argued that the military role in cyberspace outside the context of armed conflict should be limited (Bigelow), p. 3), e.g. on the protection of military networks and information systems. Heinl contends that this was an understandable posture at that time. Even today, most cyber threats are directed against civilian (public or private) systems and networks and therefore have to be dealt (up to a certain threshold) by the targeted organizations themselves or by nonmilitary authorities responsible for cyber security or cyber crime (national CSIRTs, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies, if needed).\nFurthermore, the military's exact role and responsibilities in national cyber security or defense might remain vague from the institutional perspective. A long-term institutional practice within nation states supports this approach. When countries and its institutions usually define new roles and responsibilities of the armed forces or civilian authorities anywhere (including cyberspace), they look for analogies from the physical world and translate them as literally as possible. It means there could be a long-lasting consensus that armed forces should have a limited role in cyber crises\noutside of armed conflict  and they want to just maintain the status quo, where military and civilian security or defense agencies are still somewhat isolated.\nNowadays, the debate has evolved significantly, especially due to increasing evidence of state or state-sponsored attacks on civilian cyberspace infrastructure . The increased militarization of cyberspace is also an apparent trend these days , and regular and irregular warfare are slowly losing their distinction due to the unique nature of cyberspace. Traditional norms of warfare, definitions of combatants and noncombatants, and even what constitutes military action or national casus belli are being turned upside down (TRADOC G-2, 2017, p. 20). It means the military role can simply no longer be limited to the traditional approach of engaging primarily in an armed conflict. It is particularly challenging to ensure national security and defense or even to wage a war without cooperation between military and nonmilitary (civilian) worlds these days. The cyber defense is about working with existing military, civilian, police, central and other structures, cooperation, and mixing missions of different actors with the same goal.\nHence, an advisable starting point for all nation states is to strive to set up an efficient cooperation between civilian authorities and agencies responsible for cyber security and armed forces with the mandate to conduct cyber defense operations. This cooperation framework should always start with the joint protection of those assets that are most essential for the country—critical (information) infrastructure. This is an especially important issue since civilian infrastructures are legitimate targets in case of serious cyber attacks or an armed conflict. And on the other hand, militaries as defenders of last resort for these infrastructures do not have the capacity to be familiar, let alone proficient, in the functioning of civilian networks .\n### CIIP as the core issue for cooperation\nCritical infrastructure protection (CIP) as a concept and practice was first explicitly articulated in the 1990s. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, CIP moved to the center of domestic security doctrine , not only in the United States but also in other countries. Besides the physical protection of the critical infrastructure, cyber security has also become a significant issue in today's world. Cyber threats to the critical infrastructure emanate from a wide spectrum of prospective perpetrators: state-sponsored espionage and sabotage, international terrorism, domestic militants, malevolent hacktivists, or even disaffected insiders .\nThe broadening of this concept has created a new term—critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP). As for the critical infrastructure, even a disruption of critical information infrastructure could result in human death, injuries, or physical damage and its threatening could have a debilitating effect on the security of a given nation, its economy, and the public's safety or health. CIIP is therefore generally acknowledged to be an indispensable component of national security policy  and this ability to ensure CIIP is critical regarding the cyber power of the nation state.\nNevertheless, today's common practice is that civilian authorities are responsible for coordinating cyber security incident response within the critical infrastructure and armed forces are being used only as an instrument of last resort in an armed conflict. It is important to realize that the CIIP is already a part of the cyber defense and it needs to be supported by cross-organizational collaboration to be effective. It is a joint endeavor . According to Heinl (2016, p. 38), the military has the responsibility for national security, which presumably includes the defense of the most extreme cyber threats to critical infrastructure. This common thread (at least in Europe) of limiting the role of the military in cyber security response  therefore calls for a comprehensive approach to civil-military cooperation on both—the cyber security and defense to achieve integrated government capacity. However, the main issue is still that while the military has usually little or no role in the protection of critical infrastructure during peacetime, it would be an enormously challenging task, during, e.g, the war or other cyber-enabled conflict. Hence, ensuring the CIIP only when some major crisis occurs could put the military forces in an uncomfortable position.\nIt is proposed that the CIIP should be a vital kernel for the cooperation on cyber defense between relevant civilian (nonmilitary) and military agencies within a state security apparatus. There is an apparent need to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks from both sides because any of these attacks can have the potential to threaten the national security and stability. For example, given the special nature of cyberspace, it is usually hard to attribute the attacker or the source of the attack in real-time. Attribution of cyber attacks is simply not an easy task. There are technical issues which complicate identifying cyber attackers . At the beginning of nearly all cyber attacks, the culprit is unknown, and it is always reasonable to comprehend that it can be a state, state-sponsored group, terrorist, an activist, or just some criminal actor. Therefore, governments must approach the response to each serious cyber attack targeting the critical information infrastructure very seriously.\nTherefore, a strong demand for mutual collaboration, cooperation, and information sharing among all relevant civilian and military spheres is\n#\nR. PACKA AND M. MARES\nTable 1. Political and organizational factors.\n|  Political factors | Organizational factors  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Incompatible objectives | Structural barriers  |\n|  Conflicting Definitions | Organizational Cultures  |\n|  Conflicting Theories | Organizational Independence  |\n|  Lack of guidance by political leaders | Competition for Resources  |\n|   | Inexperience and Lack of Proven Models  |\n|   | Idiosyncratic/Personality Factors  |\nlogical. As it is apparent also from this research, the practice of crisis response, joint operations, training, and exercises between state civilian and military agencies often lacks and there are still numerous factors that could affect or jeopardize this kind of cooperation in the future.\n# Factors possibly jeopardizing civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense\nMany factors could render the cooperation between a diverse spectrum of civilian and military agencies problematic. While cyber-specific factors that could jeopardize cooperation have not been identified yet, the focus is on general factors that influence civil-military cooperation (e.g., in conflict resolution) and might also apply to cyber defense. Specifically, the identified factors are inspired and based on the work of Olson and Gregorian (2007) and complemented by the literature review and analysis. Only factors that could suit the cyber realm have been picked and modified for research purposes. All factors are divided into two main categories—political and organizational—with the possibility to identify other factors during the research (Table 1).\n# Political factors\nThe first factor is called incompatible objectives. Despite the common objective to ensure national (cyber) security, each national actor (civilian or military) could hold differing, and sometimes, mutually contradictory policy goals (Olson &amp; Gregorian, 2007, p. 7). Given the fact that each national organization has a different role in the national (cyber) security and defense system, it is quite logical and there could be a small deviation. Nevertheless, the ensuring of national security begins internally with all responsible national actors and their interagency cooperation. In an increasingly complex, multi-dimensional policy world, therefore the government must promote cooperation rather than competition among the various stakeholders . If policy goals are excessively incompatible, it could result in conflict or friction among national organizations.\nThe second factor stands for conflicting definitions. Even different definitions could jeopardize cooperation. Many authors (see Futter, 2018, p. 201; Galinec et al. 2017, p. 274) state, little consensus exists about what the term ‘cyber' includes, refers to, or how it is being used. Regarding the terms of cyber security and cyber defense, the situation is similar. Since there are no ‘one-fits-all' definitions, there could be disputes between national actors about the nature or scope or meaning of the terms. These differing definitions could then lead to differing approaches on how to achieve efficient cyber defense and lead to a decrease in cooperation efficiency.\nConflicting theories could also endanger cooperation. Civilian and military institutions could have trouble coordinating at the operational, tactical, or strategic level, or even agreeing on an analysis of the problem, often because they are guided by radically different theories or assumptions about what causes problems or crises and how it can be resolved . This conceptual problem is closely related to the previous factor and contains conflicting theories on how to effectively ensure national cyber security and defense. It may cover a lot of issues, such as a discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in CIIP. While some institutions (e.g. national CSIRTs) strive to patch it immediately to secure the system, others (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement units, and others) attempt to exploit it and use it against the attacker (see Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 74--75; Pačka, 2019, pp. 71--74).\nThe last political factor represents a lack of political guidance, because the successes of each institution alone guarantee nothing in a large-scale national cyber crisis. Lack of political guidance, willpower, and support at the governmental level cannot be simply substituted. Already in 2014, Lewis (2014, p. 566) stated that whether the cyber issue reaches the top level of political leadership depends on factors such as personal interest, a direct experience of malicious cyber action, media attention or the salience of cybersecurity on their national and international agendas. Even the cyber agenda became very political in recent years, factors such as the depth of knowledge about the problem could be still an issue for politicians and other leaders. Lehto and Limnéll (2020, pp. 139, 146) therefore suggests that streamlining and strengthening strategic leadership are key aspects in making sure the cyber vision is achieved. The strong cyber leadership also prevent state agencies from operating solely in their siloes and based only on their objectives and needs. Hence, the lack of political guidance may result in many problems with the coordination. For example, insufficient resources, duplication of activities, uncertain rules of engagement in cyberspace, absence of ‘referees' to resolve competing positions, and unclear national law or jurisdictional boundaries between civilian and military\ninstitutions. Despite NATO officially recognizes cyberspace as the domain of warfare, it could still be a serious concern in many NATO countries. For example, according to the statement of retired Gen. Keith Alexander, even the United States (the pioneer of cyber warfare) still lacked “clear rules of engagement” for conducting offensive cyber operations three years ago . Hence, the lack of political guidance represents another factor that could negatively influence civil-military cooperation.\n### Organizational factors\nStructural barriers could be a strong organizational factor since rigid organizational structures represent a big obstacle to any kind of cooperation. Bureaucratic and daily operational constraints tend to stifle cooperation or any innovation and favor the status quo . In cyber realm, we could say that generally in smaller countries organizations tend to be less hierarchical and rigid. As people know each other personally, they tend to trust others more than in impersonal interactions, and greater flexibility enables them to share information swiftly. However, even in these smaller countries some barriers between civilian and military organizations naturally persists . Hence, the factor could have a serious impact on civil-military cooperation in cyberspace as well.\nNext, organizational culture is a recognized term that describes unwritten norms, rules, and customs in an establishment. The literature suggests (see Arnaud & Tinoco, 2013, p. 37) that organizational culture differs between industries as well as professions. The civilian and military culture is no exception and may cause friction within the national interagency cooperation. There is a general tendency among all organizations and sometimes even across units within the same organization to adopt substantially different planning and implementation terminology or to describe different processes and outcomes even when employing the same terminology . On the other hand, cultural interoperability among organizations stems from interagency understanding, trust, and confidence that require close and ongoing training, liaisons, and exchanges . Different organizational cultures could simply represent an important factor in the issue of civil-military cooperation. Moreover, the lack of knowledge about one another's organizational identity in the meaning of traditions, culture, images, and fundamental goals are represented in this factor.\nEven organizational independence could be for certain (civilian or military) organizations a higher priority than coordination with other organizations as they are not prepared to follow the lead of another organization . Some institutions could see cooperation\nas a fundamental threat to their operational flexibility. While cooperation is perceived as the key to cyber security and defense, the factor of preferring independence to cooperation could be an essential one.\nAs a significant factor appears also a competition for resources. State organizations such as ministries might not cooperate especially when there is a political system with strong line ministries, departmentalization, and silo arrangements. Coordination is therefore often limited to minimal coordination  and sometimes it could also lead to competition. The competition could be about different resources such as status, power, recognition, financial resources and influence . It is worth to mention that all state organizations are fully aware of cyber security and defense being one of the fastest growing fields today. It means there is still a space to set new standards, define new roles, and deliver new tasks. In this regard, some of them could also compete to take over some responsibilities from other agencies. This unhealthy competition might also result in not sharing of responsibility, agenda, or information and intelligence about cyber threats with other partners within the state.\nWhile abundant state practice in conventional warfare exists, cyber defense is a relatively new and very specific area in which a lack of proven models and inexperience is often apparent. Difficulties arise when both civilian and military institutions are stretched beyond their traditional areas of expertise , such as traditional warfighting, intelligence gathering, law-enforcing, or CIP. In the field of cyber defense, lack of best practices and guidelines (see Pačka, 2019, pp. 93--94) might lead to many wrong strategic decisions and choosing a flawed attitude toward cooperation.\nFinally, idiosyncratic or personality factors could play a key role in cyber defense cooperation. Some states might rely heavily on individuals with considerable power and specific attitudes. Stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are not uncommon within and across organizations. Sometimes the willingness to cooperate arises from personal likes or dislikes . This unprofessional behavior might lead to a decrease or cooperation between state organizations.\n## Scope and method\nThe article deals with the topic of cyber power that could nation states achieve through the development of integrated government capacity. The empirical part of the research focuses on one of the main problems in today's whole of government approach in cyberspace—the issue of the cooperation between civilian and military institutions on cyber defense. It is focused particularly on central government departments, agencies, and\nother civilian or military state institutions that are predominantly involved in ensuring cyber defense. Whole of nation approach that includes society, private sector companies, NGOs, or academia is not the focus of the study, but it is considered as the next step in achieving cyber power.\nNamely, the study focuses on the dynamics between: the civilian entities responsible for CIIP (e.g. agencies that usually operate so-called national CSIRTs),law enforcement units,military and civilian intelligence agenciesand departments of defense, including the army and special cyber command units.\nThe research has a mixed design, which includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. To measure all the factors, the researchers use quantitative data from surveys (see below) and then they use qualitative data from interviews that provide rich descriptions of the phenomena and generate new premises. An approach is primarily inductive , which means the research moves from the specific experiences and practice of respondents to the general to explain the phenomena and identify major challenges in civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense within a state.\nThe methods of data collection are document analysis, in-depth semi-structured interviews, and surveys. Getting the right participants is critical to the success of the research and simultaneously it constitutes the main limitation of the study. The willingness to participate and the consent of all participants have not been an issue since the confidentiality is ensured and outcomes are sanitized. However, it turned out that there is only a limited number of experts and practitioners who deals with this specific topic and could have been reached by researchers at the same time. Therefore, the researchers focus on a smaller amount of participants but did a more detailed interviews. It also means that participants were purposively selected by the judgment of the researchers because sampling for proportionality is not the concern of this research . Only participants who could have offered valuable insight and high-quality answers into the topic were selected. Respondent-driven sampling (also known as snowball sampling) has also been used to involve more experts and practitioners from the civilian and military spheres in the research. All respondents came from NATO countries as this research is relevant mainly for the transatlantic area. At the time of this research these participants were serving in the military, working for intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies, CSIRTs or relevant ministries. Some of them were also experts\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED SECURITY RESEARCH\n\n|  Scale | Negligible | Low | Moderate | High | Extreme  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Value | 0 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 1  |\nworking for the intergovernmental organization. The data collection period ran during the years 2019 and mid-2020. The semistructured interviews have been conducted online or face to face and the surveys have been completed in the same way.\nThe empirical research was to address the following question:\nWhat factors could significantly jeopardize civil-military interagency cooperation toward cyber defense within a nation-state?\nBased on the literature review and an analysis of the authors, ten factors of political and organizational nature that could have a strong influence on civil-military cooperation have been identified and then discussed with the respondents during the interviews and surveys. All respondents waged and deliberated each factor, shared their personal views on how important and relevant each factor is, and highlighted it on the impact scale (negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme). Finally, they had an option to add further factors or categories (Table 2).\nBased on these findings, factors with the highest impact (scoring moderate—high to extreme) on civil-military cooperation in cyber defense were recognized and highlighted. Finally, these findings also shed light and form a discussion on the second question:\nHow nation states could gain cyber power through the integrated government capacity?\nConducting this research will help states and their institutions to make better decisions about their approach to cooperation on cyber defense. It could also serve as a basis for future academic research and debate.\n## Findings\nAccording to 13 interviews and surveys with experts and practitioners from civilian and military agencies related to cyber defense, the most significant factors jeopardizing the cooperation on cyber defense are as follows (see Table 3). The findings confirm the necessity of the factors we identified and generate new premises that deserve further attention.\n## Political factors\n### Incompatible objectives (impact: moderate—high)\nMost of the respondents scored this factor as essential and claim that all national institutions or agencies must understand that the state has one\n#\nR. PACKA AND M. MARES\nTable 3. Results of the research.\n|   | Level of impact  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Score | Scale  |\n|  Political factors |  |   |\n|  Incompatible objectives | 0.643 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Conflicting definitions | 0.392 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Conflicting theories | 0.531 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Lack of guidance by political leaders | 0.843 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Organizational factors |  |   |\n|  Structural barriers | 0.688 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Organizational cultures | 0.321 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Organizational independence | 0.469 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Competition for resources | 0.750 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Inexperience and lack of proven models | 0.688 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Idiosyncratic or personality factors | 0.625 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\ncommon goal and their objectives cannot be incompatible. The root cause of the problem here might not necessarily be related to cyber security and defense but rather to the ability and recognition of these topics being a cross-government issue. Building on that, it also turns out that the objectives may not necessarily be incompatible in some cases, but their priorities may differ. It means the cooperation in this area is for some institutions simply not nearly as important as for others.\nNext, some respondents directly highlighted particularly the contrast between the military intelligence (as part of both the military and intelligence community) and cyber security community (national CSIRTs). They added that the problem might lie in the natural isolationist approach of intelligence agencies in general. Moreover, they stated that this approach is not relevant only to civil-military cooperation. It is sometimes relevant even to military and intel-military cooperation, i.e., between military intelligence agencies and the \"green army.\"\n# Conflicting definitions (impact: low—moderate)\nThis factor has almost the lowest score among respondents. Respondents had claimed that the challenge could be easily overcome by combined training and joint cyber exercises and operations. Promoting dialogue and open discussion among the civilian and military community may also solve this problem. Some of the respondents added that conflicting definitions affect primarily policymakers, not (civilian or military) cyber practitioners (at the operational level). In reality, they should figure out these differences fast, adapt to them, and then cooperate effectively.\nIt means it is less of an issue. The lack of definitions should not hinder progress or cooperation. The aphorism \"Perfect is the enemy of good\" has also been used in the interviews. Those differing views might be useful and (if properly managed) contribute to a constructive and more sustainable consensus between organizations.\nIn sum, it seems that a lack of convergence between terminologies used by civilian and military actors does not represent an additional barrier to civil-military cooperation.\n### Conflicting theories (impact: moderate)\nThe factor of conflicting theories has a moderate impact and similar answers as the previous one. Some of the respondents do not perceive it as an immense problem that requires extensional attention at the national level. At a higher level of crisis (i.e. state of emergency), there should be clear national response structures and procedures that can be activated. Below that, although, there may be disagreement and discussion on “who owns the problem” and thus how to coordinate appropriately the full set of resources. However, the most important is to have a common and shared purpose according to respondents. Conflicting theories may have an impact, but well-developed professionals should be able to reach a consensus.\nRespondents also said it is a common feature of the state itself and it is linked to the factor of incompatible objectives. Each actor within the state security system has a slightly different goal and could be guided by different theories or assumptions. Moreover, certain areas of cyber security and defense such as vulnerability weaponizing will always be disputable and it is not necessarily just a civilian-military problem, but also intelligence vs. defensive mandate agencies; or intelligence agencies and law enforcement vs. national CSIRTs.\n### Lack of political guidance (impact: high—extreme)\nThe lack of political guidance and unclear laws in cyber defense is the most critical factor in the research. Most participants agreed that there cannot be any effective action and unity of effort without a clear high-level political guidance supported by an appropriate legal framework and adequate oversight. In states where this situation occurs, it is the root cause of the problem of friction between the civilian and military spheres. Without clear roles and responsibilities and overall strategic guidance, different actors (civilian or military) have less ability to execute in complementary manners.\nNevertheless, some of the military practitioners also pointed out that the factor is relevant especially during peacetime. In times of war or other conflicts, in which armed forces are empowered to perform actions that they would normally not be permitted to do, the impact of this factor would be reduced. In these cases, there is no time or need for extensive political guidance or strict compliance with the national law. Armed forces have\nclear procedures to deal with such situations and they are ready to cooperate closely even with civilian security organizations and others.\n### Organizational factors\n### Structural barriers (impact: moderate—high)\nThis factor seems to be significant. According to some respondents, bureaucracy and operational constraints can make especially the initial cooperation hard. However, once organizational relationships are built, it is much easier to deepen them. In contrast, many others remain in favor of maintaining the status quo. Especially those whom the main responsibility is different than cyber, might still impede cooperation, as they don't see priority in cyber and don't want to innovate. In some states, the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative “from the bottom” (from the operational level). Some military practitioners have also highlighted the problem of horizontal vs. vertical cooperation in the armed forces. They have apparently the necessary internal procedures to cooperate effectively among military units of all kinds (both vertically and horizontally) in place. However, regarding the horizontal cooperation outside the military world, the military often lacks adequate procedures and processes on how to cooperate swiftly and effectively with civilian (nonmilitary) organizations.\n### Organizational cultures (impact: low—moderate)\nSurprisingly, different organizational cultures are perceived by the respondents as the least relevant factor. Only a minority of respondents feel the differences between military and civilian culture as a big obstacle for cooperation. Most of them reported that cultures nowadays can be respected, and they can be learned. Furthermore, all these differences could be more beneficial than restraining. Mutual knowledge is a matter of communication and cooperation, and both worlds would and probably could improve their organization using gained knowledge and experience from its counterparts.\nBoth experts and practitioners from civilian and military spheres agreed that this challenge can be overcome easily by simply working more together. Next, since it is still relatively rare to see specific career paths for military cyber operators, many on active duty will leave and join the industry and civilian public sector, which does serve to increase the understanding of each other's culture, organizational identity, and so on. Even though different cultures exist, the far bigger factor is apparently overall policy differences rather than cultural differences.\nOrganizational independence (impact: moderate)\nIndependence as a higher priority than cooperation is also not seen as an essential factor. Almost all respondents agreed that in most cases, this is not an issue. Although, few of them mentioned the problem of the isolationistic approach of intelligence agencies again. They also shared some of their personal experiences that underpin the presumption of some agencies to prefer independence and operational flexibility to cooperation in (both civilian and military) intelligence agencies.\n### Competition for resources (impact: high)\nAnother high scoring factor is competition for financial resources, status, power, recognition, and influence. Nearly all respondents saw the factor as a relevant barrier and almost all of them ranked the impact as “high.” The competition for resources is an issue especially in an environment where the national roles and responsibilities in cyber security and defense are still not clarified properly. It leads to the situation in which every institution is trying to get a piece of the cyber agenda for itself. This competition could jeopardize the cooperation a lot. Some respondents have also stated that it is mainly a matter of a strategic (not operational) level of cooperation between institutions and the problem is not exclusive to civilian and military cooperation again.\n### Inexperience and lack of proven models (impact: moderate—high)\nThe lack of proven models and inexperience seems to be a very relevant factor in the cyber security and defense area. It is no wonder since it is still a relatively new area for both civilian and military institutions. Some respondents even called the current situation as a startup era of cyber defense. Especially for more rigid military institutions, it could have an extremely negative impact until the necessary practice and experience are gained. According to some, one of the main obstacles in this issue could be also a lack of general cyber awareness and education of “non-specialists” and leaders at all levels. The major problem with cyber defense for a “nonspecialist” is that it's hard to visualize. The way to overcome this could be, e.g. cyber security exercises, tailored especially for high-level management. Finally, respondents see this factor as a great opportunity to start a discussion among all civilian and military institutions. It could be the motivation for some states to create an effective national system of cyber defense from scratch.\n### Idiosyncratic/personality factors (impact: moderate—high)\nThe last factor has a moderate to high impact. The human factor in collaboration on cyber defense is apparently as important as everywhere else. Although cyberspace is a technology-driven world, people are still at the\ncore of it and they are vulnerable to idiosyncratic disputes. Not surprisingly, those respondents who had a real-life experience with it had scored higher than those without it. Some of them have also added that this factor is especially important in the phase of initiation and establishment of cooperation between entities. On the other hand, given the bureaucracy and the way how state institutions work, this effect might be marginalized in the long term. It means that the impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes can be minimized over policy design in the cyber defense and related security areas.\n## Conclusion: factors jeopardizing the development of integrated government capability identified\nThere are many ways how governments can gain, achieve and project cyber power. For example, Healey (2016) claims that still too much emphasis is currently placed on the success or failure of offensive and defensive capabilities, rather than other factors and on long-term national security outcomes. It is apparent that these capabilities are and will be very closely linked to the concept of cyber power, and that both policy (decision) makers and academics are interested in it for obvious reasons. Next, it is also possible to argue that an efficient cyber defense is the focal prerequisite for gaining and increasing power in cyberspace, since it is almost impossible to project power in cyberspace when the nation states have insufficient military power. However, this hard-cyber power approach to winning in cyberspace through military domination is plausibly short-sighted. Nation states should really aim to incorporate many other variables into their grand strategies and policies in cyberspace and use a holistic approach to the integrated government capacity to achieve cyber power. Therefore, this article focused on the identification of factors that could jeopardize integrated government capacity (or so-called whole of government approach) in cyber defense and more specifically the focus was narrowed down to the field of civil-military interagency cooperation within a nation state.\nResearch has demonstrated that in today's hyper-connected world, the traditional state practice just fades away. Global uncomfortable changes in warfare domains gradually force states to rethink many aspects of their military strategies and policies, including cyber defense. With cyber threats evolving into new, complex forms, the lack of fresh, modern solutions at the national level becomes a handicap and will make it difficult for the nation state to project its cyber power.\nWith the understanding of the extensiveness of the cyber issue and its dynamic nature, six critical areas have been identified where further consideration is needed. The area could strongly affect the establishment of\nintegrated government capacity or a strategic framework for cyber power in general.\nAccording to findings, the most important factors (for the lowest to highest impact) are:Idiosyncratic/Personality factors;Incompatible objectives;Structural barriers;Inexperience and lack of proven models;Competition for resources;Lack of guidance by political leaders.\nThe impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are apparent even in the world of cyber defense. According to practice, rationality is simply not always present. Subjective elements, such as human factors, could easily undermine the will and trust between agencies and make cooperation impossible. Hence, nation states should pay attention even to this factor which seems to be minor, but like everywhere else, it could grow into a big issue. On the other hand, the effect of the factor could be minimized through policy design in the cyber defense and security areas.\nNext, the incompatible objectives of each state agency could bring a lot of problems to the cooperation on cyber defense. Cyberspace itself is a cross-cutting domain and ensuring cyber defense means to deal with a cross-government issue. There is still a lack of common understanding among decision-makers or chiefs of relevant agencies and departments that the issue is a national topic, nor the responsibility of one or a few agencies in the state. A consensus on cyber defense should be reached across military and nonmilitary institutions and joint prioritization should be done as well on the governmental level. Especially, the intelligence agencies should be more open to cooperation with other relevant actors and leave their traditional isolationist approach within the state security apparatus.\nStructural barriers to cooperation, such as bureaucracy and operational constraints, can make cooperation hard as well. Maintaining the status quo and a lack of willingness to change the agenda or perform new activities and tasks is another issue that could easily jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense. These barriers are also seen as hardly removable as the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative. Decisions should come from the top in this regard. It is primarily a military issue and the army's way of conducting business. The problem of facilitating horizontal cooperation outside the military world is evident and should be overcome to ensure cyber defense more effectively and on time.\nLack of experience and shortage of best practice is an unsurprisingly an essential factor that could negatively impact the cooperation on cyber defense. It could be an enormous problem especially for the more rigid military, but in contrast, it could be a great opportunity to approach the challenge and establish a new and effectively functioning system of cyber defense cooperation between civilians and military spheres.\nIt is also perceived from the practice that state agencies or ministries are not an exception regarding power and budget struggles. With countries focusing on the new challenges posed by cyber threats and developing their capabilities to tackle them, there is also a new opportunity to gain more political power or financial resources from the state budget. These struggles are not exclusive to civilian and military dichotomy; however, they could easily result in a rivalry between state agencies. It is not perhaps exclusive to cyber security and defense only but could be happening in other trending agendas such as hybrid warfare or space security.\nThe most significant challenge in bridging the obvious gap between civilian and military actors seems to be the lack of political direction and a clear vision on cyber matters from political leaders. It is sometimes a result of scattering the national responsibility for cyber defense among too many civilian and military institutions, together with the lack of enlightened politicians eager to lead in cyber defense effectively. The main issue here could be that leaders must meticulously review all existing policies in the context of cyber defense to ensure cyber defense properly.\nFinally, a lot of respondents also mentioned the importance of the legal and ethical aspects of this kind of cooperation. Legal elements complement political and organizational factors and they are also implied within them to some extent. Cyber defense as a mechanism of responding to the sheer scale of cyber threats is not just a technical discipline, it is linked to a vast range of legal and ethical issues. Therefore, the cyber defense principles, measures, and responsibilities of each actor must be enshrined in the law to protect society from abuses of power and guarantee citizens their rights and freedoms. However, besides that, it also helps to set clear responsibilities of official authorities dealing with cyber defense and it provides a solid ground for the cooperation. In contrast, the lack of relevant legislation or legal vagueness makes setbacks for any kind of cooperation.\nAll these factors could seriously jeopardize the unity of effort at the governmental level and overall cooperation in cyber defense. Therefore, nation states should continuously review their system of collaboration among relevant state military nonmilitary actors and focus on these sets of factors. In practice, it is obvious that all negative factors could be overcome or prevented only when a clear vision and leadership eclipse the self-interest of agencies. States and their decision-makers should approach cyber defense\nas a new agenda where creating a symbiotic relationship across both civilian and military agencies is necessary. The classic distinctions between military and civilian worlds are simply less clear-cut in cyber defense. If the nation state has an ambition to gain and project cyber power, it should make the joint cyber defense a cornerstone of plans for future development and strategic orientation. A unification of differing perceptions of the mission and each other's role within the cyber defense system is needed to establish a fully functioning integrated government capacity. A culture of shared responsibility must be inherent too.\nBased on the findings, it is also possible to make some recommendations for a proper working model of cooperation on cyber defense. It should be based on governmental level actions such as: regular joint cyber defense exercises at both technical and strategic level; operational situational awareness and intensive information sharing and exchange; clarifying the exact roles and responsibilities in the national (cyber) defense system and making cyber leaders from all relevant decision-makers and head of agencies. Especially the enlightened leaders can manage and drive their institution to become a better counterpart for cooperation.",

It reviews the civil-military interagency cooperation and aims to identify factors that could jeopardize it. First, it provides a theoretical background for the research and then according to interviews and surveys, the factors with the highest negative impact are recognized. Based on this research, the most significant challenges in bridging the gap between civilian and military worlds seems to be power and budget struggles and a lack of political direction on cyber matters from leaders.\n# KEYWORDS\nCyber defense; cyber power; cyber security; civil-military; cyberspace\n# Introduction\nCyber power has become a pressing issue for many nation states since the militarization of cyberspace has already begun and it is one of the latest additions to the power family tree (Dunn Caverty, 2018, p. 306). The trend of offensive cyberspace operations conducted by nation-states or state-sponsored groups together with the rise of serious cyber attacks on critical infrastructures¹ naturally increase political and military interest in cyber power and relevant state capabilities. It also calls for a review of a national approach to defense in cyberspace, where defense is no longer just a military issue and to gain a real cyber power and cyber effectiveness is possible only through the whole-of-government (civilian and military) cooperation.\nNowadays, cyber threats are very serious. While contemporary cyber attacks are usually still happening rather on a smaller scale or with lower impact, they may quickly rise to an enormous problem for national security and defense. We could have seen it recently when a lot of minor cyber attacks at high frequency were targeting health care facilities during the\nCONTACT Roman Pačka\n\\odot\n roman.packa@gmail.com\n\\odot\n Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University, Joštova 218/10, 602 00 Brno, Czech Republic.\n© 2021 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nglobal COVID-19 crisis (INTERPOL, 2020) and they seriously threatened the national security of several countries. The trend of escalating cyber maneuvers and the increasing prominence of cyber operations within the military is also apparent. It has already caused the development of offensive state cyber capabilities in many European and NATO countries. The modern warfare is currently shaped by new disruptive technologies and the militarization of cyberspace (Gomez, 2016; Smeets, 2018).\nThe visible product of the militarization is the cyberspace itself. It has officially become the next domain for warfighting according to NATO (NATO, 2016), placing it alongside the traditional battlegrounds of air, land, and sea. This means every state should be able to defend itself in cyberspace and move toward creating military effects in, through, and from cyberspace. However, cyberspace is very different military domain because it is the only domain created by a man and it is highly technical. Therefore, the cyberspace is heavily dependent on heterogeneous, typically civilian, players with different preferences. It is complex, hard to visualize, and constantly changing. Finally, the cyberspace is clearly a nongeographical domain, which also requires a shift of understanding for military commanders (Ablon et al. 2019, p. 8).\nDue to its unique nature, military and nonmilitary (civilian) spheres blur or erode more easily than in traditional (physical) domains. In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor. Nevertheless, the cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries. Specific challenges, such as the problem of attribution and anonymity, or the asymmetric characteristics of cyberspace results in the current situation where nation states must ensure a close civil-military collaboration within a state to achieve and gain cyber power.\nOn the one hand, this strong need for coordinated civil-military inter-agency teamwork exists to protect the nation against serious cyber threats and produce cyber effects. On the other hand, there is also a deficiency of experience and practice with that on both sides, and sometimes even the willingness to cooperate lacks as these two worlds (military and civilian/nonmilitary) are quite different and somewhat isolated. A few state actors such as Netherlands or the Czech Republic have already noticed the issue. From the military perspective, the new Dutch strategic vision for defense released by Dutch Ministry of Defence (MvD, Ministerie van Defensie) focuses on their partners outside the military organization and is going to devote greater attention to the role and task of the military in this gray zone of “strategic competition” between war and peace (MvD, 2020, p. 23). Next, the (civilian) national cyber security strategy of the Czech Republic for the years 2021--2025 created by their national cyber security authority\n(NUKIB, Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost) also calls for a common approach to cyber security and defense within the country and the improvement of the collaboration model and information sharing between military and nonmilitary actors (NUKIB, 2020, pp. 10--11).\nHence, this article intends to initiate and contribute to the discussion on civil-military interagency cooperation by considering possible factors that could spoil the establishing of an efficient integrated governmental framework for cyber defense. The article does not deal with the private sector or academia institutions such as universities nor think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It strictly focuses on the governmental interagency cooperation and response system and elaborates on factors that could affect or jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense between key state civilian (nonmilitary) and military entities, such as agencies responsible for CIIP (e.g. national Computer Security Incident Response Teams—CSIRTs), intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and departments of defense, including military cyber operations unit.\nOur main premise is that the ability of a nation state to gain cyber power leads through the efficient whole-of-government approach (so-called integrated government capability) as it is a crucial basis for achieving any power and control in cyberspace. Therefore, the article identifies the most significant barriers preventing this approach.\nResearchers are fully aware of the difficulty with the concept of cyber power, that systematic (empirical) analyses of the topic do not yet exist, and that the body of literature on cyber-power is small and fragmented. Hence, this article narrowly focuses only on the subset of the topic of cyber power and serves as another piece to the debate. It could also be a basis for further academic research or a source of inspiration for policy makers.\nData in this article are—with respect to the character of researched experts—valid mostly for the NATO countries. Recent development in this area is important from the global point of view. Firstly, due to the fact that NATO is the strongest military alliance in the contemporary world and it improves its cyber capabilities. Secondly, development in NATO countries can serve as a model for development in other parts of the world. And thirdly, recent trends in NATO have an indirect impact on the behavior of its adversaries in cyberspace.\n## Integrated government capability as an enabler for cyber power\nThe cyber is an instrument of national power and national states already use cyber means to advance their objectives (Willett, 2019, p. 86). The term “cyber power” has become common in security and strategy discourse (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 43) and it includes all forms of power in which\npower relations occur wholly or in part in or through cyberspace. However, cyber power is not created simply to exist, but rather to support other elements of national power—political, diplomatic, informational, military, and economic' (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 44).\nAccording to Klimburg (2011, p. 43), a nation's cyber power has three dimensions: (1) coordination of operational and policy aspects across governmental structures, (2) coherency of policy through international alliances and legal frameworks, and (3) cooperation of non-state cyber actors. In sum, this so-called Klimburg's Integrated capability model includes: Integrated government capability; Integrated systems capability; and Integrated national capability (Dunn Cavelty, 2018, p. 309). Klimburg claims that while the first two dimensions are important, the integrated national capability must be primarily reached because a major portion of a state's cyber capabilities lies outside direct government control. It is therefore essential to create this “whole-of-nation” cyber capability within a nation state.\nNevertheless, to follow this whole of nation approach is quite challenging for many nation states that are currently developing their cyber defensive and offensive capabilities. Hence, it is reasonable to argue with Klimburg that some nation states simply cannot create an efficient cooperation in cyberspace outside the government, while struggling with their own internal governmental part (so-called “whole-of-government” approach). For many of them, it is about the need to get the basics right first, which means to achieve the central coordination across governmental structures—integrated government capability. The ability of the government to deliver joint action which entails to attack and defend in cyberspace, to draft policy positions, and to share operational resources (Klimburg, 2011, pp. 173--174). In cyberspace, achieving this kind of coordination could be quite challenging for many nation states, because it includes the need for an efficient civil-military cooperation. A field that has been overlooked or marginalized for decades.\nThe issue of civil-military cooperation has already many aspects, specifics, and barriers in traditional operational domains, but in cyberspace, it has even more difficulties. To simply put, it could be hard to achieve efficient cooperation between military and nonmilitary organizations when governments are struggling at a strategic level to work out how to combine the capabilities of their armed forces with other instruments of national power (Inkster, 2017, p. 29). Even if the nation states and their specific civilian security (police, intelligence agencies and others) and military organizations could hold enough resources to theoretically gain cyber power, it is not entirely clear that they will have the ability to do it and perform efficient joint operations in cyberspace. For example, Bebber\n(2017, p. 427) mentions that there is a problem between a potential cyber power and a cyber effectiveness. Unlocking the power inherent in national capacities and different government actors to affect outcomes in the national interest is the key to cyber effectiveness and real cyber power (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 40). Thus, there is a difference between the available human and material resources and how they are utilized by the nation state to generate effects and support national political ends in and through cyberspace.\nFor nation states, it means to predominantly focus on joint cooperation on cyber defense, which is a multidisciplinary task that includes civilian and military state organization efforts. Only through the delivery of joint, defensive and offensive cyber operations and actions, the nation states could efficiently support their strategic security interests and achieve cyber power.\n## United by necessity: the militarization of cyberspace drives a need for civil—military cooperation on cyber defense\nAs Dunn Cavelty (2018, p. 309) points out, Klimburg's integrated capability model is consciously taking cyber power out of the context of projecting national interests coercively and adds a strong defensive cyber security element. Such a view highlights that cyber power and cyber security are intricately linked. However, Dunn Cavelty also adds that a true cyber power also needs to be able to “defend” against cyber threats. In today's view, it means to conduct cyber offensive and defensive military operations rather than a reactive and preventive approach embodied in cyber security. To simply put, there cannot be any true cyber power without a proper (civilian) cyber security and (military) cyber defense. These two environments must be inherently connected, and they must complement each other.\nEven though cyber security and cyber defense are dissimilar concepts and their definitions and theories often vary, they are still closely connected (Pačka, 2015). In this article, cyber security focuses on preventive and reactive measures in its nature, while the cyber defense could be more proactive and it allows to use military capacity and armed forces^{4}. Paraphrasing Clausewitz (1989), cyber defense could be the continuation of ensuring cyber security by other means, such as defensive and offensive cyber operations.\nNation states ensure their cyber security to improve the security and resilience of national infrastructures and services already for decades. Regarding the cyber defense, the governments all over the world has just started to build its capacity a few years ago. Specifically, they usually create\nrband new military cyber units and strive to defend the nation against the most serious cyber threats (Smeets). The issue of civil-military inter-agency cooperation on cyber defense is therefore relatively new. Not surprisingly, while there are numerous guidelines for cooperation between law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and national CSIRTs in cyber security (e.g. ENISA ; Pačka ; Skierka .), there is an insufficient practice and no handbook on cyber defense cooperation issue (Pačka), pp. 93--94).\nThe state practice could be quite challenging in that sense. There are factors such as the tendency of armies across the world to separate themselves from the rest of the nonmilitary security apparatus or the impossibility to ensure defense in cyberspace properly by a military actor alone by itself. In sum, synergy and cooperation with the rest of the national security actors who tackle cyber threats should be secured and exercised regularly. Given the fact that most of the cyberspace can be considered dual-use, it is simply difficult to separate the military and civilian realms (Droege), pp. 570, 576) and any harsh distinction simply does not work.\nAlthough, it is imminent that the segregation is present. It often rests on the assumption that the military and civilian agenda within the national security apparatus is distinct and should be kept distinct. According to Heinl, p. 38), this approach is caused historically. In the past, there was not a generally compelling need to engage civilian security authorities and agencies in military matters. Even large cyber attacks were usually not so significant to reach a threshold that would have activated the armed forces' response in previous years. Some authors (see Dunn Cavelty ; Wallace) persistently argued that the military role in cyberspace outside the context of armed conflict should be limited (Bigelow), p. 3), e.g. on the protection of military networks and information systems. Heinl contends that this was an understandable posture at that time. Even today, most cyber threats are directed against civilian (public or private) systems and networks and therefore have to be dealt (up to a certain threshold) by the targeted organizations themselves or by nonmilitary authorities responsible for cyber security or cyber crime (national CSIRTs, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies, if needed).\nFurthermore, the military's exact role and responsibilities in national cyber security or defense might remain vague from the institutional perspective. A long-term institutional practice within nation states supports this approach. When countries and its institutions usually define new roles and responsibilities of the armed forces or civilian authorities anywhere (including cyberspace), they look for analogies from the physical world and translate them as literally as possible. It means there could be a long-lasting consensus that armed forces should have a limited role in cyber crises\noutside of armed conflict (Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 72--73) and they want to just maintain the status quo, where military and civilian security or defense agencies are still somewhat isolated.\nNowadays, the debate has evolved significantly, especially due to increasing evidence of state or state-sponsored attacks on civilian cyberspace infrastructure (Bigelow, 2019, p. 3). The increased militarization of cyberspace is also an apparent trend these days (Gomez, 2016), and regular and irregular warfare are slowly losing their distinction due to the unique nature of cyberspace. Traditional norms of warfare, definitions of combatants and noncombatants, and even what constitutes military action or national casus belli are being turned upside down (TRADOC G-2, 2017, p. 20). It means the military role can simply no longer be limited to the traditional approach of engaging primarily in an armed conflict. It is particularly challenging to ensure national security and defense or even to wage a war without cooperation between military and nonmilitary (civilian) worlds these days. The cyber defense is about working with existing military, civilian, police, central and other structures, cooperation, and mixing missions of different actors with the same goal.\nHence, an advisable starting point for all nation states is to strive to set up an efficient cooperation between civilian authorities and agencies responsible for cyber security and armed forces with the mandate to conduct cyber defense operations. This cooperation framework should always start with the joint protection of those assets that are most essential for the country—critical (information) infrastructure. This is an especially important issue since civilian infrastructures are legitimate targets in case of serious cyber attacks or an armed conflict. And on the other hand, militaries as defenders of last resort for these infrastructures do not have the capacity to be familiar, let alone proficient, in the functioning of civilian networks (Tatar et al. 2017, p. 7).\n### CIIP as the core issue for cooperation\nCritical infrastructure protection (CIP) as a concept and practice was first explicitly articulated in the 1990s. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, CIP moved to the center of domestic security doctrine (Collier & Lakoff, 2008, p. 35), not only in the United States but also in other countries. Besides the physical protection of the critical infrastructure, cyber security has also become a significant issue in today's world. Cyber threats to the critical infrastructure emanate from a wide spectrum of prospective perpetrators: state-sponsored espionage and sabotage, international terrorism, domestic militants, malevolent hacktivists, or even disaffected insiders (Rudner, 2013, p. 453).\nThe broadening of this concept has created a new term—critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP). As for the critical infrastructure, even a disruption of critical information infrastructure could result in human death, injuries, or physical damage and its threatening could have a debilitating effect on the security of a given nation, its economy, and the public's safety or health. CIIP is therefore generally acknowledged to be an indispensable component of national security policy (Suter, 2007, p. 1) and this ability to ensure CIIP is critical regarding the cyber power of the nation state.\nNevertheless, today's common practice is that civilian authorities are responsible for coordinating cyber security incident response within the critical infrastructure and armed forces are being used only as an instrument of last resort in an armed conflict. It is important to realize that the CIIP is already a part of the cyber defense and it needs to be supported by cross-organizational collaboration to be effective. It is a joint endeavor (Skopik et al. 2016, p. 157). According to Heinl (2016, p. 38), the military has the responsibility for national security, which presumably includes the defense of the most extreme cyber threats to critical infrastructure. This common thread (at least in Europe) of limiting the role of the military in cyber security response (Boecke et al. 2015, p. 73) therefore calls for a comprehensive approach to civil-military cooperation on both—the cyber security and defense to achieve integrated government capacity. However, the main issue is still that while the military has usually little or no role in the protection of critical infrastructure during peacetime, it would be an enormously challenging task, during, e.g, the war or other cyber-enabled conflict. Hence, ensuring the CIIP only when some major crisis occurs could put the military forces in an uncomfortable position.\nIt is proposed that the CIIP should be a vital kernel for the cooperation on cyber defense between relevant civilian (nonmilitary) and military agencies within a state security apparatus. There is an apparent need to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks from both sides because any of these attacks can have the potential to threaten the national security and stability. For example, given the special nature of cyberspace, it is usually hard to attribute the attacker or the source of the attack in real-time. Attribution of cyber attacks is simply not an easy task. There are technical issues which complicate identifying cyber attackers (Yannakogeorgos, 2013, p. 2). At the beginning of nearly all cyber attacks, the culprit is unknown, and it is always reasonable to comprehend that it can be a state, state-sponsored group, terrorist, an activist, or just some criminal actor. Therefore, governments must approach the response to each serious cyber attack targeting the critical information infrastructure very seriously.\nTherefore, a strong demand for mutual collaboration, cooperation, and information sharing among all relevant civilian and military spheres is\n#\nR.

As it is apparent also from this research, the practice of crisis response, joint operations, training, and exercises between state civilian and military agencies often lacks and there are still numerous factors that could affect or jeopardize this kind of cooperation in the future.\n# Factors possibly jeopardizing civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense\nMany factors could render the cooperation between a diverse spectrum of civilian and military agencies problematic. While cyber-specific factors that could jeopardize cooperation have not been identified yet, the focus is on general factors that influence civil-military cooperation (e.g., in conflict resolution) and might also apply to cyber defense. Specifically, the identified factors are inspired and based on the work of Olson and Gregorian (2007) and complemented by the literature review and analysis. Only factors that could suit the cyber realm have been picked and modified for research purposes. All factors are divided into two main categories—political and organizational—with the possibility to identify other factors during the research (Table 1).\n# Political factors\nThe first factor is called incompatible objectives. Despite the common objective to ensure national (cyber) security, each national actor (civilian or military) could hold differing, and sometimes, mutually contradictory policy goals (Olson &amp; Gregorian, 2007, p. 7). Given the fact that each national organization has a different role in the national (cyber) security and defense system, it is quite logical and there could be a small deviation. Nevertheless, the ensuring of national security begins internally with all responsible national actors and their interagency cooperation. In an increasingly complex, multi-dimensional policy world, therefore the government must promote cooperation rather than competition among the various stakeholders (Whittaker et al., 2010, p. 32). If policy goals are excessively incompatible, it could result in conflict or friction among national organizations.\nThe second factor stands for conflicting definitions. Even different definitions could jeopardize cooperation. Many authors (see Futter, 2018, p. 201; Galinec et al. 2017, p. 274) state, little consensus exists about what the term ‘cyber' includes, refers to, or how it is being used. Regarding the terms of cyber security and cyber defense, the situation is similar. Since there are no ‘one-fits-all' definitions, there could be disputes between national actors about the nature or scope or meaning of the terms. These differing definitions could then lead to differing approaches on how to achieve efficient cyber defense and lead to a decrease in cooperation efficiency.\nConflicting theories could also endanger cooperation. Civilian and military institutions could have trouble coordinating at the operational, tactical, or strategic level, or even agreeing on an analysis of the problem, often because they are guided by radically different theories or assumptions about what causes problems or crises and how it can be resolved (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 9). This conceptual problem is closely related to the previous factor and contains conflicting theories on how to effectively ensure national cyber security and defense. It may cover a lot of issues, such as a discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in CIIP. While some institutions (e.g. national CSIRTs) strive to patch it immediately to secure the system, others (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement units, and others) attempt to exploit it and use it against the attacker (see Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 74--75; Pačka, 2019, pp. 71--74).\nThe last political factor represents a lack of political guidance, because the successes of each institution alone guarantee nothing in a large-scale national cyber crisis. Lack of political guidance, willpower, and support at the governmental level cannot be simply substituted. Already in 2014, Lewis (2014, p. 566) stated that whether the cyber issue reaches the top level of political leadership depends on factors such as personal interest, a direct experience of malicious cyber action, media attention or the salience of cybersecurity on their national and international agendas. Even the cyber agenda became very political in recent years, factors such as the depth of knowledge about the problem could be still an issue for politicians and other leaders. Lehto and Limnéll (2020, pp. 139, 146) therefore suggests that streamlining and strengthening strategic leadership are key aspects in making sure the cyber vision is achieved. The strong cyber leadership also prevent state agencies from operating solely in their siloes and based only on their objectives and needs. Hence, the lack of political guidance may result in many problems with the coordination. For example, insufficient resources, duplication of activities, uncertain rules of engagement in cyberspace, absence of ‘referees' to resolve competing positions, and unclear national law or jurisdictional boundaries between civilian and military\ninstitutions. Despite NATO officially recognizes cyberspace as the domain of warfare, it could still be a serious concern in many NATO countries. For example, according to the statement of retired Gen. Keith Alexander, even the United States (the pioneer of cyber warfare) still lacked “clear rules of engagement” for conducting offensive cyber operations three years ago (Lyngaas, 2018). Hence, the lack of political guidance represents another factor that could negatively influence civil-military cooperation.\n### Organizational factors\nStructural barriers could be a strong organizational factor since rigid organizational structures represent a big obstacle to any kind of cooperation. Bureaucratic and daily operational constraints tend to stifle cooperation or any innovation and favor the status quo (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 11). In cyber realm, we could say that generally in smaller countries organizations tend to be less hierarchical and rigid. As people know each other personally, they tend to trust others more than in impersonal interactions, and greater flexibility enables them to share information swiftly. However, even in these smaller countries some barriers between civilian and military organizations naturally persists (Pernik & Tuohy, 2014, p. 4, 6). Hence, the factor could have a serious impact on civil-military cooperation in cyberspace as well.\nNext, organizational culture is a recognized term that describes unwritten norms, rules, and customs in an establishment. The literature suggests (see Arnaud & Tinoco, 2013, p. 37) that organizational culture differs between industries as well as professions. The civilian and military culture is no exception and may cause friction within the national interagency cooperation. There is a general tendency among all organizations and sometimes even across units within the same organization to adopt substantially different planning and implementation terminology or to describe different processes and outcomes even when employing the same terminology (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 11). On the other hand, cultural interoperability among organizations stems from interagency understanding, trust, and confidence that require close and ongoing training, liaisons, and exchanges (Pernik & Tuohy, 2014, p. 3). Different organizational cultures could simply represent an important factor in the issue of civil-military cooperation. Moreover, the lack of knowledge about one another's organizational identity in the meaning of traditions, culture, images, and fundamental goals are represented in this factor.\nEven organizational independence could be for certain (civilian or military) organizations a higher priority than coordination with other organizations as they are not prepared to follow the lead of another organization (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 13). Some institutions could see cooperation\nas a fundamental threat to their operational flexibility. While cooperation is perceived as the key to cyber security and defense, the factor of preferring independence to cooperation could be an essential one.\nAs a significant factor appears also a competition for resources. State organizations such as ministries might not cooperate especially when there is a political system with strong line ministries, departmentalization, and silo arrangements. Coordination is therefore often limited to minimal coordination (Christensen et al. 2015) and sometimes it could also lead to competition. The competition could be about different resources such as status, power, recognition, financial resources and influence (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 14). It is worth to mention that all state organizations are fully aware of cyber security and defense being one of the fastest growing fields today. It means there is still a space to set new standards, define new roles, and deliver new tasks. In this regard, some of them could also compete to take over some responsibilities from other agencies. This unhealthy competition might also result in not sharing of responsibility, agenda, or information and intelligence about cyber threats with other partners within the state.\nWhile abundant state practice in conventional warfare exists, cyber defense is a relatively new and very specific area in which a lack of proven models and inexperience is often apparent. Difficulties arise when both civilian and military institutions are stretched beyond their traditional areas of expertise (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 15), such as traditional warfighting, intelligence gathering, law-enforcing, or CIP. In the field of cyber defense, lack of best practices and guidelines (see Pačka, 2019, pp. 93--94) might lead to many wrong strategic decisions and choosing a flawed attitude toward cooperation.\nFinally, idiosyncratic or personality factors could play a key role in cyber defense cooperation. Some states might rely heavily on individuals with considerable power and specific attitudes. Stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are not uncommon within and across organizations. Sometimes the willingness to cooperate arises from personal likes or dislikes (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 16). This unprofessional behavior might lead to a decrease or cooperation between state organizations.\n## Scope and method\nThe article deals with the topic of cyber power that could nation states achieve through the development of integrated government capacity. The empirical part of the research focuses on one of the main problems in today's whole of government approach in cyberspace—the issue of the cooperation between civilian and military institutions on cyber defense. It is focused particularly on central government departments, agencies, and\nother civilian or military state institutions that are predominantly involved in ensuring cyber defense. Whole of nation approach that includes society, private sector companies, NGOs, or academia is not the focus of the study, but it is considered as the next step in achieving cyber power.\nNamely, the study focuses on the dynamics between: the civilian entities responsible for CIIP (e.g. agencies that usually operate so-called national CSIRTs),law enforcement units,military and civilian intelligence agenciesand departments of defense, including the army and special cyber command units.\nThe research has a mixed design, which includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. To measure all the factors, the researchers use quantitative data from surveys (see below) and then they use qualitative data from interviews that provide rich descriptions of the phenomena and generate new premises. An approach is primarily inductive (Corbin & Strauss, 2008), which means the research moves from the specific experiences and practice of respondents to the general to explain the phenomena and identify major challenges in civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense within a state.\nThe methods of data collection are document analysis, in-depth semi-structured interviews, and surveys. Getting the right participants is critical to the success of the research and simultaneously it constitutes the main limitation of the study. The willingness to participate and the consent of all participants have not been an issue since the confidentiality is ensured and outcomes are sanitized. However, it turned out that there is only a limited number of experts and practitioners who deals with this specific topic and could have been reached by researchers at the same time. Therefore, the researchers focus on a smaller amount of participants but did a more detailed interviews. It also means that participants were purposively selected by the judgment of the researchers because sampling for proportionality is not the concern of this research (Morse, 2007). Only participants who could have offered valuable insight and high-quality answers into the topic were selected. Respondent-driven sampling (also known as snowball sampling) has also been used to involve more experts and practitioners from the civilian and military spheres in the research. All respondents came from NATO countries as this research is relevant mainly for the transatlantic area. At the time of this research these participants were serving in the military, working for intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies, CSIRTs or relevant ministries. Some of them were also experts\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED SECURITY RESEARCH\n449\nTable 2.

The data collection period ran during the years 2019 and mid-2020. The semistructured interviews have been conducted online or face to face and the surveys have been completed in the same way.\nThe empirical research was to address the following question:\nWhat factors could significantly jeopardize civil-military interagency cooperation toward cyber defense within a nation-state?\nBased on the literature review and an analysis of the authors, ten factors of political and organizational nature that could have a strong influence on civil-military cooperation have been identified and then discussed with the respondents during the interviews and surveys. All respondents waged and deliberated each factor, shared their personal views on how important and relevant each factor is, and highlighted it on the impact scale (negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme). Finally, they had an option to add further factors or categories (Table 2).\nBased on these findings, factors with the highest impact (scoring moderate—high to extreme) on civil-military cooperation in cyber defense were recognized and highlighted. Finally, these findings also shed light and form a discussion on the second question:\nHow nation states could gain cyber power through the integrated government capacity?\nConducting this research will help states and their institutions to make better decisions about their approach to cooperation on cyber defense. It could also serve as a basis for future academic research and debate.\n## Findings\nAccording to 13 interviews and surveys with experts and practitioners from civilian and military agencies related to cyber defense, the most significant factors jeopardizing the cooperation on cyber defense are as follows (see Table 3). The findings confirm the necessity of the factors we identified and generate new premises that deserve further attention.\n## Political factors\n### Incompatible objectives (impact: moderate—high)\nMost of the respondents scored this factor as essential and claim that all national institutions or agencies must understand that the state has one\n#\nR.

The root cause of the problem here might not necessarily be related to cyber security and defense but rather to the ability and recognition of these topics being a cross-government issue. Building on that, it also turns out that the objectives may not necessarily be incompatible in some cases, but their priorities may differ. It means the cooperation in this area is for some institutions simply not nearly as important as for others.\nNext, some respondents directly highlighted particularly the contrast between the military intelligence (as part of both the military and intelligence community) and cyber security community (national CSIRTs). They added that the problem might lie in the natural isolationist approach of intelligence agencies in general. Moreover, they stated that this approach is not relevant only to civil-military cooperation. It is sometimes relevant even to military and intel-military cooperation, i.e., between military intelligence agencies and the \"green army.\"\n# Conflicting definitions (impact: low—moderate)\nThis factor has almost the lowest score among respondents. Respondents had claimed that the challenge could be easily overcome by combined training and joint cyber exercises and operations. Promoting dialogue and open discussion among the civilian and military community may also solve this problem. Some of the respondents added that conflicting definitions affect primarily policymakers, not (civilian or military) cyber practitioners (at the operational level). In reality, they should figure out these differences fast, adapt to them, and then cooperate effectively.\nIt means it is less of an issue. The lack of definitions should not hinder progress or cooperation. The aphorism \"Perfect is the enemy of good\" has also been used in the interviews. Those differing views might be useful and (if properly managed) contribute to a constructive and more sustainable consensus between organizations.\nIn sum, it seems that a lack of convergence between terminologies used by civilian and military actors does not represent an additional barrier to civil-military cooperation.\n### Conflicting theories (impact: moderate)\nThe factor of conflicting theories has a moderate impact and similar answers as the previous one. Some of the respondents do not perceive it as an immense problem that requires extensional attention at the national level. At a higher level of crisis (i.e. state of emergency), there should be clear national response structures and procedures that can be activated. Below that, although, there may be disagreement and discussion on “who owns the problem” and thus how to coordinate appropriately the full set of resources. However, the most important is to have a common and shared purpose according to respondents. Conflicting theories may have an impact, but well-developed professionals should be able to reach a consensus.\nRespondents also said it is a common feature of the state itself and it is linked to the factor of incompatible objectives. Each actor within the state security system has a slightly different goal and could be guided by different theories or assumptions. Moreover, certain areas of cyber security and defense such as vulnerability weaponizing will always be disputable and it is not necessarily just a civilian-military problem, but also intelligence vs. defensive mandate agencies; or intelligence agencies and law enforcement vs. national CSIRTs.\n### Lack of political guidance (impact: high—extreme)\nThe lack of political guidance and unclear laws in cyber defense is the most critical factor in the research. Most participants agreed that there cannot be any effective action and unity of effort without a clear high-level political guidance supported by an appropriate legal framework and adequate oversight. In states where this situation occurs, it is the root cause of the problem of friction between the civilian and military spheres. Without clear roles and responsibilities and overall strategic guidance, different actors (civilian or military) have less ability to execute in complementary manners.\nNevertheless, some of the military practitioners also pointed out that the factor is relevant especially during peacetime. In times of war or other conflicts, in which armed forces are empowered to perform actions that they would normally not be permitted to do, the impact of this factor would be reduced. In these cases, there is no time or need for extensive political guidance or strict compliance with the national law. Armed forces have\nclear procedures to deal with such situations and they are ready to cooperate closely even with civilian security organizations and others.\n### Organizational factors\n### Structural barriers (impact: moderate—high)\nThis factor seems to be significant. According to some respondents, bureaucracy and operational constraints can make especially the initial cooperation hard. However, once organizational relationships are built, it is much easier to deepen them. In contrast, many others remain in favor of maintaining the status quo. Especially those whom the main responsibility is different than cyber, might still impede cooperation, as they don't see priority in cyber and don't want to innovate. In some states, the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative “from the bottom” (from the operational level). Some military practitioners have also highlighted the problem of horizontal vs. vertical cooperation in the armed forces. They have apparently the necessary internal procedures to cooperate effectively among military units of all kinds (both vertically and horizontally) in place. However, regarding the horizontal cooperation outside the military world, the military often lacks adequate procedures and processes on how to cooperate swiftly and effectively with civilian (nonmilitary) organizations.\n### Organizational cultures (impact: low—moderate)\nSurprisingly, different organizational cultures are perceived by the respondents as the least relevant factor. Only a minority of respondents feel the differences between military and civilian culture as a big obstacle for cooperation. Most of them reported that cultures nowadays can be respected, and they can be learned. Furthermore, all these differences could be more beneficial than restraining. Mutual knowledge is a matter of communication and cooperation, and both worlds would and probably could improve their organization using gained knowledge and experience from its counterparts.\nBoth experts and practitioners from civilian and military spheres agreed that this challenge can be overcome easily by simply working more together. Next, since it is still relatively rare to see specific career paths for military cyber operators, many on active duty will leave and join the industry and civilian public sector, which does serve to increase the understanding of each other's culture, organizational identity, and so on. Even though different cultures exist, the far bigger factor is apparently overall policy differences rather than cultural differences.\nOrganizational independence (impact: moderate)\nIndependence as a higher priority than cooperation is also not seen as an essential factor. Almost all respondents agreed that in most cases, this is not an issue. Although, few of them mentioned the problem of the isolationistic approach of intelligence agencies again. They also shared some of their personal experiences that underpin the presumption of some agencies to prefer independence and operational flexibility to cooperation in (both civilian and military) intelligence agencies.\n### Competition for resources (impact: high)\nAnother high scoring factor is competition for financial resources, status, power, recognition, and influence. Nearly all respondents saw the factor as a relevant barrier and almost all of them ranked the impact as “high.” The competition for resources is an issue especially in an environment where the national roles and responsibilities in cyber security and defense are still not clarified properly. It leads to the situation in which every institution is trying to get a piece of the cyber agenda for itself. This competition could jeopardize the cooperation a lot. Some respondents have also stated that it is mainly a matter of a strategic (not operational) level of cooperation between institutions and the problem is not exclusive to civilian and military cooperation again.\n### Inexperience and lack of proven models (impact: moderate—high)\nThe lack of proven models and inexperience seems to be a very relevant factor in the cyber security and defense area. It is no wonder since it is still a relatively new area for both civilian and military institutions. Some respondents even called the current situation as a startup era of cyber defense. Especially for more rigid military institutions, it could have an extremely negative impact until the necessary practice and experience are gained. According to some, one of the main obstacles in this issue could be also a lack of general cyber awareness and education of “non-specialists” and leaders at all levels. The major problem with cyber defense for a “nonspecialist” is that it's hard to visualize. The way to overcome this could be, e.g. cyber security exercises, tailored especially for high-level management. Finally, respondents see this factor as a great opportunity to start a discussion among all civilian and military institutions. It could be the motivation for some states to create an effective national system of cyber defense from scratch.\n### Idiosyncratic/personality factors (impact: moderate—high)\nThe last factor has a moderate to high impact. The human factor in collaboration on cyber defense is apparently as important as everywhere else. Although cyberspace is a technology-driven world, people are still at the\ncore of it and they are vulnerable to idiosyncratic disputes. Not surprisingly, those respondents who had a real-life experience with it had scored higher than those without it. Some of them have also added that this factor is especially important in the phase of initiation and establishment of cooperation between entities. On the other hand, given the bureaucracy and the way how state institutions work, this effect might be marginalized in the long term. It means that the impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes can be minimized over policy design in the cyber defense and related security areas.\n## Conclusion: factors jeopardizing the development of integrated government capability identified\nThere are many ways how governments can gain, achieve and project cyber power. For example, Healey (2016) claims that still too much emphasis is currently placed on the success or failure of offensive and defensive capabilities, rather than other factors and on long-term national security outcomes. It is apparent that these capabilities are and will be very closely linked to the concept of cyber power, and that both policy (decision) makers and academics are interested in it for obvious reasons. Next, it is also possible to argue that an efficient cyber defense is the focal prerequisite for gaining and increasing power in cyberspace, since it is almost impossible to project power in cyberspace when the nation states have insufficient military power. However, this hard-cyber power approach to winning in cyberspace through military domination is plausibly short-sighted. Nation states should really aim to incorporate many other variables into their grand strategies and policies in cyberspace and use a holistic approach to the integrated government capacity to achieve cyber power. Therefore, this article focused on the identification of factors that could jeopardize integrated government capacity (or so-called whole of government approach) in cyber defense and more specifically the focus was narrowed down to the field of civil-military interagency cooperation within a nation state.\nResearch has demonstrated that in today's hyper-connected world, the traditional state practice just fades away. Global uncomfortable changes in warfare domains gradually force states to rethink many aspects of their military strategies and policies, including cyber defense. With cyber threats evolving into new, complex forms, the lack of fresh, modern solutions at the national level becomes a handicap and will make it difficult for the nation state to project its cyber power.\nWith the understanding of the extensiveness of the cyber issue and its dynamic nature, six critical areas have been identified where further consideration is needed. The area could strongly affect the establishment of\nintegrated government capacity or a strategic framework for cyber power in general.\nAccording to findings, the most important factors (for the lowest to highest impact) are:Idiosyncratic/Personality factors;Incompatible objectives;Structural barriers;Inexperience and lack of proven models;Competition for resources;Lack of guidance by political leaders.\nThe impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are apparent even in the world of cyber defense. According to practice, rationality is simply not always present. Subjective elements, such as human factors, could easily undermine the will and trust between agencies and make cooperation impossible. Hence, nation states should pay attention even to this factor which seems to be minor, but like everywhere else, it could grow into a big issue. On the other hand, the effect of the factor could be minimized through policy design in the cyber defense and security areas.\nNext, the incompatible objectives of each state agency could bring a lot of problems to the cooperation on cyber defense. Cyberspace itself is a cross-cutting domain and ensuring cyber defense means to deal with a cross-government issue. There is still a lack of common understanding among decision-makers or chiefs of relevant agencies and departments that the issue is a national topic, nor the responsibility of one or a few agencies in the state. A consensus on cyber defense should be reached across military and nonmilitary institutions and joint prioritization should be done as well on the governmental level. Especially, the intelligence agencies should be more open to cooperation with other relevant actors and leave their traditional isolationist approach within the state security apparatus.\nStructural barriers to cooperation, such as bureaucracy and operational constraints, can make cooperation hard as well. Maintaining the status quo and a lack of willingness to change the agenda or perform new activities and tasks is another issue that could easily jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense. These barriers are also seen as hardly removable as the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative. Decisions should come from the top in this regard. It is primarily a military issue and the army's way of conducting business. The problem of facilitating horizontal cooperation outside the military world is evident and should be overcome to ensure cyber defense more effectively and on time.\nLack of experience and shortage of best practice is an unsurprisingly an essential factor that could negatively impact the cooperation on cyber defense. It could be an enormous problem especially for the more rigid military, but in contrast, it could be a great opportunity to approach the challenge and establish a new and effectively functioning system of cyber defense cooperation between civilians and military spheres.\nIt is also perceived from the practice that state agencies or ministries are not an exception regarding power and budget struggles. With countries focusing on the new challenges posed by cyber threats and developing their capabilities to tackle them, there is also a new opportunity to gain more political power or financial resources from the state budget. These struggles are not exclusive to civilian and military dichotomy; however, they could easily result in a rivalry between state agencies. It is not perhaps exclusive to cyber security and defense only but could be happening in other trending agendas such as hybrid warfare or space security.\nThe most significant challenge in bridging the obvious gap between civilian and military actors seems to be the lack of political direction and a clear vision on cyber matters from political leaders. It is sometimes a result of scattering the national responsibility for cyber defense among too many civilian and military institutions, together with the lack of enlightened politicians eager to lead in cyber defense effectively. The main issue here could be that leaders must meticulously review all existing policies in the context of cyber defense to ensure cyber defense properly.\nFinally, a lot of respondents also mentioned the importance of the legal and ethical aspects of this kind of cooperation. Legal elements complement political and organizational factors and they are also implied within them to some extent. Cyber defense as a mechanism of responding to the sheer scale of cyber threats is not just a technical discipline, it is linked to a vast range of legal and ethical issues. Therefore, the cyber defense principles, measures, and responsibilities of each actor must be enshrined in the law to protect society from abuses of power and guarantee citizens their rights and freedoms. However, besides that, it also helps to set clear responsibilities of official authorities dealing with cyber defense and it provides a solid ground for the cooperation. In contrast, the lack of relevant legislation or legal vagueness makes setbacks for any kind of cooperation.\nAll these factors could seriously jeopardize the unity of effort at the governmental level and overall cooperation in cyber defense. Therefore, nation states should continuously review their system of collaboration among relevant state military nonmilitary actors and focus on these sets of factors. In practice, it is obvious that all negative factors could be overcome or prevented only when a clear vision and leadership eclipse the self-interest of agencies. States and their decision-makers should approach cyber defense\nas a new agenda where creating a symbiotic relationship across both civilian and military agencies is necessary. The classic distinctions between military and civilian worlds are simply less clear-cut in cyber defense. If the nation state has an ambition to gain and project cyber power, it should make the joint cyber defense a cornerstone of plans for future development and strategic orientation. A unification of differing perceptions of the mission and each other's role within the cyber defense system is needed to establish a fully functioning integrated government capacity. A culture of shared responsibility must be inherent too.\nBased on the findings, it is also possible to make some recommendations for a proper working model of cooperation on cyber defense. It should be based on governmental level actions such as: regular joint cyber defense exercises at both technical and strategic level; operational situational awareness and intensive information sharing and exchange; clarifying the exact roles and responsibilities in the national (cyber) defense system and making cyber leaders from all relevant decision-makers and head of agencies. Especially the enlightened leaders can manage and drive their institution to become a better counterpart for cooperation."

It reviews the civil-military interagency cooperation and aims to identify factors that could jeopardize it. First, it provides a theoretical background for the research and then according to interviews and surveys, the factors with the highest negative impact are recognized. Based on this research, the most significant challenges in bridging the gap between civilian and military worlds seems to be power and budget struggles and a lack of political direction on cyber matters from leaders.\n# KEYWORDS\nCyber defense; cyber power; cyber security; civil-military; cyberspace\n# Introduction\nCyber power has become a pressing issue for many nation states since the militarization of cyberspace has already begun and it is one of the latest additions to the power family tree (Dunn Caverty, 2018, p. 306). The trend of offensive cyberspace operations conducted by nation-states or state-sponsored groups together with the rise of serious cyber attacks on critical infrastructures¹ naturally increase political and military interest in cyber power and relevant state capabilities. It also calls for a review of a national approach to defense in cyberspace, where defense is no longer just a military issue and to gain a real cyber power and cyber effectiveness is possible only through the whole-of-government (civilian and military) cooperation.\nNowadays, cyber threats are very serious. While contemporary cyber attacks are usually still happening rather on a smaller scale or with lower impact, they may quickly rise to an enormous problem for national security and defense. We could have seen it recently when a lot of minor cyber attacks at high frequency were targeting health care facilities during the\nCONTACT Roman Pačka\n\\odot\n roman.packa@gmail.com\n\\odot\n Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University, Joštova 218/10, 602 00 Brno, Czech Republic.\n© 2021 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nglobal COVID-19 crisis (INTERPOL, 2020) and they seriously threatened the national security of several countries. The trend of escalating cyber maneuvers and the increasing prominence of cyber operations within the military is also apparent. It has already caused the development of offensive state cyber capabilities in many European and NATO countries. The modern warfare is currently shaped by new disruptive technologies and the militarization of cyberspace (Gomez, 2016; Smeets, 2018).\nThe visible product of the militarization is the cyberspace itself. It has officially become the next domain for warfighting according to NATO (NATO, 2016), placing it alongside the traditional battlegrounds of air, land, and sea. This means every state should be able to defend itself in cyberspace and move toward creating military effects in, through, and from cyberspace. However, cyberspace is very different military domain because it is the only domain created by a man and it is highly technical. Therefore, the cyberspace is heavily dependent on heterogeneous, typically civilian, players with different preferences. It is complex, hard to visualize, and constantly changing. Finally, the cyberspace is clearly a nongeographical domain, which also requires a shift of understanding for military commanders (Ablon et al. 2019, p. 8).\nDue to its unique nature, military and nonmilitary (civilian) spheres blur or erode more easily than in traditional (physical) domains. In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor. Nevertheless, the cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries. Specific challenges, such as the problem of attribution and anonymity, or the asymmetric characteristics of cyberspace results in the current situation where nation states must ensure a close civil-military collaboration within a state to achieve and gain cyber power.\nOn the one hand, this strong need for coordinated civil-military inter-agency teamwork exists to protect the nation against serious cyber threats and produce cyber effects. On the other hand, there is also a deficiency of experience and practice with that on both sides, and sometimes even the willingness to cooperate lacks as these two worlds (military and civilian/nonmilitary) are quite different and somewhat isolated. A few state actors such as Netherlands or the Czech Republic have already noticed the issue. From the military perspective, the new Dutch strategic vision for defense released by Dutch Ministry of Defence (MvD, Ministerie van Defensie) focuses on their partners outside the military organization and is going to devote greater attention to the role and task of the military in this gray zone of “strategic competition” between war and peace (MvD, 2020, p. 23). Next, the (civilian) national cyber security strategy of the Czech Republic for the years 2021--2025 created by their national cyber security authority\n(NUKIB, Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost) also calls for a common approach to cyber security and defense within the country and the improvement of the collaboration model and information sharing between military and nonmilitary actors (NUKIB, 2020, pp. 10--11).\nHence, this article intends to initiate and contribute to the discussion on civil-military interagency cooperation by considering possible factors that could spoil the establishing of an efficient integrated governmental framework for cyber defense. The article does not deal with the private sector or academia institutions such as universities nor think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It strictly focuses on the governmental interagency cooperation and response system and elaborates on factors that could affect or jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense between key state civilian (nonmilitary) and military entities, such as agencies responsible for CIIP (e.g. national Computer Security Incident Response Teams—CSIRTs), intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and departments of defense, including military cyber operations unit.\nOur main premise is that the ability of a nation state to gain cyber power leads through the efficient whole-of-government approach (so-called integrated government capability) as it is a crucial basis for achieving any power and control in cyberspace. Therefore, the article identifies the most significant barriers preventing this approach.\nResearchers are fully aware of the difficulty with the concept of cyber power, that systematic (empirical) analyses of the topic do not yet exist, and that the body of literature on cyber-power is small and fragmented. Hence, this article narrowly focuses only on the subset of the topic of cyber power and serves as another piece to the debate. It could also be a basis for further academic research or a source of inspiration for policy makers.\nData in this article are—with respect to the character of researched experts—valid mostly for the NATO countries. Recent development in this area is important from the global point of view. Firstly, due to the fact that NATO is the strongest military alliance in the contemporary world and it improves its cyber capabilities. Secondly, development in NATO countries can serve as a model for development in other parts of the world. And thirdly, recent trends in NATO have an indirect impact on the behavior of its adversaries in cyberspace.\n## Integrated government capability as an enabler for cyber power\nThe cyber is an instrument of national power and national states already use cyber means to advance their objectives (Willett, 2019, p. 86). The term “cyber power” has become common in security and strategy discourse (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 43) and it includes all forms of power in which\npower relations occur wholly or in part in or through cyberspace. However, cyber power is not created simply to exist, but rather to support other elements of national power—political, diplomatic, informational, military, and economic' (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 44).\nAccording to Klimburg (2011, p. 43), a nation's cyber power has three dimensions: (1) coordination of operational and policy aspects across governmental structures, (2) coherency of policy through international alliances and legal frameworks, and (3) cooperation of non-state cyber actors. In sum, this so-called Klimburg's Integrated capability model includes: Integrated government capability; Integrated systems capability; and Integrated national capability (Dunn Cavelty, 2018, p. 309). Klimburg claims that while the first two dimensions are important, the integrated national capability must be primarily reached because a major portion of a state's cyber capabilities lies outside direct government control. It is therefore essential to create this “whole-of-nation” cyber capability within a nation state.\nNevertheless, to follow this whole of nation approach is quite challenging for many nation states that are currently developing their cyber defensive and offensive capabilities. Hence, it is reasonable to argue with Klimburg that some nation states simply cannot create an efficient cooperation in cyberspace outside the government, while struggling with their own internal governmental part (so-called “whole-of-government” approach). For many of them, it is about the need to get the basics right first, which means to achieve the central coordination across governmental structures—integrated government capability. The ability of the government to deliver joint action which entails to attack and defend in cyberspace, to draft policy positions, and to share operational resources (Klimburg, 2011, pp. 173--174). In cyberspace, achieving this kind of coordination could be quite challenging for many nation states, because it includes the need for an efficient civil-military cooperation. A field that has been overlooked or marginalized for decades.\nThe issue of civil-military cooperation has already many aspects, specifics, and barriers in traditional operational domains, but in cyberspace, it has even more difficulties. To simply put, it could be hard to achieve efficient cooperation between military and nonmilitary organizations when governments are struggling at a strategic level to work out how to combine the capabilities of their armed forces with other instruments of national power (Inkster, 2017, p. 29). Even if the nation states and their specific civilian security (police, intelligence agencies and others) and military organizations could hold enough resources to theoretically gain cyber power, it is not entirely clear that they will have the ability to do it and perform efficient joint operations in cyberspace. For example, Bebber\n(2017, p. 427) mentions that there is a problem between a potential cyber power and a cyber effectiveness. Unlocking the power inherent in national capacities and different government actors to affect outcomes in the national interest is the key to cyber effectiveness and real cyber power (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 40). Thus, there is a difference between the available human and material resources and how they are utilized by the nation state to generate effects and support national political ends in and through cyberspace.\nFor nation states, it means to predominantly focus on joint cooperation on cyber defense, which is a multidisciplinary task that includes civilian and military state organization efforts. Only through the delivery of joint, defensive and offensive cyber operations and actions, the nation states could efficiently support their strategic security interests and achieve cyber power.\n## United by necessity: the militarization of cyberspace drives a need for civil—military cooperation on cyber defense\nAs Dunn Cavelty (2018, p. 309) points out, Klimburg's integrated capability model is consciously taking cyber power out of the context of projecting national interests coercively and adds a strong defensive cyber security element. Such a view highlights that cyber power and cyber security are intricately linked. However, Dunn Cavelty also adds that a true cyber power also needs to be able to “defend” against cyber threats. In today's view, it means to conduct cyber offensive and defensive military operations rather than a reactive and preventive approach embodied in cyber security. To simply put, there cannot be any true cyber power without a proper (civilian) cyber security and (military) cyber defense. These two environments must be inherently connected, and they must complement each other.\nEven though cyber security and cyber defense are dissimilar concepts and their definitions and theories often vary, they are still closely connected (Pačka, 2015). In this article, cyber security focuses on preventive and reactive measures in its nature, while the cyber defense could be more proactive and it allows to use military capacity and armed forces^{4}. Paraphrasing Clausewitz (1989), cyber defense could be the continuation of ensuring cyber security by other means, such as defensive and offensive cyber operations.\nNation states ensure their cyber security to improve the security and resilience of national infrastructures and services already for decades. Regarding the cyber defense, the governments all over the world has just started to build its capacity a few years ago. Specifically, they usually create\nrband new military cyber units and strive to defend the nation against the most serious cyber threats (Smeets). The issue of civil-military inter-agency cooperation on cyber defense is therefore relatively new. Not surprisingly, while there are numerous guidelines for cooperation between law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and national CSIRTs in cyber security (e.g. ENISA ; Pačka ; Skierka .), there is an insufficient practice and no handbook on cyber defense cooperation issue (Pačka), pp. 93--94).\nThe state practice could be quite challenging in that sense. There are factors such as the tendency of armies across the world to separate themselves from the rest of the nonmilitary security apparatus or the impossibility to ensure defense in cyberspace properly by a military actor alone by itself. In sum, synergy and cooperation with the rest of the national security actors who tackle cyber threats should be secured and exercised regularly. Given the fact that most of the cyberspace can be considered dual-use, it is simply difficult to separate the military and civilian realms (Droege), pp. 570, 576) and any harsh distinction simply does not work.\nAlthough, it is imminent that the segregation is present. It often rests on the assumption that the military and civilian agenda within the national security apparatus is distinct and should be kept distinct. According to Heinl, p. 38), this approach is caused historically. In the past, there was not a generally compelling need to engage civilian security authorities and agencies in military matters. Even large cyber attacks were usually not so significant to reach a threshold that would have activated the armed forces' response in previous years. Some authors (see Dunn Cavelty ; Wallace) persistently argued that the military role in cyberspace outside the context of armed conflict should be limited (Bigelow), p. 3), e.g. on the protection of military networks and information systems. Heinl contends that this was an understandable posture at that time. Even today, most cyber threats are directed against civilian (public or private) systems and networks and therefore have to be dealt (up to a certain threshold) by the targeted organizations themselves or by nonmilitary authorities responsible for cyber security or cyber crime (national CSIRTs, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies, if needed).\nFurthermore, the military's exact role and responsibilities in national cyber security or defense might remain vague from the institutional perspective. A long-term institutional practice within nation states supports this approach. When countries and its institutions usually define new roles and responsibilities of the armed forces or civilian authorities anywhere (including cyberspace), they look for analogies from the physical world and translate them as literally as possible. It means there could be a long-lasting consensus that armed forces should have a limited role in cyber crises\noutside of armed conflict (Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 72--73) and they want to just maintain the status quo, where military and civilian security or defense agencies are still somewhat isolated.\nNowadays, the debate has evolved significantly, especially due to increasing evidence of state or state-sponsored attacks on civilian cyberspace infrastructure (Bigelow, 2019, p. 3). The increased militarization of cyberspace is also an apparent trend these days (Gomez, 2016), and regular and irregular warfare are slowly losing their distinction due to the unique nature of cyberspace. Traditional norms of warfare, definitions of combatants and noncombatants, and even what constitutes military action or national casus belli are being turned upside down (TRADOC G-2, 2017, p. 20). It means the military role can simply no longer be limited to the traditional approach of engaging primarily in an armed conflict. It is particularly challenging to ensure national security and defense or even to wage a war without cooperation between military and nonmilitary (civilian) worlds these days. The cyber defense is about working with existing military, civilian, police, central and other structures, cooperation, and mixing missions of different actors with the same goal.\nHence, an advisable starting point for all nation states is to strive to set up an efficient cooperation between civilian authorities and agencies responsible for cyber security and armed forces with the mandate to conduct cyber defense operations. This cooperation framework should always start with the joint protection of those assets that are most essential for the country—critical (information) infrastructure. This is an especially important issue since civilian infrastructures are legitimate targets in case of serious cyber attacks or an armed conflict. And on the other hand, militaries as defenders of last resort for these infrastructures do not have the capacity to be familiar, let alone proficient, in the functioning of civilian networks (Tatar et al. 2017, p. 7).\n### CIIP as the core issue for cooperation\nCritical infrastructure protection (CIP) as a concept and practice was first explicitly articulated in the 1990s. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, CIP moved to the center of domestic security doctrine (Collier & Lakoff, 2008, p. 35), not only in the United States but also in other countries. Besides the physical protection of the critical infrastructure, cyber security has also become a significant issue in today's world. Cyber threats to the critical infrastructure emanate from a wide spectrum of prospective perpetrators: state-sponsored espionage and sabotage, international terrorism, domestic militants, malevolent hacktivists, or even disaffected insiders (Rudner, 2013, p. 453).\nThe broadening of this concept has created a new term—critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP). As for the critical infrastructure, even a disruption of critical information infrastructure could result in human death, injuries, or physical damage and its threatening could have a debilitating effect on the security of a given nation, its economy, and the public's safety or health. CIIP is therefore generally acknowledged to be an indispensable component of national security policy (Suter, 2007, p. 1) and this ability to ensure CIIP is critical regarding the cyber power of the nation state.\nNevertheless, today's common practice is that civilian authorities are responsible for coordinating cyber security incident response within the critical infrastructure and armed forces are being used only as an instrument of last resort in an armed conflict. It is important to realize that the CIIP is already a part of the cyber defense and it needs to be supported by cross-organizational collaboration to be effective. It is a joint endeavor (Skopik et al. 2016, p. 157). According to Heinl (2016, p. 38), the military has the responsibility for national security, which presumably includes the defense of the most extreme cyber threats to critical infrastructure. This common thread (at least in Europe) of limiting the role of the military in cyber security response (Boecke et al. 2015, p. 73) therefore calls for a comprehensive approach to civil-military cooperation on both—the cyber security and defense to achieve integrated government capacity. However, the main issue is still that while the military has usually little or no role in the protection of critical infrastructure during peacetime, it would be an enormously challenging task, during, e.g, the war or other cyber-enabled conflict. Hence, ensuring the CIIP only when some major crisis occurs could put the military forces in an uncomfortable position.\nIt is proposed that the CIIP should be a vital kernel for the cooperation on cyber defense between relevant civilian (nonmilitary) and military agencies within a state security apparatus. There is an apparent need to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks from both sides because any of these attacks can have the potential to threaten the national security and stability. For example, given the special nature of cyberspace, it is usually hard to attribute the attacker or the source of the attack in real-time. Attribution of cyber attacks is simply not an easy task. There are technical issues which complicate identifying cyber attackers (Yannakogeorgos, 2013, p. 2). At the beginning of nearly all cyber attacks, the culprit is unknown, and it is always reasonable to comprehend that it can be a state, state-sponsored group, terrorist, an activist, or just some criminal actor. Therefore, governments must approach the response to each serious cyber attack targeting the critical information infrastructure very seriously.\nTherefore, a strong demand for mutual collaboration, cooperation, and information sharing among all relevant civilian and military spheres is\n#\nR. PACKA AND M. MARES\nTable 1. Political and organizational factors.\n|  Political factors | Organizational factors  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Incompatible objectives | Structural barriers  |\n|  Conflicting Definitions | Organizational Cultures  |\n|  Conflicting Theories | Organizational Independence  |\n|  Lack of guidance by political leaders | Competition for Resources  |\n|   | Inexperience and Lack of Proven Models  |\n|   | Idiosyncratic/Personality Factors  |\nlogical. As it is apparent also from this research, the practice of crisis response, joint operations, training, and exercises between state civilian and military agencies often lacks and there are still numerous factors that could affect or jeopardize this kind of cooperation in the future.\n# Factors possibly jeopardizing civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense\nMany factors could render the cooperation between a diverse spectrum of civilian and military agencies problematic. While cyber-specific factors that could jeopardize cooperation have not been identified yet, the focus is on general factors that influence civil-military cooperation (e.g., in conflict resolution) and might also apply to cyber defense. Specifically, the identified factors are inspired and based on the work of Olson and Gregorian (2007) and complemented by the literature review and analysis. Only factors that could suit the cyber realm have been picked and modified for research purposes. All factors are divided into two main categories—political and organizational—with the possibility to identify other factors during the research (Table 1).\n# Political factors\nThe first factor is called incompatible objectives. Despite the common objective to ensure national (cyber) security, each national actor (civilian or military) could hold differing, and sometimes, mutually contradictory policy goals (Olson &amp; Gregorian, 2007, p. 7). Given the fact that each national organization has a different role in the national (cyber) security and defense system, it is quite logical and there could be a small deviation. Nevertheless, the ensuring of national security begins internally with all responsible national actors and their interagency cooperation. In an increasingly complex, multi-dimensional policy world, therefore the government must promote cooperation rather than competition among the various stakeholders (Whittaker et al., 2010, p. 32). If policy goals are excessively incompatible, it could result in conflict or friction among national organizations.\nThe second factor stands for conflicting definitions. Even different definitions could jeopardize cooperation. Many authors (see Futter, 2018, p. 201; Galinec et al. 2017, p. 274) state, little consensus exists about what the term ‘cyber' includes, refers to, or how it is being used. Regarding the terms of cyber security and cyber defense, the situation is similar. Since there are no ‘one-fits-all' definitions, there could be disputes between national actors about the nature or scope or meaning of the terms. These differing definitions could then lead to differing approaches on how to achieve efficient cyber defense and lead to a decrease in cooperation efficiency.\nConflicting theories could also endanger cooperation. Civilian and military institutions could have trouble coordinating at the operational, tactical, or strategic level, or even agreeing on an analysis of the problem, often because they are guided by radically different theories or assumptions about what causes problems or crises and how it can be resolved (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 9). This conceptual problem is closely related to the previous factor and contains conflicting theories on how to effectively ensure national cyber security and defense. It may cover a lot of issues, such as a discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in CIIP. While some institutions (e.g. national CSIRTs) strive to patch it immediately to secure the system, others (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement units, and others) attempt to exploit it and use it against the attacker (see Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 74--75; Pačka, 2019, pp. 71--74).\nThe last political factor represents a lack of political guidance, because the successes of each institution alone guarantee nothing in a large-scale national cyber crisis. Lack of political guidance, willpower, and support at the governmental level cannot be simply substituted. Already in 2014, Lewis (2014, p. 566) stated that whether the cyber issue reaches the top level of political leadership depends on factors such as personal interest, a direct experience of malicious cyber action, media attention or the salience of cybersecurity on their national and international agendas. Even the cyber agenda became very political in recent years, factors such as the depth of knowledge about the problem could be still an issue for politicians and other leaders. Lehto and Limnéll (2020, pp. 139, 146) therefore suggests that streamlining and strengthening strategic leadership are key aspects in making sure the cyber vision is achieved. The strong cyber leadership also prevent state agencies from operating solely in their siloes and based only on their objectives and needs. Hence, the lack of political guidance may result in many problems with the coordination. For example, insufficient resources, duplication of activities, uncertain rules of engagement in cyberspace, absence of ‘referees' to resolve competing positions, and unclear national law or jurisdictional boundaries between civilian and military\ninstitutions. Despite NATO officially recognizes cyberspace as the domain of warfare, it could still be a serious concern in many NATO countries. For example, according to the statement of retired Gen. Keith Alexander, even the United States (the pioneer of cyber warfare) still lacked “clear rules of engagement” for conducting offensive cyber operations three years ago (Lyngaas, 2018). Hence, the lack of political guidance represents another factor that could negatively influence civil-military cooperation.\n### Organizational factors\nStructural barriers could be a strong organizational factor since rigid organizational structures represent a big obstacle to any kind of cooperation. Bureaucratic and daily operational constraints tend to stifle cooperation or any innovation and favor the status quo (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 11). In cyber realm, we could say that generally in smaller countries organizations tend to be less hierarchical and rigid. As people know each other personally, they tend to trust others more than in impersonal interactions, and greater flexibility enables them to share information swiftly. However, even in these smaller countries some barriers between civilian and military organizations naturally persists (Pernik & Tuohy, 2014, p. 4, 6). Hence, the factor could have a serious impact on civil-military cooperation in cyberspace as well.\nNext, organizational culture is a recognized term that describes unwritten norms, rules, and customs in an establishment. The literature suggests (see Arnaud & Tinoco, 2013, p. 37) that organizational culture differs between industries as well as professions. The civilian and military culture is no exception and may cause friction within the national interagency cooperation. There is a general tendency among all organizations and sometimes even across units within the same organization to adopt substantially different planning and implementation terminology or to describe different processes and outcomes even when employing the same terminology (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 11). On the other hand, cultural interoperability among organizations stems from interagency understanding, trust, and confidence that require close and ongoing training, liaisons, and exchanges (Pernik & Tuohy, 2014, p. 3). Different organizational cultures could simply represent an important factor in the issue of civil-military cooperation. Moreover, the lack of knowledge about one another's organizational identity in the meaning of traditions, culture, images, and fundamental goals are represented in this factor.\nEven organizational independence could be for certain (civilian or military) organizations a higher priority than coordination with other organizations as they are not prepared to follow the lead of another organization (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 13). Some institutions could see cooperation\nas a fundamental threat to their operational flexibility. While cooperation is perceived as the key to cyber security and defense, the factor of preferring independence to cooperation could be an essential one.\nAs a significant factor appears also a competition for resources. State organizations such as ministries might not cooperate especially when there is a political system with strong line ministries, departmentalization, and silo arrangements. Coordination is therefore often limited to minimal coordination (Christensen et al. 2015) and sometimes it could also lead to competition. The competition could be about different resources such as status, power, recognition, financial resources and influence (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 14). It is worth to mention that all state organizations are fully aware of cyber security and defense being one of the fastest growing fields today. It means there is still a space to set new standards, define new roles, and deliver new tasks. In this regard, some of them could also compete to take over some responsibilities from other agencies. This unhealthy competition might also result in not sharing of responsibility, agenda, or information and intelligence about cyber threats with other partners within the state.\nWhile abundant state practice in conventional warfare exists, cyber defense is a relatively new and very specific area in which a lack of proven models and inexperience is often apparent. Difficulties arise when both civilian and military institutions are stretched beyond their traditional areas of expertise (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 15), such as traditional warfighting, intelligence gathering, law-enforcing, or CIP. In the field of cyber defense, lack of best practices and guidelines (see Pačka, 2019, pp. 93--94) might lead to many wrong strategic decisions and choosing a flawed attitude toward cooperation.\nFinally, idiosyncratic or personality factors could play a key role in cyber defense cooperation. Some states might rely heavily on individuals with considerable power and specific attitudes. Stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are not uncommon within and across organizations. Sometimes the willingness to cooperate arises from personal likes or dislikes (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 16). This unprofessional behavior might lead to a decrease or cooperation between state organizations.\n## Scope and method\nThe article deals with the topic of cyber power that could nation states achieve through the development of integrated government capacity. The empirical part of the research focuses on one of the main problems in today's whole of government approach in cyberspace—the issue of the cooperation between civilian and military institutions on cyber defense. It is focused particularly on central government departments, agencies, and\nother civilian or military state institutions that are predominantly involved in ensuring cyber defense. Whole of nation approach that includes society, private sector companies, NGOs, or academia is not the focus of the study, but it is considered as the next step in achieving cyber power.\nNamely, the study focuses on the dynamics between: the civilian entities responsible for CIIP (e.g. agencies that usually operate so-called national CSIRTs),law enforcement units,military and civilian intelligence agenciesand departments of defense, including the army and special cyber command units.\nThe research has a mixed design, which includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. To measure all the factors, the researchers use quantitative data from surveys (see below) and then they use qualitative data from interviews that provide rich descriptions of the phenomena and generate new premises. An approach is primarily inductive (Corbin & Strauss, 2008), which means the research moves from the specific experiences and practice of respondents to the general to explain the phenomena and identify major challenges in civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense within a state.\nThe methods of data collection are document analysis, in-depth semi-structured interviews, and surveys. Getting the right participants is critical to the success of the research and simultaneously it constitutes the main limitation of the study. The willingness to participate and the consent of all participants have not been an issue since the confidentiality is ensured and outcomes are sanitized. However, it turned out that there is only a limited number of experts and practitioners who deals with this specific topic and could have been reached by researchers at the same time. Therefore, the researchers focus on a smaller amount of participants but did a more detailed interviews. It also means that participants were purposively selected by the judgment of the researchers because sampling for proportionality is not the concern of this research (Morse, 2007). Only participants who could have offered valuable insight and high-quality answers into the topic were selected. Respondent-driven sampling (also known as snowball sampling) has also been used to involve more experts and practitioners from the civilian and military spheres in the research. All respondents came from NATO countries as this research is relevant mainly for the transatlantic area. At the time of this research these participants were serving in the military, working for intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies, CSIRTs or relevant ministries. Some of them were also experts\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED SECURITY RESEARCH\n449\nTable 2.

The data collection period ran during the years 2019 and mid-2020. The semistructured interviews have been conducted online or face to face and the surveys have been completed in the same way.\nThe empirical research was to address the following question:\nWhat factors could significantly jeopardize civil-military interagency cooperation toward cyber defense within a nation-state?\nBased on the literature review and an analysis of the authors, ten factors of political and organizational nature that could have a strong influence on civil-military cooperation have been identified and then discussed with the respondents during the interviews and surveys. All respondents waged and deliberated each factor, shared their personal views on how important and relevant each factor is, and highlighted it on the impact scale (negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme). Finally, they had an option to add further factors or categories (Table 2).\nBased on these findings, factors with the highest impact (scoring moderate—high to extreme) on civil-military cooperation in cyber defense were recognized and highlighted. Finally, these findings also shed light and form a discussion on the second question:\nHow nation states could gain cyber power through the integrated government capacity?\nConducting this research will help states and their institutions to make better decisions about their approach to cooperation on cyber defense. It could also serve as a basis for future academic research and debate.\n## Findings\nAccording to 13 interviews and surveys with experts and practitioners from civilian and military agencies related to cyber defense, the most significant factors jeopardizing the cooperation on cyber defense are as follows (see Table 3). The findings confirm the necessity of the factors we identified and generate new premises that deserve further attention.\n## Political factors\n### Incompatible objectives (impact: moderate—high)\nMost of the respondents scored this factor as essential and claim that all national institutions or agencies must understand that the state has one\n#\nR.

The root cause of the problem here might not necessarily be related to cyber security and defense but rather to the ability and recognition of these topics being a cross-government issue. Building on that, it also turns out that the objectives may not necessarily be incompatible in some cases, but their priorities may differ. It means the cooperation in this area is for some institutions simply not nearly as important as for others.\nNext, some respondents directly highlighted particularly the contrast between the military intelligence (as part of both the military and intelligence community) and cyber security community (national CSIRTs). They added that the problem might lie in the natural isolationist approach of intelligence agencies in general. Moreover, they stated that this approach is not relevant only to civil-military cooperation. It is sometimes relevant even to military and intel-military cooperation, i.e., between military intelligence agencies and the \"green army.\"\n# Conflicting definitions (impact: low—moderate)\nThis factor has almost the lowest score among respondents. Respondents had claimed that the challenge could be easily overcome by combined training and joint cyber exercises and operations. Promoting dialogue and open discussion among the civilian and military community may also solve this problem. Some of the respondents added that conflicting definitions affect primarily policymakers, not (civilian or military) cyber practitioners (at the operational level). In reality, they should figure out these differences fast, adapt to them, and then cooperate effectively.\nIt means it is less of an issue. The lack of definitions should not hinder progress or cooperation. The aphorism \"Perfect is the enemy of good\" has also been used in the interviews. Those differing views might be useful and (if properly managed) contribute to a constructive and more sustainable consensus between organizations.\nIn sum, it seems that a lack of convergence between terminologies used by civilian and military actors does not represent an additional barrier to civil-military cooperation.\n### Conflicting theories (impact: moderate)\nThe factor of conflicting theories has a moderate impact and similar answers as the previous one. Some of the respondents do not perceive it as an immense problem that requires extensional attention at the national level. At a higher level of crisis (i.e. state of emergency), there should be clear national response structures and procedures that can be activated. Below that, although, there may be disagreement and discussion on “who owns the problem” and thus how to coordinate appropriately the full set of resources. However, the most important is to have a common and shared purpose according to respondents. Conflicting theories may have an impact, but well-developed professionals should be able to reach a consensus.\nRespondents also said it is a common feature of the state itself and it is linked to the factor of incompatible objectives. Each actor within the state security system has a slightly different goal and could be guided by different theories or assumptions. Moreover, certain areas of cyber security and defense such as vulnerability weaponizing will always be disputable and it is not necessarily just a civilian-military problem, but also intelligence vs. defensive mandate agencies; or intelligence agencies and law enforcement vs. national CSIRTs.\n### Lack of political guidance (impact: high—extreme)\nThe lack of political guidance and unclear laws in cyber defense is the most critical factor in the research. Most participants agreed that there cannot be any effective action and unity of effort without a clear high-level political guidance supported by an appropriate legal framework and adequate oversight. In states where this situation occurs, it is the root cause of the problem of friction between the civilian and military spheres. Without clear roles and responsibilities and overall strategic guidance, different actors (civilian or military) have less ability to execute in complementary manners.\nNevertheless, some of the military practitioners also pointed out that the factor is relevant especially during peacetime. In times of war or other conflicts, in which armed forces are empowered to perform actions that they would normally not be permitted to do, the impact of this factor would be reduced. In these cases, there is no time or need for extensive political guidance or strict compliance with the national law. Armed forces have\nclear procedures to deal with such situations and they are ready to cooperate closely even with civilian security organizations and others.\n### Organizational factors\n### Structural barriers (impact: moderate—high)\nThis factor seems to be significant. According to some respondents, bureaucracy and operational constraints can make especially the initial cooperation hard. However, once organizational relationships are built, it is much easier to deepen them. In contrast, many others remain in favor of maintaining the status quo. Especially those whom the main responsibility is different than cyber, might still impede cooperation, as they don't see priority in cyber and don't want to innovate. In some states, the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative “from the bottom” (from the operational level). Some military practitioners have also highlighted the problem of horizontal vs. vertical cooperation in the armed forces. They have apparently the necessary internal procedures to cooperate effectively among military units of all kinds (both vertically and horizontally) in place. However, regarding the horizontal cooperation outside the military world, the military often lacks adequate procedures and processes on how to cooperate swiftly and effectively with civilian (nonmilitary) organizations.\n### Organizational cultures (impact: low—moderate)\nSurprisingly, different organizational cultures are perceived by the respondents as the least relevant factor. Only a minority of respondents feel the differences between military and civilian culture as a big obstacle for cooperation. Most of them reported that cultures nowadays can be respected, and they can be learned. Furthermore, all these differences could be more beneficial than restraining. Mutual knowledge is a matter of communication and cooperation, and both worlds would and probably could improve their organization using gained knowledge and experience from its counterparts.\nBoth experts and practitioners from civilian and military spheres agreed that this challenge can be overcome easily by simply working more together. Next, since it is still relatively rare to see specific career paths for military cyber operators, many on active duty will leave and join the industry and civilian public sector, which does serve to increase the understanding of each other's culture, organizational identity, and so on. Even though different cultures exist, the far bigger factor is apparently overall policy differences rather than cultural differences.\nOrganizational independence (impact: moderate)\nIndependence as a higher priority than cooperation is also not seen as an essential factor. Almost all respondents agreed that in most cases, this is not an issue. Although, few of them mentioned the problem of the isolationistic approach of intelligence agencies again. They also shared some of their personal experiences that underpin the presumption of some agencies to prefer independence and operational flexibility to cooperation in (both civilian and military) intelligence agencies.\n### Competition for resources (impact: high)\nAnother high scoring factor is competition for financial resources, status, power, recognition, and influence. Nearly all respondents saw the factor as a relevant barrier and almost all of them ranked the impact as “high.” The competition for resources is an issue especially in an environment where the national roles and responsibilities in cyber security and defense are still not clarified properly. It leads to the situation in which every institution is trying to get a piece of the cyber agenda for itself. This competition could jeopardize the cooperation a lot. Some respondents have also stated that it is mainly a matter of a strategic (not operational) level of cooperation between institutions and the problem is not exclusive to civilian and military cooperation again.\n### Inexperience and lack of proven models (impact: moderate—high)\nThe lack of proven models and inexperience seems to be a very relevant factor in the cyber security and defense area. It is no wonder since it is still a relatively new area for both civilian and military institutions. Some respondents even called the current situation as a startup era of cyber defense. Especially for more rigid military institutions, it could have an extremely negative impact until the necessary practice and experience are gained. According to some, one of the main obstacles in this issue could be also a lack of general cyber awareness and education of “non-specialists” and leaders at all levels. The major problem with cyber defense for a “nonspecialist” is that it's hard to visualize. The way to overcome this could be, e.g. cyber security exercises, tailored especially for high-level management. Finally, respondents see this factor as a great opportunity to start a discussion among all civilian and military institutions. It could be the motivation for some states to create an effective national system of cyber defense from scratch.\n### Idiosyncratic/personality factors (impact: moderate—high)\nThe last factor has a moderate to high impact. The human factor in collaboration on cyber defense is apparently as important as everywhere else. Although cyberspace is a technology-driven world, people are still at the\ncore of it and they are vulnerable to idiosyncratic disputes. Not surprisingly, those respondents who had a real-life experience with it had scored higher than those without it. Some of them have also added that this factor is especially important in the phase of initiation and establishment of cooperation between entities. On the other hand, given the bureaucracy and the way how state institutions work, this effect might be marginalized in the long term. It means that the impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes can be minimized over policy design in the cyber defense and related security areas.\n## Conclusion: factors jeopardizing the development of integrated government capability identified\nThere are many ways how governments can gain, achieve and project cyber power. For example, Healey (2016) claims that still too much emphasis is currently placed on the success or failure of offensive and defensive capabilities, rather than other factors and on long-term national security outcomes. It is apparent that these capabilities are and will be very closely linked to the concept of cyber power, and that both policy (decision) makers and academics are interested in it for obvious reasons. Next, it is also possible to argue that an efficient cyber defense is the focal prerequisite for gaining and increasing power in cyberspace, since it is almost impossible to project power in cyberspace when the nation states have insufficient military power. However, this hard-cyber power approach to winning in cyberspace through military domination is plausibly short-sighted. Nation states should really aim to incorporate many other variables into their grand strategies and policies in cyberspace and use a holistic approach to the integrated government capacity to achieve cyber power. Therefore, this article focused on the identification of factors that could jeopardize integrated government capacity (or so-called whole of government approach) in cyber defense and more specifically the focus was narrowed down to the field of civil-military interagency cooperation within a nation state.\nResearch has demonstrated that in today's hyper-connected world, the traditional state practice just fades away. Global uncomfortable changes in warfare domains gradually force states to rethink many aspects of their military strategies and policies, including cyber defense. With cyber threats evolving into new, complex forms, the lack of fresh, modern solutions at the national level becomes a handicap and will make it difficult for the nation state to project its cyber power.\nWith the understanding of the extensiveness of the cyber issue and its dynamic nature, six critical areas have been identified where further consideration is needed. The area could strongly affect the establishment of\nintegrated government capacity or a strategic framework for cyber power in general.\nAccording to findings, the most important factors (for the lowest to highest impact) are:Idiosyncratic/Personality factors;Incompatible objectives;Structural barriers;Inexperience and lack of proven models;Competition for resources;Lack of guidance by political leaders.\nThe impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are apparent even in the world of cyber defense. According to practice, rationality is simply not always present. Subjective elements, such as human factors, could easily undermine the will and trust between agencies and make cooperation impossible. Hence, nation states should pay attention even to this factor which seems to be minor, but like everywhere else, it could grow into a big issue. On the other hand, the effect of the factor could be minimized through policy design in the cyber defense and security areas.\nNext, the incompatible objectives of each state agency could bring a lot of problems to the cooperation on cyber defense. Cyberspace itself is a cross-cutting domain and ensuring cyber defense means to deal with a cross-government issue. There is still a lack of common understanding among decision-makers or chiefs of relevant agencies and departments that the issue is a national topic, nor the responsibility of one or a few agencies in the state. A consensus on cyber defense should be reached across military and nonmilitary institutions and joint prioritization should be done as well on the governmental level. Especially, the intelligence agencies should be more open to cooperation with other relevant actors and leave their traditional isolationist approach within the state security apparatus.\nStructural barriers to cooperation, such as bureaucracy and operational constraints, can make cooperation hard as well. Maintaining the status quo and a lack of willingness to change the agenda or perform new activities and tasks is another issue that could easily jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense. These barriers are also seen as hardly removable as the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative. Decisions should come from the top in this regard. It is primarily a military issue and the army's way of conducting business. The problem of facilitating horizontal cooperation outside the military world is evident and should be overcome to ensure cyber defense more effectively and on time.\nLack of experience and shortage of best practice is an unsurprisingly an essential factor that could negatively impact the cooperation on cyber defense. It could be an enormous problem especially for the more rigid military, but in contrast, it could be a great opportunity to approach the challenge and establish a new and effectively functioning system of cyber defense cooperation between civilians and military spheres.\nIt is also perceived from the practice that state agencies or ministries are not an exception regarding power and budget struggles. With countries focusing on the new challenges posed by cyber threats and developing their capabilities to tackle them, there is also a new opportunity to gain more political power or financial resources from the state budget. These struggles are not exclusive to civilian and military dichotomy; however, they could easily result in a rivalry between state agencies. It is not perhaps exclusive to cyber security and defense only but could be happening in other trending agendas such as hybrid warfare or space security.\nThe most significant challenge in bridging the obvious gap between civilian and military actors seems to be the lack of political direction and a clear vision on cyber matters from political leaders. It is sometimes a result of scattering the national responsibility for cyber defense among too many civilian and military institutions, together with the lack of enlightened politicians eager to lead in cyber defense effectively. The main issue here could be that leaders must meticulously review all existing policies in the context of cyber defense to ensure cyber defense properly.\nFinally, a lot of respondents also mentioned the importance of the legal and ethical aspects of this kind of cooperation. Legal elements complement political and organizational factors and they are also implied within them to some extent. Cyber defense as a mechanism of responding to the sheer scale of cyber threats is not just a technical discipline, it is linked to a vast range of legal and ethical issues. Therefore, the cyber defense principles, measures, and responsibilities of each actor must be enshrined in the law to protect society from abuses of power and guarantee citizens their rights and freedoms. However, besides that, it also helps to set clear responsibilities of official authorities dealing with cyber defense and it provides a solid ground for the cooperation. In contrast, the lack of relevant legislation or legal vagueness makes setbacks for any kind of cooperation.\nAll these factors could seriously jeopardize the unity of effort at the governmental level and overall cooperation in cyber defense. Therefore, nation states should continuously review their system of collaboration among relevant state military nonmilitary actors and focus on these sets of factors. In practice, it is obvious that all negative factors could be overcome or prevented only when a clear vision and leadership eclipse the self-interest of agencies. States and their decision-makers should approach cyber defense\nas a new agenda where creating a symbiotic relationship across both civilian and military agencies is necessary. The classic distinctions between military and civilian worlds are simply less clear-cut in cyber defense. If the nation state has an ambition to gain and project cyber power, it should make the joint cyber defense a cornerstone of plans for future development and strategic orientation. A unification of differing perceptions of the mission and each other's role within the cyber defense system is needed to establish a fully functioning integrated government capacity. A culture of shared responsibility must be inherent too.\nBased on the findings, it is also possible to make some recommendations for a proper working model of cooperation on cyber defense. It should be based on governmental level actions such as: regular joint cyber defense exercises at both technical and strategic level; operational situational awareness and intensive information sharing and exchange; clarifying the exact roles and responsibilities in the national (cyber) defense system and making cyber leaders from all relevant decision-makers and head of agencies. Especially the enlightened leaders can manage and drive their institution to become a better counterpart for cooperation."

It reviews the civil-military interagency cooperation and aims to identify factors that could jeopardize it. First, it provides a theoretical background for the research and then according to interviews and surveys, the factors with the highest negative impact are recognized. Based on this research, the most significant challenges in bridging the gap between civilian and military worlds seems to be power and budget struggles and a lack of political direction on cyber matters from leaders.\n# KEYWORDS\nCyber defense; cyber power; cyber security; civil-military; cyberspace\n# Introduction\nCyber power has become a pressing issue for many nation states since the militarization of cyberspace has already begun and it is one of the latest additions to the power family tree (Dunn Caverty, 2018, p. 306). The trend of offensive cyberspace operations conducted by nation-states or state-sponsored groups together with the rise of serious cyber attacks on critical infrastructures¹ naturally increase political and military interest in cyber power and relevant state capabilities. It also calls for a review of a national approach to defense in cyberspace, where defense is no longer just a military issue and to gain a real cyber power and cyber effectiveness is possible only through the whole-of-government (civilian and military) cooperation.\nNowadays, cyber threats are very serious. While contemporary cyber attacks are usually still happening rather on a smaller scale or with lower impact, they may quickly rise to an enormous problem for national security and defense. We could have seen it recently when a lot of minor cyber attacks at high frequency were targeting health care facilities during the\nCONTACT Roman Pačka\n\\odot\n roman.packa@gmail.com\n\\odot\n Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University, Joštova 218/10, 602 00 Brno, Czech Republic.\n© 2021 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC\nglobal COVID-19 crisis  and they seriously threatened the national security of several countries. The trend of escalating cyber maneuvers and the increasing prominence of cyber operations within the military is also apparent. It has already caused the development of offensive state cyber capabilities in many European and NATO countries. The modern warfare is currently shaped by new disruptive technologies and the militarization of cyberspace .\nThe visible product of the militarization is the cyberspace itself. It has officially become the next domain for warfighting according to NATO , placing it alongside the traditional battlegrounds of air, land, and sea. This means every state should be able to defend itself in cyberspace and move toward creating military effects in, through, and from cyberspace. However, cyberspace is very different military domain because it is the only domain created by a man and it is highly technical. Therefore, the cyberspace is heavily dependent on heterogeneous, typically civilian, players with different preferences. It is complex, hard to visualize, and constantly changing. Finally, the cyberspace is clearly a nongeographical domain, which also requires a shift of understanding for military commanders .\nDue to its unique nature, military and nonmilitary (civilian) spheres blur or erode more easily than in traditional (physical) domains. In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor. Nevertheless, the cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries. Specific challenges, such as the problem of attribution and anonymity, or the asymmetric characteristics of cyberspace results in the current situation where nation states must ensure a close civil-military collaboration within a state to achieve and gain cyber power.\nOn the one hand, this strong need for coordinated civil-military inter-agency teamwork exists to protect the nation against serious cyber threats and produce cyber effects. On the other hand, there is also a deficiency of experience and practice with that on both sides, and sometimes even the willingness to cooperate lacks as these two worlds (military and civilian/nonmilitary) are quite different and somewhat isolated. A few state actors such as Netherlands or the Czech Republic have already noticed the issue. From the military perspective, the new Dutch strategic vision for defense released by Dutch Ministry of Defence (MvD, Ministerie van Defensie) focuses on their partners outside the military organization and is going to devote greater attention to the role and task of the military in this gray zone of “strategic competition” between war and peace . Next, the (civilian) national cyber security strategy of the Czech Republic for the years 2021--2025 created by their national cyber security authority\n(NUKIB, Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost) also calls for a common approach to cyber security and defense within the country and the improvement of the collaboration model and information sharing between military and nonmilitary actors .\nHence, this article intends to initiate and contribute to the discussion on civil-military interagency cooperation by considering possible factors that could spoil the establishing of an efficient integrated governmental framework for cyber defense. The article does not deal with the private sector or academia institutions such as universities nor think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It strictly focuses on the governmental interagency cooperation and response system and elaborates on factors that could affect or jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense between key state civilian (nonmilitary) and military entities, such as agencies responsible for CIIP (e.g. national Computer Security Incident Response Teams—CSIRTs), intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and departments of defense, including military cyber operations unit.\nOur main premise is that the ability of a nation state to gain cyber power leads through the efficient whole-of-government approach (so-called integrated government capability) as it is a crucial basis for achieving any power and control in cyberspace. Therefore, the article identifies the most significant barriers preventing this approach.\nResearchers are fully aware of the difficulty with the concept of cyber power, that systematic (empirical) analyses of the topic do not yet exist, and that the body of literature on cyber-power is small and fragmented. Hence, this article narrowly focuses only on the subset of the topic of cyber power and serves as another piece to the debate. It could also be a basis for further academic research or a source of inspiration for policy makers.\nData in this article are—with respect to the character of researched experts—valid mostly for the NATO countries. Recent development in this area is important from the global point of view. Firstly, due to the fact that NATO is the strongest military alliance in the contemporary world and it improves its cyber capabilities. Secondly, development in NATO countries can serve as a model for development in other parts of the world. And thirdly, recent trends in NATO have an indirect impact on the behavior of its adversaries in cyberspace.\n## Integrated government capability as an enabler for cyber power\nThe cyber is an instrument of national power and national states already use cyber means to advance their objectives . The term “cyber power” has become common in security and strategy discourse  and it includes all forms of power in which\npower relations occur wholly or in part in or through cyberspace. However, cyber power is not created simply to exist, but rather to support other elements of national power—political, diplomatic, informational, military, and economic' .\nAccording to Klimburg (2011, p. 43), a nation's cyber power has three dimensions: (1) coordination of operational and policy aspects across governmental structures, (2) coherency of policy through international alliances and legal frameworks, and (3) cooperation of non-state cyber actors. In sum, this so-called Klimburg's Integrated capability model includes: Integrated government capability; Integrated systems capability; and Integrated national capability (Dunn Cavelty, 2018, p. 309). Klimburg claims that while the first two dimensions are important, the integrated national capability must be primarily reached because a major portion of a state's cyber capabilities lies outside direct government control. It is therefore essential to create this “whole-of-nation” cyber capability within a nation state.\nNevertheless, to follow this whole of nation approach is quite challenging for many nation states that are currently developing their cyber defensive and offensive capabilities. Hence, it is reasonable to argue with Klimburg that some nation states simply cannot create an efficient cooperation in cyberspace outside the government, while struggling with their own internal governmental part (so-called “whole-of-government” approach). For many of them, it is about the need to get the basics right first, which means to achieve the central coordination across governmental structures—integrated government capability. The ability of the government to deliver joint action which entails to attack and defend in cyberspace, to draft policy positions, and to share operational resources . In cyberspace, achieving this kind of coordination could be quite challenging for many nation states, because it includes the need for an efficient civil-military cooperation. A field that has been overlooked or marginalized for decades.\nThe issue of civil-military cooperation has already many aspects, specifics, and barriers in traditional operational domains, but in cyberspace, it has even more difficulties. To simply put, it could be hard to achieve efficient cooperation between military and nonmilitary organizations when governments are struggling at a strategic level to work out how to combine the capabilities of their armed forces with other instruments of national power . Even if the nation states and their specific civilian security (police, intelligence agencies and others) and military organizations could hold enough resources to theoretically gain cyber power, it is not entirely clear that they will have the ability to do it and perform efficient joint operations in cyberspace. For example, Bebber\n(2017, p. 427) mentions that there is a problem between a potential cyber power and a cyber effectiveness. Unlocking the power inherent in national capacities and different government actors to affect outcomes in the national interest is the key to cyber effectiveness and real cyber power . Thus, there is a difference between the available human and material resources and how they are utilized by the nation state to generate effects and support national political ends in and through cyberspace.\nFor nation states, it means to predominantly focus on joint cooperation on cyber defense, which is a multidisciplinary task that includes civilian and military state organization efforts. Only through the delivery of joint, defensive and offensive cyber operations and actions, the nation states could efficiently support their strategic security interests and achieve cyber power.\n## United by necessity: the militarization of cyberspace drives a need for civil—military cooperation on cyber defense\nAs Dunn Cavelty (2018, p. 309) points out, Klimburg's integrated capability model is consciously taking cyber power out of the context of projecting national interests coercively and adds a strong defensive cyber security element. Such a view highlights that cyber power and cyber security are intricately linked. However, Dunn Cavelty also adds that a true cyber power also needs to be able to “defend” against cyber threats. In today's view, it means to conduct cyber offensive and defensive military operations rather than a reactive and preventive approach embodied in cyber security. To simply put, there cannot be any true cyber power without a proper (civilian) cyber security and (military) cyber defense. These two environments must be inherently connected, and they must complement each other.\nEven though cyber security and cyber defense are dissimilar concepts and their definitions and theories often vary, they are still closely connected (Pačka, 2015). In this article, cyber security focuses on preventive and reactive measures in its nature, while the cyber defense could be more proactive and it allows to use military capacity and armed forces^{4}. Paraphrasing Clausewitz (1989), cyber defense could be the continuation of ensuring cyber security by other means, such as defensive and offensive cyber operations.\nNation states ensure their cyber security to improve the security and resilience of national infrastructures and services already for decades. Regarding the cyber defense, the governments all over the world has just started to build its capacity a few years ago. Specifically, they usually create\nrband new military cyber units and strive to defend the nation against the most serious cyber threats (Smeets). The issue of civil-military inter-agency cooperation on cyber defense is therefore relatively new. Not surprisingly, while there are numerous guidelines for cooperation between law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and national CSIRTs in cyber security (e.g. ENISA ; Pačka ; Skierka .), there is an insufficient practice and no handbook on cyber defense cooperation issue (Pačka), pp. 93--94).\nThe state practice could be quite challenging in that sense. There are factors such as the tendency of armies across the world to separate themselves from the rest of the nonmilitary security apparatus or the impossibility to ensure defense in cyberspace properly by a military actor alone by itself. In sum, synergy and cooperation with the rest of the national security actors who tackle cyber threats should be secured and exercised regularly. Given the fact that most of the cyberspace can be considered dual-use, it is simply difficult to separate the military and civilian realms (Droege), pp. 570, 576) and any harsh distinction simply does not work.\nAlthough, it is imminent that the segregation is present. It often rests on the assumption that the military and civilian agenda within the national security apparatus is distinct and should be kept distinct. According to Heinl, p. 38), this approach is caused historically. In the past, there was not a generally compelling need to engage civilian security authorities and agencies in military matters. Even large cyber attacks were usually not so significant to reach a threshold that would have activated the armed forces' response in previous years. Some authors (see Dunn Cavelty ; Wallace) persistently argued that the military role in cyberspace outside the context of armed conflict should be limited (Bigelow), p. 3), e.g. on the protection of military networks and information systems. Heinl contends that this was an understandable posture at that time. Even today, most cyber threats are directed against civilian (public or private) systems and networks and therefore have to be dealt (up to a certain threshold) by the targeted organizations themselves or by nonmilitary authorities responsible for cyber security or cyber crime (national CSIRTs, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies, if needed).\nFurthermore, the military's exact role and responsibilities in national cyber security or defense might remain vague from the institutional perspective. A long-term institutional practice within nation states supports this approach. When countries and its institutions usually define new roles and responsibilities of the armed forces or civilian authorities anywhere (including cyberspace), they look for analogies from the physical world and translate them as literally as possible. It means there could be a long-lasting consensus that armed forces should have a limited role in cyber crises\noutside of armed conflict  and they want to just maintain the status quo, where military and civilian security or defense agencies are still somewhat isolated.\nNowadays, the debate has evolved significantly, especially due to increasing evidence of state or state-sponsored attacks on civilian cyberspace infrastructure . The increased militarization of cyberspace is also an apparent trend these days , and regular and irregular warfare are slowly losing their distinction due to the unique nature of cyberspace. Traditional norms of warfare, definitions of combatants and noncombatants, and even what constitutes military action or national casus belli are being turned upside down (TRADOC G-2, 2017, p. 20). It means the military role can simply no longer be limited to the traditional approach of engaging primarily in an armed conflict. It is particularly challenging to ensure national security and defense or even to wage a war without cooperation between military and nonmilitary (civilian) worlds these days. The cyber defense is about working with existing military, civilian, police, central and other structures, cooperation, and mixing missions of different actors with the same goal.\nHence, an advisable starting point for all nation states is to strive to set up an efficient cooperation between civilian authorities and agencies responsible for cyber security and armed forces with the mandate to conduct cyber defense operations. This cooperation framework should always start with the joint protection of those assets that are most essential for the country—critical (information) infrastructure. This is an especially important issue since civilian infrastructures are legitimate targets in case of serious cyber attacks or an armed conflict. And on the other hand, militaries as defenders of last resort for these infrastructures do not have the capacity to be familiar, let alone proficient, in the functioning of civilian networks .\n### CIIP as the core issue for cooperation\nCritical infrastructure protection (CIP) as a concept and practice was first explicitly articulated in the 1990s. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, CIP moved to the center of domestic security doctrine , not only in the United States but also in other countries. Besides the physical protection of the critical infrastructure, cyber security has also become a significant issue in today's world. Cyber threats to the critical infrastructure emanate from a wide spectrum of prospective perpetrators: state-sponsored espionage and sabotage, international terrorism, domestic militants, malevolent hacktivists, or even disaffected insiders .\nThe broadening of this concept has created a new term—critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP). As for the critical infrastructure, even a disruption of critical information infrastructure could result in human death, injuries, or physical damage and its threatening could have a debilitating effect on the security of a given nation, its economy, and the public's safety or health. CIIP is therefore generally acknowledged to be an indispensable component of national security policy  and this ability to ensure CIIP is critical regarding the cyber power of the nation state.\nNevertheless, today's common practice is that civilian authorities are responsible for coordinating cyber security incident response within the critical infrastructure and armed forces are being used only as an instrument of last resort in an armed conflict. It is important to realize that the CIIP is already a part of the cyber defense and it needs to be supported by cross-organizational collaboration to be effective. It is a joint endeavor . According to Heinl (2016, p. 38), the military has the responsibility for national security, which presumably includes the defense of the most extreme cyber threats to critical infrastructure. This common thread (at least in Europe) of limiting the role of the military in cyber security response  therefore calls for a comprehensive approach to civil-military cooperation on both—the cyber security and defense to achieve integrated government capacity. However, the main issue is still that while the military has usually little or no role in the protection of critical infrastructure during peacetime, it would be an enormously challenging task, during, e.g, the war or other cyber-enabled conflict. Hence, ensuring the CIIP only when some major crisis occurs could put the military forces in an uncomfortable position.\nIt is proposed that the CIIP should be a vital kernel for the cooperation on cyber defense between relevant civilian (nonmilitary) and military agencies within a state security apparatus. There is an apparent need to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks from both sides because any of these attacks can have the potential to threaten the national security and stability. For example, given the special nature of cyberspace, it is usually hard to attribute the attacker or the source of the attack in real-time. Attribution of cyber attacks is simply not an easy task. There are technical issues which complicate identifying cyber attackers . At the beginning of nearly all cyber attacks, the culprit is unknown, and it is always reasonable to comprehend that it can be a state, state-sponsored group, terrorist, an activist, or just some criminal actor. Therefore, governments must approach the response to each serious cyber attack targeting the critical information infrastructure very seriously.\nTherefore, a strong demand for mutual collaboration, cooperation, and information sharing among all relevant civilian and military spheres is\n#\nR. PACKA AND M. MARES\nTable 1. Political and organizational factors.\n|  Political factors | Organizational factors  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Incompatible objectives | Structural barriers  |\n|  Conflicting Definitions | Organizational Cultures  |\n|  Conflicting Theories | Organizational Independence  |\n|  Lack of guidance by political leaders | Competition for Resources  |\n|   | Inexperience and Lack of Proven Models  |\n|   | Idiosyncratic/Personality Factors  |\nlogical. As it is apparent also from this research, the practice of crisis response, joint operations, training, and exercises between state civilian and military agencies often lacks and there are still numerous factors that could affect or jeopardize this kind of cooperation in the future.\n# Factors possibly jeopardizing civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense\nMany factors could render the cooperation between a diverse spectrum of civilian and military agencies problematic. While cyber-specific factors that could jeopardize cooperation have not been identified yet, the focus is on general factors that influence civil-military cooperation (e.g., in conflict resolution) and might also apply to cyber defense. Specifically, the identified factors are inspired and based on the work of Olson and Gregorian (2007) and complemented by the literature review and analysis. Only factors that could suit the cyber realm have been picked and modified for research purposes. All factors are divided into two main categories—political and organizational—with the possibility to identify other factors during the research (Table 1).\n# Political factors\nThe first factor is called incompatible objectives. Despite the common objective to ensure national (cyber) security, each national actor (civilian or military) could hold differing, and sometimes, mutually contradictory policy goals (Olson &amp; Gregorian, 2007, p. 7). Given the fact that each national organization has a different role in the national (cyber) security and defense system, it is quite logical and there could be a small deviation. Nevertheless, the ensuring of national security begins internally with all responsible national actors and their interagency cooperation. In an increasingly complex, multi-dimensional policy world, therefore the government must promote cooperation rather than competition among the various stakeholders . If policy goals are excessively incompatible, it could result in conflict or friction among national organizations.\nThe second factor stands for conflicting definitions. Even different definitions could jeopardize cooperation. Many authors (see Futter, 2018, p. 201; Galinec et al. 2017, p. 274) state, little consensus exists about what the term ‘cyber' includes, refers to, or how it is being used. Regarding the terms of cyber security and cyber defense, the situation is similar. Since there are no ‘one-fits-all' definitions, there could be disputes between national actors about the nature or scope or meaning of the terms. These differing definitions could then lead to differing approaches on how to achieve efficient cyber defense and lead to a decrease in cooperation efficiency.\nConflicting theories could also endanger cooperation. Civilian and military institutions could have trouble coordinating at the operational, tactical, or strategic level, or even agreeing on an analysis of the problem, often because they are guided by radically different theories or assumptions about what causes problems or crises and how it can be resolved . This conceptual problem is closely related to the previous factor and contains conflicting theories on how to effectively ensure national cyber security and defense. It may cover a lot of issues, such as a discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in CIIP. While some institutions (e.g. national CSIRTs) strive to patch it immediately to secure the system, others (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement units, and others) attempt to exploit it and use it against the attacker (see Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 74--75; Pačka, 2019, pp. 71--74).\nThe last political factor represents a lack of political guidance, because the successes of each institution alone guarantee nothing in a large-scale national cyber crisis. Lack of political guidance, willpower, and support at the governmental level cannot be simply substituted. Already in 2014, Lewis (2014, p. 566) stated that whether the cyber issue reaches the top level of political leadership depends on factors such as personal interest, a direct experience of malicious cyber action, media attention or the salience of cybersecurity on their national and international agendas. Even the cyber agenda became very political in recent years, factors such as the depth of knowledge about the problem could be still an issue for politicians and other leaders. Lehto and Limnéll (2020, pp. 139, 146) therefore suggests that streamlining and strengthening strategic leadership are key aspects in making sure the cyber vision is achieved. The strong cyber leadership also prevent state agencies from operating solely in their siloes and based only on their objectives and needs. Hence, the lack of political guidance may result in many problems with the coordination. For example, insufficient resources, duplication of activities, uncertain rules of engagement in cyberspace, absence of ‘referees' to resolve competing positions, and unclear national law or jurisdictional boundaries between civilian and military\ninstitutions. Despite NATO officially recognizes cyberspace as the domain of warfare, it could still be a serious concern in many NATO countries. For example, according to the statement of retired Gen. Keith Alexander, even the United States (the pioneer of cyber warfare) still lacked “clear rules of engagement” for conducting offensive cyber operations three years ago . Hence, the lack of political guidance represents another factor that could negatively influence civil-military cooperation.\n### Organizational factors\nStructural barriers could be a strong organizational factor since rigid organizational structures represent a big obstacle to any kind of cooperation. Bureaucratic and daily operational constraints tend to stifle cooperation or any innovation and favor the status quo . In cyber realm, we could say that generally in smaller countries organizations tend to be less hierarchical and rigid. As people know each other personally, they tend to trust others more than in impersonal interactions, and greater flexibility enables them to share information swiftly. However, even in these smaller countries some barriers between civilian and military organizations naturally persists . Hence, the factor could have a serious impact on civil-military cooperation in cyberspace as well.\nNext, organizational culture is a recognized term that describes unwritten norms, rules, and customs in an establishment. The literature suggests (see Arnaud & Tinoco, 2013, p. 37) that organizational culture differs between industries as well as professions. The civilian and military culture is no exception and may cause friction within the national interagency cooperation. There is a general tendency among all organizations and sometimes even across units within the same organization to adopt substantially different planning and implementation terminology or to describe different processes and outcomes even when employing the same terminology . On the other hand, cultural interoperability among organizations stems from interagency understanding, trust, and confidence that require close and ongoing training, liaisons, and exchanges . Different organizational cultures could simply represent an important factor in the issue of civil-military cooperation. Moreover, the lack of knowledge about one another's organizational identity in the meaning of traditions, culture, images, and fundamental goals are represented in this factor.\nEven organizational independence could be for certain (civilian or military) organizations a higher priority than coordination with other organizations as they are not prepared to follow the lead of another organization . Some institutions could see cooperation\nas a fundamental threat to their operational flexibility. While cooperation is perceived as the key to cyber security and defense, the factor of preferring independence to cooperation could be an essential one.\nAs a significant factor appears also a competition for resources. State organizations such as ministries might not cooperate especially when there is a political system with strong line ministries, departmentalization, and silo arrangements. Coordination is therefore often limited to minimal coordination  and sometimes it could also lead to competition. The competition could be about different resources such as status, power, recognition, financial resources and influence . It is worth to mention that all state organizations are fully aware of cyber security and defense being one of the fastest growing fields today. It means there is still a space to set new standards, define new roles, and deliver new tasks. In this regard, some of them could also compete to take over some responsibilities from other agencies. This unhealthy competition might also result in not sharing of responsibility, agenda, or information and intelligence about cyber threats with other partners within the state.\nWhile abundant state practice in conventional warfare exists, cyber defense is a relatively new and very specific area in which a lack of proven models and inexperience is often apparent. Difficulties arise when both civilian and military institutions are stretched beyond their traditional areas of expertise , such as traditional warfighting, intelligence gathering, law-enforcing, or CIP. In the field of cyber defense, lack of best practices and guidelines (see Pačka, 2019, pp. 93--94) might lead to many wrong strategic decisions and choosing a flawed attitude toward cooperation.\nFinally, idiosyncratic or personality factors could play a key role in cyber defense cooperation. Some states might rely heavily on individuals with considerable power and specific attitudes. Stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are not uncommon within and across organizations. Sometimes the willingness to cooperate arises from personal likes or dislikes . This unprofessional behavior might lead to a decrease or cooperation between state organizations.\n## Scope and method\nThe article deals with the topic of cyber power that could nation states achieve through the development of integrated government capacity. The empirical part of the research focuses on one of the main problems in today's whole of government approach in cyberspace—the issue of the cooperation between civilian and military institutions on cyber defense. It is focused particularly on central government departments, agencies, and\nother civilian or military state institutions that are predominantly involved in ensuring cyber defense. Whole of nation approach that includes society, private sector companies, NGOs, or academia is not the focus of the study, but it is considered as the next step in achieving cyber power.\nNamely, the study focuses on the dynamics between: the civilian entities responsible for CIIP (e.g. agencies that usually operate so-called national CSIRTs),law enforcement units,military and civilian intelligence agenciesand departments of defense, including the army and special cyber command units.\nThe research has a mixed design, which includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. To measure all the factors, the researchers use quantitative data from surveys (see below) and then they use qualitative data from interviews that provide rich descriptions of the phenomena and generate new premises. An approach is primarily inductive , which means the research moves from the specific experiences and practice of respondents to the general to explain the phenomena and identify major challenges in civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense within a state.\nThe methods of data collection are document analysis, in-depth semi-structured interviews, and surveys. Getting the right participants is critical to the success of the research and simultaneously it constitutes the main limitation of the study. The willingness to participate and the consent of all participants have not been an issue since the confidentiality is ensured and outcomes are sanitized. However, it turned out that there is only a limited number of experts and practitioners who deals with this specific topic and could have been reached by researchers at the same time. Therefore, the researchers focus on a smaller amount of participants but did a more detailed interviews. It also means that participants were purposively selected by the judgment of the researchers because sampling for proportionality is not the concern of this research . Only participants who could have offered valuable insight and high-quality answers into the topic were selected. Respondent-driven sampling (also known as snowball sampling) has also been used to involve more experts and practitioners from the civilian and military spheres in the research. All respondents came from NATO countries as this research is relevant mainly for the transatlantic area. At the time of this research these participants were serving in the military, working for intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies, CSIRTs or relevant ministries. Some of them were also experts\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED SECURITY RESEARCH\n\n|  Scale | Negligible | Low | Moderate | High | Extreme  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Value | 0 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0.75 | 1  |\nworking for the intergovernmental organization. The data collection period ran during the years 2019 and mid-2020. The semistructured interviews have been conducted online or face to face and the surveys have been completed in the same way.\nThe empirical research was to address the following question:\nWhat factors could significantly jeopardize civil-military interagency cooperation toward cyber defense within a nation-state?\nBased on the literature review and an analysis of the authors, ten factors of political and organizational nature that could have a strong influence on civil-military cooperation have been identified and then discussed with the respondents during the interviews and surveys. All respondents waged and deliberated each factor, shared their personal views on how important and relevant each factor is, and highlighted it on the impact scale (negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme). Finally, they had an option to add further factors or categories (Table 2).\nBased on these findings, factors with the highest impact (scoring moderate—high to extreme) on civil-military cooperation in cyber defense were recognized and highlighted. Finally, these findings also shed light and form a discussion on the second question:\nHow nation states could gain cyber power through the integrated government capacity?\nConducting this research will help states and their institutions to make better decisions about their approach to cooperation on cyber defense. It could also serve as a basis for future academic research and debate.\n## Findings\nAccording to 13 interviews and surveys with experts and practitioners from civilian and military agencies related to cyber defense, the most significant factors jeopardizing the cooperation on cyber defense are as follows (see Table 3). The findings confirm the necessity of the factors we identified and generate new premises that deserve further attention.\n## Political factors\n### Incompatible objectives (impact: moderate—high)\nMost of the respondents scored this factor as essential and claim that all national institutions or agencies must understand that the state has one\n#\nR. PACKA AND M. MARES\nTable 3. Results of the research.\n|   | Level of impact  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Score | Scale  |\n|  Political factors |  |   |\n|  Incompatible objectives | 0.643 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Conflicting definitions | 0.392 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Conflicting theories | 0.531 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Lack of guidance by political leaders | 0.843 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Organizational factors |  |   |\n|  Structural barriers | 0.688 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Organizational cultures | 0.321 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Organizational independence | 0.469 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Competition for resources | 0.750 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Inexperience and lack of proven models | 0.688 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\n|  Idiosyncratic or personality factors | 0.625 | negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme  |\ncommon goal and their objectives cannot be incompatible. The root cause of the problem here might not necessarily be related to cyber security and defense but rather to the ability and recognition of these topics being a cross-government issue. Building on that, it also turns out that the objectives may not necessarily be incompatible in some cases, but their priorities may differ. It means the cooperation in this area is for some institutions simply not nearly as important as for others.\nNext, some respondents directly highlighted particularly the contrast between the military intelligence (as part of both the military and intelligence community) and cyber security community (national CSIRTs). They added that the problem might lie in the natural isolationist approach of intelligence agencies in general. Moreover, they stated that this approach is not relevant only to civil-military cooperation. It is sometimes relevant even to military and intel-military cooperation, i.e., between military intelligence agencies and the \"green army.\"\n# Conflicting definitions (impact: low—moderate)\nThis factor has almost the lowest score among respondents. Respondents had claimed that the challenge could be easily overcome by combined training and joint cyber exercises and operations. Promoting dialogue and open discussion among the civilian and military community may also solve this problem. Some of the respondents added that conflicting definitions affect primarily policymakers, not (civilian or military) cyber practitioners (at the operational level). In reality, they should figure out these differences fast, adapt to them, and then cooperate effectively.\nIt means it is less of an issue. The lack of definitions should not hinder progress or cooperation. The aphorism \"Perfect is the enemy of good\" has also been used in the interviews. Those differing views might be useful and (if properly managed) contribute to a constructive and more sustainable consensus between organizations.\nIn sum, it seems that a lack of convergence between terminologies used by civilian and military actors does not represent an additional barrier to civil-military cooperation.\n### Conflicting theories (impact: moderate)\nThe factor of conflicting theories has a moderate impact and similar answers as the previous one. Some of the respondents do not perceive it as an immense problem that requires extensional attention at the national level. At a higher level of crisis (i.e. state of emergency), there should be clear national response structures and procedures that can be activated. Below that, although, there may be disagreement and discussion on “who owns the problem” and thus how to coordinate appropriately the full set of resources. However, the most important is to have a common and shared purpose according to respondents. Conflicting theories may have an impact, but well-developed professionals should be able to reach a consensus.\nRespondents also said it is a common feature of the state itself and it is linked to the factor of incompatible objectives. Each actor within the state security system has a slightly different goal and could be guided by different theories or assumptions. Moreover, certain areas of cyber security and defense such as vulnerability weaponizing will always be disputable and it is not necessarily just a civilian-military problem, but also intelligence vs. defensive mandate agencies; or intelligence agencies and law enforcement vs. national CSIRTs.\n### Lack of political guidance (impact: high—extreme)\nThe lack of political guidance and unclear laws in cyber defense is the most critical factor in the research. Most participants agreed that there cannot be any effective action and unity of effort without a clear high-level political guidance supported by an appropriate legal framework and adequate oversight. In states where this situation occurs, it is the root cause of the problem of friction between the civilian and military spheres. Without clear roles and responsibilities and overall strategic guidance, different actors (civilian or military) have less ability to execute in complementary manners.\nNevertheless, some of the military practitioners also pointed out that the factor is relevant especially during peacetime. In times of war or other conflicts, in which armed forces are empowered to perform actions that they would normally not be permitted to do, the impact of this factor would be reduced. In these cases, there is no time or need for extensive political guidance or strict compliance with the national law. Armed forces have\nclear procedures to deal with such situations and they are ready to cooperate closely even with civilian security organizations and others.\n### Organizational factors\n### Structural barriers (impact: moderate—high)\nThis factor seems to be significant. According to some respondents, bureaucracy and operational constraints can make especially the initial cooperation hard. However, once organizational relationships are built, it is much easier to deepen them. In contrast, many others remain in favor of maintaining the status quo. Especially those whom the main responsibility is different than cyber, might still impede cooperation, as they don't see priority in cyber and don't want to innovate. In some states, the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative “from the bottom” (from the operational level). Some military practitioners have also highlighted the problem of horizontal vs. vertical cooperation in the armed forces. They have apparently the necessary internal procedures to cooperate effectively among military units of all kinds (both vertically and horizontally) in place. However, regarding the horizontal cooperation outside the military world, the military often lacks adequate procedures and processes on how to cooperate swiftly and effectively with civilian (nonmilitary) organizations.\n### Organizational cultures (impact: low—moderate)\nSurprisingly, different organizational cultures are perceived by the respondents as the least relevant factor. Only a minority of respondents feel the differences between military and civilian culture as a big obstacle for cooperation. Most of them reported that cultures nowadays can be respected, and they can be learned. Furthermore, all these differences could be more beneficial than restraining. Mutual knowledge is a matter of communication and cooperation, and both worlds would and probably could improve their organization using gained knowledge and experience from its counterparts.\nBoth experts and practitioners from civilian and military spheres agreed that this challenge can be overcome easily by simply working more together. Next, since it is still relatively rare to see specific career paths for military cyber operators, many on active duty will leave and join the industry and civilian public sector, which does serve to increase the understanding of each other's culture, organizational identity, and so on. Even though different cultures exist, the far bigger factor is apparently overall policy differences rather than cultural differences.\nOrganizational independence (impact: moderate)\nIndependence as a higher priority than cooperation is also not seen as an essential factor. Almost all respondents agreed that in most cases, this is not an issue. Although, few of them mentioned the problem of the isolationistic approach of intelligence agencies again. They also shared some of their personal experiences that underpin the presumption of some agencies to prefer independence and operational flexibility to cooperation in (both civilian and military) intelligence agencies.\n### Competition for resources (impact: high)\nAnother high scoring factor is competition for financial resources, status, power, recognition, and influence. Nearly all respondents saw the factor as a relevant barrier and almost all of them ranked the impact as “high.” The competition for resources is an issue especially in an environment where the national roles and responsibilities in cyber security and defense are still not clarified properly. It leads to the situation in which every institution is trying to get a piece of the cyber agenda for itself. This competition could jeopardize the cooperation a lot. Some respondents have also stated that it is mainly a matter of a strategic (not operational) level of cooperation between institutions and the problem is not exclusive to civilian and military cooperation again.\n### Inexperience and lack of proven models (impact: moderate—high)\nThe lack of proven models and inexperience seems to be a very relevant factor in the cyber security and defense area. It is no wonder since it is still a relatively new area for both civilian and military institutions. Some respondents even called the current situation as a startup era of cyber defense. Especially for more rigid military institutions, it could have an extremely negative impact until the necessary practice and experience are gained. According to some, one of the main obstacles in this issue could be also a lack of general cyber awareness and education of “non-specialists” and leaders at all levels. The major problem with cyber defense for a “nonspecialist” is that it's hard to visualize. The way to overcome this could be, e.g. cyber security exercises, tailored especially for high-level management. Finally, respondents see this factor as a great opportunity to start a discussion among all civilian and military institutions. It could be the motivation for some states to create an effective national system of cyber defense from scratch.\n### Idiosyncratic/personality factors (impact: moderate—high)\nThe last factor has a moderate to high impact. The human factor in collaboration on cyber defense is apparently as important as everywhere else. Although cyberspace is a technology-driven world, people are still at the\ncore of it and they are vulnerable to idiosyncratic disputes. Not surprisingly, those respondents who had a real-life experience with it had scored higher than those without it. Some of them have also added that this factor is especially important in the phase of initiation and establishment of cooperation between entities. On the other hand, given the bureaucracy and the way how state institutions work, this effect might be marginalized in the long term. It means that the impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes can be minimized over policy design in the cyber defense and related security areas.\n## Conclusion: factors jeopardizing the development of integrated government capability identified\nThere are many ways how governments can gain, achieve and project cyber power. For example, Healey (2016) claims that still too much emphasis is currently placed on the success or failure of offensive and defensive capabilities, rather than other factors and on long-term national security outcomes. It is apparent that these capabilities are and will be very closely linked to the concept of cyber power, and that both policy (decision) makers and academics are interested in it for obvious reasons. Next, it is also possible to argue that an efficient cyber defense is the focal prerequisite for gaining and increasing power in cyberspace, since it is almost impossible to project power in cyberspace when the nation states have insufficient military power. However, this hard-cyber power approach to winning in cyberspace through military domination is plausibly short-sighted. Nation states should really aim to incorporate many other variables into their grand strategies and policies in cyberspace and use a holistic approach to the integrated government capacity to achieve cyber power. Therefore, this article focused on the identification of factors that could jeopardize integrated government capacity (or so-called whole of government approach) in cyber defense and more specifically the focus was narrowed down to the field of civil-military interagency cooperation within a nation state.\nResearch has demonstrated that in today's hyper-connected world, the traditional state practice just fades away. Global uncomfortable changes in warfare domains gradually force states to rethink many aspects of their military strategies and policies, including cyber defense. With cyber threats evolving into new, complex forms, the lack of fresh, modern solutions at the national level becomes a handicap and will make it difficult for the nation state to project its cyber power.\nWith the understanding of the extensiveness of the cyber issue and its dynamic nature, six critical areas have been identified where further consideration is needed. The area could strongly affect the establishment of\nintegrated government capacity or a strategic framework for cyber power in general.\nAccording to findings, the most important factors (for the lowest to highest impact) are:Idiosyncratic/Personality factors;Incompatible objectives;Structural barriers;Inexperience and lack of proven models;Competition for resources;Lack of guidance by political leaders.\nThe impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are apparent even in the world of cyber defense. According to practice, rationality is simply not always present. Subjective elements, such as human factors, could easily undermine the will and trust between agencies and make cooperation impossible. Hence, nation states should pay attention even to this factor which seems to be minor, but like everywhere else, it could grow into a big issue. On the other hand, the effect of the factor could be minimized through policy design in the cyber defense and security areas.\nNext, the incompatible objectives of each state agency could bring a lot of problems to the cooperation on cyber defense. Cyberspace itself is a cross-cutting domain and ensuring cyber defense means to deal with a cross-government issue. There is still a lack of common understanding among decision-makers or chiefs of relevant agencies and departments that the issue is a national topic, nor the responsibility of one or a few agencies in the state. A consensus on cyber defense should be reached across military and nonmilitary institutions and joint prioritization should be done as well on the governmental level. Especially, the intelligence agencies should be more open to cooperation with other relevant actors and leave their traditional isolationist approach within the state security apparatus.\nStructural barriers to cooperation, such as bureaucracy and operational constraints, can make cooperation hard as well. Maintaining the status quo and a lack of willingness to change the agenda or perform new activities and tasks is another issue that could easily jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense. These barriers are also seen as hardly removable as the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative. Decisions should come from the top in this regard. It is primarily a military issue and the army's way of conducting business. The problem of facilitating horizontal cooperation outside the military world is evident and should be overcome to ensure cyber defense more effectively and on time.\nLack of experience and shortage of best practice is an unsurprisingly an essential factor that could negatively impact the cooperation on cyber defense. It could be an enormous problem especially for the more rigid military, but in contrast, it could be a great opportunity to approach the challenge and establish a new and effectively functioning system of cyber defense cooperation between civilians and military spheres.\nIt is also perceived from the practice that state agencies or ministries are not an exception regarding power and budget struggles. With countries focusing on the new challenges posed by cyber threats and developing their capabilities to tackle them, there is also a new opportunity to gain more political power or financial resources from the state budget. These struggles are not exclusive to civilian and military dichotomy; however, they could easily result in a rivalry between state agencies. It is not perhaps exclusive to cyber security and defense only but could be happening in other trending agendas such as hybrid warfare or space security.\nThe most significant challenge in bridging the obvious gap between civilian and military actors seems to be the lack of political direction and a clear vision on cyber matters from political leaders. It is sometimes a result of scattering the national responsibility for cyber defense among too many civilian and military institutions, together with the lack of enlightened politicians eager to lead in cyber defense effectively. The main issue here could be that leaders must meticulously review all existing policies in the context of cyber defense to ensure cyber defense properly.\nFinally, a lot of respondents also mentioned the importance of the legal and ethical aspects of this kind of cooperation. Legal elements complement political and organizational factors and they are also implied within them to some extent. Cyber defense as a mechanism of responding to the sheer scale of cyber threats is not just a technical discipline, it is linked to a vast range of legal and ethical issues. Therefore, the cyber defense principles, measures, and responsibilities of each actor must be enshrined in the law to protect society from abuses of power and guarantee citizens their rights and freedoms. However, besides that, it also helps to set clear responsibilities of official authorities dealing with cyber defense and it provides a solid ground for the cooperation. In contrast, the lack of relevant legislation or legal vagueness makes setbacks for any kind of cooperation.\nAll these factors could seriously jeopardize the unity of effort at the governmental level and overall cooperation in cyber defense. Therefore, nation states should continuously review their system of collaboration among relevant state military nonmilitary actors and focus on these sets of factors. In practice, it is obvious that all negative factors could be overcome or prevented only when a clear vision and leadership eclipse the self-interest of agencies. States and their decision-makers should approach cyber defense\nas a new agenda where creating a symbiotic relationship across both civilian and military agencies is necessary. The classic distinctions between military and civilian worlds are simply less clear-cut in cyber defense. If the nation state has an ambition to gain and project cyber power, it should make the joint cyber defense a cornerstone of plans for future development and strategic orientation. A unification of differing perceptions of the mission and each other's role within the cyber defense system is needed to establish a fully functioning integrated government capacity. A culture of shared responsibility must be inherent too.\nBased on the findings, it is also possible to make some recommendations for a proper working model of cooperation on cyber defense. It should be based on governmental level actions such as: regular joint cyber defense exercises at both technical and strategic level; operational situational awareness and intensive information sharing and exchange; clarifying the exact roles and responsibilities in the national (cyber) defense system and making cyber leaders from all relevant decision-makers and head of agencies. Especially the enlightened leaders can manage and drive their institution to become a better counterpart for cooperation."

The trend of escalating cyber maneuvers and the increasing prominence of cyber operations within the military is also apparent. It has already caused the development of offensive state cyber capabilities in many European and NATO countries. The modern warfare is currently shaped by new disruptive technologies and the militarization of cyberspace .\nThe visible product of the militarization is the cyberspace itself. It has officially become the next domain for warfighting according to NATO , placing it alongside the traditional battlegrounds of air, land, and sea. This means every state should be able to defend itself in cyberspace and move toward creating military effects in, through, and from cyberspace. However, cyberspace is very different military domain because it is the only domain created by a man and it is highly technical. Therefore, the cyberspace is heavily dependent on heterogeneous, typically civilian, players with different preferences. It is complex, hard to visualize, and constantly changing. Finally, the cyberspace is clearly a nongeographical domain, which also requires a shift of understanding for military commanders .\nDue to its unique nature, military and nonmilitary (civilian) spheres blur or erode more easily than in traditional (physical) domains. In a common national security and defense ecosystem, the roles of players such as an army, police, intelligence agency, and others are set clearly and there is an evident division of labor. Nevertheless, the cyberspace constantly changes the boundaries. Specific challenges, such as the problem of attribution and anonymity, or the asymmetric characteristics of cyberspace results in the current situation where nation states must ensure a close civil-military collaboration within a state to achieve and gain cyber power.\nOn the one hand, this strong need for coordinated civil-military inter-agency teamwork exists to protect the nation against serious cyber threats and produce cyber effects. On the other hand, there is also a deficiency of experience and practice with that on both sides, and sometimes even the willingness to cooperate lacks as these two worlds (military and civilian/nonmilitary) are quite different and somewhat isolated. A few state actors such as Netherlands or the Czech Republic have already noticed the issue. From the military perspective, the new Dutch strategic vision for defense released by Dutch Ministry of Defence (MvD, Ministerie van Defensie) focuses on their partners outside the military organization and is going to devote greater attention to the role and task of the military in this gray zone of “strategic competition” between war and peace . Next, the (civilian) national cyber security strategy of the Czech Republic for the years 2021--2025 created by their national cyber security authority\n(NUKIB, Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost) also calls for a common approach to cyber security and defense within the country and the improvement of the collaboration model and information sharing between military and nonmilitary actors .\nHence, this article intends to initiate and contribute to the discussion on civil-military interagency cooperation by considering possible factors that could spoil the establishing of an efficient integrated governmental framework for cyber defense. The article does not deal with the private sector or academia institutions such as universities nor think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It strictly focuses on the governmental interagency cooperation and response system and elaborates on factors that could affect or jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense between key state civilian (nonmilitary) and military entities, such as agencies responsible for CIIP (e.g. national Computer Security Incident Response Teams—CSIRTs), intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and departments of defense, including military cyber operations unit.\nOur main premise is that the ability of a nation state to gain cyber power leads through the efficient whole-of-government approach (so-called integrated government capability) as it is a crucial basis for achieving any power and control in cyberspace. Therefore, the article identifies the most significant barriers preventing this approach.\nResearchers are fully aware of the difficulty with the concept of cyber power, that systematic (empirical) analyses of the topic do not yet exist, and that the body of literature on cyber-power is small and fragmented. Hence, this article narrowly focuses only on the subset of the topic of cyber power and serves as another piece to the debate. It could also be a basis for further academic research or a source of inspiration for policy makers.\nData in this article are—with respect to the character of researched experts—valid mostly for the NATO countries. Recent development in this area is important from the global point of view. Firstly, due to the fact that NATO is the strongest military alliance in the contemporary world and it improves its cyber capabilities. Secondly, development in NATO countries can serve as a model for development in other parts of the world. And thirdly, recent trends in NATO have an indirect impact on the behavior of its adversaries in cyberspace.\n\n---\n\n## ## Conclusion: factors jeopardizing the development of integrated government capability identified\n\nThere are many ways how governments can gain, achieve and project cyber power. For example, Healey (2016) claims that still too much emphasis is currently placed on the success or failure of offensive and defensive capabilities, rather than other factors and on long-term national security outcomes. It is apparent that these capabilities are and will be very closely linked to the concept of cyber power, and that both policy (decision) makers and academics are interested in it for obvious reasons. Next, it is also possible to argue that an efficient cyber defense is the focal prerequisite for gaining and increasing power in cyberspace, since it is almost impossible to project power in cyberspace when the nation states have insufficient military power. However, this hard-cyber power approach to winning in cyberspace through military domination is plausibly short-sighted. Nation states should really aim to incorporate many other variables into their grand strategies and policies in cyberspace and use a holistic approach to the integrated government capacity to achieve cyber power. Therefore, this article focused on the identification of factors that could jeopardize integrated government capacity (or so-called whole of government approach) in cyber defense and more specifically the focus was narrowed down to the field of civil-military interagency cooperation within a nation state.\nResearch has demonstrated that in today's hyper-connected world, the traditional state practice just fades away. Global uncomfortable changes in warfare domains gradually force states to rethink many aspects of their military strategies and policies, including cyber defense. With cyber threats evolving into new, complex forms, the lack of fresh, modern solutions at the national level becomes a handicap and will make it difficult for the nation state to project its cyber power.\nWith the understanding of the extensiveness of the cyber issue and its dynamic nature, six critical areas have been identified where further consideration is needed. The area could strongly affect the establishment of\nintegrated government capacity or a strategic framework for cyber power in general.\nAccording to findings, the most important factors (for the lowest to highest impact) are:Idiosyncratic/Personality factors;Incompatible objectives;Structural barriers;Inexperience and lack of proven models;Competition for resources;Lack of guidance by political leaders.\nThe impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are apparent even in the world of cyber defense. According to practice, rationality is simply not always present. Subjective elements, such as human factors, could easily undermine the will and trust between agencies and make cooperation impossible. Hence, nation states should pay attention even to this factor which seems to be minor, but like everywhere else, it could grow into a big issue. On the other hand, the effect of the factor could be minimized through policy design in the cyber defense and security areas.\nNext, the incompatible objectives of each state agency could bring a lot of problems to the cooperation on cyber defense.

Recent development in this area is important from the global point of view. Firstly, due to the fact that NATO is the strongest military alliance in the contemporary world and it improves its cyber capabilities. Secondly, development in NATO countries can serve as a model for development in other parts of the world. And thirdly, recent trends in NATO have an indirect impact on the behavior of its adversaries in cyberspace.\n\n## Integrated government capability as an enabler for cyber power\n\nThe cyber is an instrument of national power and national states already use cyber means to advance their objectives (Willett, 2019, p. 86). The term “cyber power” has become common in security and strategy discourse (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 43) and it includes all forms of power in which",
    "power relations occur wholly or in part in or through cyberspace. However, cyber power is not created simply to exist, but rather to support other elements of national power—political, diplomatic, informational, military, and economic' (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 44).\n\nAccording to Klimburg (2011, p. 43), a nation's cyber power has three dimensions: (1) coordination of operational and policy aspects across governmental structures, (2) coherency of policy through international alliances and legal frameworks, and (3) cooperation of non-state cyber actors. In sum, this so-called Klimburg's Integrated capability model includes: Integrated government capability; Integrated systems capability; and Integrated national capability (Dunn Cavelty, 2018, p. 309). Klimburg claims that while the first two dimensions are important, the integrated national capability must be primarily reached because a major portion of a state's cyber capabilities lies outside direct government control. It is therefore essential to create this “whole-of-nation” cyber capability within a nation state.\n\nNevertheless, to follow this whole of nation approach is quite challenging for many nation states that are currently developing their cyber defensive and offensive capabilities. Hence, it is reasonable to argue with Klimburg that some nation states simply cannot create an efficient cooperation in cyberspace outside the government, while struggling with their own internal governmental part (so-called “whole-of-government” approach). For many of them, it is about the need to get the basics right first, which means to achieve the central coordination across governmental structures—integrated government capability. The ability of the government to deliver joint action which entails to attack and defend in cyberspace, to draft policy positions, and to share operational resources (Klimburg, 2011, pp. 173--174). In cyberspace, achieving this kind of coordination could be quite challenging for many nation states, because it includes the need for an efficient civil-military cooperation. A field that has been overlooked or marginalized for decades.\n\nThe issue of civil-military cooperation has already many aspects, specifics, and barriers in traditional operational domains, but in cyberspace, it has even more difficulties. To simply put, it could be hard to achieve efficient cooperation between military and nonmilitary organizations when governments are struggling at a strategic level to work out how to combine the capabilities of their armed forces with other instruments of national power (Inkster, 2017, p. 29). Even if the nation states and their specific civilian security (police, intelligence agencies and others) and military organizations could hold enough resources to theoretically gain cyber power, it is not entirely clear that they will have the ability to do it and perform efficient joint operations in cyberspace. For example, Bebber",
    "(2017, p. 427) mentions that there is a problem between a potential cyber power and a cyber effectiveness. Unlocking the power inherent in national capacities and different government actors to affect outcomes in the national interest is the key to cyber effectiveness and real cyber power (Betz & Stevens, 2011, p. 40). Thus, there is a difference between the available human and material resources and how they are utilized by the nation state to generate effects and support national political ends in and through cyberspace.\n\nFor nation states, it means to predominantly focus on joint cooperation on cyber defense, which is a multidisciplinary task that includes civilian and military state organization efforts. Only through the delivery of joint, defensive and offensive cyber operations and actions, the nation states could efficiently support their strategic security interests and achieve cyber power.\n\n## United by necessity: the militarization of cyberspace drives a need for civil—military cooperation on cyber defense\n\nAs Dunn Cavelty (2018, p. 309) points out, Klimburg's integrated capability model is consciously taking cyber power out of the context of projecting national interests coercively and adds a strong defensive cyber security element. Such a view highlights that cyber power and cyber security are intricately linked. However, Dunn Cavelty also adds that a true cyber power also needs to be able to “defend” against cyber threats. In today's view, it means to conduct cyber offensive and defensive military operations rather than a reactive and preventive approach embodied in cyber security. To simply put, there cannot be any true cyber power without a proper (civilian) cyber security and (military) cyber defense. These two environments must be inherently connected, and they must complement each other.\n\nEven though cyber security and cyber defense are dissimilar concepts and their definitions and theories often vary, they are still closely connected (Pačka, 2015). In this article, cyber security focuses on preventive and reactive measures in its nature, while the cyber defense could be more proactive and it allows to use military capacity and armed forces^{4}. Paraphrasing Clausewitz (1989), cyber defense could be the continuation of ensuring cyber security by other means, such as defensive and offensive cyber operations.\n\nNation states ensure their cyber security to improve the security and resilience of national infrastructures and services already for decades. Regarding the cyber defense, the governments all over the world has just started to build its capacity a few years ago. Specifically, they usually create",
    "rband new military cyber units and strive to defend the nation against the most serious cyber threats (Smeets). The issue of civil-military inter-agency cooperation on cyber defense is therefore relatively new. Not surprisingly, while there are numerous guidelines for cooperation between law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and national CSIRTs in cyber security (e.g. ENISA ; Pačka ; Skierka .), there is an insufficient practice and no handbook on cyber defense cooperation issue (Pačka), pp. 93--94).\n\nThe state practice could be quite challenging in that sense. There are factors such as the tendency of armies across the world to separate themselves from the rest of the nonmilitary security apparatus or the impossibility to ensure defense in cyberspace properly by a military actor alone by itself. In sum, synergy and cooperation with the rest of the national security actors who tackle cyber threats should be secured and exercised regularly. Given the fact that most of the cyberspace can be considered dual-use, it is simply difficult to separate the military and civilian realms (Droege), pp. 570, 576) and any harsh distinction simply does not work.\n\nAlthough, it is imminent that the segregation is present. It often rests on the assumption that the military and civilian agenda within the national security apparatus is distinct and should be kept distinct. According to Heinl, p. 38), this approach is caused historically. In the past, there was not a generally compelling need to engage civilian security authorities and agencies in military matters. Even large cyber attacks were usually not so significant to reach a threshold that would have activated the armed forces' response in previous years. Some authors (see Dunn Cavelty ; Wallace) persistently argued that the military role in cyberspace outside the context of armed conflict should be limited (Bigelow), p. 3), e.g. on the protection of military networks and information systems. Heinl contends that this was an understandable posture at that time. Even today, most cyber threats are directed against civilian (public or private) systems and networks and therefore have to be dealt (up to a certain threshold) by the targeted organizations themselves or by nonmilitary authorities responsible for cyber security or cyber crime (national CSIRTs, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies, if needed).\n\nFurthermore, the military's exact role and responsibilities in national cyber security or defense might remain vague from the institutional perspective. A long-term institutional practice within nation states supports this approach. When countries and its institutions usually define new roles and responsibilities of the armed forces or civilian authorities anywhere (including cyberspace), they look for analogies from the physical world and translate them as literally as possible. It means there could be a long-lasting consensus that armed forces should have a limited role in cyber crises",
    "outside of armed conflict (Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 72--73) and they want to just maintain the status quo, where military and civilian security or defense agencies are still somewhat isolated.\n\nNowadays, the debate has evolved significantly, especially due to increasing evidence of state or state-sponsored attacks on civilian cyberspace infrastructure (Bigelow, 2019, p. 3). The increased militarization of cyberspace is also an apparent trend these days (Gomez, 2016), and regular and irregular warfare are slowly losing their distinction due to the unique nature of cyberspace. Traditional norms of warfare, definitions of combatants and noncombatants, and even what constitutes military action or national casus belli are being turned upside down (TRADOC G-2, 2017, p. 20). It means the military role can simply no longer be limited to the traditional approach of engaging primarily in an armed conflict. It is particularly challenging to ensure national security and defense or even to wage a war without cooperation between military and nonmilitary (civilian) worlds these days. The cyber defense is about working with existing military, civilian, police, central and other structures, cooperation, and mixing missions of different actors with the same goal.\n\nHence, an advisable starting point for all nation states is to strive to set up an efficient cooperation between civilian authorities and agencies responsible for cyber security and armed forces with the mandate to conduct cyber defense operations. This cooperation framework should always start with the joint protection of those assets that are most essential for the country—critical (information) infrastructure. This is an especially important issue since civilian infrastructures are legitimate targets in case of serious cyber attacks or an armed conflict. And on the other hand, militaries as defenders of last resort for these infrastructures do not have the capacity to be familiar, let alone proficient, in the functioning of civilian networks (Tatar et al. 2017, p. 7).\n\n### CIIP as the core issue for cooperation\n\nCritical infrastructure protection (CIP) as a concept and practice was first explicitly articulated in the 1990s. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, CIP moved to the center of domestic security doctrine (Collier & Lakoff, 2008, p. 35), not only in the United States but also in other countries. Besides the physical protection of the critical infrastructure, cyber security has also become a significant issue in today's world. Cyber threats to the critical infrastructure emanate from a wide spectrum of prospective perpetrators: state-sponsored espionage and sabotage, international terrorism, domestic militants, malevolent hacktivists, or even disaffected insiders (Rudner, 2013, p. 453).",
    "The broadening of this concept has created a new term—critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP). As for the critical infrastructure, even a disruption of critical information infrastructure could result in human death, injuries, or physical damage and its threatening could have a debilitating effect on the security of a given nation, its economy, and the public's safety or health. CIIP is therefore generally acknowledged to be an indispensable component of national security policy (Suter, 2007, p. 1) and this ability to ensure CIIP is critical regarding the cyber power of the nation state.\n\nNevertheless, today's common practice is that civilian authorities are responsible for coordinating cyber security incident response within the critical infrastructure and armed forces are being used only as an instrument of last resort in an armed conflict. It is important to realize that the CIIP is already a part of the cyber defense and it needs to be supported by cross-organizational collaboration to be effective. It is a joint endeavor (Skopik et al. 2016, p. 157). According to Heinl (2016, p. 38), the military has the responsibility for national security, which presumably includes the defense of the most extreme cyber threats to critical infrastructure. This common thread (at least in Europe) of limiting the role of the military in cyber security response (Boecke et al. 2015, p. 73) therefore calls for a comprehensive approach to civil-military cooperation on both—the cyber security and defense to achieve integrated government capacity. However, the main issue is still that while the military has usually little or no role in the protection of critical infrastructure during peacetime, it would be an enormously challenging task, during, e.g, the war or other cyber-enabled conflict. Hence, ensuring the CIIP only when some major crisis occurs could put the military forces in an uncomfortable position.\n\nIt is proposed that the CIIP should be a vital kernel for the cooperation on cyber defense between relevant civilian (nonmilitary) and military agencies within a state security apparatus. There is an apparent need to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks from both sides because any of these attacks can have the potential to threaten the national security and stability. For example, given the special nature of cyberspace, it is usually hard to attribute the attacker or the source of the attack in real-time. Attribution of cyber attacks is simply not an easy task. There are technical issues which complicate identifying cyber attackers (Yannakogeorgos, 2013, p. 2). At the beginning of nearly all cyber attacks, the culprit is unknown, and it is always reasonable to comprehend that it can be a state, state-sponsored group, terrorist, an activist, or just some criminal actor. Therefore, governments must approach the response to each serious cyber attack targeting the critical information infrastructure very seriously.\n\nTherefore, a strong demand for mutual collaboration, cooperation, and information sharing among all relevant civilian and military spheres is",
    "#\n\nR. PACKA AND M. MARES\n\nTable 1. Political and organizational factors.\n\n|  Political factors | Organizational factors  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Incompatible objectives | Structural barriers  |\n|  Conflicting Definitions | Organizational Cultures  |\n|  Conflicting Theories | Organizational Independence  |\n|  Lack of guidance by political leaders | Competition for Resources  |\n|   | Inexperience and Lack of Proven Models  |\n|   | Idiosyncratic/Personality Factors  |\n\nlogical. As it is apparent also from this research, the practice of crisis response, joint operations, training, and exercises between state civilian and military agencies often lacks and there are still numerous factors that could affect or jeopardize this kind of cooperation in the future.\n\n# Factors possibly jeopardizing civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense\n\nMany factors could render the cooperation between a diverse spectrum of civilian and military agencies problematic. While cyber-specific factors that could jeopardize cooperation have not been identified yet, the focus is on general factors that influence civil-military cooperation (e.g., in conflict resolution) and might also apply to cyber defense. Specifically, the identified factors are inspired and based on the work of Olson and Gregorian (2007) and complemented by the literature review and analysis. Only factors that could suit the cyber realm have been picked and modified for research purposes. All factors are divided into two main categories—political and organizational—with the possibility to identify other factors during the research (Table 1).\n\n# Political factors\n\nThe first factor is called incompatible objectives. Despite the common objective to ensure national (cyber) security, each national actor (civilian or military) could hold differing, and sometimes, mutually contradictory policy goals (Olson &amp; Gregorian, 2007, p. 7). Given the fact that each national organization has a different role in the national (cyber) security and defense system, it is quite logical and there could be a small deviation. Nevertheless, the ensuring of national security begins internally with all responsible national actors and their interagency cooperation. In an increasingly complex, multi-dimensional policy world, therefore the government must promote cooperation rather than competition among the various stakeholders (Whittaker et al., 2010, p. 32). If policy goals are excessively incompatible, it could result in conflict or friction among national organizations.",
    "The second factor stands for conflicting definitions. Even different definitions could jeopardize cooperation. Many authors (see Futter, 2018, p. 201; Galinec et al. 2017, p. 274) state, little consensus exists about what the term ‘cyber' includes, refers to, or how it is being used. Regarding the terms of cyber security and cyber defense, the situation is similar. Since there are no ‘one-fits-all' definitions, there could be disputes between national actors about the nature or scope or meaning of the terms. These differing definitions could then lead to differing approaches on how to achieve efficient cyber defense and lead to a decrease in cooperation efficiency.\n\nConflicting theories could also endanger cooperation. Civilian and military institutions could have trouble coordinating at the operational, tactical, or strategic level, or even agreeing on an analysis of the problem, often because they are guided by radically different theories or assumptions about what causes problems or crises and how it can be resolved (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 9). This conceptual problem is closely related to the previous factor and contains conflicting theories on how to effectively ensure national cyber security and defense. It may cover a lot of issues, such as a discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in CIIP. While some institutions (e.g. national CSIRTs) strive to patch it immediately to secure the system, others (such as intelligence agencies, law enforcement units, and others) attempt to exploit it and use it against the attacker (see Boecke et al. 2015, pp. 74--75; Pačka, 2019, pp. 71--74).\n\nThe last political factor represents a lack of political guidance, because the successes of each institution alone guarantee nothing in a large-scale national cyber crisis. Lack of political guidance, willpower, and support at the governmental level cannot be simply substituted. Already in 2014, Lewis (2014, p. 566) stated that whether the cyber issue reaches the top level of political leadership depends on factors such as personal interest, a direct experience of malicious cyber action, media attention or the salience of cybersecurity on their national and international agendas. Even the cyber agenda became very political in recent years, factors such as the depth of knowledge about the problem could be still an issue for politicians and other leaders. Lehto and Limnéll (2020, pp. 139, 146) therefore suggests that streamlining and strengthening strategic leadership are key aspects in making sure the cyber vision is achieved. The strong cyber leadership also prevent state agencies from operating solely in their siloes and based only on their objectives and needs. Hence, the lack of political guidance may result in many problems with the coordination. For example, insufficient resources, duplication of activities, uncertain rules of engagement in cyberspace, absence of ‘referees' to resolve competing positions, and unclear national law or jurisdictional boundaries between civilian and military",
    "institutions. Despite NATO officially recognizes cyberspace as the domain of warfare, it could still be a serious concern in many NATO countries. For example, according to the statement of retired Gen. Keith Alexander, even the United States (the pioneer of cyber warfare) still lacked “clear rules of engagement” for conducting offensive cyber operations three years ago (Lyngaas, 2018). Hence, the lack of political guidance represents another factor that could negatively influence civil-military cooperation.\n\n### Organizational factors\n\nStructural barriers could be a strong organizational factor since rigid organizational structures represent a big obstacle to any kind of cooperation. Bureaucratic and daily operational constraints tend to stifle cooperation or any innovation and favor the status quo (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 11). In cyber realm, we could say that generally in smaller countries organizations tend to be less hierarchical and rigid. As people know each other personally, they tend to trust others more than in impersonal interactions, and greater flexibility enables them to share information swiftly. However, even in these smaller countries some barriers between civilian and military organizations naturally persists (Pernik & Tuohy, 2014, p. 4, 6). Hence, the factor could have a serious impact on civil-military cooperation in cyberspace as well.\n\nNext, organizational culture is a recognized term that describes unwritten norms, rules, and customs in an establishment. The literature suggests (see Arnaud & Tinoco, 2013, p. 37) that organizational culture differs between industries as well as professions. The civilian and military culture is no exception and may cause friction within the national interagency cooperation. There is a general tendency among all organizations and sometimes even across units within the same organization to adopt substantially different planning and implementation terminology or to describe different processes and outcomes even when employing the same terminology (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 11). On the other hand, cultural interoperability among organizations stems from interagency understanding, trust, and confidence that require close and ongoing training, liaisons, and exchanges (Pernik & Tuohy, 2014, p. 3). Different organizational cultures could simply represent an important factor in the issue of civil-military cooperation. Moreover, the lack of knowledge about one another's organizational identity in the meaning of traditions, culture, images, and fundamental goals are represented in this factor.\n\nEven organizational independence could be for certain (civilian or military) organizations a higher priority than coordination with other organizations as they are not prepared to follow the lead of another organization (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 13). Some institutions could see cooperation",
    "as a fundamental threat to their operational flexibility. While cooperation is perceived as the key to cyber security and defense, the factor of preferring independence to cooperation could be an essential one.\n\nAs a significant factor appears also a competition for resources. State organizations such as ministries might not cooperate especially when there is a political system with strong line ministries, departmentalization, and silo arrangements. Coordination is therefore often limited to minimal coordination (Christensen et al. 2015) and sometimes it could also lead to competition. The competition could be about different resources such as status, power, recognition, financial resources and influence (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 14). It is worth to mention that all state organizations are fully aware of cyber security and defense being one of the fastest growing fields today. It means there is still a space to set new standards, define new roles, and deliver new tasks. In this regard, some of them could also compete to take over some responsibilities from other agencies. This unhealthy competition might also result in not sharing of responsibility, agenda, or information and intelligence about cyber threats with other partners within the state.\n\nWhile abundant state practice in conventional warfare exists, cyber defense is a relatively new and very specific area in which a lack of proven models and inexperience is often apparent. Difficulties arise when both civilian and military institutions are stretched beyond their traditional areas of expertise (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 15), such as traditional warfighting, intelligence gathering, law-enforcing, or CIP. In the field of cyber defense, lack of best practices and guidelines (see Pačka, 2019, pp. 93--94) might lead to many wrong strategic decisions and choosing a flawed attitude toward cooperation.\n\nFinally, idiosyncratic or personality factors could play a key role in cyber defense cooperation. Some states might rely heavily on individuals with considerable power and specific attitudes. Stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are not uncommon within and across organizations. Sometimes the willingness to cooperate arises from personal likes or dislikes (Olson & Gregorian, 2007, p. 16). This unprofessional behavior might lead to a decrease or cooperation between state organizations.\n\n## Scope and method\n\nThe article deals with the topic of cyber power that could nation states achieve through the development of integrated government capacity. The empirical part of the research focuses on one of the main problems in today's whole of government approach in cyberspace—the issue of the cooperation between civilian and military institutions on cyber defense. It is focused particularly on central government departments, agencies, and",
    "other civilian or military state institutions that are predominantly involved in ensuring cyber defense. Whole of nation approach that includes society, private sector companies, NGOs, or academia is not the focus of the study, but it is considered as the next step in achieving cyber power.\n\nNamely, the study focuses on the dynamics between: the civilian entities responsible for CIIP (e.g. agencies that usually operate so-called national CSIRTs),law enforcement units,military and civilian intelligence agenciesand departments of defense, including the army and special cyber command units.\n\nThe research has a mixed design, which includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. To measure all the factors, the researchers use quantitative data from surveys (see below) and then they use qualitative data from interviews that provide rich descriptions of the phenomena and generate new premises. An approach is primarily inductive (Corbin & Strauss, 2008), which means the research moves from the specific experiences and practice of respondents to the general to explain the phenomena and identify major challenges in civil-military interagency cooperation on cyber defense within a state.\n\nThe methods of data collection are document analysis, in-depth semi-structured interviews, and surveys. Getting the right participants is critical to the success of the research and simultaneously it constitutes the main limitation of the study. The willingness to participate and the consent of all participants have not been an issue since the confidentiality is ensured and outcomes are sanitized. However, it turned out that there is only a limited number of experts and practitioners who deals with this specific topic and could have been reached by researchers at the same time. Therefore, the researchers focus on a smaller amount of participants but did a more detailed interviews. It also means that participants were purposively selected by the judgment of the researchers because sampling for proportionality is not the concern of this research (Morse, 2007). Only participants who could have offered valuable insight and high-quality answers into the topic were selected. Respondent-driven sampling (also known as snowball sampling) has also been used to involve more experts and practitioners from the civilian and military spheres in the research. All respondents came from NATO countries as this research is relevant mainly for the transatlantic area. At the time of this research these participants were serving in the military, working for intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies, CSIRTs or relevant ministries. Some of them were also experts",

The data collection period ran during the years 2019 and mid-2020. The semistructured interviews have been conducted online or face to face and the surveys have been completed in the same way.\n\nThe empirical research was to address the following question:\n\nWhat factors could significantly jeopardize civil-military interagency cooperation toward cyber defense within a nation-state?\n\nBased on the literature review and an analysis of the authors, ten factors of political and organizational nature that could have a strong influence on civil-military cooperation have been identified and then discussed with the respondents during the interviews and surveys. All respondents waged and deliberated each factor, shared their personal views on how important and relevant each factor is, and highlighted it on the impact scale (negligible—low—moderate—high—extreme). Finally, they had an option to add further factors or categories (Table 2).\n\nBased on these findings, factors with the highest impact (scoring moderate—high to extreme) on civil-military cooperation in cyber defense were recognized and highlighted. Finally, these findings also shed light and form a discussion on the second question:\n\nHow nation states could gain cyber power through the integrated government capacity?\n\nConducting this research will help states and their institutions to make better decisions about their approach to cooperation on cyber defense. It could also serve as a basis for future academic research and debate.\n\n## Findings\n\nAccording to 13 interviews and surveys with experts and practitioners from civilian and military agencies related to cyber defense, the most significant factors jeopardizing the cooperation on cyber defense are as follows (see Table 3). The findings confirm the necessity of the factors we identified and generate new premises that deserve further attention.\n\n## Political factors\n\n### Incompatible objectives (impact: moderate—high)\n\nMost of the respondents scored this factor as essential and claim that all national institutions or agencies must understand that the state has one",

The root cause of the problem here might not necessarily be related to cyber security and defense but rather to the ability and recognition of these topics being a cross-government issue. Building on that, it also turns out that the objectives may not necessarily be incompatible in some cases, but their priorities may differ. It means the cooperation in this area is for some institutions simply not nearly as important as for others.\n\nNext, some respondents directly highlighted particularly the contrast between the military intelligence (as part of both the military and intelligence community) and cyber security community (national CSIRTs). They added that the problem might lie in the natural isolationist approach of intelligence agencies in general. Moreover, they stated that this approach is not relevant only to civil-military cooperation. It is sometimes relevant even to military and intel-military cooperation, i.e., between military intelligence agencies and the \"green army.\"\n\n# Conflicting definitions (impact: low—moderate)\n\nThis factor has almost the lowest score among respondents. Respondents had claimed that the challenge could be easily overcome by combined training and joint cyber exercises and operations. Promoting dialogue and open discussion among the civilian and military community may also solve this problem. Some of the respondents added that conflicting definitions affect primarily policymakers, not (civilian or military) cyber practitioners (at the operational level). In reality, they should figure out these differences fast, adapt to them, and then cooperate effectively.\n\nIt means it is less of an issue. The lack of definitions should not hinder progress or cooperation. The aphorism \"Perfect is the enemy of good\" has also been used in the interviews. Those differing views might be useful and (if properly managed) contribute to a constructive and more sustainable consensus between organizations.",
    "In sum, it seems that a lack of convergence between terminologies used by civilian and military actors does not represent an additional barrier to civil-military cooperation.\n\n### Conflicting theories (impact: moderate)\n\nThe factor of conflicting theories has a moderate impact and similar answers as the previous one. Some of the respondents do not perceive it as an immense problem that requires extensional attention at the national level. At a higher level of crisis (i.e. state of emergency), there should be clear national response structures and procedures that can be activated. Below that, although, there may be disagreement and discussion on “who owns the problem” and thus how to coordinate appropriately the full set of resources. However, the most important is to have a common and shared purpose according to respondents. Conflicting theories may have an impact, but well-developed professionals should be able to reach a consensus.\n\nRespondents also said it is a common feature of the state itself and it is linked to the factor of incompatible objectives. Each actor within the state security system has a slightly different goal and could be guided by different theories or assumptions. Moreover, certain areas of cyber security and defense such as vulnerability weaponizing will always be disputable and it is not necessarily just a civilian-military problem, but also intelligence vs. defensive mandate agencies; or intelligence agencies and law enforcement vs. national CSIRTs.\n\n### Lack of political guidance (impact: high—extreme)\n\nThe lack of political guidance and unclear laws in cyber defense is the most critical factor in the research. Most participants agreed that there cannot be any effective action and unity of effort without a clear high-level political guidance supported by an appropriate legal framework and adequate oversight. In states where this situation occurs, it is the root cause of the problem of friction between the civilian and military spheres. Without clear roles and responsibilities and overall strategic guidance, different actors (civilian or military) have less ability to execute in complementary manners.\n\nNevertheless, some of the military practitioners also pointed out that the factor is relevant especially during peacetime. In times of war or other conflicts, in which armed forces are empowered to perform actions that they would normally not be permitted to do, the impact of this factor would be reduced. In these cases, there is no time or need for extensive political guidance or strict compliance with the national law. Armed forces have",
    "clear procedures to deal with such situations and they are ready to cooperate closely even with civilian security organizations and others.\n\n### Organizational factors\n\n### Structural barriers (impact: moderate—high)\n\nThis factor seems to be significant. According to some respondents, bureaucracy and operational constraints can make especially the initial cooperation hard. However, once organizational relationships are built, it is much easier to deepen them. In contrast, many others remain in favor of maintaining the status quo. Especially those whom the main responsibility is different than cyber, might still impede cooperation, as they don't see priority in cyber and don't want to innovate. In some states, the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative “from the bottom” (from the operational level). Some military practitioners have also highlighted the problem of horizontal vs. vertical cooperation in the armed forces. They have apparently the necessary internal procedures to cooperate effectively among military units of all kinds (both vertically and horizontally) in place. However, regarding the horizontal cooperation outside the military world, the military often lacks adequate procedures and processes on how to cooperate swiftly and effectively with civilian (nonmilitary) organizations.\n\n### Organizational cultures (impact: low—moderate)\n\nSurprisingly, different organizational cultures are perceived by the respondents as the least relevant factor. Only a minority of respondents feel the differences between military and civilian culture as a big obstacle for cooperation. Most of them reported that cultures nowadays can be respected, and they can be learned. Furthermore, all these differences could be more beneficial than restraining. Mutual knowledge is a matter of communication and cooperation, and both worlds would and probably could improve their organization using gained knowledge and experience from its counterparts.\n\nBoth experts and practitioners from civilian and military spheres agreed that this challenge can be overcome easily by simply working more together. Next, since it is still relatively rare to see specific career paths for military cyber operators, many on active duty will leave and join the industry and civilian public sector, which does serve to increase the understanding of each other's culture, organizational identity, and so on. Even though different cultures exist, the far bigger factor is apparently overall policy differences rather than cultural differences.",
    "Organizational independence (impact: moderate)\n\nIndependence as a higher priority than cooperation is also not seen as an essential factor. Almost all respondents agreed that in most cases, this is not an issue. Although, few of them mentioned the problem of the isolationistic approach of intelligence agencies again. They also shared some of their personal experiences that underpin the presumption of some agencies to prefer independence and operational flexibility to cooperation in (both civilian and military) intelligence agencies.\n\n### Competition for resources (impact: high)\n\nAnother high scoring factor is competition for financial resources, status, power, recognition, and influence. Nearly all respondents saw the factor as a relevant barrier and almost all of them ranked the impact as “high.” The competition for resources is an issue especially in an environment where the national roles and responsibilities in cyber security and defense are still not clarified properly. It leads to the situation in which every institution is trying to get a piece of the cyber agenda for itself. This competition could jeopardize the cooperation a lot. Some respondents have also stated that it is mainly a matter of a strategic (not operational) level of cooperation between institutions and the problem is not exclusive to civilian and military cooperation again.\n\n### Inexperience and lack of proven models (impact: moderate—high)\n\nThe lack of proven models and inexperience seems to be a very relevant factor in the cyber security and defense area. It is no wonder since it is still a relatively new area for both civilian and military institutions. Some respondents even called the current situation as a startup era of cyber defense. Especially for more rigid military institutions, it could have an extremely negative impact until the necessary practice and experience are gained. According to some, one of the main obstacles in this issue could be also a lack of general cyber awareness and education of “non-specialists” and leaders at all levels. The major problem with cyber defense for a “nonspecialist” is that it's hard to visualize. The way to overcome this could be, e.g. cyber security exercises, tailored especially for high-level management. Finally, respondents see this factor as a great opportunity to start a discussion among all civilian and military institutions. It could be the motivation for some states to create an effective national system of cyber defense from scratch.\n\n### Idiosyncratic/personality factors (impact: moderate—high)\n\nThe last factor has a moderate to high impact. The human factor in collaboration on cyber defense is apparently as important as everywhere else. Although cyberspace is a technology-driven world, people are still at the",
    "core of it and they are vulnerable to idiosyncratic disputes. Not surprisingly, those respondents who had a real-life experience with it had scored higher than those without it. Some of them have also added that this factor is especially important in the phase of initiation and establishment of cooperation between entities. On the other hand, given the bureaucracy and the way how state institutions work, this effect might be marginalized in the long term. It means that the impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes can be minimized over policy design in the cyber defense and related security areas.\n\n## Conclusion: factors jeopardizing the development of integrated government capability identified\n\nThere are many ways how governments can gain, achieve and project cyber power. For example, Healey (2016) claims that still too much emphasis is currently placed on the success or failure of offensive and defensive capabilities, rather than other factors and on long-term national security outcomes. It is apparent that these capabilities are and will be very closely linked to the concept of cyber power, and that both policy (decision) makers and academics are interested in it for obvious reasons. Next, it is also possible to argue that an efficient cyber defense is the focal prerequisite for gaining and increasing power in cyberspace, since it is almost impossible to project power in cyberspace when the nation states have insufficient military power. However, this hard-cyber power approach to winning in cyberspace through military domination is plausibly short-sighted. Nation states should really aim to incorporate many other variables into their grand strategies and policies in cyberspace and use a holistic approach to the integrated government capacity to achieve cyber power. Therefore, this article focused on the identification of factors that could jeopardize integrated government capacity (or so-called whole of government approach) in cyber defense and more specifically the focus was narrowed down to the field of civil-military interagency cooperation within a nation state.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that in today's hyper-connected world, the traditional state practice just fades away. Global uncomfortable changes in warfare domains gradually force states to rethink many aspects of their military strategies and policies, including cyber defense. With cyber threats evolving into new, complex forms, the lack of fresh, modern solutions at the national level becomes a handicap and will make it difficult for the nation state to project its cyber power.\n\nWith the understanding of the extensiveness of the cyber issue and its dynamic nature, six critical areas have been identified where further consideration is needed. The area could strongly affect the establishment of",
    "integrated government capacity or a strategic framework for cyber power in general.\n\nAccording to findings, the most important factors (for the lowest to highest impact) are:Idiosyncratic/Personality factors;Incompatible objectives;Structural barriers;Inexperience and lack of proven models;Competition for resources;Lack of guidance by political leaders.\n\nThe impact of personal likes or dislikes together with stereotyping and uncooperative attitudes are apparent even in the world of cyber defense. According to practice, rationality is simply not always present. Subjective elements, such as human factors, could easily undermine the will and trust between agencies and make cooperation impossible. Hence, nation states should pay attention even to this factor which seems to be minor, but like everywhere else, it could grow into a big issue. On the other hand, the effect of the factor could be minimized through policy design in the cyber defense and security areas.\n\nNext, the incompatible objectives of each state agency could bring a lot of problems to the cooperation on cyber defense. Cyberspace itself is a cross-cutting domain and ensuring cyber defense means to deal with a cross-government issue. There is still a lack of common understanding among decision-makers or chiefs of relevant agencies and departments that the issue is a national topic, nor the responsibility of one or a few agencies in the state. A consensus on cyber defense should be reached across military and nonmilitary institutions and joint prioritization should be done as well on the governmental level. Especially, the intelligence agencies should be more open to cooperation with other relevant actors and leave their traditional isolationist approach within the state security apparatus.\n\nStructural barriers to cooperation, such as bureaucracy and operational constraints, can make cooperation hard as well. Maintaining the status quo and a lack of willingness to change the agenda or perform new activities and tasks is another issue that could easily jeopardize the cooperation on cyber defense. These barriers are also seen as hardly removable as the culture of overcentralized control leaves little space for initiative. Decisions should come from the top in this regard. It is primarily a military issue and the army's way of conducting business. The problem of facilitating horizontal cooperation outside the military world is evident and should be overcome to ensure cyber defense more effectively and on time.",
    "Lack of experience and shortage of best practice is an unsurprisingly an essential factor that could negatively impact the cooperation on cyber defense. It could be an enormous problem especially for the more rigid military, but in contrast, it could be a great opportunity to approach the challenge and establish a new and effectively functioning system of cyber defense cooperation between civilians and military spheres.\n\nIt is also perceived from the practice that state agencies or ministries are not an exception regarding power and budget struggles. With countries focusing on the new challenges posed by cyber threats and developing their capabilities to tackle them, there is also a new opportunity to gain more political power or financial resources from the state budget. These struggles are not exclusive to civilian and military dichotomy; however, they could easily result in a rivalry between state agencies. It is not perhaps exclusive to cyber security and defense only but could be happening in other trending agendas such as hybrid warfare or space security.\n\nThe most significant challenge in bridging the obvious gap between civilian and military actors seems to be the lack of political direction and a clear vision on cyber matters from political leaders. It is sometimes a result of scattering the national responsibility for cyber defense among too many civilian and military institutions, together with the lack of enlightened politicians eager to lead in cyber defense effectively. The main issue here could be that leaders must meticulously review all existing policies in the context of cyber defense to ensure cyber defense properly.\n\nFinally, a lot of respondents also mentioned the importance of the legal and ethical aspects of this kind of cooperation. Legal elements complement political and organizational factors and they are also implied within them to some extent. Cyber defense as a mechanism of responding to the sheer scale of cyber threats is not just a technical discipline, it is linked to a vast range of legal and ethical issues. Therefore, the cyber defense principles, measures, and responsibilities of each actor must be enshrined in the law to protect society from abuses of power and guarantee citizens their rights and freedoms. However, besides that, it also helps to set clear responsibilities of official authorities dealing with cyber defense and it provides a solid ground for the cooperation. In contrast, the lack of relevant legislation or legal vagueness makes setbacks for any kind of cooperation.\n\nAll these factors could seriously jeopardize the unity of effort at the governmental level and overall cooperation in cyber defense. Therefore, nation states should continuously review their system of collaboration among relevant state military nonmilitary actors and focus on these sets of factors. In practice, it is obvious that all negative factors could be overcome or prevented only when a clear vision and leadership eclipse the self-interest of agencies. States and their decision-makers should approach cyber defense",
    "as a new agenda where creating a symbiotic relationship across both civilian and military agencies is necessary. The classic distinctions between military and civilian worlds are simply less clear-cut in cyber defense. If the nation state has an ambition to gain and project cyber power, it should make the joint cyber defense a cornerstone of plans for future development and strategic orientation. A unification of differing perceptions of the mission and each other's role within the cyber defense system is needed to establish a fully functioning integrated government capacity. A culture of shared responsibility must be inherent too.\n\nBased on the findings, it is also possible to make some recommendations for a proper working model of cooperation on cyber defense. It should be based on governmental level actions such as: regular joint cyber defense exercises at both technical and strategic level; operational situational awareness and intensive information sharing and exchange; clarifying the exact roles and responsibilities in the national (cyber) defense system and making cyber leaders from all relevant decision-makers and head of agencies. Especially the enlightened leaders can manage and drive their institution to become a better counterpart for cooperation.\n\n## Notes\n\nCyber operations enabled Russia to interfere in the United States' 2016 elections, China to steal blueprints for the United States' F-35 fighters, and the United States to disrupt Iran's nuclear program (DeVore & Lee, 2017, pp. 40--41).NATO is a political and military alliance, whose essential and enduring purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means. Collective defense is at the heart of the Alliance and creates a spirit of solidarity and cohesion among its members. NATO also embodies the transatlantic link by which the security of North America is tied to that of Europe's. It is an intergovernmental organization that provides a forum where members can consult on any issue they may choose to raise and take decisions on political and military matters affecting their security (NATO, 2021).In this study, the term „civil “means all government nonmilitary security institutions and agencies including law enforcement and intelligence agencies.National CSIRTs (Computer Security Incident Response Teams) have the responsibility to act as the national point of contact for domestic incident response stakeholders and for other CSIRTs around the world. National CSIRTs help coordinate incident response at the national and international levels (Skierka et al. 2015, p. 8).",

It reviews the civil-military interagency cooperation and aims to identify factors that could jeopardize it. First, it provides a theoretical background for the research and then according to interviews and surveys, the factors with the highest negative impact are recognized. Based on this research, the most significant challenges in bridging the gap between civilian and military worlds seems to be power and budget struggles and a lack of political direction on cyber matters from leaders.",
