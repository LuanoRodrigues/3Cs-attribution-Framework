The article adopts a multidisciplinary approach, integrating legal theory, international relations, and cyber law to analyze how digital security issues intersect with global economic transactions. Utilizing doctrinal legal analysis, the article delves into international treaties, case law, and policy documents, while a comparative method highlights variances and similarities across jurisdictions. The article identifies significant gaps in existing international legal frameworks that are ill-equipped to address the complexities and nuances of the digital age. It advocates for comprehensive legal reforms, encompassing cyber warfare, digital trade, and cross-border investments. The objective is to align international law with the digital era's realities, effectively balancing national security, economic growth, and individual rights in a globally interconnected environment. This article not only uncovers critical shortcomings in current legal structures but also proposes forward-looking legal strategies, essential for tackling emerging challenges at the cybersecurity, trade, and investment nexus. These strategies chart a course towards a more resilient and adaptive international legal system, equipped to address the multifaceted issues arising from the digital era's convergence.\n\nPublished with license by Koninklijke Brill BV | DOI:10.1163/22119000-12340327\n\n© XU QIAN, 2024 | ISSN: 1660-7112 (print) 2211-9000 (online)",

Furthermore, an act of this magnitude could also be conducted by the State or an independent criminal.⁶ Cyberattacks can be analyzed through four primary criteria. Firstly, they possess the capacity to manipulate, destroy, or exfiltrate data, rendering them inherently disruptive and unpredictable. Their origin may be domestic or foreign, introducing complexities in attribution. Secondly, the nature of the perpetrator varies, ranging from individual criminals to organized groups or entities. Thirdly, the impact of cyberattacks is predominantly virtual, encompassing data loss or manipulation, which significantly diminishes the affected data’s commercial value. Moreover, attacks on critical infrastructure can precipitate severe disruptions to essential services. Lastly, the attribution of cyberattacks to state actors presents challenges, necessitating substantial evidence to establish\n\n⁴ IBM Services, ‘What is a Cyber-attack?’ (IBM, 11 November 2020) <www.ibm.com by-services=\"\" business-continuity=\"\" cyberattack#:~:text=\"The%20most%20well%2Dknown%20type,malware%20may%20not%20be%20immediate\" in-en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.

There are several definitions produced by scholars, research organizations, and private enterprises. However, there is a need for a uniform/consensual legal definition to the term cyberattacks. Two definitions are frequently cited. The National Institute of Standards and Technology–Computer Security Resource Center: defines cyberattack as ‘[a]n attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information’. Secondly, the National Research Council’s Committee on Offensive Information Warfare defines cyber-attacks as ‘[e]fforts to alter, disrupt, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information or programs on them’.

Key issues include the lack of consensus on the required standards of proof, the debate over whether attributions should be made publicly or kept confidential, and the ambiguity surrounding the legal consequences of successful attribution. Additionally, while public attributions can serve purposes such as deterring future attacks and holding perpetrators accountable, they may also escalate tensions and risk revealing sensitive intelligence sources.[10] There might be a notable loss of information or reduction in its value which could pose significant threats to the economy and national security.[11] Due to their inherent characteristics, cyberattacks present a global challenge.

Consequently, there is burgeoning discourse surrounding the development of a cybersecurity treaty, paralleling established frameworks for managing other forms of strategic risk. However, crafting effective agreements necessitates a nuanced understanding of cyber incident typologies and their respective implications.

Its conceptual framework illuminates the potential interpretation and development of international legal norms, compares distinct yet interconnected areas, and explores the broader geopolitical dimensions of this global challenge. By analyzing fundamental principles of international law – such as state sovereignty, the use of force, and state responsibility – within the context of cyber operations, the article raises critical questions about their applicability to emerging cyber realities. Furthermore, it employs comparative legal analysis to draw parallels between legal frameworks governing nuclear non-proliferation and potential cybersecurity frameworks, highlighting the importance of adapting existing legal mechanisms to address new challenges.

While clarity within general international law remains scarce, valuable insights can be gleaned from existing legal frameworks in international economic realms, such as international trade and investment law. The emergence of the cyber realm has introduced contemporary issues that challenge established norms and rules of international law, necessitating examination in terms of interpretation, application, and structure. Cyberattacks transcend mere technological phenomena, fundamentally reshaping traditional societal paradigms including concepts of capital[17] and warfare.[18] The article probes the adequacy of existing international legal and economic rules in defining cyberattacks and delineating breaches of established norms. It critically examines the efficacy of international law in regulating cyberattacks, recognizing the inherent complexities in defining and addressing such incidents. The article offers a nuanced definition of cyberattacks, recognizing their intricate nature that defies simple conceptualization. It contends that cyberattacks represent a modern manifestation of acts of war, a concept deeply rooted in international legal discourse spanning millennia. Exploring potential solutions, the article investigates the role of international economic law in mitigating cyber threats, particularly in safeguarding global data flows integral to contemporary globalization processes. Moreover, it delves into the potential applicability of investment treaties in regulating digital assets and scrutinizes existing parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation.[19] By examining how nuclear non-proliferation treaties serve as a precedent, the article explores the feasibility of developing a comprehensive set of international rules to govern cyberattacks, thereby addressing critical gaps in current regulatory frameworks.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333",

Its effect on the economy cannot be ignored, especially in the case of the United States where approximately 90% of critical infrastructure is possessed by the private sector, and companies do not see any specific reason for investing in cybersecurity to secure public interest.²⁴ By refusing to invest in cybersecurity, the private sector increases the exposure of the whole economy and society to cyber threats.

This omission underscores a critical gap, especially as the digital realm continues to be a significant frontier for both commerce and potential conflict.³⁶ The degree of digitization of economic activities is generally linked to the tendency of experiencing cyberattacks. A recent measure by the Indian government is the 'Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)' project. The process involves a biometric ID that assigns to each individual, a 12-digit number. It further requires, storing 10 fingerprints, iris scans and other necessary details such as names, addresses and date of birth to be recorded in the eGovernance cloud platform. Consequently, the practice involves an increased cybersecurity concern among the individuals, private organisations and the government agencies.

Projections by Cybersecurity Ventures suggest a dramatic rise in global cybercrime costs, with estimates indicating a potential annual total of USD 10.5 trillion by 2025, marking a considerable increase from USD 3 trillion in 2015.³⁸ These figures underscore the immense economic impact of cybercrime, surpassing damages caused by natural disasters and even exceeding the collective value of significant illegal drug trades worldwide. Such crimes represent a substantial economic transfer globally, impeding innovation and investment.³⁹ While no sector is immune to cyber threats, the financial services industry stands out as particularly vulnerable. The 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report highlights financial organizations⁴⁰ as the most heavily targeted sector, followed by healthcare and public administration, respectively.⁴¹\n\nThere has been no global consensus on the definition of cybersecurity. However, it has been defined by the International Telecommunication Union as 'a set of tools, policies, safeguards, and technologies that can protect the cyber environment and the assets of an organization or user.'⁴² Cybersecurity, therefore, seeks to protect and maintain the digital assets security of the organization or the user against the risks involved in the cyber environment. The approach offered by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) presents an intriguing perspective on cyberattacks. NIST's framework does not differentiate between state-sponsored actions and criminal activities, nor does it consider the distinct impact of cyber incidents on public versus private records, networks, and facilities. While prioritizing the integrity of information and information networks, NIST's framework fails to encompass broader societal goals such as national market growth, law enforcement access\n\n³⁸ Steve Morgan, 'Cybercrime to Cost the World $10.5 Trillion Annually By 2025' (Cybercrime Magazine, 13 November 2020) <https: cybersecurityventures.com=\"\" hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n\n³⁹ Brian Cashell and others, 'The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attack' (United States Congressional Research Service, 1 April 2004) <https: ras.org=\"\" rl32331.pdf=\"\" sgp=\"\" crs=\"\" misc=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n\n⁴⁰ Kenning Arlitsch and Adam Edelman, 'Staying Safe: Cyber Security for People and Organizations' (2014) 54 J Libr Admin 46.\n\n⁴¹ '2020 Data Breach Investigation Report' (Verizon, 2020) <https: 2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf=\"\" enterprise.verizon.com=\"\" resources=\"\" reports=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023; the Public Administration sector manages with the administration of local, state and federal government.\n\n⁴² International Telecommunication Union, 'Overview of Cybersecurity: Recommendation ITU-T X.1205' (ITU-T, 4 August 2008) <https: rec=\"\" t-rec-x.1205-200804-i=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:>",

Consequently, the definition outlined by NIST primarily focuses on unauthorized use and confidentiality concerns but lacks clarity in distinguishing between state-driven actions and criminal activities.\n\nAn alternative legal definition proposed by the United States National Research Council defines cyberattacks as purposeful actions aimed at altering, disrupting, deceiving, degrading, or destroying computer systems, networks, or the information and programs within them.43 While this definition offers rationality, it also highlights ambiguity, particularly in differentiating between basic cybercrimes and cyberattacks. This lack of clarity may lead to inconsistencies within the legal framework, hindering effective coordination among agencies.\n\n## 2.2 International Responses and Legal Implications\n\nThe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has introduced the Cyber Norms Index to monitor and compare significant achievements in negotiating and establishing norms for governmental actions in cyberspace.

The global cybersecurity landscape is fraught with concerns regarding the likelihood of financial losses, misappropriation of classified data, and disruptions to critical infrastructure.

Historically, such acts encompassed a wide range of actions, including unfriendly economic or commercial measures and actions that insulted a nation's pride.⁷⁰ However, rapid technological advancements have challenged this traditional concept, rendering established legal categories inadequate to regulate contemporary activities.⁷¹\n\nIn the context of cyberspace, clarifying the concept of *casus belli* serves to provide a clear standard against which states can assess their behavior and that of others when initiating or responding to cyberattacks.⁷² Traditional theories of *casus belli*, often emphasizing the violent and aggressive nature of armed operations, may not directly apply to cyberattacks due to their non-physical nature. Nevertheless, cyberattacks can be viewed as potential triggers for war if they cause substantial physical damage to the target's computer systems. While a destructive attack on computer systems by a nation-state may not necessarily constitute a *casus belli*, a significant strike solely targeting computer systems could potentially justify a defensive military response.⁷³\n\nClassifying cyber assaults, such as computer intrusions or communication disruptions, presents significant challenges. For instance, while both data breaches and attacks on air traffic control systems are invasive, the latter could result in greater damage and loss of life, potentially constituting an 'armed attack' rather than mere data theft. Additionally, attacks causing significant harm, regardless of the level of intrusion, may qualify as 'armed attacks.' Large-scale cyberattacks have the potential to incapacitate an opponent's ability to wage war effectively, surpassing the impact of traditional kinetic attacks. Such attacks can disrupt vital functions such as leadership, communication,\n\n⁶⁹ Hannah Herbst, 'Cyber Attacks &amp; Modern Warfare' (*Denver J Intl L Pol*, 8 April 2020) <http: djilp.org=\"\" cyber-attacks-modern-warfare=\"\"></http:> accessed 25 November 2023.\n\n⁷⁰ Colonel Charles J Dunlap, Jr, 'International Law and Terrorism' <http: dunlapterrorism.pdf=\"\" people.duke.edu=\"\" ~pfeaver=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n\n⁷¹ Lawrence T Greenberg and others, *Information Warfare and International Law* (DOD Command Command and Control Research Program 1998).\n\n⁷² Charles C Poché, 'This Means War!

Determining whether a cyberattack violates this prohibition requires an understanding of how ‘force’ is interpreted in international law and whether cyberattacks meet the criteria set out by these standards.⁷⁵\n\nA narrow interpretation of ‘force’ is recommended, aligning with the objectives outlined in the UN Charter’s preamble to maintain international peace and security and prevent war.⁷⁶ However, the Charter does not exhaustively address all aspects of force regulation, and further guidance is sought from customary international law, as noted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).⁷⁷ Offensive cyber capabilities, such as implanting harmful code into computer networks, share similarities with traditional military actions, economic coercion, and subversion.⁷⁸ The effects of cyberattacks can range from temporary disruptions, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, to severe physical damage and loss of life, such as disrupting emergency networks for first responders.\n\nCategorizing all cyberattacks as a ‘use of force’ under Article 2(4) would require an exceptionally broad interpretation.⁷⁹ The Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare suggests that cyberattacks with tangible consequences in the physical\n\n⁷⁴ UN Charter Art 2, para 4.\n\n⁷⁵ Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ (2012) 30 Berkeley J Intl L 525.

The Tallinn Manual outlines criteria including severity, spontaneity, directness, intrusiveness, quantification, and presumptive legitimacy to evaluate cyberattack consequences against those of conventional attacks.⁸¹ If a cyberattack exhibits sufficient resemblance to these criteria, broadening the prohibition on force is warranted.⁸² Despite the United States' emphasis on consequences over methodology, modern society's heavy reliance on computer systems raises concerns about incapacitating physical infrastructure without tangible destruction.⁸³\n\nThe SolarWinds incident underscores the importance of characterizing cyberattacks as casus belli. SolarWinds, a company serving a vast clientele including major US government agencies, fell victim to cyber-attacks that compromised the integrity of their data.

In the context of cyberattacks, ensuring proportionality requires a nuanced understanding of technical intricacies. For example, a cyber response coded into software demands extensive knowledge of potential targets, often obtained through conventional cyber exploitation methods.94 The Office of the Attorney General of California defined cyber exploitation as 'the non-consensual distribution or publication of intimate photos or videos\n\n87 Vindman (n 18).\n88 ibid.\n89 See generally on proportionality, Hensey A Fenton II, 'Proportionality and Its Applicability in the Realm of Cyber-Attacks' (2019) 29 Duke J Comp &amp; Intl L 335.\n90 Melzer (n 67).\n91 UN Charter art 51.

Consequently, cooperation amongst Member States must be achieved to establish suitable standards such that the measures result in minimum trade distortion. On a preliminary level, it is essential that world governments agree upon a uniform understanding of the nature and scope of cybersecurity measures and the risks posed by them towards international trade.

Further, these measures must not be 'a disguised restriction on trade' and should not be 'more than necessary' to attain the objective.¹¹⁴ While the official text of this clause remains unavailable, leaked information provides insights into its content. Despite references to the negotiating text on the WTO's official website, it remains inaccessible to the public.¹¹⁵ Nevertheless, preliminary observations can be made based on the leaked information.\n\nWhile the exception provides visibility to cybersecurity issues and nation-states with the autonomy to design rigorous cybersecurity mechanisms, the exception is not a comprehensive regulation of cybersecurity and is only an enabling provision. Cyber-security measures remain the prerogative of Member States to keep in place. As a result, there remains a lack of comprehensive regulation of cyber-related issues in international trade. This status quo is especially concerning in a vital and ever-growing area like e-commerce. How this exception will be invoked by Member States remains to be seen but backlash based on information freedom concerns can certainly be anticipated. Further, the exception could also prove to be overbroad. The exception, apart from empowering Member States to take cybersecurity-related measures, allows any measures taken to achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives'. Such a vague enabling provision could lead to disastrous consequences, which could undermine the foundations of international trade. The term 'public policy', typically used in relation to international commercial arbitration, has been held by numerous judgments to be an 'unruly horse'.¹¹⁶ Due to the inherent lack of a precise definition, arbitration scholars have found the concept to be excessively malleable, shaped by the subjective values and principles in each nation.¹¹⁷ Adding to the existing uncertainty around cyber-attacks and cyber-security, the insertion of an unruly horse that is 'public policy', would certainly be undesirable.

According to the UNCTAD report, e-commerce transactions amounted to over USD 29 trillion by 2017, constituting approximately 36% of global GDP. As the world increasingly embraces data-driven technology, the centrality of effective data governance becomes ever more apparent.¹²⁴\n\nThe evolution of international trade towards digital platforms has exposed nation-states to new challenges, particularly cyberattacks, which pose threats to data integrity. One key question is whether cyberattacks should be considered acts of war. Given that virtually all industries are potential targets for cyber hackers, a unified and international solution is necessary to address this problem. Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) could serve as a means to tackle this emerging issue. BITs provide fundamental protections to foreign investments and offer various dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration. Integrating substantive protection against cybercrimes into BITs would enhance the accountability of states and incentivize them to adopt robust data protection laws. This approach could contribute to mitigating the risks posed by cyberattacks in the context of international investment.\n\n## 5.1 Digital Assets as Emerging Investments\n\nThe initial task for investors is to ascertain whether digital assets meet the criteria to qualify as 'covered investments' under BITs.

Furthermore, to invoke the BIT regime, investors must establish the presence of an investment and demonstrate that it has been made within the territory of the host State. With regards to the existence of investment, tribunals have previously construed intangible assets like intellectual property rights and administrative rights as falling within the scope of investment. Given the liberal approach adopted thus far, digital assets may feasibly be encompassed within this definition. It is foreseeable that investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) claims concerning this issue will proliferate, particularly as foreign investment in digital firms – providing services such as e-commerce platforms and online payment support – continues to escalate.\n\nTribunals have typically referenced the definition provided in BITs and objective economic criteria to ascertain whether an investment has been established, contrasting it with a mere commercial transaction. In interpreting BIT provisions, tribunals often turn to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, which outlines the general rule for interpreting treaty provisions, taking into consideration the purpose of the BIT and its other provisions. Certain BITs, such as the German Model BIT, employ a broad asset-based definition of investment, encompassing phrases like ‘every kind of asset’, thereby potentially encompassing digital assets as well.\n\nWhen considering the inclusion of digital assets within the definition of an asset, it is crucial to carefully delineate the concept of digital assets itself. The primary concern regarding digital assets pertains to the data they encapsulate, which holds both intrinsic and extrinsic value. The economic worth of digital assets is intricately linked to their data content, with the value of a digital asset being inherently tied to the data it contains. Intrinsic value pertains to the core data itself, while extrinsic value encompasses additional elements such as customer metadata, which companies often monetize significantly. Furthermore, there exists a symbiotic relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic value, akin to the seeds and flesh of a fruit, respectively. While not all BITs offer a broad definition of investment, it is advisable to establish a clear understanding of digital assets within the context of investment arbitration to mitigate the risk of numerous arbitration claims stemming from uncertainties in this regard.\n\nApart from the definition of an investment, there are other factors that can affect the inclusion of digital assets under the definition of covered investments, such as economic factors.¹²⁵ If the definition of investment\n\n¹²⁵ Enikő Horváth and Severin Klinkmüller, ‘The Concept of “Investment” in the Digital Economy: The Case of Social Media Companies’ (2019) 20 JWIT 577, 593.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333",

Therefore, a broad definition in the BIT would be ideal to bring digital assets within the investment arbitration regime. There are various definitions of investment in BITs which particularly limit the definition of investment by making it mandatory for investments to have some connection with economic factors such as expectations of profits or assumption of risk. For instance, in the case of Romak SA v Uzbekistan, the Tribunal adopted a restrictive approach in interpreting the definition of an investment.[126] It's essential for investment tribunals to recognize that digital companies often operate under long-term business models, where the initial investment is directed towards research and development.[127] These companies may take a considerable period to generate revenue, distinguishing them from single commercial transactions.[128]\n\nAnother pertinent issue relates to the requirement of a territorial link in various BITs, stipulating that investments must be made within the territory of the host State. Establishing the territorial presence of digital assets poses inherent challenges.[129] Jonathan Bick's categorization of digital assets into possession, location, and control underscores the importance of these factors in establishing a territorial link between the State and the investment.

Since the assumption of control does not imply that the property has been acquired by the government, compensation should be paid under international law, indicating that the owner was deprived of their fundamental right of ownership of the property.¹³³\n\n## 5.2 Investment Claims in the Age of Cybersecurity\n\nThe central concern in this context revolves around whether investors can pursue claims against states for cybercrimes.¹³⁴ Studies from 2017 indicate that a single data breach can cost a company up to USD 3.62 million on average. The severity of costs varies depending on factors like the type and volume of data stolen; for instance, the leakage of trade secrets could pose an existential threat to a company. The principle of ‘Fair and Equitable Treatment’ (FET) is pivotal in this regard, as it obliges states to provide investors with essential conditions, potentially enabling investors to lodge claims for cybercrimes.\n\nTribunals typically assess whether state actions are arbitrary under FET provisions by referencing core principles.¹³⁵ Regarding digital assets, FET claims may challenge alterations in measures related to national cybersecurity. ‘Transparency’ plays a crucial role for investors conducting business in a host state, and states are obligated to maintain transparency.

Chile's support for these policies on national security grounds increased costs for foreign investors. Similarly, data localization policies initiated by the Vietnamese government have been challenged by tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Google on economic and human rights grounds. Regarding claims related to Denial of Justice, these typically entail the right to be heard. Such a right is infringed when the cyber legislation of the host state fails to provide effective opportunities for all parties to present their case.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned considerations, claims may also arise based on the Full Protection and Security standard (FPS). These claims encompass not only threats from armed rebels but also modern dangers posed by cybercriminals. Cyberattacks can compromise the three primary pillars of security: confidentiality, availability, and integrity. A claim under FPS due to a cyberattack can be sustained if it can be demonstrated that the security assured by the host State extends beyond physical protection. Factors such as the standard liability of the host State and the potential overlap between FPS and FET provisions are also pivotal in determining whether the investment was deprived of legal protection.\n\nThe definition of investment has evolved over time, and similarly, the application of FPS has expanded. An investor can succeed in their claim even in the absence of a physical attack, as exemplified in the case of Azurix v Argentina,¹³⁸ where the host State was deemed responsible for providing an overall safe environment to investors.

In the realm of cybersecurity, a State can fulfill this obligation by ratifying agreements like the Budapest Convention, known for its comprehensive approach to cybercrime cooperation. The lack of protection for investors often stems from a deficiency in international cooperation. Regarding the interplay between FPS and FET, it primarily concerns legal security. Tribunals have ruled that a breach of the FET standard does not necessarily entail a breach of FPS, as seen in cases like Wena Hotels LTD v Egypt¹³⁹ and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v Ecuador.¹⁴⁰\n\nIn instances where host States lack cyber laws, courts have applied analogical reasoning, drawing from laws related to privacy and theft. However, if domestic courts fail to apply such principles and a void in cybersecurity laws persists, this absence could be deemed a violation of the FPS standard. The FPS standard underscores the State's duty to furnish investors with an adequate legal framework for protection. Intangible assets, if deemed investments under the relevant BIT, can be subject to expropriation, including indirect expropriation resulting in asset depreciation. Addressing these issues requires enhancing the contents of BITs by expanding the definition of investment to encompass digital assets. States must recognize that safeguarding investors from cybercrime not only benefits investors but also preserves the economy and the privacy of citizens, serving the public interest of the host State. Incorporating cyberattacks under the FPS provision in BITs can compel host States to fulfill their obligation and shield investors from cyber threats, which have the potential to devastate companies in an instant. Therefore, it is imperative to prohibit these detrimental criminal actions.\n\n## 5.3 National Security Exceptions in Investment Law\n\nVarious international investment agreements incorporate exceptions,¹⁴¹ including those related to national security. This exception grants host States the authority to implement precautionary measures. However, there is considerable debate within the Investor ISDS regime regarding the basis for invoking this national security exception.

Regular reviews should be conducted to assess the ongoing necessity of upholding security-related investment restrictions. In the author's view, all these remedies prevent this exception of national security from becoming a mere 'black and white' matter and a different solution should be adopted which can balance the rights of the contracting parties and foreign investors. Hence, the threat to cybersecurity such as cyber-attacks should be covered under the umbrella of national security. By invoking these exceptions, the States are likely to take certain measures to prevent these crimes that would violate the international investment agreements and would be able to justify such measures under existing exceptions.\n\n## 6 Making the Linkages: Nuclear Proliferation and Cyberattacks\n\nIn contemporary times, parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation are frequently drawn, owing to the escalating threat that cyberattacks pose to global security and diplomacy.^[143]^ Cybersecurity has transcended local boundaries to become a matter of international concern, impacting peace and security on a global scale. However, existing international law inadequately addresses these cybersecurity threats, necessitating the establishment of more robust and effective regulations. A recent report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) highlighted the strategic risks posed by cyberattacks, underscoring the urgent need for the introduction of a cybersecurity treaty. The international community must recognize and address the risks posed by cybersecurity, analogous to the approach taken with non-proliferation agreements.\n\nNuclear non-proliferation aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and associated delivery systems, with the overarching goal of averting nuclear conflict or catastrophe in the future.

For instance, the NC3 systems of nuclear-armed governments heavily rely on digital processors and computers, rendering them vulnerable to hacking and cyberattacks. Moreover, the nuclear force infrastructure encompasses weapons, launch sites, and command authorities interconnected through communication and data processing technologies, facilitating cyber vulnerabilities. Despite the reluctance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to address the convergence of nuclear and cyber threats, scholars and non-governmental experts have extensively documented their interactions. Without stronger protections against cyberattacks and illegal hacking, the realm of nuclear weapons and security remains susceptible to exploitation.\n\n## 6.1 Comparative Analysis of Legal Frameworks\n\nEfforts in nuclear non-proliferation have spanned approximately fifty years, originating in the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. The earliest initiatives began within the UN, with Article 11(1) of the UN Charter emphasizing the preservation of international peace and security.¹⁴⁵ A significant development during this period was the conclusion of the Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) in 1963,¹⁴⁶ although some countries abstained from signing due to perceived weaknesses in its provisions, notably the absence of international control mechanisms or spot inspections.¹⁴⁷\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis highlighted the need for a comprehensive framework to address nuclear proliferation. Consequently, the NPT was signed in 1968 by 62 countries, including nuclear weapon states like the US. Notably, China and France refrained from signing initially.

In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was created with the goal of promoting and overseeing to promote and oversee the peaceful use of nuclear technology.\n\n¹⁴⁶ The PTBT can be viewed as the first global and formal attempt towards non-proliferation. At first, the Treaty was only ratified by the USSR, the US, and the UK.\n\n¹⁴⁷ For instance, China conducted Project 596 in 1964, which was its first atom bomb test. Due to its relatively small audience, and the fact that even its signatories continued to defy it, the PTBT was largely a failure.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>",

Subsequent developments included the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, such as the Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America, and agreements like the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT-I) between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.¹⁴⁹\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War in 1991, efforts in non-proliferation intensified, with particular focus on strengthening the NPT. The revelation of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program after the Gulf War prompted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to introduce the Model Additional Protocol, enhancing its access to information and nuclear facilities. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 1996 marked a significant milestone, prohibiting all nuclear explosions and providing for on-site inspections and confidence-building measures.\n\nIn recent years, cybercrime and cyberattacks have emerged as significant threats to international security, paralleling the concerns posed by nuclear proliferation in the past. Analogous to the NPT for nuclear issues, there is a growing need for a comprehensive treaty addressing cybercrime, regulation of the internet, and law enforcement procedures for cross-border investigations. These issues carry profound implications for human rights, economic systems, and national security. International cooperation is crucial in developing effective regulatory frameworks for cyberspace,¹⁵⁰ fostering confidence among stakeholders and ensuring a secure digital environment.\n\n## 6.2 Lessons from Nuclear Law for Cyber Regulation\n\nThe NPT is a three-part global pact intended at restricting the spread of nuclear weapons: (1) non-proliferation, (2) disarmament, and (3) peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The basic tenets of the treaty include the principle that nuclear weapons will not be acquired by States that do not have them, nuclear-weapon States will pursue disarmament, and all States have access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes under safeguards.\n\nAccording to Article IX of the NPT, 'nuclear weapon states (NWS)' are those that have detonated a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967,\n\n¹⁴⁸ Following suit, states of the South Pacific established an NWFZ in 1985, Southeast Asia in 1995, Africa in 1996, and Central Asia in 2006.\n\n¹⁴⁹ Seven years later, SALT-I was followed up by the signing of SALT-II by these two nations, which further limited their nuclear capabilities.\n\n¹⁵⁰ Deborah Brown, 'Cybercrime is Dangerous, But a New UN Treaty Could Be Worse for Rights' (13 August 2021) <https: 08=\"\" 13=\"\" 2021=\"\" cybercrime-dangerous-new-un-treaty-could-be-worse-rights=\"\" news=\"\" www.hrw.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>",

These nuclear-weapon States are prohibited from transferring nuclear weapons to any recipient and from assisting, encouraging, or inducing any non-NWS to produce or acquire them. Non-nuclear weapons nations are similarly prohibited from receiving or manufacturing nuclear weapons from any source.¹⁵¹ Additionally, the Treaty mandates that all Parties must pursue talks on effective measures for nuclear disarmament and a treaty on general and comprehensive disarmament under international control. States retain the right to develop, produce, and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, provided such activities comply with the treaty's non-proliferation provisions. Moreover, the NPT allows groups of nations to enter into regional agreements to ensure the absence of nuclear weapons on their respective territories, known as nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties. The treaty also establishes mechanisms for periodic review and assessment of its implementation, as outlined in Article VIII.\n\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) supplements the NPT and includes a Protocol detailing the International Monitoring System (IMS), On-Site Inspections (OSI), and Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs). The CTBT prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, with provisions for redressing violations, ensuring compliance, and periodic review of its effectiveness.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy's infamous fear in the 1960s, that 20 or perhaps 30 'Nuclear-Weapon States (NWSs)' would arise within a decade, did not come true. The number of nuclear powers or governments with active nuclear weapons programmes remains at ten even now. The NPT recognises five of them as lawful nuclear weapons possessors, which corresponds to the permanent five members of the 'UN Security Council (UNSC)'. Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are all said to have nuclear weapons or have demonstrated it through testing. Iran has long been accused of pursuing a zealous nuclear weapons development. In contrast, no less than 26 governments have renounced or been forced to abandon their pursuit of nuclear weapons, having completed feasibility studies, targeted weapon research or even development, or manufactured nuclear weapons (or inherited them following the collapse of the Soviet Union). Almost the whole phalanx of middle powers is made\n\n¹⁵¹ There are gaps in the current treaty framework. Firstly, there is the issue of countries like India, Pakistan, and Israel not joining the NPT. This leads to a significant amount of unsafeguarded nuclear activity. Another concern is that countries signatory may develop nuclear fuel cycle facilities and then subsequently opt-out of the Treaty as North Korea did. To avoid this, stronger and more regular inspection measures need to be enforced within the Treaty mechanism, with the aid of international bodies.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333",

When one considers that the CTBT names out 44 'nuclear capable' governments whose ratification is necessary before the treaty can be implemented, the miracle of non-proliferation becomes even greater. By comparing the 'before' and 'after,' we may obtain a sense of the consequences of international norms. The vast majority of 'nuclear aspirants' began their nuclear programmes before the NPT was signed. After the NPT was opened for signing, only Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, and (perhaps) Syria developed their programmes. Surprisingly, none of these nations were democracies at the time the pact was drafted. On the contrary, the vast majority of 'renouncers' halted their programmes during or after the discussions. As a result, for most of them, the NPT signified the line beyond which nuclear weapons ambitions lost their legitimacy.\n\nThe reliance of nuclear-armed governments, including the US, on computerized Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems underscores a critical vulnerability. These systems, integral to every aspect of nuclear force management, operate within cyberspace, making them susceptible to hacking and cyberattacks. NC3 systems encompass a network of communication and data-processing technologies linking weapons, radar systems, launch sites, and senior authorities responsible for nuclear decision-making. Despite extensive cybersecurity measures, the complexity and diversity of these systems render them inherently vulnerable, with numerous potential points of attack. Moreover, emerging technologies such as cyber capabilities, hypersonics, and encryption have the dual potential of exacerbating conflicts within the framework of the NPT while also offering avenues for achieving its objectives. While the NPT has been slow to address these evolving challenges, academia and non-governmental organizations have extensively studied their implications for nuclear issues. However, there remains a significant gap between civil society's engagement with emerging technologies and their integration into the NPT framework.[152]\n\nGiven its role as both a treaty and a forum, the NPT holds particular importance in addressing these challenges.

The NPT review process provides a unique opportunity for nuclear‐possessor and non‐possessor states to discuss and address a wide range of issues affecting nuclear order and treaty obligations. In light of these considerations, emerging technologies should be incorporated into all nuclear and non‐nuclear disarmament agreements, including the CTBT, the Conference on Disarmament (CD), and nuclear‐weapon‐free zones. However, the NPT, with its comprehensive legal framework and review mechanism, stands as a pivotal platform for addressing the challenges posed by emerging technologies to nuclear disarmament and non‐proliferation efforts.\n\nEdward Ifft highlights the CTBT innovative approach to addressing the challenge of unequal capacity among State parties to collect and evaluate data about compliance. The treaty establishes an IMS, comprising 337 globally distributed sites equipped with seismic, radionuclide, hydroacoustic, and infrared sensors. Ifft suggests that most States lack the resources to independently acquire and analyze this data. However, individual State parties can access professional technical analysis of IMS data and other relevant information free of charge from an international data center in Vienna. Drawing on the collaborative IMS model proposed by the CTBT, Ifft proposes the development of a Joint Attribution Mechanism (JAM) to assist nations with limited cyber forensic capabilities in collecting and analyzing data for attribution purposes. Such a mechanism could serve as a cost‐effective solution, encouraging nations to participate in a cyber treaty. Additionally, a JAM would enhance the credibility and legitimacy of the attribution process for nations with advanced cyber forensic capabilities. Ensuring reliable attribution is essential, but it is equally important to establish consistent consequences for cyber aggressors. This highlights the need for effective mechanisms to punish those responsible for cyberattacks consistently.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis article underscores the profound complexities and pressing challenges in the domain of cybersecurity, especially when viewed through the prism of international law.

The disruption wrought by cyberattacks on WTO agreements is even more deleterious, given the outdated security exceptions that remain unresponsive to risk-based cybersecurity measures. Moreover, the burgeoning surge in FDIs in digital assets, primarily intangible, exposes another lacuna in international law, conspicuously absent in contemporary investment treaties. These considerations underscore an imminent need to institute measures to mitigate the manifold issues arising from cyberattacks.\n\nPublic international law must evolve to address the specific nuances of cyberattacks and the consequent implications on State sovereignty, transborder crime, and national security. The ascendance of cyber aggression necessitates a re-examination of the fundamental tenets of international law, including the principles of Jus Ad Bellum and Jus In Bello, with a more nuanced lens. The complexities of attribution and the abstract nature of cyber warfare necessitate a shift in how we perceive sovereignty and territoriality in the digital age.\n\nIn the sphere of WTO law, the advent of cyber threats and the expansion of digital economies call for a revamp of trade rules and exceptions. It is crucial to establish a harmonized understanding of cybersecurity risks and potential countermeasures, with a balanced approach to cyber governance and free trade. Thus, a common vision is the need of the hour to work in collaboration internationally for ensuring cybersecurity and keeping cybercrimes at bay. The establishment of the Trade and Technology Council by the United States and the European Union represents a promising development in the quest for global consensus on trade and technology issues. This initiative holds the potential to facilitate increased collaboration and the harmonization of regulations across international borders.\n\nFinally, as cyberattacks increasingly target financial assets and systems, the role of investment law becomes paramount. The rise of data-driven businesses necessitates safeguarding digital assets and investments, requiring innovative legal mechanisms such as ‘digital-ready' BITs. Re-envisioning BITs to include digital assets, whilst establishing the scope of security provisions under the FET clause, can address potential investment claims from cyber risks. This would balance the need for a stable investment environment with the protection of digital assets, thereby fostering confidence amongst investors in the digital era.",

The article adopts a multidisciplinary approach, integrating legal theory, international relations, and cyber law to analyze how digital security issues intersect with global economic transactions. Utilizing doctrinal legal analysis, the article delves into international treaties, case law, and policy documents, while a comparative method highlights variances and similarities across jurisdictions. The article identifies significant gaps in existing international legal frameworks that are ill-equipped to address the complexities and nuances of the digital age. It advocates for comprehensive legal reforms, encompassing cyber warfare, digital trade, and cross-border investments. The objective is to align international law with the digital era's realities, effectively balancing national security, economic growth, and individual rights in a globally interconnected environment. This article not only uncovers critical shortcomings in current legal structures but also proposes forward-looking legal strategies, essential for tackling emerging challenges at the cybersecurity, trade, and investment nexus. These strategies chart a course towards a more resilient and adaptive international legal system, equipped to address the multifaceted issues arising from the digital era's convergence.\nPublished with license by Koninklijke Brill BV | DOI:10.1163/22119000-12340327\n© XU QIAN, 2024 | ISSN: 1660-7112 (print) 2211-9000 (online)\nQIAN\n# Keywords\ncyberattack – cybersecurity – international investment law – international trade law\n# 1 Introduction\nToday's technology-driven world has fueled the growth of data-driven businesses that store necessarily sensitive and crucial information within certain digital information systems that become a part of a cyber environment.¹ In its literal sense, cybersecurity can be termed as the practice of protecting or securing a network, server, or electronic device from any external intruders, targeted attackers, or malicious opportunists.² 'Cybersecurity' refers to the protection from damage, unauthorized use, or exploitation of the information contained in electronic systems to maintain their integrity and confidentiality.³ In a nutshell, cybersecurity strives to protect sensitive information or the digital information system (that stores such sensitive information) against targeted security risks. This practice is crucial as it helps in preserving and maintaining the integrity or privacy of data.\nThe 'International Organization for Standardization (ISO)' and 'International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)', in ISO/ERC 27000 (Information\n¹ O A Hathaway and others, 'The Law of Cyber-Attack' (2012) 100 (4) Cal L Rev 817.

Furthermore, an act of this magnitude could also be conducted by the State or an independent criminal.⁶ Cyberattacks can be analyzed through four primary criteria. Firstly, they possess the capacity to manipulate, destroy, or exfiltrate data, rendering them inherently disruptive and unpredictable. Their origin may be domestic or foreign, introducing complexities in attribution. Secondly, the nature of the perpetrator varies, ranging from individual criminals to organized groups or entities. Thirdly, the impact of cyberattacks is predominantly virtual, encompassing data loss or manipulation, which significantly diminishes the affected data’s commercial value. Moreover, attacks on critical infrastructure can precipitate severe disruptions to essential services. Lastly, the attribution of cyberattacks to state actors presents challenges, necessitating substantial evidence to establish\n⁴ IBM Services, ‘What is a Cyber-attack?’ (IBM, 11 November 2020) <www.ibm.com by-services=\"\" business-continuity=\"\" cyberattack#:~:text=\"The%20most%20well%2Dknown%20type,malware%20may%20not%20be%20immediate\" in-en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.

There are several definitions produced by scholars, research organizations, and private enterprises. However, there is a need for a uniform/consensual legal definition to the term cyberattacks. Two definitions are frequently cited. The National Institute of Standards and Technology–Computer Security Resource Center: defines cyberattack as ‘[a]n attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information’. Secondly, the National Research Council’s Committee on Offensive Information Warfare defines cyber-attacks as ‘[e]fforts to alter, disrupt, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information or programs on them’. See Matthew C Waxman, ‘Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)’ (2011) 36 Yale J Intl L 424.

In the same vein, it has warned by UK head of MI6 that China was exporting technology that allowed it to exert a ‘web of authoritarian control’ around the world. This may lead some countries to get caught in ‘data traps’ and digital currencies could be one such trap, see Roula Khalaf and Helen Warrell, ‘UK Spy Chief Raises Fears over China’s Digital Renminbi’ (Financial Times, 10 December 2021) <https: 128d7139-15d6-4f4d-a247-fc9228a53ebd=\"\" 128d7=\"\" content=\"\" www.ft.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:></www.ibm.com>\nQIAN\nculpability. For instance, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack attributed to the 'Guardians of Peace' raised suspicions of North Korean involvement, yet conclusive evidence remained elusive.\nThere is a major concern if these attacks can be attributed to a State;[7] such State attributable attacks would be considered, by virtue of 'Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter,' to be a volatile use of force.[8] The sovereignty of a State is transgressed when it falls prey to such attacks.[9] Attribution in cyberattacks poses significant challenges beyond simply identifying the responsible actor. Key issues include the lack of consensus on the required standards of proof, the debate over whether attributions should be made publicly or kept confidential, and the ambiguity surrounding the legal consequences of successful attribution. Additionally, while public attributions can serve purposes such as deterring future attacks and holding perpetrators accountable, they may also escalate tensions and risk revealing sensitive intelligence sources.[10] There might be a notable loss of information or reduction in its value which could pose significant threats to the economy and national security.[11] Due to their inherent characteristics, cyberattacks present a global challenge. Distinctively differing from conventional physical assaults, these cyber intrusions are swift, transcend borders, and exhibit no discernible pattern, rendering\n7 Delbert Tran, 'The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack' (2018) 20(1) Yale J L &amp; Tech 376.

The Institute classified the fifteen main players in this field of conflict into three categories, with one surprise: there is only one State in the first category; the United States is, according to the study, some ten years ahead of the Chinese. While the United States is the only one to tick all the boxes in the first category, there are more in the second category: China and Russia, but also France, the only European Union country on this list.

Consequently, there is burgeoning discourse surrounding the development of a cybersecurity treaty, paralleling established frameworks for managing other forms of strategic risk. However, crafting effective agreements necessitates a nuanced understanding of cyber incident typologies and their respective implications. Organizations such as the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) advocate for a comprehensive consideration of strategic risks inherent in cyber capabilities.¹⁵ Thus, addressing cyber threats mandates the formulation of holistic frameworks that reconcile national sovereignty, security imperatives, and international cooperation mandates.¹⁶\nThis article draws upon theoretical foundations from international law, comparative law, and international relations to provide a thorough examination of the pressing issue of cyberattacks. Its conceptual framework illuminates the potential interpretation and development of international legal norms, compares distinct yet interconnected areas, and explores the broader geopolitical dimensions of this global challenge. By analyzing fundamental principles of international law – such as state sovereignty, the use of force, and state responsibility – within the context of cyber operations, the article raises critical questions about their applicability to emerging cyber realities. Furthermore, it employs comparative legal analysis to draw parallels between legal frameworks governing nuclear non-proliferation and potential cybersecurity frameworks, highlighting the importance of adapting existing legal mechanisms to address new challenges. Additionally, the article considers the roles of both state and non-state actors in cybercrimes and examines the geopolitical implications of attributing cyberattacks to states.\nThis article establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the challenges posed by cyberattacks and the ongoing pursuit of bolstered cybersecurity\n¹² Marc Barrachin and Algirde Pipikaite, ‘We Need a Global Standard for Reporting Cyber Attacks’ (Harv Bus Rev, 8 November 2019) <https: 11=\"\" 2019=\"\" hbr.org=\"\" we-need-a-global-standard-for-reporting-cyber-attacks=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n¹³ United Nations General Assembly Res 64/211, ‘Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and Taking Stock of National Efforts to Protect Critical Information Infrastructures’ (17 March 2010) UN Doc A/RES/64/211.\n¹⁴ See Barrachin and Pipikaite (n 12).\n¹⁵ See Martha Finnermore and Duncan B Hollis, ‘Constructing Norms for Global Cybersecurity’ (2016) 110 AJIL 425.\n¹⁶ M Wohfeld and J Jasper, ‘Cyberattacks and Cyber Conflict: Where Is Conflict Resolution?’, in O Grech (ed), Contemporary Issues in Conflict Resolution (University of Malta 2018), 5–17.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\nwithin the domain of public international law. While clarity within general international law remains scarce, valuable insights can be gleaned from existing legal frameworks in international economic realms, such as international trade and investment law. The emergence of the cyber realm has introduced contemporary issues that challenge established norms and rules of international law, necessitating examination in terms of interpretation, application, and structure. Cyberattacks transcend mere technological phenomena, fundamentally reshaping traditional societal paradigms including concepts of capital[17] and warfare.[18] The article probes the adequacy of existing international legal and economic rules in defining cyberattacks and delineating breaches of established norms. It critically examines the efficacy of international law in regulating cyberattacks, recognizing the inherent complexities in defining and addressing such incidents. The article offers a nuanced definition of cyberattacks, recognizing their intricate nature that defies simple conceptualization. It contends that cyberattacks represent a modern manifestation of acts of war, a concept deeply rooted in international legal discourse spanning millennia. Exploring potential solutions, the article investigates the role of international economic law in mitigating cyber threats, particularly in safeguarding global data flows integral to contemporary globalization processes. Moreover, it delves into the potential applicability of investment treaties in regulating digital assets and scrutinizes existing parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation.[19] By examining how nuclear non-proliferation treaties serve as a precedent, the article explores the feasibility of developing a comprehensive set of international rules to govern cyberattacks, thereby addressing critical gaps in current regulatory frameworks.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n301\n## 2 Delineating the Notion and Boundaries of Cyberattacks\nA cyberattack is any kind of malicious action aimed at obtaining unlawful access to information technology systems including the resources or valuable information of their users that they may encompass. Cyberattacks hit businesses every day, particularly targeting critical infrastructure, trade secrets, and intellectual property with commercial value, and other online information.²⁰ Cyberattacks can peculiarly break into the defence²¹ systems²² which include defense capabilities and private military suppliers²³ and can gravely threaten the security of the nation. Its effect on the economy cannot be ignored, especially in the case of the United States where approximately 90% of critical infrastructure is possessed by the private sector, and companies do not see any specific reason for investing in cybersecurity to secure public interest.²⁴ By refusing to invest in cybersecurity, the private sector increases the exposure of the whole economy and society to cyber threats. The risk of cyberattacks that have the potential to cause large-scale shutdowns and huge amounts of other material harms are amplified by the digital transformation of the infrastructure of various sectors.²⁵ Moreover, ‘information technology (IT)’, connected devices, cyber-physical systems, and industrial control systems are all potential\n20 Meltzer (n 6).\n21 Fred Cohen, ‘Simulating Cyberattacks, Defenses, and Consequences’ (1999) 18(6) Computers &amp; Security 479.\n22 The Honorable James Clapper and others, ‘Joint Statement for the Record to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Foreign Cyber Threats to the United States’ (United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, 5 January 2017) <https: clapper-lettre-rogers_01-05-16.pdf=\"\" imo=\"\" media=\"\" www.armed-services.senate.gov=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n23 For instance, in the United States, the defense industry comprises the Department of Defense (DOD) along with agencies responsible for national security and military equipment providers. Measures have been undertaken by the DOD to mitigate risks caused by acquisition of third-party goods and services. In this regard, the procurement process may face a cyber risk caused by insertion of a bad software or a rogue product along the supply chain capable of forcing itself into the national security systems.\n24 Meltzer (n 6).\n25 NIS Cooperation Group, ‘EU Coordinated Risk Assessment of the Cybersecurity of 5G Networks’ (2019); For instance, numerous power outages caused by the NotPetya cyberattack on the power network of Ukraine.

Finally, there exists a two-fold risk in the cyber-espionage area. First, any unauthorized person may access and steal sensitive personal information. Second, existing information may be altered to create a façade and disseminate fake news to the larger public.³⁰ Furthermore, a major source of deceptive information and malicious publication could perhaps be, deep fake videos generated by ‘Artificial Intelligence (AI)’.³¹\nIn the context of the growing importance of a data-driven economy for national economic progress, effective data governance emerges as a critical aspect of governance.³² Governments are increasingly prioritizing data governance and implementing measures to safeguard the digital economy against cyber threats. These measures include implementing export limitations and restricting foreign government access to national technology.³³ One of the most significant and concerning cyberattacks targeted the US Government, its agencies, and numerous private companies – the ‘SolarWinds hack.’³⁴\n26 ‘Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity: Version 1.1’ (NIST, 16 April 2018) <https: cswp=\"\" nistpcbs=\"\" nistpubs.nist.gov=\"\" nistpubs.nist.gov/ns162018.pdf=\"\" nistpubs=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n27 Critical infrastructure has been defined by the USA PATRIOT Act as physical or virtual systems that are so integral to the United States that their impairment or destruction would result in a ‘debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters’; USA Patriot Act, 42 USC § 5195c(e) (2001).

While the full extent of the attack remains uncertain, it is believed to have impacted entities such as the US Treasury, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Commerce, and parts of the Pentagon.³⁵\n## 2.1 The Ambiguity of 'Cyberattack' within International Law\nDespite the pervasive phenomenon of cyberattacks in our increasingly interconnected contemporary society, where organisations are transitioning their operations and data storage to online platforms, international law remains ambivalent, lacking a precise and universally accepted legal definition for the term 'cyberattack'. This omission underscores a critical gap, especially as the digital realm continues to be a significant frontier for both commerce and potential conflict.³⁶ The degree of digitization of economic activities is generally linked to the tendency of experiencing cyberattacks. A recent measure by the Indian government is the 'Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)' project. The process involves a biometric ID that assigns to each individual, a 12-digit number. It further requires, storing 10 fingerprints, iris scans and other necessary details such as names, addresses and date of birth to be recorded in the eGovernance cloud platform. Consequently, the practice involves an increased cybersecurity concern among the individuals, private organisations and the government agencies. In the absence of indigenous cybersecurity technology and patents in the nation, India's government has declared that it will be providing monetary incentives to Indian enterprises who acquire foreign firms with cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies.³⁷ Perhaps worse, most of these threats have targeted small-scale industries that do not have the requisite means, instruments, or techniques to protect themselves and their business interests. Maintenance of cybersecurity is getting harder every year as cybercriminals continuously pose new threats, leverage new bugs, and carry out new sophisticated attacks; whilst regulatory institutions are still evolving and enhancing their standards.\n³⁵ 'Scope of Russian Hacking Becomes Clear: Multiple U.S. Agencies Were Hit' (The New York Times, 14 December 2020), <https: 12=\"\" 14=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" rus=\"\" sia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n³⁶ Brett Van Niekerk, 'Suppression of Cyber-defences', IST-Africa Week Conference, Durban, 2016.

Projections by Cybersecurity Ventures suggest a dramatic rise in global cybercrime costs, with estimates indicating a potential annual total of USD 10.5 trillion by 2025, marking a considerable increase from USD 3 trillion in 2015.³⁸ These figures underscore the immense economic impact of cybercrime, surpassing damages caused by natural disasters and even exceeding the collective value of significant illegal drug trades worldwide. Such crimes represent a substantial economic transfer globally, impeding innovation and investment.³⁹ While no sector is immune to cyber threats, the financial services industry stands out as particularly vulnerable. The 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report highlights financial organizations⁴⁰ as the most heavily targeted sector, followed by healthcare and public administration, respectively.⁴¹\nThere has been no global consensus on the definition of cybersecurity. However, it has been defined by the International Telecommunication Union as 'a set of tools, policies, safeguards, and technologies that can protect the cyber environment and the assets of an organization or user.'⁴² Cybersecurity, therefore, seeks to protect and maintain the digital assets security of the organization or the user against the risks involved in the cyber environment. The approach offered by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) presents an intriguing perspective on cyberattacks. NIST's framework does not differentiate between state-sponsored actions and criminal activities, nor does it consider the distinct impact of cyber incidents on public versus private records, networks, and facilities. While prioritizing the integrity of information and information networks, NIST's framework fails to encompass broader societal goals such as national market growth, law enforcement access\n³⁸ Steve Morgan, 'Cybercrime to Cost the World $10.5 Trillion Annually By 2025' (Cybercrime Magazine, 13 November 2020) <https: cybersecurityventures.com=\"\" hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n³⁹ Brian Cashell and others, 'The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attack' (United States Congressional Research Service, 1 April 2004) <https: ras.org=\"\" rl32331.pdf=\"\" sgp=\"\" crs=\"\" misc=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n⁴⁰ Kenning Arlitsch and Adam Edelman, 'Staying Safe: Cyber Security for People and Organizations' (2014) 54 J Libr Admin 46.\n⁴¹ '2020 Data Breach Investigation Report' (Verizon, 2020) <https: 2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf=\"\" enterprise.verizon.com=\"\" resources=\"\" reports=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023; the Public Administration sector manages with the administration of local, state and federal government.\n⁴² International Telecommunication Union, 'Overview of Cybersecurity: Recommendation ITU-T X.1205' (ITU-T, 4 August 2008) <https: rec=\"\" t-rec-x.1205-200804-i=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n305\nto private data, information quality management, or social constraints. Consequently, the definition outlined by NIST primarily focuses on unauthorized use and confidentiality concerns but lacks clarity in distinguishing between state-driven actions and criminal activities.\nAn alternative legal definition proposed by the United States National Research Council defines cyberattacks as purposeful actions aimed at altering, disrupting, deceiving, degrading, or destroying computer systems, networks, or the information and programs within them.43 While this definition offers rationality, it also highlights ambiguity, particularly in differentiating between basic cybercrimes and cyberattacks. This lack of clarity may lead to inconsistencies within the legal framework, hindering effective coordination among agencies.\n## 2.2 International Responses and Legal Implications\nThe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has introduced the Cyber Norms Index to monitor and compare significant achievements in negotiating and establishing norms for governmental actions in cyberspace. This index aids policymakers and observers in analyzing proposals for cyber norms, tracking their development, and assessing their uniform adoption by members of the global community. Users can utilize the index to examine multilateral outcomes and compare information using various groups or keywords. Additionally, there has been a widespread call for norms aimed at immunizing and stabilizing cyberspace.44 CSO Online45 has curated a list of\n43 Owens William, Technology, Policy Law and Ethics Regarding U.S. Acquisition and Use of Cyberattack Capabilities (National Academies 2009).\n44 Henry Farrell, ‘Promoting Norms for Cyberspace’ (Council on Foreign Relations, 6 April 2015) <http: cybersecurity=\"\" p36358=\"\" promoting-norms-cyberspace=\"\" www.cfr.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023. Cyber norms may also evolve in a decentralised, bottom-up fashion rather than through top-down regulation. On this idea, see, eg, Bryan Druzin and Jessica Li, ‘Censorship’s Fragile Grip on the Internet: Can Online Speech be Controlled?’ (2016) 49 Cornell Intl L J 369 (arguing that cyber norms may evolve suddenly as the unintended consequence of decentralised behaviour). For the self-standardization of international legal norms more generally, see Bryan Druzin, ‘Why Does Soft Law Have Any Power Anyway?’ (2016) 7 Asian J Intl L 361 (arguing that many areas of soft law exhibit strong network effects, rendering it uniquely calibrated to induce voluntary adoption); Bryan Druzin, ‘Towards a Theory of Spontaneous Legal Standardization’ (2017) 8 JIDS 403 (positing a theory as to how legal normative standardization may occur in a decentralized, bottom-up fashion from network effect pressures).\n45 CSO Online is a publication that provides news, analysis, and research on a broad range of security and risk management topics.

In February 2020, the US Department of Justice apprehended two Chinese citizens for allegedly laundering bitcoin on behalf of North Korean attackers.⁵² Similarly, the Mexican\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n307\nfinance ministry reported a hacking attempt on its infrastructure, although no confidential information was compromises.53 In 2021, Russian hackers infiltrated a Ukrainian government file-sharing system, attempting to disseminate illicit records to compromised machines.54\nAmong the most recent and significant cyberattacks is the SolarWinds breach. SolarWinds, a prominent US information technology company, fell victim to a cyberattack that went undetected for months,55 affecting its customers. US authorities suspect Russian hackers to be behind the attack, which targeted not the federal government or a private organization's network directly, but a third-party technology provider. This tactic, known as a 'Supply Chain' attack, exploited vulnerabilities in SolarWinds' Orion IT management tools, compromising high-ranking departments of the US government, including the Department of Homeland Security and Treasury, as well as private enterprises like FireEye.\n## 2.3 Cyber-Attacks on the Upswing: Risk for Worsening\nHacking groups and state-sponsored organizations have discovered that cyber-attacks are an effective weapon for balancing the playing field with rivals. The convergence of an attacker threat is highly risky and an expensive danger of insider manipulation or theft of intellectual property has generated a precarious environment in the private sector.56 While employee incompetence and human errors contribute to organizational vulnerabilities, recent years have witnessed a notable surge in attacks by malicious actors with access to sensitive business information. The global cybersecurity landscape is fraught with concerns regarding the likelihood of financial losses, misappropriation of classified data, and disruptions to critical infrastructure. The escalating scale and complexity of cyberattacks have not only heightened the risk of being caught off guard but have also increased the costs associated with preventing and recovering from such incidents.\n53 Adriana Barrera, 'Mexico's Economy Ministry Hit by Cyber-attack' (Reuters, 25 February 2020) <www.reuters.com article=\"\" us-mexico-economy-cyberattack-iduskcn20jobi=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n54 Dan Goodin, 'Ukraine Says Russia Hacked Its Document Portal and Planted Malicious Files' (ARS Technica, 25 February 2021) <https: 02=\"\" 2021=\"\" arstechnica.com=\"\" information-technology=\"\" ukraine-says-russia-hacked-its-document-portal-and-planted-malicious-files=\"\" /=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n55 Richard Kugler, 'Deterrence of Cyber Attacks', in Franklin D Kramer and others (eds), Cyberpower and National Security (National Defense University Press 2009) 309.\n56 See Sesha Kethineni, 'Cybercrime in India: Laws, Regulations, and Enforcement Mechanisms', in T Holt and A Bossler (eds), The Palgrave Handbook of International Cybercrime and Cyberdeviance (Palgrave 2020) 305–26.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.reuters.com>\nQIAN\nDespite media attention being drawn to high-profile cyberattacks targeting large corporations like Target, Netflix, and financial institutions such as JP Morgan, it is small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that remain the most vulnerable.[57] Industry analysts estimate that up to  $60\\%$  of SMEs may face collapse within six months due to cyberattacks, ranging from phishing scams to ransomware assaults.[58]\nChina's initiative to develop digital infrastructure, known as the 'Digital Silk Road,' alongside its traditional infrastructure projects, aims to enhance international connectivity in terms of communication and data flow.[59] This digital complement to the land-based 'Silk Road Economic Belt' and the 'Twenty-First Century Maritime Silk Road' seeks to bolster capacity for the exchange of goods.[60]\nIn light of these developments, states reliant on global interactions must prioritize the development of credible policies on cross-border data flow. As nations seek to thrive in the post-COVID-19 era and compete in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, facilitating cross-border data flow is imperative. Several governments have already issued warnings about the potential for large-scale cyber assaults, exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to lure individuals and companies into divulging personal and financial data.\n# 3 Paradigm Shift in Public International Law: Cyberattack as an Act of War\nThe world is rapidly transitioning towards intensive digitalization, a trend that has been ongoing for years but has recently accelerated unexpectedly.[61] The\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n309\ndata-driven economy has become crucial for the economic growth of nations and the global economy, with global data flow surpassing the value of traded goods in 2014.⁶² The interplay between cybersecurity and trade is profound, as technology and data flow revolutionize international trade, communication, e-commerce, and innovation.⁶³ Technological advancements such as cloud computing, AI, big data processing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have facilitated global data flow, accelerating the transnational interconnectedness of corporations, governments, and supply chains.⁶⁴ However, rapid digitalization has also brought about challenges, including an increase in the frequency of cyberattacks, which modern international law struggles to address.⁶⁵\nDefining a cyberattack poses challenges, but it is widely accepted that such attacks aim to undermine or disrupt the function of a computer network.⁶⁶ The growing reliance on technology makes nations vulnerable to cyber threats, with many ill-equipped to handle serious cyber incidents.⁶⁷ Cyberattacks can have severe ramifications beyond the virtual realm, prompting states to focus on securing critical infrastructure and bolstering cybersecurity measures. Unlike traditional forms of warfare, cyberattacks occur in the digital domain but can have equally devastating consequences in the physical world.⁶⁸ Recent incidents, such as the SolarWinds attacks, highlight the surprise element inherent in cyber warfare.

Historically, such acts encompassed a wide range of actions, including unfriendly economic or commercial measures and actions that insulted a nation's pride.⁷⁰ However, rapid technological advancements have challenged this traditional concept, rendering established legal categories inadequate to regulate contemporary activities.⁷¹\nIn the context of cyberspace, clarifying the concept of *casus belli* serves to provide a clear standard against which states can assess their behavior and that of others when initiating or responding to cyberattacks.⁷² Traditional theories of *casus belli*, often emphasizing the violent and aggressive nature of armed operations, may not directly apply to cyberattacks due to their non-physical nature. Nevertheless, cyberattacks can be viewed as potential triggers for war if they cause substantial physical damage to the target's computer systems. While a destructive attack on computer systems by a nation-state may not necessarily constitute a *casus belli*, a significant strike solely targeting computer systems could potentially justify a defensive military response.⁷³\nClassifying cyber assaults, such as computer intrusions or communication disruptions, presents significant challenges. For instance, while both data breaches and attacks on air traffic control systems are invasive, the latter could result in greater damage and loss of life, potentially constituting an 'armed attack' rather than mere data theft. Additionally, attacks causing significant harm, regardless of the level of intrusion, may qualify as 'armed attacks.' Large-scale cyberattacks have the potential to incapacitate an opponent's ability to wage war effectively, surpassing the impact of traditional kinetic attacks. Such attacks can disrupt vital functions such as leadership, communication,\n⁶⁹ Hannah Herbst, 'Cyber Attacks &amp; Modern Warfare' (*Denver J Intl L Pol*, 8 April 2020) <http: djilp.org=\"\" cyber-attacks-modern-warfare=\"\"></http:> accessed 25 November 2023.\n⁷⁰ Colonel Charles J Dunlap, Jr, 'International Law and Terrorism' <http: dunlapterrorism.pdf=\"\" people.duke.edu=\"\" ~pfeaver=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n⁷¹ Lawrence T Greenberg and others, *Information Warfare and International Law* (DOD Command Command and Control Research Program 1998).\n⁷² Charles C Poché, 'This Means War!

Consequently, cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure should be regarded as legitimate grounds for declaring a casus belli.\n## 3.2 Conceptualizing Cyber-Operation as Use of force\nThe United Nations (UN) Charter, a foundational document governing the use of force (*Jus Ad Bellum*), outlines in Article 2(4)⁷⁴ that Member States must refrain from threatening or using force to undermine the territorial sovereignty or political independence of another state, unless justified by self-defense or authorized by the UN Security Council. Determining whether a cyberattack violates this prohibition requires an understanding of how ‘force’ is interpreted in international law and whether cyberattacks meet the criteria set out by these standards.⁷⁵\nA narrow interpretation of ‘force’ is recommended, aligning with the objectives outlined in the UN Charter’s preamble to maintain international peace and security and prevent war.⁷⁶ However, the Charter does not exhaustively address all aspects of force regulation, and further guidance is sought from customary international law, as noted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).⁷⁷ Offensive cyber capabilities, such as implanting harmful code into computer networks, share similarities with traditional military actions, economic coercion, and subversion.⁷⁸ The effects of cyberattacks can range from temporary disruptions, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, to severe physical damage and loss of life, such as disrupting emergency networks for first responders.\nCategorizing all cyberattacks as a ‘use of force’ under Article 2(4) would require an exceptionally broad interpretation.⁷⁹ The Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare suggests that cyberattacks with tangible consequences in the physical\n⁷⁴ UN Charter Art 2, para 4.\n⁷⁵ Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ (2012) 30 Berkeley J Intl L 525.

The Tallinn Manual outlines criteria including severity, spontaneity, directness, intrusiveness, quantification, and presumptive legitimacy to evaluate cyberattack consequences against those of conventional attacks.⁸¹ If a cyberattack exhibits sufficient resemblance to these criteria, broadening the prohibition on force is warranted.⁸² Despite the United States' emphasis on consequences over methodology, modern society's heavy reliance on computer systems raises concerns about incapacitating physical infrastructure without tangible destruction.⁸³\nThe SolarWinds incident underscores the importance of characterizing cyberattacks as casus belli. SolarWinds, a company serving a vast clientele including major US government agencies, fell victim to cyber-attacks that compromised the integrity of their data. While some argue these attacks do not meet the casus belli threshold and constitute espionage,⁸⁴ distinguishing between cyber-attacks and espionage remains challenging. Responses to cyber espionage must be strategized akin to other cyberattacks, especially in cases like supply chain attacks, where damage control may overshadow the actors' intent.⁸⁵ While cyber espionage typically does not warrant casus belli, it may do so if aimed at undermining a state's political and social institutions.⁸⁶ The intertwining of espionage and operational access in incidents like SolarWinds raises concerns about latent vulnerabilities and potential future attacks of unprecedented magnitude.

The declaration of SolarWinds as a casus belli hinges on the interpretation by relevant authorities, as exemplified by the French government's stance on cyberattacks causing system collapse.87 Therefore, if United States authorities deem SolarWinds attacks as a casus belli, access to critical systems by hackers can warrant such a classification.88\n## 3.3 Self-Defence in the International Law of Cyberattack\nCyber self-defense reactions that are similar to armed attacks must fulfill proportionality,89 necessity, and immediacy criteria.90 According to Article 51 of the UN Charter, 'Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.'91 The International Court of Justice in Nicaragua laid down that Article 51, like Articles 2(4) and 42 of the UN Charter, does not refer to specific weapons.92 Therefore, this rationale can be applied to cyber operations as well.\nAs a consequence, if a State is the target of a cyber-attack, it has the same right to employ force in self-defense as if it were attacked by armed forces.93 The ICJ has repeatedly found that the fundamental principles of 'individual', 'collective,' and 'self-defense' authorize only those means that are proportional to the armed assault and where it is reasonable to react with those measures. In the context of cyberattacks, ensuring proportionality requires a nuanced understanding of technical intricacies. For example, a cyber response coded into software demands extensive knowledge of potential targets, often obtained through conventional cyber exploitation methods.94 The Office of the Attorney General of California defined cyber exploitation as 'the non-consensual distribution or publication of intimate photos or videos\n87 Vindman (n 18).\n88 ibid.\n89 See generally on proportionality, Hensey A Fenton II, 'Proportionality and Its Applicability in the Realm of Cyber-Attacks' (2019) 29 Duke J Comp &amp; Intl L 335.\n90 Melzer (n 67).\n91 UN Charter art 51.

Prior to the establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, bilateral trade was seen as beneficial for increasing demand for local products and improving living standards.100 However, the implementation of GATT and subsequent efforts to regulate and harmonize international trade introduced complexities, particularly regarding the interpretation of terms like non-state actors, terrorism, the environment, and cybersecurity measures at the domestic and international levels.101 During Ministerial Conference 11 in 2017, 71 World Trade Organization (WTO) members, both developed and developing, issued a Joint Statement on Electronic Commerce, expressing their commitment to exploring future negotiations on the trade-related aspects of electronic commerce. Currently, negotiations involve 90 WTO members, with The Gambia\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\nbeing the latest addition. An updated negotiation text from November 2023, under Section C, addresses cybersecurity. It emphasizes the evolving nature of cyber threats and outlines measures for member states to enhance cybersecurity capabilities. These measures include building the capabilities of national entities responsible for cybersecurity incident response, collaborating to identify and mitigate malicious intrusions or dissemination of malicious code affecting electronic networks, addressing cybercrime, and sharing information for awareness and best practices.¹⁰²\n## 4.1 Legal Pitfalls in the Context of Digital Trade\nIn the sphere of international trade, cybersecurity measures are employed to address illegal data breaches by non-state actors that affect legitimate trading activities among WTO Member States. However, the cybersecurity countermeasures are often justified by the States based upon the general and security exceptions under the GATT and ‘General Agreement on Trade in Services Agreement (GATS)’. With the advent of the WTO Panel decision in Russia-Traffic in Transit, it is now well established that recourse to exceptions under the WTO is justiciable and not entirely self-judging.¹⁰³\nBuilding on this, the concept of ‘national security unilateralism,’ as delineated by Chaisse and Georgopoulos, reflects an emerging trend where states increasingly prioritize their national security interests, sometimes contravening established international economic norms.¹⁰⁴ A prominent example of this trend is the trade policies of the United States under the Trump administration, marked by unilateral tariff impositions that circumvent standard global trade procedures. This paradigm shift, moving away from a cooperative, rules-based approach in international economic relations to a more insular,\n¹⁰² WTO Electronic Commerce Negotiations Updated Consolidated Negotiating Text – November 2023 <https: img=\"\" pdf=\"\" wto_ji=\"\">\n¹⁰³ Panel Report, Russia – Traffic in Transit, WT/DS512/R, adopted April 2019; Dylan Geraets, ‘WTO Issues Ruling in Russia – Traffic in Transit: Measures Justified on National Security Grounds Are Justiciable’ (Mayer Brown, 8 April 2019) <https: 04=\"\" 2019=\"\" en=\"\" en=\"\" publications=\"\" wto-issues-ruling-in-russia-traffic-in-transit-measures-justified-on-national-security-grounds-are-justiciable#_edn2=\"\" www.mayerbrown.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023. A provision is self-judging when the members can decide whether and how this exception can be applied to the measure. On the one hand, it is non-justiciable when the issue cannot be subject to the findings of a WTO Panel or the adjudicative system. On the other hand, the provision is justiciable if the phrases ‘it considers’ and ‘necessary’ are not read together.\n¹⁰⁴ Julien Chaisse and Georgios Dimitropoulos, ‘Special Economic Zones in International Economic Law: Towards Unilateral Economic Law’ (2021) 24(2) JIEL 229–57.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:>\nQIAN\nsecurity-centric model, presents significant challenges to the traditional frameworks of international trade law.\nThe proliferation of digital trade raises concerns$^{105}$ pertaining to cross-border data flow, critical infrastructure of the trading countries, and vulnerability to cyberattacks, which can potentially lead to violation of trade obligations as envisaged under the GATT, GATS, and TBT Agreements. While the foundation of the GATT is based upon non-discrimination between domestic and foreign goods, an effective domestic policy to counter cyberattacks can result in restricting the access of certain suspicious manufacturers of goods to further participate in the supply chain.$^{106}$ The States have sought to justify these inherent trade-distorting measures based upon the general exception, under the GATT.\nSimilarly, in the context of the TBT Agreement, the Appellate Body in $EC - Asbestos$ held that where the risk associated with cross-border trade increases, the discretion of the Member States also increases in parallel.$^{107}$ Even under the GATS, Member States can take recourse to justify cybersecurity measures based upon the general and security exceptions although the scope of application of trade-restrictive measures is relatively less broad as compared to GATT. The regional free trade agreements have gone one step further by allowing commitments from reciprocating nations to allow the cross-border transfer of personal information and the restricted prohibition on the measures of data localization.\nWhile the security exceptions under the GATT and GATS are self-judging in nature, they are however not immune from panel review as highlighted in Russia – Traffic in Transit.$^{108}$ The general exceptions under the GATT and GATS are resorted to justify measures necessary to protect public morals or secure compliance with laws and regulations. Based upon these, the member nation must evidence whether the cybersecurity measure is ‘necessary’ in light of balancing the factors and whether less trade restricting alternatives are available.$^{109}$ It is, however, agreed to some extent that these\n105 Simon J Evenett and Johannes Fritz, ‘Mapping Policies Affecting Digital Trade’ (Global Trade Alert, 15 April 2021) <www.globaltradealert.org 68=\"\" reports=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n106 See Samm Sacks and others, ‘China’s Cybersecurity Reviews for “Critical” Systems Add Focus on Supply Chain, Foreign, Control’ (New America, 2020) <https: cbina=\"\" china-cybersecurity-reviews-critical-systems-add-focus-supply-chain-foreign-control-translation=\"\" blog=\"\" cybersecurityinitiative=\"\" digichina=\"\" www.newamerica.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 25 November 2023.\n107 Appellate Body Report, $EC - Asbestos$, WT/DS135/AB/R, adopted April 2001.\n108 Panel Report, Russia – Traffic in Transit, WT/DS512/R, adopted April 2019.\n109 Appellate Body Report, Brazil – Measures Affecting Imports of Retreaded Tyres, WT/DS332/AB/R, adopted December 2007.

Consequently, cooperation amongst Member States must be achieved to establish suitable standards such that the measures result in minimum trade distortion. On a preliminary level, it is essential that world governments agree upon a uniform understanding of the nature and scope of cybersecurity measures and the risks posed by them towards international trade. The domestic and international standard-setting organizations can prescribe certain standards for usage and regulation of cybersecurity measures in line with the ISO and IEC standards on cybersecurity.[110]\nThe WTO has made efforts to regulate cybercrime through initiatives such as the Consolidated E-Commerce Negotiating Text circulated in December 2020.[111] The most controversial clause in the document is a broad exception that has been proposed to be incorporated into the negotiated text.[112] This exception allows Member States to freely adopt measures, notwithstanding the obligations under the agreement, to guarantee cybersecurity, safeguard cyberspace sovereignty safeguard the lawful rights and interests of the citizens, juridical persons, and other organizations, and achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives.\"[113] The only limitation to this broad power is that the measures taken must not be arbitrary or discriminatory; they must\nRequirement case significantly clarifies the application of the national security exception in WTO law, particularly by establishing that such exceptions are not entirely self-judging and subject to review (United States – Origin Marking Requirement, WT/DS597/10, Panel report under appeal on 26 January 2023). It underscores the necessity for concrete evidence to justify invoking national security, thereby narrowing the scope for its arbitrary use in trade disputes.

Further, these measures must not be 'a disguised restriction on trade' and should not be 'more than necessary' to attain the objective.¹¹⁴ While the official text of this clause remains unavailable, leaked information provides insights into its content. Despite references to the negotiating text on the WTO's official website, it remains inaccessible to the public.¹¹⁵ Nevertheless, preliminary observations can be made based on the leaked information.\nWhile the exception provides visibility to cybersecurity issues and nation-states with the autonomy to design rigorous cybersecurity mechanisms, the exception is not a comprehensive regulation of cybersecurity and is only an enabling provision. Cyber-security measures remain the prerogative of Member States to keep in place. As a result, there remains a lack of comprehensive regulation of cyber-related issues in international trade. This status quo is especially concerning in a vital and ever-growing area like e-commerce. How this exception will be invoked by Member States remains to be seen but backlash based on information freedom concerns can certainly be anticipated. Further, the exception could also prove to be overbroad. The exception, apart from empowering Member States to take cybersecurity-related measures, allows any measures taken to achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives'. Such a vague enabling provision could lead to disastrous consequences, which could undermine the foundations of international trade. The term 'public policy', typically used in relation to international commercial arbitration, has been held by numerous judgments to be an 'unruly horse'.¹¹⁶ Due to the inherent lack of a precise definition, arbitration scholars have found the concept to be excessively malleable, shaped by the subjective values and principles in each nation.¹¹⁷ Adding to the existing uncertainty around cyber-attacks and cyber-security, the insertion of an unruly horse that is 'public policy', would certainly be undesirable. The text must be revised to include a definition of public policy, or at the least illustrations of the term.\nMoreover, the establishment of standards alone is insufficient; robust compliance and enforcement mechanisms are necessary at the national level.

Lastly, regulatory bodies must adhere to good regulatory practices to ensure accountability and transparency in their actions.¹¹⁹ It should be further noted that on 20 June 2023, the European Commission and the High Representative published a Joint Communication on a European Economic Security Strategy, to minimize the risks to economic security in the context of increased geopolitical tensions and accelerated technological shifts, while preserving maximum levels of economic openness and dynamism. The Strategy proposes a thorough assessment of risks to economic security include physical and cyber security of critical infrastructure.¹²⁰\n## 5 International Investment Law and the Dynamics of Cybersecurity\nCountries with significant infrastructure development often attract substantial foreign investments from multinational corporations. However, infrastructure encompasses not only physical structures but also digital infrastructure, which plays a crucial role in attracting foreign direct investments (FDI). The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of workplaces, leading to increased reliance on digital assets such as fiber networks and broadband connectivity.¹²¹ Consequently, enhancing a nation's digital infrastructure can attract more FDI, particularly from e-commerce and technology companies.\nNumerous prominent companies globally possess trade secrets and intellectual property rights crucial for their commercial viability. Cyber hackers pose a significant threat by potentially dismantling these assets within a short span, thereby jeopardizing not only the company's survival but also the broader economy. Emphasizing a robust cybersecurity framework becomes imperative as a prerequisite for engaging in any business endeavor. States\n¹¹⁸ Shin-yi Peng, “Private” Cybersecurity Standards?

According to the UNCTAD report, e-commerce transactions amounted to over USD 29 trillion by 2017, constituting approximately 36% of global GDP. As the world increasingly embraces data-driven technology, the centrality of effective data governance becomes ever more apparent.¹²⁴\nThe evolution of international trade towards digital platforms has exposed nation-states to new challenges, particularly cyberattacks, which pose threats to data integrity. One key question is whether cyberattacks should be considered acts of war. Given that virtually all industries are potential targets for cyber hackers, a unified and international solution is necessary to address this problem. Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) could serve as a means to tackle this emerging issue. BITs provide fundamental protections to foreign investments and offer various dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration. Integrating substantive protection against cybercrimes into BITs would enhance the accountability of states and incentivize them to adopt robust data protection laws. This approach could contribute to mitigating the risks posed by cyberattacks in the context of international investment.\n## 5.1 Digital Assets as Emerging Investments\nThe initial task for investors is to ascertain whether digital assets meet the criteria to qualify as 'covered investments' under BITs. As investment tribunals grapple with claims related to cybercrime, they will face the challenge of addressing investment law policy arguments. Extending BIT provisions to encompass such crimes will inevitably entail implications for both investors\n¹²² ‘A Roadmap for Cross Border Data Flows: Future-Proofing Readiness and Cooperation in the New Data Economy: White Paper’ (World Economic Forum, 9 June 2020) <www3.we forum.org 2020.pdf=\"\" docs=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_Cross_Border_Data_Flows_2020.=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_cross_border_data_flows_2020.pdf=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n¹²³ Marina Dane, ‘Digitalisation, Trade, and Geopolitics in Asia’ (2020) <www.kas.de 2020=\"\" 8314289=\"\" documents=\"\" digitalisation%2c+trade%2c+and+geopolitics+in+asia.pdf=\"\" www.kas.de=\"\">/3bf29911-2dcb-6e72-d4aa-936f9b5082d0?version=1.0&amp;t=1608181259722&gt; accessed 19 October 2021.\n¹²⁴ Aaronson and Struett (n 66); ‘Global e-Commerce Sales Surged to $29 Trillion’ (UNCTAD Press Release, 29 March 2019) <https: global-e-commerce-sales-surged-29-trillion=\"\" press-material=\"\" unctad.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.kas.de></www3.we>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n321\nand States, and defining the jurisdiction of investment tribunals over such claims will prove to be challenging. Furthermore, to invoke the BIT regime, investors must establish the presence of an investment and demonstrate that it has been made within the territory of the host State. With regards to the existence of investment, tribunals have previously construed intangible assets like intellectual property rights and administrative rights as falling within the scope of investment. Given the liberal approach adopted thus far, digital assets may feasibly be encompassed within this definition. It is foreseeable that investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) claims concerning this issue will proliferate, particularly as foreign investment in digital firms – providing services such as e-commerce platforms and online payment support – continues to escalate.\nTribunals have typically referenced the definition provided in BITs and objective economic criteria to ascertain whether an investment has been established, contrasting it with a mere commercial transaction. In interpreting BIT provisions, tribunals often turn to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, which outlines the general rule for interpreting treaty provisions, taking into consideration the purpose of the BIT and its other provisions. Certain BITs, such as the German Model BIT, employ a broad asset-based definition of investment, encompassing phrases like ‘every kind of asset’, thereby potentially encompassing digital assets as well.\nWhen considering the inclusion of digital assets within the definition of an asset, it is crucial to carefully delineate the concept of digital assets itself. The primary concern regarding digital assets pertains to the data they encapsulate, which holds both intrinsic and extrinsic value. The economic worth of digital assets is intricately linked to their data content, with the value of a digital asset being inherently tied to the data it contains. Intrinsic value pertains to the core data itself, while extrinsic value encompasses additional elements such as customer metadata, which companies often monetize significantly. Furthermore, there exists a symbiotic relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic value, akin to the seeds and flesh of a fruit, respectively. While not all BITs offer a broad definition of investment, it is advisable to establish a clear understanding of digital assets within the context of investment arbitration to mitigate the risk of numerous arbitration claims stemming from uncertainties in this regard.\nApart from the definition of an investment, there are other factors that can affect the inclusion of digital assets under the definition of covered investments, such as economic factors.¹²⁵ If the definition of investment\n¹²⁵ Enikő Horváth and Severin Klinkmüller, ‘The Concept of “Investment” in the Digital Economy: The Case of Social Media Companies’ (2019) 20 JWIT 577, 593.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nprovided under Article 25 (1) ICSID is relied on, digital assets might very well be excluded as a covered investment. Therefore, a broad definition in the BIT would be ideal to bring digital assets within the investment arbitration regime. There are various definitions of investment in BITs which particularly limit the definition of investment by making it mandatory for investments to have some connection with economic factors such as expectations of profits or assumption of risk. For instance, in the case of Romak SA v Uzbekistan, the Tribunal adopted a restrictive approach in interpreting the definition of an investment.[126] It's essential for investment tribunals to recognize that digital companies often operate under long-term business models, where the initial investment is directed towards research and development.[127] These companies may take a considerable period to generate revenue, distinguishing them from single commercial transactions.[128]\nAnother pertinent issue relates to the requirement of a territorial link in various BITs, stipulating that investments must be made within the territory of the host State. Establishing the territorial presence of digital assets poses inherent challenges.[129] Jonathan Bick's categorization of digital assets into possession, location, and control underscores the importance of these factors in establishing a territorial link between the State and the investment. In Abaclat v Argentina,[130] the Tribunal emphasized that the nature of the investment is crucial in determining its location, focusing on how the funds were ultimately utilized rather than where they were initially disbursed. This interpretation helps alleviate some of the challenges in proving digital assets as covered investments. In Wena Hotel v Egypt, the Tribunal affirmed that expropriation encompasses both tangible and intangible assets, including digital\n126 Romak SA (Switzerland) v The Republic of Uzbekistan, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No AA280, November 26, 2009, [2009] IIC 400.\n127 Pranay Ahlawat and others, 'How Software Companies Can Get More Bang for Their R &amp; D Buck' (BCG, 22 November 2019) <www.bcg.com 2019=\"\" en-in=\"\" publications=\"\" software-companies-using-research-and-development-more=\"\"> accessed 19 October 2021.\n128 Aaron Holmes, 'From Snapchat to Uber, These are the Tech Companies Worth Billions Despite Never Turning a Profit' (Business Insider India, 27 November 2019) <www.businessinsider.in 72263380.cms=\"\" articleshow=\"\" from-snapchat-to-uber-these-are-the-tech-companies-worth-billions-despite-never-turning-a-profit=\"\" news=\"\" tech=\"\" www.businessinsider.in=\"\"> accessed 19 October 2021.\n129 However, such a difficulty will not be fatal per se; See Dinstein (n 107) 596.

Since the assumption of control does not imply that the property has been acquired by the government, compensation should be paid under international law, indicating that the owner was deprived of their fundamental right of ownership of the property.¹³³\n## 5.2 Investment Claims in the Age of Cybersecurity\nThe central concern in this context revolves around whether investors can pursue claims against states for cybercrimes.¹³⁴ Studies from 2017 indicate that a single data breach can cost a company up to USD 3.62 million on average. The severity of costs varies depending on factors like the type and volume of data stolen; for instance, the leakage of trade secrets could pose an existential threat to a company. The principle of ‘Fair and Equitable Treatment’ (FET) is pivotal in this regard, as it obliges states to provide investors with essential conditions, potentially enabling investors to lodge claims for cybercrimes.\nTribunals typically assess whether state actions are arbitrary under FET provisions by referencing core principles.¹³⁵ Regarding digital assets, FET claims may challenge alterations in measures related to national cybersecurity. ‘Transparency’ plays a crucial role for investors conducting business in a host state, and states are obligated to maintain transparency. While states have\n¹³¹ Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000) para 98.\n¹³² Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/84/3, Award (1992) para 164.\n¹³³ Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v TAMS-AFFA Consulting, 225 6 IRAN-US CTR 219.\n¹³⁴ Julien Chaisse and Cristen Bauer, ‘Cybersecurity and the Protection of Digital Assets: Assessing the Role of International Investment Law and Arbitration’ (2019) 21 Vand J Ent &amp; Tech L 549, 568.\n¹³⁵ In Glamis Gold Ltd v United States, Award, IIC 380 (2009), it is mentioned that ‘fair and equitable treatment encompasses a universe of “fundamental” principles common throughout the world that include “the duty to act in good faith, due process, transparency and candor, and fairness and protection from arbitrariness’. In MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004), the Tribunal agreed with a legal opinion by Judge Schwebel that fair and equitable treatment encompassed such fundamental standards as good faith, due process, non-discrimination and proportionality.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nthe right to amend laws concerning national cybersecurity to achieve public policy objectives, such changes must not be inconsistent, as demonstrated in the case of PSEG Global v Republic of Turkey.¹³⁶ In this case, Turkey's frequent changes to the law were deemed to create uncertainty for investors, violating FET provisions.\nAnother relevant case involving the implementation of inconsistent policies by a state is MTD Equity v Republic of Chile.¹³⁷ The tribunal ruled that Chile violated FET provisions by adopting contradictory positions with the investor regarding data localization policies. Chile's support for these policies on national security grounds increased costs for foreign investors. Similarly, data localization policies initiated by the Vietnamese government have been challenged by tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Google on economic and human rights grounds. Regarding claims related to Denial of Justice, these typically entail the right to be heard. Such a right is infringed when the cyber legislation of the host state fails to provide effective opportunities for all parties to present their case.\nIn addition to the aforementioned considerations, claims may also arise based on the Full Protection and Security standard (FPS). These claims encompass not only threats from armed rebels but also modern dangers posed by cybercriminals. Cyberattacks can compromise the three primary pillars of security: confidentiality, availability, and integrity. A claim under FPS due to a cyberattack can be sustained if it can be demonstrated that the security assured by the host State extends beyond physical protection. Factors such as the standard liability of the host State and the potential overlap between FPS and FET provisions are also pivotal in determining whether the investment was deprived of legal protection.\nThe definition of investment has evolved over time, and similarly, the application of FPS has expanded. An investor can succeed in their claim even in the absence of a physical attack, as exemplified in the case of Azurix v Argentina,¹³⁸ where the host State was deemed responsible for providing an overall safe environment to investors. Given that digital assets predominantly fall under the category of intangible assets, they can be interpreted to meet the criteria of covered investments, thus availing the protection of FPS provisions in BITs.\n¹³⁶ PSEG Global Inc v Republic of Turkey, ICSID Case No ARB/02/5, Award (2007) paras 248–256.\n¹³⁷ MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Republic of Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004) para 189.\n¹³⁸ Azurix Corp v Argentina, ICSID Case No ARB/01/12, Award (2004) para 408.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n325\nStates are obligated to protect investments, necessitating them to exercise due diligence. In the realm of cybersecurity, a State can fulfill this obligation by ratifying agreements like the Budapest Convention, known for its comprehensive approach to cybercrime cooperation. The lack of protection for investors often stems from a deficiency in international cooperation. Regarding the interplay between FPS and FET, it primarily concerns legal security. Tribunals have ruled that a breach of the FET standard does not necessarily entail a breach of FPS, as seen in cases like Wena Hotels LTD v Egypt¹³⁹ and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v Ecuador.¹⁴⁰\nIn instances where host States lack cyber laws, courts have applied analogical reasoning, drawing from laws related to privacy and theft. However, if domestic courts fail to apply such principles and a void in cybersecurity laws persists, this absence could be deemed a violation of the FPS standard. The FPS standard underscores the State's duty to furnish investors with an adequate legal framework for protection. Intangible assets, if deemed investments under the relevant BIT, can be subject to expropriation, including indirect expropriation resulting in asset depreciation. Addressing these issues requires enhancing the contents of BITs by expanding the definition of investment to encompass digital assets. States must recognize that safeguarding investors from cybercrime not only benefits investors but also preserves the economy and the privacy of citizens, serving the public interest of the host State. Incorporating cyberattacks under the FPS provision in BITs can compel host States to fulfill their obligation and shield investors from cyber threats, which have the potential to devastate companies in an instant. Therefore, it is imperative to prohibit these detrimental criminal actions.\n## 5.3 National Security Exceptions in Investment Law\nVarious international investment agreements incorporate exceptions,¹⁴¹ including those related to national security. This exception grants host States the authority to implement precautionary measures. However, there is considerable debate within the Investor ISDS regime regarding the basis for invoking this national security exception. Some argue that it is a self-judging provision prone to arbitrary use by States, while others contend that it is based on necessity. From the perspective of host countries, national security interests are\n¹³⁹ Wena Hotels LTD v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000).\n¹⁴⁰ Occidental Exploration and Production Company v The Republic of Ecuador, LCIA Case No UN3467 (1976).\n¹⁴¹ Katia Yannaca-Small, 'Essential Security Interests under International Investment Law', in OECD (ed.), International Investment Perspectives: Freedom of Investment in a Changing World (2007).\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\ndeemed significant, both for developed and developing nations. Developed countries often invoke national security interests in response to attempted takeovers of industries, whereas developing countries may do so during economic crises.^[142]^\nHowever, prior to invoking this exception, States should adhere to the requirement of explicit good faith. Regular reviews should be conducted to assess the ongoing necessity of upholding security-related investment restrictions. In the author's view, all these remedies prevent this exception of national security from becoming a mere 'black and white' matter and a different solution should be adopted which can balance the rights of the contracting parties and foreign investors. Hence, the threat to cybersecurity such as cyber-attacks should be covered under the umbrella of national security. By invoking these exceptions, the States are likely to take certain measures to prevent these crimes that would violate the international investment agreements and would be able to justify such measures under existing exceptions.\n## 6 Making the Linkages: Nuclear Proliferation and Cyberattacks\nIn contemporary times, parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation are frequently drawn, owing to the escalating threat that cyberattacks pose to global security and diplomacy.^[143]^ Cybersecurity has transcended local boundaries to become a matter of international concern, impacting peace and security on a global scale. However, existing international law inadequately addresses these cybersecurity threats, necessitating the establishment of more robust and effective regulations. A recent report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) highlighted the strategic risks posed by cyberattacks, underscoring the urgent need for the introduction of a cybersecurity treaty. The international community must recognize and address the risks posed by cybersecurity, analogous to the approach taken with non-proliferation agreements.\nNuclear non-proliferation aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and associated delivery systems, with the overarching goal of averting nuclear conflict or catastrophe in the future. Conversely, cyberattacks encompass malicious attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or valuable data. The proliferation of cyberattacks has raised concerns among financial institutions, corporations, and governments regarding their potential\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n327\nimpact on financial and economic systems, prioritizing cyber risk alongside geopolitical and economic risks.¹⁴⁴\nAs technology becomes increasingly integral to government, institutional, and personal operations, parallels between nuclear and cyber threats become apparent. For instance, the NC3 systems of nuclear-armed governments heavily rely on digital processors and computers, rendering them vulnerable to hacking and cyberattacks. Moreover, the nuclear force infrastructure encompasses weapons, launch sites, and command authorities interconnected through communication and data processing technologies, facilitating cyber vulnerabilities. Despite the reluctance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to address the convergence of nuclear and cyber threats, scholars and non-governmental experts have extensively documented their interactions. Without stronger protections against cyberattacks and illegal hacking, the realm of nuclear weapons and security remains susceptible to exploitation.\n## 6.1 Comparative Analysis of Legal Frameworks\nEfforts in nuclear non-proliferation have spanned approximately fifty years, originating in the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. The earliest initiatives began within the UN, with Article 11(1) of the UN Charter emphasizing the preservation of international peace and security.¹⁴⁵ A significant development during this period was the conclusion of the Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) in 1963,¹⁴⁶ although some countries abstained from signing due to perceived weaknesses in its provisions, notably the absence of international control mechanisms or spot inspections.¹⁴⁷\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis highlighted the need for a comprehensive framework to address nuclear proliferation. Consequently, the NPT was signed in 1968 by 62 countries, including nuclear weapon states like the US. Notably, China and France refrained from signing initially. The NPT came\n¹⁴⁴ Stéphane Lhuissier and Fabien Tripier, *A Measure of the Evolution of Cyber Risk* (17 December 2021) <https: blog-entry=\"\" blocnotesdeleco.banque-france.fr=\"\" measure-evolution-cyber-risk=\"\" en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n¹⁴⁵ Then, in 1946, the Atomic Energy Commission was set up to recommend measures for controlling atomic energy. In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was created with the goal of promoting and overseeing to promote and oversee the peaceful use of nuclear technology.\n¹⁴⁶ The PTBT can be viewed as the first global and formal attempt towards non-proliferation. At first, the Treaty was only ratified by the USSR, the US, and the UK.\n¹⁴⁷ For instance, China conducted Project 596 in 1964, which was its first atom bomb test. Due to its relatively small audience, and the fact that even its signatories continued to defy it, the PTBT was largely a failure.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\ninto force in 1970, categorizing countries into nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states,¹⁴⁸ with the former defined as those that conducted nuclear tests before January 1967. Subsequent developments included the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, such as the Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America, and agreements like the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT-I) between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.¹⁴⁹\nFollowing the end of the Cold War in 1991, efforts in non-proliferation intensified, with particular focus on strengthening the NPT. The revelation of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program after the Gulf War prompted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to introduce the Model Additional Protocol, enhancing its access to information and nuclear facilities. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 1996 marked a significant milestone, prohibiting all nuclear explosions and providing for on-site inspections and confidence-building measures.\nIn recent years, cybercrime and cyberattacks have emerged as significant threats to international security, paralleling the concerns posed by nuclear proliferation in the past. Analogous to the NPT for nuclear issues, there is a growing need for a comprehensive treaty addressing cybercrime, regulation of the internet, and law enforcement procedures for cross-border investigations. These issues carry profound implications for human rights, economic systems, and national security. International cooperation is crucial in developing effective regulatory frameworks for cyberspace,¹⁵⁰ fostering confidence among stakeholders and ensuring a secure digital environment.\n## 6.2 Lessons from Nuclear Law for Cyber Regulation\nThe NPT is a three-part global pact intended at restricting the spread of nuclear weapons: (1) non-proliferation, (2) disarmament, and (3) peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The basic tenets of the treaty include the principle that nuclear weapons will not be acquired by States that do not have them, nuclear-weapon States will pursue disarmament, and all States have access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes under safeguards.\nAccording to Article IX of the NPT, 'nuclear weapon states (NWS)' are those that have detonated a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967,\n¹⁴⁸ Following suit, states of the South Pacific established an NWFZ in 1985, Southeast Asia in 1995, Africa in 1996, and Central Asia in 2006.\n¹⁴⁹ Seven years later, SALT-I was followed up by the signing of SALT-II by these two nations, which further limited their nuclear capabilities.\n¹⁵⁰ Deborah Brown, 'Cybercrime is Dangerous, But a New UN Treaty Could Be Worse for Rights' (13 August 2021) <https: 08=\"\" 13=\"\" 2021=\"\" cybercrime-dangerous-new-un-treaty-could-be-worse-rights=\"\" news=\"\" www.hrw.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n329\nwhich includes China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These nuclear-weapon States are prohibited from transferring nuclear weapons to any recipient and from assisting, encouraging, or inducing any non-NWS to produce or acquire them. Non-nuclear weapons nations are similarly prohibited from receiving or manufacturing nuclear weapons from any source.¹⁵¹ Additionally, the Treaty mandates that all Parties must pursue talks on effective measures for nuclear disarmament and a treaty on general and comprehensive disarmament under international control. States retain the right to develop, produce, and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, provided such activities comply with the treaty's non-proliferation provisions. Moreover, the NPT allows groups of nations to enter into regional agreements to ensure the absence of nuclear weapons on their respective territories, known as nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties. The treaty also establishes mechanisms for periodic review and assessment of its implementation, as outlined in Article VIII.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) supplements the NPT and includes a Protocol detailing the International Monitoring System (IMS), On-Site Inspections (OSI), and Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs). The CTBT prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, with provisions for redressing violations, ensuring compliance, and periodic review of its effectiveness.\nPresident John F. Kennedy's infamous fear in the 1960s, that 20 or perhaps 30 'Nuclear-Weapon States (NWSs)' would arise within a decade, did not come true. The number of nuclear powers or governments with active nuclear weapons programmes remains at ten even now. The NPT recognises five of them as lawful nuclear weapons possessors, which corresponds to the permanent five members of the 'UN Security Council (UNSC)'. Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are all said to have nuclear weapons or have demonstrated it through testing. Iran has long been accused of pursuing a zealous nuclear weapons development. In contrast, no less than 26 governments have renounced or been forced to abandon their pursuit of nuclear weapons, having completed feasibility studies, targeted weapon research or even development, or manufactured nuclear weapons (or inherited them following the collapse of the Soviet Union). Almost the whole phalanx of middle powers is made\n¹⁵¹ There are gaps in the current treaty framework. Firstly, there is the issue of countries like India, Pakistan, and Israel not joining the NPT. This leads to a significant amount of unsafeguarded nuclear activity. Another concern is that countries signatory may develop nuclear fuel cycle facilities and then subsequently opt-out of the Treaty as North Korea did. To avoid this, stronger and more regular inspection measures need to be enforced within the Treaty mechanism, with the aid of international bodies.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nup of these countries. When one considers that the CTBT names out 44 'nuclear capable' governments whose ratification is necessary before the treaty can be implemented, the miracle of non-proliferation becomes even greater. By comparing the 'before' and 'after,' we may obtain a sense of the consequences of international norms. The vast majority of 'nuclear aspirants' began their nuclear programmes before the NPT was signed. After the NPT was opened for signing, only Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, and (perhaps) Syria developed their programmes. Surprisingly, none of these nations were democracies at the time the pact was drafted. On the contrary, the vast majority of 'renouncers' halted their programmes during or after the discussions. As a result, for most of them, the NPT signified the line beyond which nuclear weapons ambitions lost their legitimacy.\nThe reliance of nuclear-armed governments, including the US, on computerized Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems underscores a critical vulnerability. These systems, integral to every aspect of nuclear force management, operate within cyberspace, making them susceptible to hacking and cyberattacks. NC3 systems encompass a network of communication and data-processing technologies linking weapons, radar systems, launch sites, and senior authorities responsible for nuclear decision-making. Despite extensive cybersecurity measures, the complexity and diversity of these systems render them inherently vulnerable, with numerous potential points of attack. Moreover, emerging technologies such as cyber capabilities, hypersonics, and encryption have the dual potential of exacerbating conflicts within the framework of the NPT while also offering avenues for achieving its objectives. While the NPT has been slow to address these evolving challenges, academia and non-governmental organizations have extensively studied their implications for nuclear issues. However, there remains a significant gap between civil society's engagement with emerging technologies and their integration into the NPT framework.[152]\nGiven its role as both a treaty and a forum, the NPT holds particular importance in addressing these challenges. States parties to the NPT have legal obligations regarding nuclear technology proliferation, making it essential\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nto consider the impact of emerging technologies on treaty compliance and verification. The NPT review process provides a unique opportunity for nuclear‐possessor and non‐possessor states to discuss and address a wide range of issues affecting nuclear order and treaty obligations. In light of these considerations, emerging technologies should be incorporated into all nuclear and non‐nuclear disarmament agreements, including the CTBT, the Conference on Disarmament (CD), and nuclear‐weapon‐free zones. However, the NPT, with its comprehensive legal framework and review mechanism, stands as a pivotal platform for addressing the challenges posed by emerging technologies to nuclear disarmament and non‐proliferation efforts.\nEdward Ifft highlights the CTBT innovative approach to addressing the challenge of unequal capacity among State parties to collect and evaluate data about compliance. The treaty establishes an IMS, comprising 337 globally distributed sites equipped with seismic, radionuclide, hydroacoustic, and infrared sensors. Ifft suggests that most States lack the resources to independently acquire and analyze this data. However, individual State parties can access professional technical analysis of IMS data and other relevant information free of charge from an international data center in Vienna. Drawing on the collaborative IMS model proposed by the CTBT, Ifft proposes the development of a Joint Attribution Mechanism (JAM) to assist nations with limited cyber forensic capabilities in collecting and analyzing data for attribution purposes. Such a mechanism could serve as a cost‐effective solution, encouraging nations to participate in a cyber treaty. Additionally, a JAM would enhance the credibility and legitimacy of the attribution process for nations with advanced cyber forensic capabilities. Ensuring reliable attribution is essential, but it is equally important to establish consistent consequences for cyber aggressors. This highlights the need for effective mechanisms to punish those responsible for cyberattacks consistently.\n## Conclusion\nThis article underscores the profound complexities and pressing challenges in the domain of cybersecurity, especially when viewed through the prism of international law. The pernicious implications of cyberattacks are ever more pertinent in an era increasingly dominated by digital data and connectivity. While the international community grapples with defining and responding to these cyber threats, our existing legal frameworks, rooted in conventional\nphysical paradigms, are inadequately equipped to address this novel form of virtual aggression.\nThe current structure of international law does not encapsulate an all-encompassing definition of cyberattacks, making it a precarious space in need of robust codification. The disruption wrought by cyberattacks on WTO agreements is even more deleterious, given the outdated security exceptions that remain unresponsive to risk-based cybersecurity measures. Moreover, the burgeoning surge in FDIs in digital assets, primarily intangible, exposes another lacuna in international law, conspicuously absent in contemporary investment treaties. These considerations underscore an imminent need to institute measures to mitigate the manifold issues arising from cyberattacks.\nPublic international law must evolve to address the specific nuances of cyberattacks and the consequent implications on State sovereignty, transborder crime, and national security. The ascendance of cyber aggression necessitates a re-examination of the fundamental tenets of international law, including the principles of Jus Ad Bellum and Jus In Bello, with a more nuanced lens. The complexities of attribution and the abstract nature of cyber warfare necessitate a shift in how we perceive sovereignty and territoriality in the digital age.\nIn the sphere of WTO law, the advent of cyber threats and the expansion of digital economies call for a revamp of trade rules and exceptions. It is crucial to establish a harmonized understanding of cybersecurity risks and potential countermeasures, with a balanced approach to cyber governance and free trade. Thus, a common vision is the need of the hour to work in collaboration internationally for ensuring cybersecurity and keeping cybercrimes at bay. The establishment of the Trade and Technology Council by the United States and the European Union represents a promising development in the quest for global consensus on trade and technology issues. This initiative holds the potential to facilitate increased collaboration and the harmonization of regulations across international borders.\nFinally, as cyberattacks increasingly target financial assets and systems, the role of investment law becomes paramount. The rise of data-driven businesses necessitates safeguarding digital assets and investments, requiring innovative legal mechanisms such as ‘digital-ready' BITs. Re-envisioning BITs to include digital assets, whilst establishing the scope of security provisions under the FET clause, can address potential investment claims from cyber risks. This would balance the need for a stable investment environment with the protection of digital assets, thereby fostering confidence amongst investors in the digital era.\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n333\nConclusively, the international legal community faces the arduous task of negotiating the fine line between national security, economic prosperity, and individual rights in the realm of cyberspace. As we stride further into the digital era, there is an urgent necessity for a comprehensive and balanced global legal framework to govern cybersecurity. Through learning from and building upon existing mechanisms such as nuclear non-proliferation treaties, we can forge a path towards establishing robust, comprehensive international rules to regulate cyberattacks. This challenge, albeit monumental, is imperative for the security and prosperity of nations in the evolving digital landscape.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333",

In its literal sense, cybersecurity can be termed as the practice of protecting or securing a network, server, or electronic device from any external intruders, targeted attackers, or malicious opportunists. 'Cybersecurity' refers to the protection from damage, unauthorized use, or exploitation of the information contained in electronic systems to maintain their integrity and confidentiality. In a nutshell, cybersecurity strives to protect sensitive information or the digital information system (that stores such sensitive information) against targeted security risks. This practice is crucial as it helps in preserving and maintaining the integrity or privacy of data.\nThe 'International Organization for Standardization (ISO)' and 'International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)', in ISO/ERC 27000 (Information\n O A Hathaway and others, 'The Law of Cyber-Attack' (2012) 100 (4) Cal L Rev 817.

An individual or a group can carry out such an act. Furthermore, an act of this magnitude could also be conducted by the State or an independent criminal. Cyberattacks can be analyzed through four primary criteria. Firstly, they possess the capacity to manipulate, destroy, or exfiltrate data, rendering them inherently disruptive and unpredictable. Their origin may be domestic or foreign, introducing complexities in attribution. Secondly, the nature of the perpetrator varies, ranging from individual criminals to organized groups or entities. Thirdly, the impact of cyberattacks is predominantly virtual, encompassing data loss or manipulation, which significantly diminishes the affected data’s commercial value. Moreover, attacks on critical infrastructure can precipitate severe disruptions to essential services. Lastly, the attribution of cyberattacks to state actors presents challenges, necessitating substantial evidence to establish\n IBM Services, ‘What is a Cyber-attack?’ (IBM, 11 November 2020) <www.ibm.com by-services=\"\" business-continuity=\"\" cyberattack#:~:text=\"The%20most%20well%2Dknown%20type,malware%20may%20not%20be%20immediate\" in-en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.

There are several definitions produced by scholars, research organizations, and private enterprises. However, there is a need for a uniform/consensual legal definition to the term cyberattacks. Two definitions are frequently cited. The National Institute of Standards and Technology–Computer Security Resource Center: defines cyberattack as ‘[a]n attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information’. Secondly, the National Research Council’s Committee on Offensive Information Warfare defines cyber-attacks as ‘[e]fforts to alter, disrupt, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information or programs on them’.

For instance, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack attributed to the 'Guardians of Peace' raised suspicions of North Korean involvement, yet conclusive evidence remained elusive.\nThere is a major concern if these attacks can be attributed to a State;[7] such State attributable attacks would be considered, by virtue of 'Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter,' to be a volatile use of force.[8] The sovereignty of a State is transgressed when it falls prey to such attacks.[9] Attribution in cyberattacks poses significant challenges beyond simply identifying the responsible actor. Key issues include the lack of consensus on the required standards of proof, the debate over whether attributions should be made publicly or kept confidential, and the ambiguity surrounding the legal consequences of successful attribution. Additionally, while public attributions can serve purposes such as deterring future attacks and holding perpetrators accountable, they may also escalate tensions and risk revealing sensitive intelligence sources.[10] There might be a notable loss of information or reduction in its value which could pose significant threats to the economy and national security.[11] Due to their inherent characteristics, cyberattacks present a global challenge. Distinctively differing from conventional physical assaults, these cyber intrusions are swift, transcend borders, and exhibit no discernible pattern, rendering\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333</https:></www.iiss.org>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\ntheir prediction and management challenging. The United Nations General Assembly, in 2010, and the World Economic Forum, in 2019 have stressed the importance of cybersecurity by highlighting the global threat posed by cyberattacks. Consequently, there is burgeoning discourse surrounding the development of a cybersecurity treaty, paralleling established frameworks for managing other forms of strategic risk. However, crafting effective agreements necessitates a nuanced understanding of cyber incident typologies and their respective implications. Organizations such as the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) advocate for a comprehensive consideration of strategic risks inherent in cyber capabilities. Thus, addressing cyber threats mandates the formulation of holistic frameworks that reconcile national sovereignty, security imperatives, and international cooperation mandates.\nThis article draws upon theoretical foundations from international law, comparative law, and international relations to provide a thorough examination of the pressing issue of cyberattacks. Its conceptual framework illuminates the potential interpretation and development of international legal norms, compares distinct yet interconnected areas, and explores the broader geopolitical dimensions of this global challenge. By analyzing fundamental principles of international law – such as state sovereignty, the use of force, and state responsibility – within the context of cyber operations, the article raises critical questions about their applicability to emerging cyber realities. Furthermore, it employs comparative legal analysis to draw parallels between legal frameworks governing nuclear non-proliferation and potential cybersecurity frameworks, highlighting the importance of adapting existing legal mechanisms to address new challenges. Additionally, the article considers the roles of both state and non-state actors in cybercrimes and examines the geopolitical implications of attributing cyberattacks to states.\nThis article establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the challenges posed by cyberattacks and the ongoing pursuit of bolstered cybersecurity\n Marc Barrachin and Algirde Pipikaite, ‘We Need a Global Standard for Reporting Cyber Attacks’ (Harv Bus Rev, 8 November 2019) <https: 11=\"\" 2019=\"\" hbr.org=\"\" we-need-a-global-standard-for-reporting-cyber-attacks=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n United Nations General Assembly Res 64/211, ‘Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and Taking Stock of National Efforts to Protect Critical Information Infrastructures’ (17 March 2010) UN Doc A/RES/64/211.\n See Barrachin and Pipikaite (n 12).\n See Martha Finnermore and Duncan B Hollis, ‘Constructing Norms for Global Cybersecurity’ (2016) 110 AJIL 425.\n M Wohfeld and J Jasper, ‘Cyberattacks and Cyber Conflict: Where Is Conflict Resolution?’, in O Grech (ed), Contemporary Issues in Conflict Resolution (University of Malta 2018), 5–17.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\nwithin the domain of public international law. While clarity within general international law remains scarce, valuable insights can be gleaned from existing legal frameworks in international economic realms, such as international trade and investment law. The emergence of the cyber realm has introduced contemporary issues that challenge established norms and rules of international law, necessitating examination in terms of interpretation, application, and structure. Cyberattacks transcend mere technological phenomena, fundamentally reshaping traditional societal paradigms including concepts of capital[17] and warfare.[18] The article probes the adequacy of existing international legal and economic rules in defining cyberattacks and delineating breaches of established norms. It critically examines the efficacy of international law in regulating cyberattacks, recognizing the inherent complexities in defining and addressing such incidents. The article offers a nuanced definition of cyberattacks, recognizing their intricate nature that defies simple conceptualization. It contends that cyberattacks represent a modern manifestation of acts of war, a concept deeply rooted in international legal discourse spanning millennia. Exploring potential solutions, the article investigates the role of international economic law in mitigating cyber threats, particularly in safeguarding global data flows integral to contemporary globalization processes. Moreover, it delves into the potential applicability of investment treaties in regulating digital assets and scrutinizes existing parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation.[19] By examining how nuclear non-proliferation treaties serve as a precedent, the article explores the feasibility of developing a comprehensive set of international rules to govern cyberattacks, thereby addressing critical gaps in current regulatory frameworks.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nA cyberattack is any kind of malicious action aimed at obtaining unlawful access to information technology systems including the resources or valuable information of their users that they may encompass. Cyberattacks hit businesses every day, particularly targeting critical infrastructure, trade secrets, and intellectual property with commercial value, and other online information. Cyberattacks can peculiarly break into the defence systems which include defense capabilities and private military suppliers and can gravely threaten the security of the nation. Its effect on the economy cannot be ignored, especially in the case of the United States where approximately 90% of critical infrastructure is possessed by the private sector, and companies do not see any specific reason for investing in cybersecurity to secure public interest. By refusing to invest in cybersecurity, the private sector increases the exposure of the whole economy and society to cyber threats. The risk of cyberattacks that have the potential to cause large-scale shutdowns and huge amounts of other material harms are amplified by the digital transformation of the infrastructure of various sectors. Moreover, ‘information technology (IT)’, connected devices, cyber-physical systems, and industrial control systems are all potential\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\nattack vectors of critical infrastructure. The threat of cyber espionage is known and it may be centered on theft via access to cloud-based data platforms and malicious software. Finally, there exists a two-fold risk in the cyber-espionage area. First, any unauthorized person may access and steal sensitive personal information. Second, existing information may be altered to create a façade and disseminate fake news to the larger public. Furthermore, a major source of deceptive information and malicious publication could perhaps be, deep fake videos generated by ‘Artificial Intelligence (AI)’.\nIn the context of the growing importance of a data-driven economy for national economic progress, effective data governance emerges as a critical aspect of governance. Governments are increasingly prioritizing data governance and implementing measures to safeguard the digital economy against cyber threats. These measures include implementing export limitations and restricting foreign government access to national technology. One of the most significant and concerning cyberattacks targeted the US Government, its agencies, and numerous private companies – the ‘SolarWinds hack.’\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\n## 2.1 The Ambiguity of 'Cyberattack' within International Law\nDespite the pervasive phenomenon of cyberattacks in our increasingly interconnected contemporary society, where organisations are transitioning their operations and data storage to online platforms, international law remains ambivalent, lacking a precise and universally accepted legal definition for the term 'cyberattack'. This omission underscores a critical gap, especially as the digital realm continues to be a significant frontier for both commerce and potential conflict. The degree of digitization of economic activities is generally linked to the tendency of experiencing cyberattacks. A recent measure by the Indian government is the 'Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)' project. The process involves a biometric ID that assigns to each individual, a 12-digit number. It further requires, storing 10 fingerprints, iris scans and other necessary details such as names, addresses and date of birth to be recorded in the eGovernance cloud platform. Consequently, the practice involves an increased cybersecurity concern among the individuals, private organisations and the government agencies. In the absence of indigenous cybersecurity technology and patents in the nation, India's government has declared that it will be providing monetary incentives to Indian enterprises who acquire foreign firms with cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies. Perhaps worse, most of these threats have targeted small-scale industries that do not have the requisite means, instruments, or techniques to protect themselves and their business interests. Maintenance of cybersecurity is getting harder every year as cybercriminals continuously pose new threats, leverage new bugs, and carry out new sophisticated attacks; whilst regulatory institutions are still evolving and enhancing their standards.\n 'Scope of Russian Hacking Becomes Clear: Multiple U.S. Agencies Were Hit' (The New York Times, 14 December 2020), <https: 12=\"\" 14=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" rus=\"\" sia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Brett Van Niekerk, 'Suppression of Cyber-defences', IST-Africa Week Conference, Durban, 2016.

Projections by Cybersecurity Ventures suggest a dramatic rise in global cybercrime costs, with estimates indicating a potential annual total of USD 10.5 trillion by 2025, marking a considerable increase from USD 3 trillion in 2015. These figures underscore the immense economic impact of cybercrime, surpassing damages caused by natural disasters and even exceeding the collective value of significant illegal drug trades worldwide. Such crimes represent a substantial economic transfer globally, impeding innovation and investment. While no sector is immune to cyber threats, the financial services industry stands out as particularly vulnerable. The 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report highlights financial organizations as the most heavily targeted sector, followed by healthcare and public administration, respectively.\nThere has been no global consensus on the definition of cybersecurity. However, it has been defined by the International Telecommunication Union as 'a set of tools, policies, safeguards, and technologies that can protect the cyber environment and the assets of an organization or user.' Cybersecurity, therefore, seeks to protect and maintain the digital assets security of the organization or the user against the risks involved in the cyber environment. The approach offered by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) presents an intriguing perspective on cyberattacks. NIST's framework does not differentiate between state-sponsored actions and criminal activities, nor does it consider the distinct impact of cyber incidents on public versus private records, networks, and facilities. While prioritizing the integrity of information and information networks, NIST's framework fails to encompass broader societal goals such as national market growth, law enforcement access\n Steve Morgan, 'Cybercrime to Cost the World $10.5 Trillion Annually By 2025' (Cybercrime Magazine, 13 November 2020) <https: cybersecurityventures.com=\"\" hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Brian Cashell and others, 'The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attack' (United States Congressional Research Service, 1 April 2004) <https: ras.org=\"\" rl32331.pdf=\"\" sgp=\"\" crs=\"\" misc=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Kenning Arlitsch and Adam Edelman, 'Staying Safe: Cyber Security for People and Organizations' (2014) 54 J Libr Admin 46.\n '2020 Data Breach Investigation Report' (Verizon, 2020) <https: 2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf=\"\" enterprise.verizon.com=\"\" resources=\"\" reports=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023; the Public Administration sector manages with the administration of local, state and federal government.\n International Telecommunication Union, 'Overview of Cybersecurity: Recommendation ITU-T X.1205' (ITU-T, 4 August 2008) <https: rec=\"\" t-rec-x.1205-200804-i=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nAn alternative legal definition proposed by the United States National Research Council defines cyberattacks as purposeful actions aimed at altering, disrupting, deceiving, degrading, or destroying computer systems, networks, or the information and programs within them.43 While this definition offers rationality, it also highlights ambiguity, particularly in differentiating between basic cybercrimes and cyberattacks. This lack of clarity may lead to inconsistencies within the legal framework, hindering effective coordination among agencies.\n## 2.2 International Responses and Legal Implications\nThe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has introduced the Cyber Norms Index to monitor and compare significant achievements in negotiating and establishing norms for governmental actions in cyberspace. This index aids policymakers and observers in analyzing proposals for cyber norms, tracking their development, and assessing their uniform adoption by members of the global community. Users can utilize the index to examine multilateral outcomes and compare information using various groups or keywords. Additionally, there has been a widespread call for norms aimed at immunizing and stabilizing cyberspace.44 CSO Online45 has curated a list of\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</http:>\nQIAN\nnotable 21st-century security breaches, employing simple metrics such as the number of affected consumers and distinguishing between breaches resulting from malicious intent and those caused by accidental exposure. One notable breach involved theft of encrypted consumer payment information from Adobe's systems, affecting approximately 3 million customers, with login data manipulation for an unspecified number of users. More recently, Canva, an Australian web design app, experienced a significant breach compromising sensitive information of over 100 million consumers. Another prominent breach occurred in 2016 when Yahoo reported what is described as the largest privacy breach in history, compromising sensitive data of nearly five million users, including unauthorized access to full names, email addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers.\nBoth the private sector and governmental agencies are susceptible to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by various incidents.

SolarWinds, a prominent US information technology company, fell victim to a cyberattack that went undetected for months,55 affecting its customers. US authorities suspect Russian hackers to be behind the attack, which targeted not the federal government or a private organization's network directly, but a third-party technology provider. This tactic, known as a 'Supply Chain' attack, exploited vulnerabilities in SolarWinds' Orion IT management tools, compromising high-ranking departments of the US government, including the Department of Homeland Security and Treasury, as well as private enterprises like FireEye.\n## 2.3 Cyber-Attacks on the Upswing: Risk for Worsening\nHacking groups and state-sponsored organizations have discovered that cyber-attacks are an effective weapon for balancing the playing field with rivals. The convergence of an attacker threat is highly risky and an expensive danger of insider manipulation or theft of intellectual property has generated a precarious environment in the private sector.56 While employee incompetence and human errors contribute to organizational vulnerabilities, recent years have witnessed a notable surge in attacks by malicious actors with access to sensitive business information. The global cybersecurity landscape is fraught with concerns regarding the likelihood of financial losses, misappropriation of classified data, and disruptions to critical infrastructure. The escalating scale and complexity of cyberattacks have not only heightened the risk of being caught off guard but have also increased the costs associated with preventing and recovering from such incidents.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.reuters.com>\nQIAN\nDespite media attention being drawn to high-profile cyberattacks targeting large corporations like Target, Netflix, and financial institutions such as JP Morgan, it is small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that remain the most vulnerable.[57] Industry analysts estimate that up to  $60\\%$  of SMEs may face collapse within six months due to cyberattacks, ranging from phishing scams to ransomware assaults.[58]\nChina's initiative to develop digital infrastructure, known as the 'Digital Silk Road,' alongside its traditional infrastructure projects, aims to enhance international connectivity in terms of communication and data flow.[59] This digital complement to the land-based 'Silk Road Economic Belt' and the 'Twenty-First Century Maritime Silk Road' seeks to bolster capacity for the exchange of goods.[60]\nIn light of these developments, states reliant on global interactions must prioritize the development of credible policies on cross-border data flow. As nations seek to thrive in the post-COVID-19 era and compete in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, facilitating cross-border data flow is imperative. Several governments have already issued warnings about the potential for large-scale cyber assaults, exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to lure individuals and companies into divulging personal and financial data.\n# 3 Paradigm Shift in Public International Law: Cyberattack as an Act of War\nThe world is rapidly transitioning towards intensive digitalization, a trend that has been ongoing for years but has recently accelerated unexpectedly.[61] The\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nDefining a cyberattack poses challenges, but it is widely accepted that such attacks aim to undermine or disrupt the function of a computer network. The growing reliance on technology makes nations vulnerable to cyber threats, with many ill-equipped to handle serious cyber incidents. Cyberattacks can have severe ramifications beyond the virtual realm, prompting states to focus on securing critical infrastructure and bolstering cybersecurity measures. Unlike traditional forms of warfare, cyberattacks occur in the digital domain but can have equally devastating consequences in the physical world. Recent incidents, such as the SolarWinds attacks, highlight the surprise element inherent in cyber warfare.

Historically, such acts encompassed a wide range of actions, including unfriendly economic or commercial measures and actions that insulted a nation's pride. However, rapid technological advancements have challenged this traditional concept, rendering established legal categories inadequate to regulate contemporary activities.\nIn the context of cyberspace, clarifying the concept of *casus belli* serves to provide a clear standard against which states can assess their behavior and that of others when initiating or responding to cyberattacks. Traditional theories of *casus belli*, often emphasizing the violent and aggressive nature of armed operations, may not directly apply to cyberattacks due to their non-physical nature. Nevertheless, cyberattacks can be viewed as potential triggers for war if they cause substantial physical damage to the target's computer systems. While a destructive attack on computer systems by a nation-state may not necessarily constitute a *casus belli*, a significant strike solely targeting computer systems could potentially justify a defensive military response.\nClassifying cyber assaults, such as computer intrusions or communication disruptions, presents significant challenges. For instance, while both data breaches and attacks on air traffic control systems are invasive, the latter could result in greater damage and loss of life, potentially constituting an 'armed attack' rather than mere data theft. Additionally, attacks causing significant harm, regardless of the level of intrusion, may qualify as 'armed attacks.' Large-scale cyberattacks have the potential to incapacitate an opponent's ability to wage war effectively, surpassing the impact of traditional kinetic attacks. Such attacks can disrupt vital functions such as leadership, communication,\n Hannah Herbst, 'Cyber Attacks &amp; Modern Warfare' (*Denver J Intl L Pol*, 8 April 2020) <http: djilp.org=\"\" cyber-attacks-modern-warfare=\"\"></http:> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Colonel Charles J Dunlap, Jr, 'International Law and Terrorism' <http: dunlapterrorism.pdf=\"\" people.duke.edu=\"\" ~pfeaver=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Lawrence T Greenberg and others, *Information Warfare and International Law* (DOD Command Command and Control Research Program 1998).\n Charles C Poché, 'This Means War!

Consequently, cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure should be regarded as legitimate grounds for declaring a casus belli.\n## 3.2 Conceptualizing Cyber-Operation as Use of force\nThe United Nations (UN) Charter, a foundational document governing the use of force (*Jus Ad Bellum*), outlines in Article 2(4) that Member States must refrain from threatening or using force to undermine the territorial sovereignty or political independence of another state, unless justified by self-defense or authorized by the UN Security Council. Determining whether a cyberattack violates this prohibition requires an understanding of how ‘force’ is interpreted in international law and whether cyberattacks meet the criteria set out by these standards.\nA narrow interpretation of ‘force’ is recommended, aligning with the objectives outlined in the UN Charter’s preamble to maintain international peace and security and prevent war. However, the Charter does not exhaustively address all aspects of force regulation, and further guidance is sought from customary international law, as noted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Offensive cyber capabilities, such as implanting harmful code into computer networks, share similarities with traditional military actions, economic coercion, and subversion. The effects of cyberattacks can range from temporary disruptions, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, to severe physical damage and loss of life, such as disrupting emergency networks for first responders.\nCategorizing all cyberattacks as a ‘use of force’ under Article 2(4) would require an exceptionally broad interpretation. The Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare suggests that cyberattacks with tangible consequences in the physical\n UN Charter Art 2, para 4.\n Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ (2012) 30 Berkeley J Intl L 525.

The Tallinn Manual outlines criteria including severity, spontaneity, directness, intrusiveness, quantification, and presumptive legitimacy to evaluate cyberattack consequences against those of conventional attacks. If a cyberattack exhibits sufficient resemblance to these criteria, broadening the prohibition on force is warranted. Despite the United States' emphasis on consequences over methodology, modern society's heavy reliance on computer systems raises concerns about incapacitating physical infrastructure without tangible destruction.\nThe SolarWinds incident underscores the importance of characterizing cyberattacks as casus belli. SolarWinds, a company serving a vast clientele including major US government agencies, fell victim to cyber-attacks that compromised the integrity of their data. While some argue these attacks do not meet the casus belli threshold and constitute espionage, distinguishing between cyber-attacks and espionage remains challenging. Responses to cyber espionage must be strategized akin to other cyberattacks, especially in cases like supply chain attacks, where damage control may overshadow the actors' intent. While cyber espionage typically does not warrant casus belli, it may do so if aimed at undermining a state's political and social institutions. The intertwining of espionage and operational access in incidents like SolarWinds raises concerns about latent vulnerabilities and potential future attacks of unprecedented magnitude.

In the context of cyberattacks, ensuring proportionality requires a nuanced understanding of technical intricacies. For example, a cyber response coded into software demands extensive knowledge of potential targets, often obtained through conventional cyber exploitation methods.94 The Office of the Attorney General of California defined cyber exploitation as 'the non-consensual distribution or publication of intimate photos or videos\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nonline'.95 Cyber exploitation hurts the privacy of an individual and public safety by publishing photos or videos without appropriate consent.\nHence, for the fulfilment of the principle of necessity, it is essential that all the other remedies that do not involve such a use of force have been proven futile or have been exhausted, without success.96 According to the authors of The Tallinn Manual, the availability, or lack thereof, of accessible options that do not rise to the level of use of force is the key to doing a 'necessity analysis' in the cyber realm.97 If a State's military computer networks are breached as a result of a cyber-attack, it may take some time for the State to retaliate using cyber or kinetic means.98 When there is no other feasible choice and the assault is real and imminent, the victim state may invoke self-defense to justify reasonable, necessary, and proportional safeguards to maintain its security.99\n## 4 Global Data Flow and the Transformation of International Trade: Issues and Challenges for Trade Law\nThe growing digital trade landscape has heightened concerns regarding cybersecurity within the international rules-based trading system. Prior to the establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, bilateral trade was seen as beneficial for increasing demand for local products and improving living standards.100 However, the implementation of GATT and subsequent efforts to regulate and harmonize international trade introduced complexities, particularly regarding the interpretation of terms like non-state actors, terrorism, the environment, and cybersecurity measures at the domestic and international levels.101 During Ministerial Conference 11 in 2017, 71 World Trade Organization (WTO) members, both developed and developing, issued a Joint Statement on Electronic Commerce, expressing their commitment to exploring future negotiations on the trade-related aspects of electronic commerce. Currently, negotiations involve 90 WTO members, with The Gambia\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\nbeing the latest addition. An updated negotiation text from November 2023, under Section C, addresses cybersecurity. It emphasizes the evolving nature of cyber threats and outlines measures for member states to enhance cybersecurity capabilities. These measures include building the capabilities of national entities responsible for cybersecurity incident response, collaborating to identify and mitigate malicious intrusions or dissemination of malicious code affecting electronic networks, addressing cybercrime, and sharing information for awareness and best practices.\n## 4.1 Legal Pitfalls in the Context of Digital Trade\nIn the sphere of international trade, cybersecurity measures are employed to address illegal data breaches by non-state actors that affect legitimate trading activities among WTO Member States. However, the cybersecurity countermeasures are often justified by the States based upon the general and security exceptions under the GATT and ‘General Agreement on Trade in Services Agreement (GATS)’. With the advent of the WTO Panel decision in Russia-Traffic in Transit, it is now well established that recourse to exceptions under the WTO is justiciable and not entirely self-judging.\nBuilding on this, the concept of ‘national security unilateralism,’ as delineated by Chaisse and Georgopoulos, reflects an emerging trend where states increasingly prioritize their national security interests, sometimes contravening established international economic norms. A prominent example of this trend is the trade policies of the United States under the Trump administration, marked by unilateral tariff impositions that circumvent standard global trade procedures. This paradigm shift, moving away from a cooperative, rules-based approach in international economic relations to a more insular,\n WTO Electronic Commerce Negotiations Updated Consolidated Negotiating Text – November 2023 <https: img=\"\" pdf=\"\" wto_ji=\"\">\n Panel Report, Russia – Traffic in Transit, WT/DS512/R, adopted April 2019; Dylan Geraets, ‘WTO Issues Ruling in Russia – Traffic in Transit: Measures Justified on National Security Grounds Are Justiciable’ (Mayer Brown, 8 April 2019) <https: 04=\"\" 2019=\"\" en=\"\" en=\"\" publications=\"\" wto-issues-ruling-in-russia-traffic-in-transit-measures-justified-on-national-security-grounds-are-justiciable#_edn2=\"\" www.mayerbrown.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023. A provision is self-judging when the members can decide whether and how this exception can be applied to the measure. On the one hand, it is non-justiciable when the issue cannot be subject to the findings of a WTO Panel or the adjudicative system. On the other hand, the provision is justiciable if the phrases ‘it considers’ and ‘necessary’ are not read together.\n Julien Chaisse and Georgios Dimitropoulos, ‘Special Economic Zones in International Economic Law: Towards Unilateral Economic Law’ (2021) 24(2) JIEL 229–57.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:>\nQIAN\nsecurity-centric model, presents significant challenges to the traditional frameworks of international trade law.\nThe proliferation of digital trade raises concerns$^{105}$ pertaining to cross-border data flow, critical infrastructure of the trading countries, and vulnerability to cyberattacks, which can potentially lead to violation of trade obligations as envisaged under the GATT, GATS, and TBT Agreements. While the foundation of the GATT is based upon non-discrimination between domestic and foreign goods, an effective domestic policy to counter cyberattacks can result in restricting the access of certain suspicious manufacturers of goods to further participate in the supply chain.$^{106}$ The States have sought to justify these inherent trade-distorting measures based upon the general exception, under the GATT.\nSimilarly, in the context of the TBT Agreement, the Appellate Body in $EC - Asbestos$ held that where the risk associated with cross-border trade increases, the discretion of the Member States also increases in parallel.$^{107}$ Even under the GATS, Member States can take recourse to justify cybersecurity measures based upon the general and security exceptions although the scope of application of trade-restrictive measures is relatively less broad as compared to GATT. The regional free trade agreements have gone one step further by allowing commitments from reciprocating nations to allow the cross-border transfer of personal information and the restricted prohibition on the measures of data localization.\nWhile the security exceptions under the GATT and GATS are self-judging in nature, they are however not immune from panel review as highlighted in Russia – Traffic in Transit.$^{108}$ The general exceptions under the GATT and GATS are resorted to justify measures necessary to protect public morals or secure compliance with laws and regulations. Based upon these, the member nation must evidence whether the cybersecurity measure is ‘necessary’ in light of balancing the factors and whether less trade restricting alternatives are available.$^{109}$ It is, however, agreed to some extent that these\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</www.globaltradealert.org>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\ndomestic cybersecurity measures outweigh the costs associated with them leading to better information symmetry, regulatory oversight, and reducing business malpractices.\n## 4.2 Strengthening International Trade Law in the Digital Era\nThe sole reliance upon the general and security exceptions under the WTO covered agreements results in drastic trade distortion effects which can lead to justification for most, if not all, cybersecurity measures. Consequently, cooperation amongst Member States must be achieved to establish suitable standards such that the measures result in minimum trade distortion. On a preliminary level, it is essential that world governments agree upon a uniform understanding of the nature and scope of cybersecurity measures and the risks posed by them towards international trade. The domestic and international standard-setting organizations can prescribe certain standards for usage and regulation of cybersecurity measures in line with the ISO and IEC standards on cybersecurity.[110]\nThe WTO has made efforts to regulate cybercrime through initiatives such as the Consolidated E-Commerce Negotiating Text circulated in December 2020.[111] The most controversial clause in the document is a broad exception that has been proposed to be incorporated into the negotiated text.[112] This exception allows Member States to freely adopt measures, notwithstanding the obligations under the agreement, to guarantee cybersecurity, safeguard cyberspace sovereignty safeguard the lawful rights and interests of the citizens, juridical persons, and other organizations, and achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives.\"[113] The only limitation to this broad power is that the measures taken must not be arbitrary or discriminatory; they must\nRequirement case significantly clarifies the application of the national security exception in WTO law, particularly by establishing that such exceptions are not entirely self-judging and subject to review (United States – Origin Marking Requirement, WT/DS597/10, Panel report under appeal on 26 January 2023). It underscores the necessity for concrete evidence to justify invoking national security, thereby narrowing the scope for its arbitrary use in trade disputes. For a commentary, see J Chaisse and K Olaoye, 'United States – Origin Marking Requirement, WT/DS597/R' (2023) 117(3) AJIL 488–493.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></http:>\nQIAN\nbe applied in an equal manner to all nations without any discrimination. Further, these measures must not be 'a disguised restriction on trade' and should not be 'more than necessary' to attain the objective. While the official text of this clause remains unavailable, leaked information provides insights into its content. Despite references to the negotiating text on the WTO's official website, it remains inaccessible to the public. Nevertheless, preliminary observations can be made based on the leaked information.\nWhile the exception provides visibility to cybersecurity issues and nation-states with the autonomy to design rigorous cybersecurity mechanisms, the exception is not a comprehensive regulation of cybersecurity and is only an enabling provision. Cyber-security measures remain the prerogative of Member States to keep in place. As a result, there remains a lack of comprehensive regulation of cyber-related issues in international trade. This status quo is especially concerning in a vital and ever-growing area like e-commerce. How this exception will be invoked by Member States remains to be seen but backlash based on information freedom concerns can certainly be anticipated. Further, the exception could also prove to be overbroad. The exception, apart from empowering Member States to take cybersecurity-related measures, allows any measures taken to achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives'. Such a vague enabling provision could lead to disastrous consequences, which could undermine the foundations of international trade. The term 'public policy', typically used in relation to international commercial arbitration, has been held by numerous judgments to be an 'unruly horse'. Due to the inherent lack of a precise definition, arbitration scholars have found the concept to be excessively malleable, shaped by the subjective values and principles in each nation. Adding to the existing uncertainty around cyber-attacks and cyber-security, the insertion of an unruly horse that is 'public policy', would certainly be undesirable. The text must be revised to include a definition of public policy, or at the least illustrations of the term.\nMoreover, the establishment of standards alone is insufficient; robust compliance and enforcement mechanisms are necessary at the national level.

However, infrastructure encompasses not only physical structures but also digital infrastructure, which plays a crucial role in attracting foreign direct investments (FDI). The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of workplaces, leading to increased reliance on digital assets such as fiber networks and broadband connectivity. Consequently, enhancing a nation's digital infrastructure can attract more FDI, particularly from e-commerce and technology companies.\nNumerous prominent companies globally possess trade secrets and intellectual property rights crucial for their commercial viability. Cyber hackers pose a significant threat by potentially dismantling these assets within a short span, thereby jeopardizing not only the company's survival but also the broader economy.

Given the substantial contribution of digital trade to global GDP and its benefits to nations worldwide, addressing threats to the digital trade system becomes paramount. These considerations are of profound significance, particularly as e-commerce trade not only fosters corporate growth and profitability but also facilitates employment generation and mitigates socioeconomic inequalities. According to the UNCTAD report, e-commerce transactions amounted to over USD 29 trillion by 2017, constituting approximately 36% of global GDP. As the world increasingly embraces data-driven technology, the centrality of effective data governance becomes ever more apparent.\nThe evolution of international trade towards digital platforms has exposed nation-states to new challenges, particularly cyberattacks, which pose threats to data integrity. One key question is whether cyberattacks should be considered acts of war. Given that virtually all industries are potential targets for cyber hackers, a unified and international solution is necessary to address this problem. Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) could serve as a means to tackle this emerging issue. BITs provide fundamental protections to foreign investments and offer various dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration. Integrating substantive protection against cybercrimes into BITs would enhance the accountability of states and incentivize them to adopt robust data protection laws. This approach could contribute to mitigating the risks posed by cyberattacks in the context of international investment.\n## 5.1 Digital Assets as Emerging Investments\nThe initial task for investors is to ascertain whether digital assets meet the criteria to qualify as 'covered investments' under BITs. As investment tribunals grapple with claims related to cybercrime, they will face the challenge of addressing investment law policy arguments. Extending BIT provisions to encompass such crimes will inevitably entail implications for both investors\n ‘A Roadmap for Cross Border Data Flows: Future-Proofing Readiness and Cooperation in the New Data Economy: White Paper’ (World Economic Forum, 9 June 2020) <www3.we forum.org 2020.pdf=\"\" docs=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_Cross_Border_Data_Flows_2020.=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_cross_border_data_flows_2020.pdf=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Marina Dane, ‘Digitalisation, Trade, and Geopolitics in Asia’ (2020) <www.kas.de 2020=\"\" 8314289=\"\" documents=\"\" digitalisation%2c+trade%2c+and+geopolitics+in+asia.pdf=\"\" www.kas.de=\"\">/3bf29911-2dcb-6e72-d4aa-936f9b5082d0?version=1.0&amp;t=1608181259722&gt; accessed 19 October 2021.\n Aaronson and Struett (n 66); ‘Global e-Commerce Sales Surged to $29 Trillion’ (UNCTAD Press Release, 29 March 2019) <https: global-e-commerce-sales-surged-29-trillion=\"\" press-material=\"\" unctad.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.kas.de></www3.we>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nTribunals have typically referenced the definition provided in BITs and objective economic criteria to ascertain whether an investment has been established, contrasting it with a mere commercial transaction. In interpreting BIT provisions, tribunals often turn to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, which outlines the general rule for interpreting treaty provisions, taking into consideration the purpose of the BIT and its other provisions. Certain BITs, such as the German Model BIT, employ a broad asset-based definition of investment, encompassing phrases like ‘every kind of asset’, thereby potentially encompassing digital assets as well.\nWhen considering the inclusion of digital assets within the definition of an asset, it is crucial to carefully delineate the concept of digital assets itself. The primary concern regarding digital assets pertains to the data they encapsulate, which holds both intrinsic and extrinsic value. The economic worth of digital assets is intricately linked to their data content, with the value of a digital asset being inherently tied to the data it contains. Intrinsic value pertains to the core data itself, while extrinsic value encompasses additional elements such as customer metadata, which companies often monetize significantly. Furthermore, there exists a symbiotic relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic value, akin to the seeds and flesh of a fruit, respectively. While not all BITs offer a broad definition of investment, it is advisable to establish a clear understanding of digital assets within the context of investment arbitration to mitigate the risk of numerous arbitration claims stemming from uncertainties in this regard.\nApart from the definition of an investment, there are other factors that can affect the inclusion of digital assets under the definition of covered investments, such as economic factors. If the definition of investment\n Enikő Horváth and Severin Klinkmüller, ‘The Concept of “Investment” in the Digital Economy: The Case of Social Media Companies’ (2019) 20 JWIT 577, 593.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nprovided under Article 25 (1) ICSID is relied on, digital assets might very well be excluded as a covered investment. Therefore, a broad definition in the BIT would be ideal to bring digital assets within the investment arbitration regime. There are various definitions of investment in BITs which particularly limit the definition of investment by making it mandatory for investments to have some connection with economic factors such as expectations of profits or assumption of risk. For instance, in the case of Romak SA v Uzbekistan, the Tribunal adopted a restrictive approach in interpreting the definition of an investment.[126] It's essential for investment tribunals to recognize that digital companies often operate under long-term business models, where the initial investment is directed towards research and development.[127] These companies may take a considerable period to generate revenue, distinguishing them from single commercial transactions.[128]\nAnother pertinent issue relates to the requirement of a territorial link in various BITs, stipulating that investments must be made within the territory of the host State. Establishing the territorial presence of digital assets poses inherent challenges.[129] Jonathan Bick's categorization of digital assets into possession, location, and control underscores the importance of these factors in establishing a territorial link between the State and the investment. In Abaclat v Argentina,[130] the Tribunal emphasized that the nature of the investment is crucial in determining its location, focusing on how the funds were ultimately utilized rather than where they were initially disbursed. This interpretation helps alleviate some of the challenges in proving digital assets as covered investments. In Wena Hotel v Egypt, the Tribunal affirmed that expropriation encompasses both tangible and intangible assets, including digital\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333</www.businessinsider.in></www.bcg.com>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\nassets, under international law. In SPP v Egypt, the tribunal clarified that it is an accepted proposition that the protection of international law extends to contract rights and therefore compensation should be made for taking away these rights. Moreover, in Tippetts v Tams-Affa, Tribunal stated that under international law, even if the title in the property is not affected, its deprivation may occur by the interference of a State in the use or enjoyments of benefits attached to the property. Since the assumption of control does not imply that the property has been acquired by the government, compensation should be paid under international law, indicating that the owner was deprived of their fundamental right of ownership of the property.\n## 5.2 Investment Claims in the Age of Cybersecurity\nThe central concern in this context revolves around whether investors can pursue claims against states for cybercrimes. Studies from 2017 indicate that a single data breach can cost a company up to USD 3.62 million on average. The severity of costs varies depending on factors like the type and volume of data stolen; for instance, the leakage of trade secrets could pose an existential threat to a company. The principle of ‘Fair and Equitable Treatment’ (FET) is pivotal in this regard, as it obliges states to provide investors with essential conditions, potentially enabling investors to lodge claims for cybercrimes.\nTribunals typically assess whether state actions are arbitrary under FET provisions by referencing core principles. Regarding digital assets, FET claims may challenge alterations in measures related to national cybersecurity. ‘Transparency’ plays a crucial role for investors conducting business in a host state, and states are obligated to maintain transparency. While states have\n Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000) para 98.\n Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/84/3, Award (1992) para 164.\n Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v TAMS-AFFA Consulting, 225 6 IRAN-US CTR 219.\n Julien Chaisse and Cristen Bauer, ‘Cybersecurity and the Protection of Digital Assets: Assessing the Role of International Investment Law and Arbitration’ (2019) 21 Vand J Ent &amp; Tech L 549, 568.\n In Glamis Gold Ltd v United States, Award, IIC 380 (2009), it is mentioned that ‘fair and equitable treatment encompasses a universe of “fundamental” principles common throughout the world that include “the duty to act in good faith, due process, transparency and candor, and fairness and protection from arbitrariness’. In MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004), the Tribunal agreed with a legal opinion by Judge Schwebel that fair and equitable treatment encompassed such fundamental standards as good faith, due process, non-discrimination and proportionality.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nthe right to amend laws concerning national cybersecurity to achieve public policy objectives, such changes must not be inconsistent, as demonstrated in the case of PSEG Global v Republic of Turkey. In this case, Turkey's frequent changes to the law were deemed to create uncertainty for investors, violating FET provisions.\nAnother relevant case involving the implementation of inconsistent policies by a state is MTD Equity v Republic of Chile. The tribunal ruled that Chile violated FET provisions by adopting contradictory positions with the investor regarding data localization policies. Chile's support for these policies on national security grounds increased costs for foreign investors. Similarly, data localization policies initiated by the Vietnamese government have been challenged by tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Google on economic and human rights grounds. Regarding claims related to Denial of Justice, these typically entail the right to be heard. Such a right is infringed when the cyber legislation of the host state fails to provide effective opportunities for all parties to present their case.\nIn addition to the aforementioned considerations, claims may also arise based on the Full Protection and Security standard (FPS). These claims encompass not only threats from armed rebels but also modern dangers posed by cybercriminals. Cyberattacks can compromise the three primary pillars of security: confidentiality, availability, and integrity. A claim under FPS due to a cyberattack can be sustained if it can be demonstrated that the security assured by the host State extends beyond physical protection. Factors such as the standard liability of the host State and the potential overlap between FPS and FET provisions are also pivotal in determining whether the investment was deprived of legal protection.\nThe definition of investment has evolved over time, and similarly, the application of FPS has expanded. An investor can succeed in their claim even in the absence of a physical attack, as exemplified in the case of Azurix v Argentina, where the host State was deemed responsible for providing an overall safe environment to investors. Given that digital assets predominantly fall under the category of intangible assets, they can be interpreted to meet the criteria of covered investments, thus availing the protection of FPS provisions in BITs.\n PSEG Global Inc v Republic of Turkey, ICSID Case No ARB/02/5, Award (2007) paras 248–256.\n MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Republic of Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004) para 189.\n Azurix Corp v Argentina, ICSID Case No ARB/01/12, Award (2004) para 408.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nIn instances where host States lack cyber laws, courts have applied analogical reasoning, drawing from laws related to privacy and theft. However, if domestic courts fail to apply such principles and a void in cybersecurity laws persists, this absence could be deemed a violation of the FPS standard. The FPS standard underscores the State's duty to furnish investors with an adequate legal framework for protection. Intangible assets, if deemed investments under the relevant BIT, can be subject to expropriation, including indirect expropriation resulting in asset depreciation. Addressing these issues requires enhancing the contents of BITs by expanding the definition of investment to encompass digital assets. States must recognize that safeguarding investors from cybercrime not only benefits investors but also preserves the economy and the privacy of citizens, serving the public interest of the host State. Incorporating cyberattacks under the FPS provision in BITs can compel host States to fulfill their obligation and shield investors from cyber threats, which have the potential to devastate companies in an instant. Therefore, it is imperative to prohibit these detrimental criminal actions.\n## 5.3 National Security Exceptions in Investment Law\nVarious international investment agreements incorporate exceptions, including those related to national security. This exception grants host States the authority to implement precautionary measures. However, there is considerable debate within the Investor ISDS regime regarding the basis for invoking this national security exception. Some argue that it is a self-judging provision prone to arbitrary use by States, while others contend that it is based on necessity. From the perspective of host countries, national security interests are\n Wena Hotels LTD v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000).\n Occidental Exploration and Production Company v The Republic of Ecuador, LCIA Case No UN3467 (1976).\n Katia Yannaca-Small, 'Essential Security Interests under International Investment Law', in OECD (ed.), International Investment Perspectives: Freedom of Investment in a Changing World (2007).\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\ndeemed significant, both for developed and developing nations. Developed countries often invoke national security interests in response to attempted takeovers of industries, whereas developing countries may do so during economic crises.^[142]^\nHowever, prior to invoking this exception, States should adhere to the requirement of explicit good faith. Regular reviews should be conducted to assess the ongoing necessity of upholding security-related investment restrictions. In the author's view, all these remedies prevent this exception of national security from becoming a mere 'black and white' matter and a different solution should be adopted which can balance the rights of the contracting parties and foreign investors. Hence, the threat to cybersecurity such as cyber-attacks should be covered under the umbrella of national security. By invoking these exceptions, the States are likely to take certain measures to prevent these crimes that would violate the international investment agreements and would be able to justify such measures under existing exceptions.\n## 6 Making the Linkages: Nuclear Proliferation and Cyberattacks\nIn contemporary times, parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation are frequently drawn, owing to the escalating threat that cyberattacks pose to global security and diplomacy.^[143]^ Cybersecurity has transcended local boundaries to become a matter of international concern, impacting peace and security on a global scale. However, existing international law inadequately addresses these cybersecurity threats, necessitating the establishment of more robust and effective regulations. A recent report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) highlighted the strategic risks posed by cyberattacks, underscoring the urgent need for the introduction of a cybersecurity treaty. The international community must recognize and address the risks posed by cybersecurity, analogous to the approach taken with non-proliferation agreements.\nNuclear non-proliferation aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and associated delivery systems, with the overarching goal of averting nuclear conflict or catastrophe in the future. Conversely, cyberattacks encompass malicious attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or valuable data. The proliferation of cyberattacks has raised concerns among financial institutions, corporations, and governments regarding their potential\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nAs technology becomes increasingly integral to government, institutional, and personal operations, parallels between nuclear and cyber threats become apparent. For instance, the NC3 systems of nuclear-armed governments heavily rely on digital processors and computers, rendering them vulnerable to hacking and cyberattacks. Moreover, the nuclear force infrastructure encompasses weapons, launch sites, and command authorities interconnected through communication and data processing technologies, facilitating cyber vulnerabilities. Despite the reluctance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to address the convergence of nuclear and cyber threats, scholars and non-governmental experts have extensively documented their interactions. Without stronger protections against cyberattacks and illegal hacking, the realm of nuclear weapons and security remains susceptible to exploitation.\n## 6.1 Comparative Analysis of Legal Frameworks\nEfforts in nuclear non-proliferation have spanned approximately fifty years, originating in the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. The earliest initiatives began within the UN, with Article 11(1) of the UN Charter emphasizing the preservation of international peace and security. A significant development during this period was the conclusion of the Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) in 1963, although some countries abstained from signing due to perceived weaknesses in its provisions, notably the absence of international control mechanisms or spot inspections.\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis highlighted the need for a comprehensive framework to address nuclear proliferation. Consequently, the NPT was signed in 1968 by 62 countries, including nuclear weapon states like the US. Notably, China and France refrained from signing initially. The NPT came\n Stéphane Lhuissier and Fabien Tripier, *A Measure of the Evolution of Cyber Risk* (17 December 2021) <https: blog-entry=\"\" blocnotesdeleco.banque-france.fr=\"\" measure-evolution-cyber-risk=\"\" en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Then, in 1946, the Atomic Energy Commission was set up to recommend measures for controlling atomic energy. In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was created with the goal of promoting and overseeing to promote and oversee the peaceful use of nuclear technology.\n The PTBT can be viewed as the first global and formal attempt towards non-proliferation. At first, the Treaty was only ratified by the USSR, the US, and the UK.\n For instance, China conducted Project 596 in 1964, which was its first atom bomb test. Due to its relatively small audience, and the fact that even its signatories continued to defy it, the PTBT was largely a failure.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\ninto force in 1970, categorizing countries into nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states, with the former defined as those that conducted nuclear tests before January 1967. Subsequent developments included the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, such as the Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America, and agreements like the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT-I) between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\nFollowing the end of the Cold War in 1991, efforts in non-proliferation intensified, with particular focus on strengthening the NPT. The revelation of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program after the Gulf War prompted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to introduce the Model Additional Protocol, enhancing its access to information and nuclear facilities. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 1996 marked a significant milestone, prohibiting all nuclear explosions and providing for on-site inspections and confidence-building measures.\nIn recent years, cybercrime and cyberattacks have emerged as significant threats to international security, paralleling the concerns posed by nuclear proliferation in the past. Analogous to the NPT for nuclear issues, there is a growing need for a comprehensive treaty addressing cybercrime, regulation of the internet, and law enforcement procedures for cross-border investigations. These issues carry profound implications for human rights, economic systems, and national security. International cooperation is crucial in developing effective regulatory frameworks for cyberspace, fostering confidence among stakeholders and ensuring a secure digital environment.\n## 6.2 Lessons from Nuclear Law for Cyber Regulation\nThe NPT is a three-part global pact intended at restricting the spread of nuclear weapons: (1) non-proliferation, (2) disarmament, and (3) peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The basic tenets of the treaty include the principle that nuclear weapons will not be acquired by States that do not have them, nuclear-weapon States will pursue disarmament, and all States have access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes under safeguards.\nAccording to Article IX of the NPT, 'nuclear weapon states (NWS)' are those that have detonated a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967,\n Following suit, states of the South Pacific established an NWFZ in 1985, Southeast Asia in 1995, Africa in 1996, and Central Asia in 2006.\n Seven years later, SALT-I was followed up by the signing of SALT-II by these two nations, which further limited their nuclear capabilities.\n Deborah Brown, 'Cybercrime is Dangerous, But a New UN Treaty Could Be Worse for Rights' (13 August 2021) <https: 08=\"\" 13=\"\" 2021=\"\" cybercrime-dangerous-new-un-treaty-could-be-worse-rights=\"\" news=\"\" www.hrw.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) supplements the NPT and includes a Protocol detailing the International Monitoring System (IMS), On-Site Inspections (OSI), and Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs). The CTBT prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, with provisions for redressing violations, ensuring compliance, and periodic review of its effectiveness.\nPresident John F. Kennedy's infamous fear in the 1960s, that 20 or perhaps 30 'Nuclear-Weapon States (NWSs)' would arise within a decade, did not come true. The number of nuclear powers or governments with active nuclear weapons programmes remains at ten even now. The NPT recognises five of them as lawful nuclear weapons possessors, which corresponds to the permanent five members of the 'UN Security Council (UNSC)'. Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are all said to have nuclear weapons or have demonstrated it through testing. Iran has long been accused of pursuing a zealous nuclear weapons development. In contrast, no less than 26 governments have renounced or been forced to abandon their pursuit of nuclear weapons, having completed feasibility studies, targeted weapon research or even development, or manufactured nuclear weapons (or inherited them following the collapse of the Soviet Union). Almost the whole phalanx of middle powers is made\n There are gaps in the current treaty framework. Firstly, there is the issue of countries like India, Pakistan, and Israel not joining the NPT. This leads to a significant amount of unsafeguarded nuclear activity. Another concern is that countries signatory may develop nuclear fuel cycle facilities and then subsequently opt-out of the Treaty as North Korea did. To avoid this, stronger and more regular inspection measures need to be enforced within the Treaty mechanism, with the aid of international bodies.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nup of these countries. When one considers that the CTBT names out 44 'nuclear capable' governments whose ratification is necessary before the treaty can be implemented, the miracle of non-proliferation becomes even greater. By comparing the 'before' and 'after,' we may obtain a sense of the consequences of international norms. The vast majority of 'nuclear aspirants' began their nuclear programmes before the NPT was signed. After the NPT was opened for signing, only Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, and (perhaps) Syria developed their programmes. Surprisingly, none of these nations were democracies at the time the pact was drafted. On the contrary, the vast majority of 'renouncers' halted their programmes during or after the discussions. As a result, for most of them, the NPT signified the line beyond which nuclear weapons ambitions lost their legitimacy.\nThe reliance of nuclear-armed governments, including the US, on computerized Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems underscores a critical vulnerability. These systems, integral to every aspect of nuclear force management, operate within cyberspace, making them susceptible to hacking and cyberattacks. NC3 systems encompass a network of communication and data-processing technologies linking weapons, radar systems, launch sites, and senior authorities responsible for nuclear decision-making. Despite extensive cybersecurity measures, the complexity and diversity of these systems render them inherently vulnerable, with numerous potential points of attack. Moreover, emerging technologies such as cyber capabilities, hypersonics, and encryption have the dual potential of exacerbating conflicts within the framework of the NPT while also offering avenues for achieving its objectives. While the NPT has been slow to address these evolving challenges, academia and non-governmental organizations have extensively studied their implications for nuclear issues. However, there remains a significant gap between civil society's engagement with emerging technologies and their integration into the NPT framework.[152]\nGiven its role as both a treaty and a forum, the NPT holds particular importance in addressing these challenges. States parties to the NPT have legal obligations regarding nuclear technology proliferation, making it essential\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nto consider the impact of emerging technologies on treaty compliance and verification. The NPT review process provides a unique opportunity for nuclear‐possessor and non‐possessor states to discuss and address a wide range of issues affecting nuclear order and treaty obligations. In light of these considerations, emerging technologies should be incorporated into all nuclear and non‐nuclear disarmament agreements, including the CTBT, the Conference on Disarmament (CD), and nuclear‐weapon‐free zones. However, the NPT, with its comprehensive legal framework and review mechanism, stands as a pivotal platform for addressing the challenges posed by emerging technologies to nuclear disarmament and non‐proliferation efforts.\nEdward Ifft highlights the CTBT innovative approach to addressing the challenge of unequal capacity among State parties to collect and evaluate data about compliance. The treaty establishes an IMS, comprising 337 globally distributed sites equipped with seismic, radionuclide, hydroacoustic, and infrared sensors. Ifft suggests that most States lack the resources to independently acquire and analyze this data. However, individual State parties can access professional technical analysis of IMS data and other relevant information free of charge from an international data center in Vienna. Drawing on the collaborative IMS model proposed by the CTBT, Ifft proposes the development of a Joint Attribution Mechanism (JAM) to assist nations with limited cyber forensic capabilities in collecting and analyzing data for attribution purposes. Such a mechanism could serve as a cost‐effective solution, encouraging nations to participate in a cyber treaty. Additionally, a JAM would enhance the credibility and legitimacy of the attribution process for nations with advanced cyber forensic capabilities. Ensuring reliable attribution is essential, but it is equally important to establish consistent consequences for cyber aggressors. This highlights the need for effective mechanisms to punish those responsible for cyberattacks consistently.\n## Conclusion\nThis article underscores the profound complexities and pressing challenges in the domain of cybersecurity, especially when viewed through the prism of international law. The pernicious implications of cyberattacks are ever more pertinent in an era increasingly dominated by digital data and connectivity. While the international community grapples with defining and responding to these cyber threats, our existing legal frameworks, rooted in conventional\nphysical paradigms, are inadequately equipped to address this novel form of virtual aggression.\nThe current structure of international law does not encapsulate an all-encompassing definition of cyberattacks, making it a precarious space in need of robust codification. The disruption wrought by cyberattacks on WTO agreements is even more deleterious, given the outdated security exceptions that remain unresponsive to risk-based cybersecurity measures. Moreover, the burgeoning surge in FDIs in digital assets, primarily intangible, exposes another lacuna in international law, conspicuously absent in contemporary investment treaties. These considerations underscore an imminent need to institute measures to mitigate the manifold issues arising from cyberattacks.\nPublic international law must evolve to address the specific nuances of cyberattacks and the consequent implications on State sovereignty, transborder crime, and national security. The ascendance of cyber aggression necessitates a re-examination of the fundamental tenets of international law, including the principles of Jus Ad Bellum and Jus In Bello, with a more nuanced lens. The complexities of attribution and the abstract nature of cyber warfare necessitate a shift in how we perceive sovereignty and territoriality in the digital age.\nIn the sphere of WTO law, the advent of cyber threats and the expansion of digital economies call for a revamp of trade rules and exceptions. It is crucial to establish a harmonized understanding of cybersecurity risks and potential countermeasures, with a balanced approach to cyber governance and free trade. Thus, a common vision is the need of the hour to work in collaboration internationally for ensuring cybersecurity and keeping cybercrimes at bay. The establishment of the Trade and Technology Council by the United States and the European Union represents a promising development in the quest for global consensus on trade and technology issues. This initiative holds the potential to facilitate increased collaboration and the harmonization of regulations across international borders.\nFinally, as cyberattacks increasingly target financial assets and systems, the role of investment law becomes paramount. The rise of data-driven businesses necessitates safeguarding digital assets and investments, requiring innovative legal mechanisms such as ‘digital-ready' BITs. Re-envisioning BITs to include digital assets, whilst establishing the scope of security provisions under the FET clause, can address potential investment claims from cyber risks. This would balance the need for a stable investment environment with the protection of digital assets, thereby fostering confidence amongst investors in the digital era.\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333",

In its literal sense, cybersecurity can be termed as the practice of protecting or securing a network, server, or electronic device from any external intruders, targeted attackers, or malicious opportunists. 'Cybersecurity' refers to the protection from damage, unauthorized use, or exploitation of the information contained in electronic systems to maintain their integrity and confidentiality. In a nutshell, cybersecurity strives to protect sensitive information or the digital information system (that stores such sensitive information) against targeted security risks. This practice is crucial as it helps in preserving and maintaining the integrity or privacy of data.\nThe 'International Organization for Standardization (ISO)' and 'International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)', in ISO/ERC 27000 (Information\n O A Hathaway and others, 'The Law of Cyber-Attack' (2012) 100 (4) Cal L Rev 817.

An individual or a group can carry out such an act. Furthermore, an act of this magnitude could also be conducted by the State or an independent criminal. Cyberattacks can be analyzed through four primary criteria. Firstly, they possess the capacity to manipulate, destroy, or exfiltrate data, rendering them inherently disruptive and unpredictable. Their origin may be domestic or foreign, introducing complexities in attribution. Secondly, the nature of the perpetrator varies, ranging from individual criminals to organized groups or entities. Thirdly, the impact of cyberattacks is predominantly virtual, encompassing data loss or manipulation, which significantly diminishes the affected data’s commercial value. Moreover, attacks on critical infrastructure can precipitate severe disruptions to essential services. Lastly, the attribution of cyberattacks to state actors presents challenges, necessitating substantial evidence to establish\n IBM Services, ‘What is a Cyber-attack?’ (IBM, 11 November 2020) <www.ibm.com by-services=\"\" business-continuity=\"\" cyberattack#:~:text=\"The%20most%20well%2Dknown%20type,malware%20may%20not%20be%20immediate\" in-en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.

There are several definitions produced by scholars, research organizations, and private enterprises. However, there is a need for a uniform/consensual legal definition to the term cyberattacks. Two definitions are frequently cited. The National Institute of Standards and Technology–Computer Security Resource Center: defines cyberattack as ‘[a]n attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information’. Secondly, the National Research Council’s Committee on Offensive Information Warfare defines cyber-attacks as ‘[e]fforts to alter, disrupt, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information or programs on them’.

For instance, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack attributed to the 'Guardians of Peace' raised suspicions of North Korean involvement, yet conclusive evidence remained elusive.\nThere is a major concern if these attacks can be attributed to a State;[7] such State attributable attacks would be considered, by virtue of 'Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter,' to be a volatile use of force.[8] The sovereignty of a State is transgressed when it falls prey to such attacks.[9] Attribution in cyberattacks poses significant challenges beyond simply identifying the responsible actor. Key issues include the lack of consensus on the required standards of proof, the debate over whether attributions should be made publicly or kept confidential, and the ambiguity surrounding the legal consequences of successful attribution. Additionally, while public attributions can serve purposes such as deterring future attacks and holding perpetrators accountable, they may also escalate tensions and risk revealing sensitive intelligence sources.[10] There might be a notable loss of information or reduction in its value which could pose significant threats to the economy and national security.[11] Due to their inherent characteristics, cyberattacks present a global challenge.

The United Nations General Assembly, in 2010, and the World Economic Forum, in 2019 have stressed the importance of cybersecurity by highlighting the global threat posed by cyberattacks. Consequently, there is burgeoning discourse surrounding the development of a cybersecurity treaty, paralleling established frameworks for managing other forms of strategic risk. However, crafting effective agreements necessitates a nuanced understanding of cyber incident typologies and their respective implications. Organizations such as the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) advocate for a comprehensive consideration of strategic risks inherent in cyber capabilities. Thus, addressing cyber threats mandates the formulation of holistic frameworks that reconcile national sovereignty, security imperatives, and international cooperation mandates.\nThis article draws upon theoretical foundations from international law, comparative law, and international relations to provide a thorough examination of the pressing issue of cyberattacks. Its conceptual framework illuminates the potential interpretation and development of international legal norms, compares distinct yet interconnected areas, and explores the broader geopolitical dimensions of this global challenge. By analyzing fundamental principles of international law – such as state sovereignty, the use of force, and state responsibility – within the context of cyber operations, the article raises critical questions about their applicability to emerging cyber realities. Furthermore, it employs comparative legal analysis to draw parallels between legal frameworks governing nuclear non-proliferation and potential cybersecurity frameworks, highlighting the importance of adapting existing legal mechanisms to address new challenges. Additionally, the article considers the roles of both state and non-state actors in cybercrimes and examines the geopolitical implications of attributing cyberattacks to states.\nThis article establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the challenges posed by cyberattacks and the ongoing pursuit of bolstered cybersecurity\n Marc Barrachin and Algirde Pipikaite, ‘We Need a Global Standard for Reporting Cyber Attacks’ (Harv Bus Rev, 8 November 2019) <https: 11=\"\" 2019=\"\" hbr.org=\"\" we-need-a-global-standard-for-reporting-cyber-attacks=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n United Nations General Assembly Res 64/211, ‘Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and Taking Stock of National Efforts to Protect Critical Information Infrastructures’ (17 March 2010) UN Doc A/RES/64/211.\n See Barrachin and Pipikaite (n 12).\n See Martha Finnermore and Duncan B Hollis, ‘Constructing Norms for Global Cybersecurity’ (2016) 110 AJIL 425.\n M Wohfeld and J Jasper, ‘Cyberattacks and Cyber Conflict: Where Is Conflict Resolution?’, in O Grech (ed), Contemporary Issues in Conflict Resolution (University of Malta 2018), 5–17.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\nwithin the domain of public international law. While clarity within general international law remains scarce, valuable insights can be gleaned from existing legal frameworks in international economic realms, such as international trade and investment law. The emergence of the cyber realm has introduced contemporary issues that challenge established norms and rules of international law, necessitating examination in terms of interpretation, application, and structure. Cyberattacks transcend mere technological phenomena, fundamentally reshaping traditional societal paradigms including concepts of capital[17] and warfare.[18] The article probes the adequacy of existing international legal and economic rules in defining cyberattacks and delineating breaches of established norms. It critically examines the efficacy of international law in regulating cyberattacks, recognizing the inherent complexities in defining and addressing such incidents. The article offers a nuanced definition of cyberattacks, recognizing their intricate nature that defies simple conceptualization. It contends that cyberattacks represent a modern manifestation of acts of war, a concept deeply rooted in international legal discourse spanning millennia. Exploring potential solutions, the article investigates the role of international economic law in mitigating cyber threats, particularly in safeguarding global data flows integral to contemporary globalization processes. Moreover, it delves into the potential applicability of investment treaties in regulating digital assets and scrutinizes existing parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation.[19] By examining how nuclear non-proliferation treaties serve as a precedent, the article explores the feasibility of developing a comprehensive set of international rules to govern cyberattacks, thereby addressing critical gaps in current regulatory frameworks.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nA cyberattack is any kind of malicious action aimed at obtaining unlawful access to information technology systems including the resources or valuable information of their users that they may encompass. Cyberattacks hit businesses every day, particularly targeting critical infrastructure, trade secrets, and intellectual property with commercial value, and other online information. Cyberattacks can peculiarly break into the defence systems which include defense capabilities and private military suppliers and can gravely threaten the security of the nation. Its effect on the economy cannot be ignored, especially in the case of the United States where approximately 90% of critical infrastructure is possessed by the private sector, and companies do not see any specific reason for investing in cybersecurity to secure public interest. By refusing to invest in cybersecurity, the private sector increases the exposure of the whole economy and society to cyber threats. The risk of cyberattacks that have the potential to cause large-scale shutdowns and huge amounts of other material harms are amplified by the digital transformation of the infrastructure of various sectors. Moreover, ‘information technology (IT)’, connected devices, cyber-physical systems, and industrial control systems are all potential\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\nattack vectors of critical infrastructure. The threat of cyber espionage is known and it may be centered on theft via access to cloud-based data platforms and malicious software. Finally, there exists a two-fold risk in the cyber-espionage area. First, any unauthorized person may access and steal sensitive personal information. Second, existing information may be altered to create a façade and disseminate fake news to the larger public. Furthermore, a major source of deceptive information and malicious publication could perhaps be, deep fake videos generated by ‘Artificial Intelligence (AI)’.\nIn the context of the growing importance of a data-driven economy for national economic progress, effective data governance emerges as a critical aspect of governance. Governments are increasingly prioritizing data governance and implementing measures to safeguard the digital economy against cyber threats. These measures include implementing export limitations and restricting foreign government access to national technology. One of the most significant and concerning cyberattacks targeted the US Government, its agencies, and numerous private companies – the ‘SolarWinds hack.’\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\n## 2.1 The Ambiguity of 'Cyberattack' within International Law\nDespite the pervasive phenomenon of cyberattacks in our increasingly interconnected contemporary society, where organisations are transitioning their operations and data storage to online platforms, international law remains ambivalent, lacking a precise and universally accepted legal definition for the term 'cyberattack'. This omission underscores a critical gap, especially as the digital realm continues to be a significant frontier for both commerce and potential conflict. The degree of digitization of economic activities is generally linked to the tendency of experiencing cyberattacks. A recent measure by the Indian government is the 'Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)' project. The process involves a biometric ID that assigns to each individual, a 12-digit number. It further requires, storing 10 fingerprints, iris scans and other necessary details such as names, addresses and date of birth to be recorded in the eGovernance cloud platform. Consequently, the practice involves an increased cybersecurity concern among the individuals, private organisations and the government agencies. In the absence of indigenous cybersecurity technology and patents in the nation, India's government has declared that it will be providing monetary incentives to Indian enterprises who acquire foreign firms with cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies. Perhaps worse, most of these threats have targeted small-scale industries that do not have the requisite means, instruments, or techniques to protect themselves and their business interests. Maintenance of cybersecurity is getting harder every year as cybercriminals continuously pose new threats, leverage new bugs, and carry out new sophisticated attacks; whilst regulatory institutions are still evolving and enhancing their standards.\n 'Scope of Russian Hacking Becomes Clear: Multiple U.S. Agencies Were Hit' (The New York Times, 14 December 2020), <https: 12=\"\" 14=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" rus=\"\" sia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Brett Van Niekerk, 'Suppression of Cyber-defences', IST-Africa Week Conference, Durban, 2016.

Projections by Cybersecurity Ventures suggest a dramatic rise in global cybercrime costs, with estimates indicating a potential annual total of USD 10.5 trillion by 2025, marking a considerable increase from USD 3 trillion in 2015. These figures underscore the immense economic impact of cybercrime, surpassing damages caused by natural disasters and even exceeding the collective value of significant illegal drug trades worldwide. Such crimes represent a substantial economic transfer globally, impeding innovation and investment. While no sector is immune to cyber threats, the financial services industry stands out as particularly vulnerable. The 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report highlights financial organizations as the most heavily targeted sector, followed by healthcare and public administration, respectively.\nThere has been no global consensus on the definition of cybersecurity. However, it has been defined by the International Telecommunication Union as 'a set of tools, policies, safeguards, and technologies that can protect the cyber environment and the assets of an organization or user.' Cybersecurity, therefore, seeks to protect and maintain the digital assets security of the organization or the user against the risks involved in the cyber environment. The approach offered by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) presents an intriguing perspective on cyberattacks. NIST's framework does not differentiate between state-sponsored actions and criminal activities, nor does it consider the distinct impact of cyber incidents on public versus private records, networks, and facilities. While prioritizing the integrity of information and information networks, NIST's framework fails to encompass broader societal goals such as national market growth, law enforcement access\n Steve Morgan, 'Cybercrime to Cost the World $10.5 Trillion Annually By 2025' (Cybercrime Magazine, 13 November 2020) <https: cybersecurityventures.com=\"\" hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Brian Cashell and others, 'The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attack' (United States Congressional Research Service, 1 April 2004) <https: ras.org=\"\" rl32331.pdf=\"\" sgp=\"\" crs=\"\" misc=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Kenning Arlitsch and Adam Edelman, 'Staying Safe: Cyber Security for People and Organizations' (2014) 54 J Libr Admin 46.\n '2020 Data Breach Investigation Report' (Verizon, 2020) <https: 2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf=\"\" enterprise.verizon.com=\"\" resources=\"\" reports=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023; the Public Administration sector manages with the administration of local, state and federal government.\n International Telecommunication Union, 'Overview of Cybersecurity: Recommendation ITU-T X.1205' (ITU-T, 4 August 2008) <https: rec=\"\" t-rec-x.1205-200804-i=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nAn alternative legal definition proposed by the United States National Research Council defines cyberattacks as purposeful actions aimed at altering, disrupting, deceiving, degrading, or destroying computer systems, networks, or the information and programs within them.43 While this definition offers rationality, it also highlights ambiguity, particularly in differentiating between basic cybercrimes and cyberattacks. This lack of clarity may lead to inconsistencies within the legal framework, hindering effective coordination among agencies.\n## 2.2 International Responses and Legal Implications\nThe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has introduced the Cyber Norms Index to monitor and compare significant achievements in negotiating and establishing norms for governmental actions in cyberspace. This index aids policymakers and observers in analyzing proposals for cyber norms, tracking their development, and assessing their uniform adoption by members of the global community. Users can utilize the index to examine multilateral outcomes and compare information using various groups or keywords. Additionally, there has been a widespread call for norms aimed at immunizing and stabilizing cyberspace.44 CSO Online45 has curated a list of\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</http:>\nQIAN\nnotable 21st-century security breaches, employing simple metrics such as the number of affected consumers and distinguishing between breaches resulting from malicious intent and those caused by accidental exposure. One notable breach involved theft of encrypted consumer payment information from Adobe's systems, affecting approximately 3 million customers, with login data manipulation for an unspecified number of users. More recently, Canva, an Australian web design app, experienced a significant breach compromising sensitive information of over 100 million consumers. Another prominent breach occurred in 2016 when Yahoo reported what is described as the largest privacy breach in history, compromising sensitive data of nearly five million users, including unauthorized access to full names, email addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers.\nBoth the private sector and governmental agencies are susceptible to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by various incidents.

SolarWinds, a prominent US information technology company, fell victim to a cyberattack that went undetected for months,55 affecting its customers. US authorities suspect Russian hackers to be behind the attack, which targeted not the federal government or a private organization's network directly, but a third-party technology provider. This tactic, known as a 'Supply Chain' attack, exploited vulnerabilities in SolarWinds' Orion IT management tools, compromising high-ranking departments of the US government, including the Department of Homeland Security and Treasury, as well as private enterprises like FireEye.\n## 2.3 Cyber-Attacks on the Upswing: Risk for Worsening\nHacking groups and state-sponsored organizations have discovered that cyber-attacks are an effective weapon for balancing the playing field with rivals. The convergence of an attacker threat is highly risky and an expensive danger of insider manipulation or theft of intellectual property has generated a precarious environment in the private sector.56 While employee incompetence and human errors contribute to organizational vulnerabilities, recent years have witnessed a notable surge in attacks by malicious actors with access to sensitive business information. The global cybersecurity landscape is fraught with concerns regarding the likelihood of financial losses, misappropriation of classified data, and disruptions to critical infrastructure. The escalating scale and complexity of cyberattacks have not only heightened the risk of being caught off guard but have also increased the costs associated with preventing and recovering from such incidents.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.reuters.com>\nQIAN\nDespite media attention being drawn to high-profile cyberattacks targeting large corporations like Target, Netflix, and financial institutions such as JP Morgan, it is small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that remain the most vulnerable.[57] Industry analysts estimate that up to  $60\\%$  of SMEs may face collapse within six months due to cyberattacks, ranging from phishing scams to ransomware assaults.[58]\nChina's initiative to develop digital infrastructure, known as the 'Digital Silk Road,' alongside its traditional infrastructure projects, aims to enhance international connectivity in terms of communication and data flow.[59] This digital complement to the land-based 'Silk Road Economic Belt' and the 'Twenty-First Century Maritime Silk Road' seeks to bolster capacity for the exchange of goods.[60]\nIn light of these developments, states reliant on global interactions must prioritize the development of credible policies on cross-border data flow. As nations seek to thrive in the post-COVID-19 era and compete in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, facilitating cross-border data flow is imperative.

Historically, such acts encompassed a wide range of actions, including unfriendly economic or commercial measures and actions that insulted a nation's pride. However, rapid technological advancements have challenged this traditional concept, rendering established legal categories inadequate to regulate contemporary activities.\nIn the context of cyberspace, clarifying the concept of *casus belli* serves to provide a clear standard against which states can assess their behavior and that of others when initiating or responding to cyberattacks. Traditional theories of *casus belli*, often emphasizing the violent and aggressive nature of armed operations, may not directly apply to cyberattacks due to their non-physical nature. Nevertheless, cyberattacks can be viewed as potential triggers for war if they cause substantial physical damage to the target's computer systems. While a destructive attack on computer systems by a nation-state may not necessarily constitute a *casus belli*, a significant strike solely targeting computer systems could potentially justify a defensive military response.\nClassifying cyber assaults, such as computer intrusions or communication disruptions, presents significant challenges. For instance, while both data breaches and attacks on air traffic control systems are invasive, the latter could result in greater damage and loss of life, potentially constituting an 'armed attack' rather than mere data theft. Additionally, attacks causing significant harm, regardless of the level of intrusion, may qualify as 'armed attacks.' Large-scale cyberattacks have the potential to incapacitate an opponent's ability to wage war effectively, surpassing the impact of traditional kinetic attacks. Such attacks can disrupt vital functions such as leadership, communication,\n Hannah Herbst, 'Cyber Attacks &amp; Modern Warfare' (*Denver J Intl L Pol*, 8 April 2020) <http: djilp.org=\"\" cyber-attacks-modern-warfare=\"\"></http:> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Colonel Charles J Dunlap, Jr, 'International Law and Terrorism' <http: dunlapterrorism.pdf=\"\" people.duke.edu=\"\" ~pfeaver=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Lawrence T Greenberg and others, *Information Warfare and International Law* (DOD Command Command and Control Research Program 1998).\n Charles C Poché, 'This Means War!

Consequently, cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure should be regarded as legitimate grounds for declaring a casus belli.\n## 3.2 Conceptualizing Cyber-Operation as Use of force\nThe United Nations (UN) Charter, a foundational document governing the use of force (*Jus Ad Bellum*), outlines in Article 2(4) that Member States must refrain from threatening or using force to undermine the territorial sovereignty or political independence of another state, unless justified by self-defense or authorized by the UN Security Council. Determining whether a cyberattack violates this prohibition requires an understanding of how ‘force’ is interpreted in international law and whether cyberattacks meet the criteria set out by these standards.\nA narrow interpretation of ‘force’ is recommended, aligning with the objectives outlined in the UN Charter’s preamble to maintain international peace and security and prevent war. However, the Charter does not exhaustively address all aspects of force regulation, and further guidance is sought from customary international law, as noted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Offensive cyber capabilities, such as implanting harmful code into computer networks, share similarities with traditional military actions, economic coercion, and subversion. The effects of cyberattacks can range from temporary disruptions, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, to severe physical damage and loss of life, such as disrupting emergency networks for first responders.\nCategorizing all cyberattacks as a ‘use of force’ under Article 2(4) would require an exceptionally broad interpretation. The Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare suggests that cyberattacks with tangible consequences in the physical\n UN Charter Art 2, para 4.\n Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ (2012) 30 Berkeley J Intl L 525.

The Tallinn Manual outlines criteria including severity, spontaneity, directness, intrusiveness, quantification, and presumptive legitimacy to evaluate cyberattack consequences against those of conventional attacks. If a cyberattack exhibits sufficient resemblance to these criteria, broadening the prohibition on force is warranted. Despite the United States' emphasis on consequences over methodology, modern society's heavy reliance on computer systems raises concerns about incapacitating physical infrastructure without tangible destruction.\nThe SolarWinds incident underscores the importance of characterizing cyberattacks as casus belli. SolarWinds, a company serving a vast clientele including major US government agencies, fell victim to cyber-attacks that compromised the integrity of their data. While some argue these attacks do not meet the casus belli threshold and constitute espionage, distinguishing between cyber-attacks and espionage remains challenging. Responses to cyber espionage must be strategized akin to other cyberattacks, especially in cases like supply chain attacks, where damage control may overshadow the actors' intent. While cyber espionage typically does not warrant casus belli, it may do so if aimed at undermining a state's political and social institutions. The intertwining of espionage and operational access in incidents like SolarWinds raises concerns about latent vulnerabilities and potential future attacks of unprecedented magnitude.

In the context of cyberattacks, ensuring proportionality requires a nuanced understanding of technical intricacies. For example, a cyber response coded into software demands extensive knowledge of potential targets, often obtained through conventional cyber exploitation methods.94 The Office of the Attorney General of California defined cyber exploitation as 'the non-consensual distribution or publication of intimate photos or videos\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nonline'.95 Cyber exploitation hurts the privacy of an individual and public safety by publishing photos or videos without appropriate consent.\nHence, for the fulfilment of the principle of necessity, it is essential that all the other remedies that do not involve such a use of force have been proven futile or have been exhausted, without success.96 According to the authors of The Tallinn Manual, the availability, or lack thereof, of accessible options that do not rise to the level of use of force is the key to doing a 'necessity analysis' in the cyber realm.97 If a State's military computer networks are breached as a result of a cyber-attack, it may take some time for the State to retaliate using cyber or kinetic means.98 When there is no other feasible choice and the assault is real and imminent, the victim state may invoke self-defense to justify reasonable, necessary, and proportional safeguards to maintain its security.99\n## 4 Global Data Flow and the Transformation of International Trade: Issues and Challenges for Trade Law\nThe growing digital trade landscape has heightened concerns regarding cybersecurity within the international rules-based trading system. Prior to the establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, bilateral trade was seen as beneficial for increasing demand for local products and improving living standards.100 However, the implementation of GATT and subsequent efforts to regulate and harmonize international trade introduced complexities, particularly regarding the interpretation of terms like non-state actors, terrorism, the environment, and cybersecurity measures at the domestic and international levels.101 During Ministerial Conference 11 in 2017, 71 World Trade Organization (WTO) members, both developed and developing, issued a Joint Statement on Electronic Commerce, expressing their commitment to exploring future negotiations on the trade-related aspects of electronic commerce. Currently, negotiations involve 90 WTO members, with The Gambia\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\nbeing the latest addition. An updated negotiation text from November 2023, under Section C, addresses cybersecurity. It emphasizes the evolving nature of cyber threats and outlines measures for member states to enhance cybersecurity capabilities. These measures include building the capabilities of national entities responsible for cybersecurity incident response, collaborating to identify and mitigate malicious intrusions or dissemination of malicious code affecting electronic networks, addressing cybercrime, and sharing information for awareness and best practices.\n## 4.1 Legal Pitfalls in the Context of Digital Trade\nIn the sphere of international trade, cybersecurity measures are employed to address illegal data breaches by non-state actors that affect legitimate trading activities among WTO Member States. However, the cybersecurity countermeasures are often justified by the States based upon the general and security exceptions under the GATT and ‘General Agreement on Trade in Services Agreement (GATS)’. With the advent of the WTO Panel decision in Russia-Traffic in Transit, it is now well established that recourse to exceptions under the WTO is justiciable and not entirely self-judging.\nBuilding on this, the concept of ‘national security unilateralism,’ as delineated by Chaisse and Georgopoulos, reflects an emerging trend where states increasingly prioritize their national security interests, sometimes contravening established international economic norms. A prominent example of this trend is the trade policies of the United States under the Trump administration, marked by unilateral tariff impositions that circumvent standard global trade procedures. This paradigm shift, moving away from a cooperative, rules-based approach in international economic relations to a more insular,\n WTO Electronic Commerce Negotiations Updated Consolidated Negotiating Text – November 2023 <https: img=\"\" pdf=\"\" wto_ji=\"\">\n Panel Report, Russia – Traffic in Transit, WT/DS512/R, adopted April 2019; Dylan Geraets, ‘WTO Issues Ruling in Russia – Traffic in Transit: Measures Justified on National Security Grounds Are Justiciable’ (Mayer Brown, 8 April 2019) <https: 04=\"\" 2019=\"\" en=\"\" en=\"\" publications=\"\" wto-issues-ruling-in-russia-traffic-in-transit-measures-justified-on-national-security-grounds-are-justiciable#_edn2=\"\" www.mayerbrown.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023. A provision is self-judging when the members can decide whether and how this exception can be applied to the measure. On the one hand, it is non-justiciable when the issue cannot be subject to the findings of a WTO Panel or the adjudicative system. On the other hand, the provision is justiciable if the phrases ‘it considers’ and ‘necessary’ are not read together.\n Julien Chaisse and Georgios Dimitropoulos, ‘Special Economic Zones in International Economic Law: Towards Unilateral Economic Law’ (2021) 24(2) JIEL 229–57.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:>\nQIAN\nsecurity-centric model, presents significant challenges to the traditional frameworks of international trade law.\nThe proliferation of digital trade raises concerns$^{105}$ pertaining to cross-border data flow, critical infrastructure of the trading countries, and vulnerability to cyberattacks, which can potentially lead to violation of trade obligations as envisaged under the GATT, GATS, and TBT Agreements. While the foundation of the GATT is based upon non-discrimination between domestic and foreign goods, an effective domestic policy to counter cyberattacks can result in restricting the access of certain suspicious manufacturers of goods to further participate in the supply chain.$^{106}$ The States have sought to justify these inherent trade-distorting measures based upon the general exception, under the GATT.\nSimilarly, in the context of the TBT Agreement, the Appellate Body in $EC - Asbestos$ held that where the risk associated with cross-border trade increases, the discretion of the Member States also increases in parallel.$^{107}$ Even under the GATS, Member States can take recourse to justify cybersecurity measures based upon the general and security exceptions although the scope of application of trade-restrictive measures is relatively less broad as compared to GATT. The regional free trade agreements have gone one step further by allowing commitments from reciprocating nations to allow the cross-border transfer of personal information and the restricted prohibition on the measures of data localization.\nWhile the security exceptions under the GATT and GATS are self-judging in nature, they are however not immune from panel review as highlighted in Russia – Traffic in Transit.$^{108}$ The general exceptions under the GATT and GATS are resorted to justify measures necessary to protect public morals or secure compliance with laws and regulations. Based upon these, the member nation must evidence whether the cybersecurity measure is ‘necessary’ in light of balancing the factors and whether less trade restricting alternatives are available.$^{109}$ It is, however, agreed to some extent that these\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</www.globaltradealert.org>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\ndomestic cybersecurity measures outweigh the costs associated with them leading to better information symmetry, regulatory oversight, and reducing business malpractices.\n## 4.2 Strengthening International Trade Law in the Digital Era\nThe sole reliance upon the general and security exceptions under the WTO covered agreements results in drastic trade distortion effects which can lead to justification for most, if not all, cybersecurity measures. Consequently, cooperation amongst Member States must be achieved to establish suitable standards such that the measures result in minimum trade distortion. On a preliminary level, it is essential that world governments agree upon a uniform understanding of the nature and scope of cybersecurity measures and the risks posed by them towards international trade. The domestic and international standard-setting organizations can prescribe certain standards for usage and regulation of cybersecurity measures in line with the ISO and IEC standards on cybersecurity.[110]\nThe WTO has made efforts to regulate cybercrime through initiatives such as the Consolidated E-Commerce Negotiating Text circulated in December 2020.[111] The most controversial clause in the document is a broad exception that has been proposed to be incorporated into the negotiated text.[112] This exception allows Member States to freely adopt measures, notwithstanding the obligations under the agreement, to guarantee cybersecurity, safeguard cyberspace sovereignty safeguard the lawful rights and interests of the citizens, juridical persons, and other organizations, and achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives.\"[113] The only limitation to this broad power is that the measures taken must not be arbitrary or discriminatory; they must\nRequirement case significantly clarifies the application of the national security exception in WTO law, particularly by establishing that such exceptions are not entirely self-judging and subject to review (United States – Origin Marking Requirement, WT/DS597/10, Panel report under appeal on 26 January 2023). It underscores the necessity for concrete evidence to justify invoking national security, thereby narrowing the scope for its arbitrary use in trade disputes. For a commentary, see J Chaisse and K Olaoye, 'United States – Origin Marking Requirement, WT/DS597/R' (2023) 117(3) AJIL 488–493.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></http:>\nQIAN\nbe applied in an equal manner to all nations without any discrimination. Further, these measures must not be 'a disguised restriction on trade' and should not be 'more than necessary' to attain the objective. While the official text of this clause remains unavailable, leaked information provides insights into its content. Despite references to the negotiating text on the WTO's official website, it remains inaccessible to the public. Nevertheless, preliminary observations can be made based on the leaked information.\nWhile the exception provides visibility to cybersecurity issues and nation-states with the autonomy to design rigorous cybersecurity mechanisms, the exception is not a comprehensive regulation of cybersecurity and is only an enabling provision. Cyber-security measures remain the prerogative of Member States to keep in place. As a result, there remains a lack of comprehensive regulation of cyber-related issues in international trade. This status quo is especially concerning in a vital and ever-growing area like e-commerce. How this exception will be invoked by Member States remains to be seen but backlash based on information freedom concerns can certainly be anticipated. Further, the exception could also prove to be overbroad. The exception, apart from empowering Member States to take cybersecurity-related measures, allows any measures taken to achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives'. Such a vague enabling provision could lead to disastrous consequences, which could undermine the foundations of international trade. The term 'public policy', typically used in relation to international commercial arbitration, has been held by numerous judgments to be an 'unruly horse'. Due to the inherent lack of a precise definition, arbitration scholars have found the concept to be excessively malleable, shaped by the subjective values and principles in each nation. Adding to the existing uncertainty around cyber-attacks and cyber-security, the insertion of an unruly horse that is 'public policy', would certainly be undesirable. The text must be revised to include a definition of public policy, or at the least illustrations of the term.\nMoreover, the establishment of standards alone is insufficient; robust compliance and enforcement mechanisms are necessary at the national level.

However, infrastructure encompasses not only physical structures but also digital infrastructure, which plays a crucial role in attracting foreign direct investments (FDI). The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of workplaces, leading to increased reliance on digital assets such as fiber networks and broadband connectivity. Consequently, enhancing a nation's digital infrastructure can attract more FDI, particularly from e-commerce and technology companies.\nNumerous prominent companies globally possess trade secrets and intellectual property rights crucial for their commercial viability. Cyber hackers pose a significant threat by potentially dismantling these assets within a short span, thereby jeopardizing not only the company's survival but also the broader economy. Emphasizing a robust cybersecurity framework becomes imperative as a prerequisite for engaging in any business endeavor. States\n Shin-yi Peng, “Private” Cybersecurity Standards?

Given the substantial contribution of digital trade to global GDP and its benefits to nations worldwide, addressing threats to the digital trade system becomes paramount. These considerations are of profound significance, particularly as e-commerce trade not only fosters corporate growth and profitability but also facilitates employment generation and mitigates socioeconomic inequalities. According to the UNCTAD report, e-commerce transactions amounted to over USD 29 trillion by 2017, constituting approximately 36% of global GDP. As the world increasingly embraces data-driven technology, the centrality of effective data governance becomes ever more apparent.\nThe evolution of international trade towards digital platforms has exposed nation-states to new challenges, particularly cyberattacks, which pose threats to data integrity. One key question is whether cyberattacks should be considered acts of war. Given that virtually all industries are potential targets for cyber hackers, a unified and international solution is necessary to address this problem. Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) could serve as a means to tackle this emerging issue. BITs provide fundamental protections to foreign investments and offer various dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration. Integrating substantive protection against cybercrimes into BITs would enhance the accountability of states and incentivize them to adopt robust data protection laws. This approach could contribute to mitigating the risks posed by cyberattacks in the context of international investment.\n## 5.1 Digital Assets as Emerging Investments\nThe initial task for investors is to ascertain whether digital assets meet the criteria to qualify as 'covered investments' under BITs. As investment tribunals grapple with claims related to cybercrime, they will face the challenge of addressing investment law policy arguments. Extending BIT provisions to encompass such crimes will inevitably entail implications for both investors\n ‘A Roadmap for Cross Border Data Flows: Future-Proofing Readiness and Cooperation in the New Data Economy: White Paper’ (World Economic Forum, 9 June 2020) <www3.we forum.org 2020.pdf=\"\" docs=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_Cross_Border_Data_Flows_2020.=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_cross_border_data_flows_2020.pdf=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Marina Dane, ‘Digitalisation, Trade, and Geopolitics in Asia’ (2020) <www.kas.de 2020=\"\" 8314289=\"\" documents=\"\" digitalisation%2c+trade%2c+and+geopolitics+in+asia.pdf=\"\" www.kas.de=\"\">/3bf29911-2dcb-6e72-d4aa-936f9b5082d0?version=1.0&amp;t=1608181259722&gt; accessed 19 October 2021.\n Aaronson and Struett (n 66); ‘Global e-Commerce Sales Surged to $29 Trillion’ (UNCTAD Press Release, 29 March 2019) <https: global-e-commerce-sales-surged-29-trillion=\"\" press-material=\"\" unctad.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.kas.de></www3.we>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nTribunals have typically referenced the definition provided in BITs and objective economic criteria to ascertain whether an investment has been established, contrasting it with a mere commercial transaction. In interpreting BIT provisions, tribunals often turn to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, which outlines the general rule for interpreting treaty provisions, taking into consideration the purpose of the BIT and its other provisions. Certain BITs, such as the German Model BIT, employ a broad asset-based definition of investment, encompassing phrases like ‘every kind of asset’, thereby potentially encompassing digital assets as well.\nWhen considering the inclusion of digital assets within the definition of an asset, it is crucial to carefully delineate the concept of digital assets itself. The primary concern regarding digital assets pertains to the data they encapsulate, which holds both intrinsic and extrinsic value. The economic worth of digital assets is intricately linked to their data content, with the value of a digital asset being inherently tied to the data it contains. Intrinsic value pertains to the core data itself, while extrinsic value encompasses additional elements such as customer metadata, which companies often monetize significantly. Furthermore, there exists a symbiotic relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic value, akin to the seeds and flesh of a fruit, respectively. While not all BITs offer a broad definition of investment, it is advisable to establish a clear understanding of digital assets within the context of investment arbitration to mitigate the risk of numerous arbitration claims stemming from uncertainties in this regard.\nApart from the definition of an investment, there are other factors that can affect the inclusion of digital assets under the definition of covered investments, such as economic factors. If the definition of investment\n Enikő Horváth and Severin Klinkmüller, ‘The Concept of “Investment” in the Digital Economy: The Case of Social Media Companies’ (2019) 20 JWIT 577, 593.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nprovided under Article 25 (1) ICSID is relied on, digital assets might very well be excluded as a covered investment. Therefore, a broad definition in the BIT would be ideal to bring digital assets within the investment arbitration regime. There are various definitions of investment in BITs which particularly limit the definition of investment by making it mandatory for investments to have some connection with economic factors such as expectations of profits or assumption of risk. For instance, in the case of Romak SA v Uzbekistan, the Tribunal adopted a restrictive approach in interpreting the definition of an investment.[126] It's essential for investment tribunals to recognize that digital companies often operate under long-term business models, where the initial investment is directed towards research and development.[127] These companies may take a considerable period to generate revenue, distinguishing them from single commercial transactions.[128]\nAnother pertinent issue relates to the requirement of a territorial link in various BITs, stipulating that investments must be made within the territory of the host State. Establishing the territorial presence of digital assets poses inherent challenges.[129] Jonathan Bick's categorization of digital assets into possession, location, and control underscores the importance of these factors in establishing a territorial link between the State and the investment. In Abaclat v Argentina,[130] the Tribunal emphasized that the nature of the investment is crucial in determining its location, focusing on how the funds were ultimately utilized rather than where they were initially disbursed. This interpretation helps alleviate some of the challenges in proving digital assets as covered investments. In Wena Hotel v Egypt, the Tribunal affirmed that expropriation encompasses both tangible and intangible assets, including digital\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333</www.businessinsider.in></www.bcg.com>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\nassets, under international law. In SPP v Egypt, the tribunal clarified that it is an accepted proposition that the protection of international law extends to contract rights and therefore compensation should be made for taking away these rights. Moreover, in Tippetts v Tams-Affa, Tribunal stated that under international law, even if the title in the property is not affected, its deprivation may occur by the interference of a State in the use or enjoyments of benefits attached to the property. Since the assumption of control does not imply that the property has been acquired by the government, compensation should be paid under international law, indicating that the owner was deprived of their fundamental right of ownership of the property.\n## 5.2 Investment Claims in the Age of Cybersecurity\nThe central concern in this context revolves around whether investors can pursue claims against states for cybercrimes. Studies from 2017 indicate that a single data breach can cost a company up to USD 3.62 million on average. The severity of costs varies depending on factors like the type and volume of data stolen; for instance, the leakage of trade secrets could pose an existential threat to a company. The principle of ‘Fair and Equitable Treatment’ (FET) is pivotal in this regard, as it obliges states to provide investors with essential conditions, potentially enabling investors to lodge claims for cybercrimes.\nTribunals typically assess whether state actions are arbitrary under FET provisions by referencing core principles. Regarding digital assets, FET claims may challenge alterations in measures related to national cybersecurity. ‘Transparency’ plays a crucial role for investors conducting business in a host state, and states are obligated to maintain transparency. While states have\n Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000) para 98.\n Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/84/3, Award (1992) para 164.\n Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v TAMS-AFFA Consulting, 225 6 IRAN-US CTR 219.\n Julien Chaisse and Cristen Bauer, ‘Cybersecurity and the Protection of Digital Assets: Assessing the Role of International Investment Law and Arbitration’ (2019) 21 Vand J Ent &amp; Tech L 549, 568.\n In Glamis Gold Ltd v United States, Award, IIC 380 (2009), it is mentioned that ‘fair and equitable treatment encompasses a universe of “fundamental” principles common throughout the world that include “the duty to act in good faith, due process, transparency and candor, and fairness and protection from arbitrariness’. In MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004), the Tribunal agreed with a legal opinion by Judge Schwebel that fair and equitable treatment encompassed such fundamental standards as good faith, due process, non-discrimination and proportionality.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nthe right to amend laws concerning national cybersecurity to achieve public policy objectives, such changes must not be inconsistent, as demonstrated in the case of PSEG Global v Republic of Turkey. In this case, Turkey's frequent changes to the law were deemed to create uncertainty for investors, violating FET provisions.\nAnother relevant case involving the implementation of inconsistent policies by a state is MTD Equity v Republic of Chile. The tribunal ruled that Chile violated FET provisions by adopting contradictory positions with the investor regarding data localization policies. Chile's support for these policies on national security grounds increased costs for foreign investors. Similarly, data localization policies initiated by the Vietnamese government have been challenged by tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Google on economic and human rights grounds. Regarding claims related to Denial of Justice, these typically entail the right to be heard. Such a right is infringed when the cyber legislation of the host state fails to provide effective opportunities for all parties to present their case.\nIn addition to the aforementioned considerations, claims may also arise based on the Full Protection and Security standard (FPS). These claims encompass not only threats from armed rebels but also modern dangers posed by cybercriminals. Cyberattacks can compromise the three primary pillars of security: confidentiality, availability, and integrity. A claim under FPS due to a cyberattack can be sustained if it can be demonstrated that the security assured by the host State extends beyond physical protection. Factors such as the standard liability of the host State and the potential overlap between FPS and FET provisions are also pivotal in determining whether the investment was deprived of legal protection.\nThe definition of investment has evolved over time, and similarly, the application of FPS has expanded. An investor can succeed in their claim even in the absence of a physical attack, as exemplified in the case of Azurix v Argentina, where the host State was deemed responsible for providing an overall safe environment to investors. Given that digital assets predominantly fall under the category of intangible assets, they can be interpreted to meet the criteria of covered investments, thus availing the protection of FPS provisions in BITs.\n PSEG Global Inc v Republic of Turkey, ICSID Case No ARB/02/5, Award (2007) paras 248–256.\n MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Republic of Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004) para 189.\n Azurix Corp v Argentina, ICSID Case No ARB/01/12, Award (2004) para 408.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nIn instances where host States lack cyber laws, courts have applied analogical reasoning, drawing from laws related to privacy and theft. However, if domestic courts fail to apply such principles and a void in cybersecurity laws persists, this absence could be deemed a violation of the FPS standard. The FPS standard underscores the State's duty to furnish investors with an adequate legal framework for protection. Intangible assets, if deemed investments under the relevant BIT, can be subject to expropriation, including indirect expropriation resulting in asset depreciation. Addressing these issues requires enhancing the contents of BITs by expanding the definition of investment to encompass digital assets. States must recognize that safeguarding investors from cybercrime not only benefits investors but also preserves the economy and the privacy of citizens, serving the public interest of the host State. Incorporating cyberattacks under the FPS provision in BITs can compel host States to fulfill their obligation and shield investors from cyber threats, which have the potential to devastate companies in an instant. Therefore, it is imperative to prohibit these detrimental criminal actions.\n## 5.3 National Security Exceptions in Investment Law\nVarious international investment agreements incorporate exceptions, including those related to national security. This exception grants host States the authority to implement precautionary measures. However, there is considerable debate within the Investor ISDS regime regarding the basis for invoking this national security exception. Some argue that it is a self-judging provision prone to arbitrary use by States, while others contend that it is based on necessity. From the perspective of host countries, national security interests are\n Wena Hotels LTD v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000).\n Occidental Exploration and Production Company v The Republic of Ecuador, LCIA Case No UN3467 (1976).\n Katia Yannaca-Small, 'Essential Security Interests under International Investment Law', in OECD (ed.), International Investment Perspectives: Freedom of Investment in a Changing World (2007).\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\ndeemed significant, both for developed and developing nations. Developed countries often invoke national security interests in response to attempted takeovers of industries, whereas developing countries may do so during economic crises.^[142]^\nHowever, prior to invoking this exception, States should adhere to the requirement of explicit good faith. Regular reviews should be conducted to assess the ongoing necessity of upholding security-related investment restrictions. In the author's view, all these remedies prevent this exception of national security from becoming a mere 'black and white' matter and a different solution should be adopted which can balance the rights of the contracting parties and foreign investors. Hence, the threat to cybersecurity such as cyber-attacks should be covered under the umbrella of national security. By invoking these exceptions, the States are likely to take certain measures to prevent these crimes that would violate the international investment agreements and would be able to justify such measures under existing exceptions.\n## 6 Making the Linkages: Nuclear Proliferation and Cyberattacks\nIn contemporary times, parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation are frequently drawn, owing to the escalating threat that cyberattacks pose to global security and diplomacy.^[143]^ Cybersecurity has transcended local boundaries to become a matter of international concern, impacting peace and security on a global scale. However, existing international law inadequately addresses these cybersecurity threats, necessitating the establishment of more robust and effective regulations. A recent report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) highlighted the strategic risks posed by cyberattacks, underscoring the urgent need for the introduction of a cybersecurity treaty. The international community must recognize and address the risks posed by cybersecurity, analogous to the approach taken with non-proliferation agreements.\nNuclear non-proliferation aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and associated delivery systems, with the overarching goal of averting nuclear conflict or catastrophe in the future. Conversely, cyberattacks encompass malicious attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or valuable data. The proliferation of cyberattacks has raised concerns among financial institutions, corporations, and governments regarding their potential\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nAs technology becomes increasingly integral to government, institutional, and personal operations, parallels between nuclear and cyber threats become apparent. For instance, the NC3 systems of nuclear-armed governments heavily rely on digital processors and computers, rendering them vulnerable to hacking and cyberattacks. Moreover, the nuclear force infrastructure encompasses weapons, launch sites, and command authorities interconnected through communication and data processing technologies, facilitating cyber vulnerabilities. Despite the reluctance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to address the convergence of nuclear and cyber threats, scholars and non-governmental experts have extensively documented their interactions. Without stronger protections against cyberattacks and illegal hacking, the realm of nuclear weapons and security remains susceptible to exploitation.\n## 6.1 Comparative Analysis of Legal Frameworks\nEfforts in nuclear non-proliferation have spanned approximately fifty years, originating in the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. The earliest initiatives began within the UN, with Article 11(1) of the UN Charter emphasizing the preservation of international peace and security. A significant development during this period was the conclusion of the Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) in 1963, although some countries abstained from signing due to perceived weaknesses in its provisions, notably the absence of international control mechanisms or spot inspections.\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis highlighted the need for a comprehensive framework to address nuclear proliferation. Consequently, the NPT was signed in 1968 by 62 countries, including nuclear weapon states like the US. Notably, China and France refrained from signing initially. The NPT came\n Stéphane Lhuissier and Fabien Tripier, *A Measure of the Evolution of Cyber Risk* (17 December 2021) <https: blog-entry=\"\" blocnotesdeleco.banque-france.fr=\"\" measure-evolution-cyber-risk=\"\" en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Then, in 1946, the Atomic Energy Commission was set up to recommend measures for controlling atomic energy. In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was created with the goal of promoting and overseeing to promote and oversee the peaceful use of nuclear technology.\n The PTBT can be viewed as the first global and formal attempt towards non-proliferation. At first, the Treaty was only ratified by the USSR, the US, and the UK.\n For instance, China conducted Project 596 in 1964, which was its first atom bomb test. Due to its relatively small audience, and the fact that even its signatories continued to defy it, the PTBT was largely a failure.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\ninto force in 1970, categorizing countries into nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states, with the former defined as those that conducted nuclear tests before January 1967. Subsequent developments included the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, such as the Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America, and agreements like the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT-I) between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\nFollowing the end of the Cold War in 1991, efforts in non-proliferation intensified, with particular focus on strengthening the NPT. The revelation of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program after the Gulf War prompted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to introduce the Model Additional Protocol, enhancing its access to information and nuclear facilities. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 1996 marked a significant milestone, prohibiting all nuclear explosions and providing for on-site inspections and confidence-building measures.\nIn recent years, cybercrime and cyberattacks have emerged as significant threats to international security, paralleling the concerns posed by nuclear proliferation in the past. Analogous to the NPT for nuclear issues, there is a growing need for a comprehensive treaty addressing cybercrime, regulation of the internet, and law enforcement procedures for cross-border investigations. These issues carry profound implications for human rights, economic systems, and national security. International cooperation is crucial in developing effective regulatory frameworks for cyberspace, fostering confidence among stakeholders and ensuring a secure digital environment.\n## 6.2 Lessons from Nuclear Law for Cyber Regulation\nThe NPT is a three-part global pact intended at restricting the spread of nuclear weapons: (1) non-proliferation, (2) disarmament, and (3) peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The basic tenets of the treaty include the principle that nuclear weapons will not be acquired by States that do not have them, nuclear-weapon States will pursue disarmament, and all States have access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes under safeguards.\nAccording to Article IX of the NPT, 'nuclear weapon states (NWS)' are those that have detonated a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967,\n Following suit, states of the South Pacific established an NWFZ in 1985, Southeast Asia in 1995, Africa in 1996, and Central Asia in 2006.\n Seven years later, SALT-I was followed up by the signing of SALT-II by these two nations, which further limited their nuclear capabilities.\n Deborah Brown, 'Cybercrime is Dangerous, But a New UN Treaty Could Be Worse for Rights' (13 August 2021) <https: 08=\"\" 13=\"\" 2021=\"\" cybercrime-dangerous-new-un-treaty-could-be-worse-rights=\"\" news=\"\" www.hrw.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) supplements the NPT and includes a Protocol detailing the International Monitoring System (IMS), On-Site Inspections (OSI), and Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs). The CTBT prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, with provisions for redressing violations, ensuring compliance, and periodic review of its effectiveness.\nPresident John F. Kennedy's infamous fear in the 1960s, that 20 or perhaps 30 'Nuclear-Weapon States (NWSs)' would arise within a decade, did not come true. The number of nuclear powers or governments with active nuclear weapons programmes remains at ten even now. The NPT recognises five of them as lawful nuclear weapons possessors, which corresponds to the permanent five members of the 'UN Security Council (UNSC)'. Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are all said to have nuclear weapons or have demonstrated it through testing. Iran has long been accused of pursuing a zealous nuclear weapons development. In contrast, no less than 26 governments have renounced or been forced to abandon their pursuit of nuclear weapons, having completed feasibility studies, targeted weapon research or even development, or manufactured nuclear weapons (or inherited them following the collapse of the Soviet Union). Almost the whole phalanx of middle powers is made\n There are gaps in the current treaty framework. Firstly, there is the issue of countries like India, Pakistan, and Israel not joining the NPT. This leads to a significant amount of unsafeguarded nuclear activity. Another concern is that countries signatory may develop nuclear fuel cycle facilities and then subsequently opt-out of the Treaty as North Korea did. To avoid this, stronger and more regular inspection measures need to be enforced within the Treaty mechanism, with the aid of international bodies.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nup of these countries. When one considers that the CTBT names out 44 'nuclear capable' governments whose ratification is necessary before the treaty can be implemented, the miracle of non-proliferation becomes even greater. By comparing the 'before' and 'after,' we may obtain a sense of the consequences of international norms. The vast majority of 'nuclear aspirants' began their nuclear programmes before the NPT was signed. After the NPT was opened for signing, only Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, and (perhaps) Syria developed their programmes. Surprisingly, none of these nations were democracies at the time the pact was drafted. On the contrary, the vast majority of 'renouncers' halted their programmes during or after the discussions. As a result, for most of them, the NPT signified the line beyond which nuclear weapons ambitions lost their legitimacy.\nThe reliance of nuclear-armed governments, including the US, on computerized Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems underscores a critical vulnerability. These systems, integral to every aspect of nuclear force management, operate within cyberspace, making them susceptible to hacking and cyberattacks. NC3 systems encompass a network of communication and data-processing technologies linking weapons, radar systems, launch sites, and senior authorities responsible for nuclear decision-making. Despite extensive cybersecurity measures, the complexity and diversity of these systems render them inherently vulnerable, with numerous potential points of attack. Moreover, emerging technologies such as cyber capabilities, hypersonics, and encryption have the dual potential of exacerbating conflicts within the framework of the NPT while also offering avenues for achieving its objectives. While the NPT has been slow to address these evolving challenges, academia and non-governmental organizations have extensively studied their implications for nuclear issues. However, there remains a significant gap between civil society's engagement with emerging technologies and their integration into the NPT framework.[152]\nGiven its role as both a treaty and a forum, the NPT holds particular importance in addressing these challenges. States parties to the NPT have legal obligations regarding nuclear technology proliferation, making it essential\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nto consider the impact of emerging technologies on treaty compliance and verification. The NPT review process provides a unique opportunity for nuclear‐possessor and non‐possessor states to discuss and address a wide range of issues affecting nuclear order and treaty obligations. In light of these considerations, emerging technologies should be incorporated into all nuclear and non‐nuclear disarmament agreements, including the CTBT, the Conference on Disarmament (CD), and nuclear‐weapon‐free zones. However, the NPT, with its comprehensive legal framework and review mechanism, stands as a pivotal platform for addressing the challenges posed by emerging technologies to nuclear disarmament and non‐proliferation efforts.\nEdward Ifft highlights the CTBT innovative approach to addressing the challenge of unequal capacity among State parties to collect and evaluate data about compliance. The treaty establishes an IMS, comprising 337 globally distributed sites equipped with seismic, radionuclide, hydroacoustic, and infrared sensors. Ifft suggests that most States lack the resources to independently acquire and analyze this data. However, individual State parties can access professional technical analysis of IMS data and other relevant information free of charge from an international data center in Vienna. Drawing on the collaborative IMS model proposed by the CTBT, Ifft proposes the development of a Joint Attribution Mechanism (JAM) to assist nations with limited cyber forensic capabilities in collecting and analyzing data for attribution purposes. Such a mechanism could serve as a cost‐effective solution, encouraging nations to participate in a cyber treaty. Additionally, a JAM would enhance the credibility and legitimacy of the attribution process for nations with advanced cyber forensic capabilities. Ensuring reliable attribution is essential, but it is equally important to establish consistent consequences for cyber aggressors. This highlights the need for effective mechanisms to punish those responsible for cyberattacks consistently.\n## Conclusion\nThis article underscores the profound complexities and pressing challenges in the domain of cybersecurity, especially when viewed through the prism of international law. The pernicious implications of cyberattacks are ever more pertinent in an era increasingly dominated by digital data and connectivity. While the international community grapples with defining and responding to these cyber threats, our existing legal frameworks, rooted in conventional\nphysical paradigms, are inadequately equipped to address this novel form of virtual aggression.\nThe current structure of international law does not encapsulate an all-encompassing definition of cyberattacks, making it a precarious space in need of robust codification. The disruption wrought by cyberattacks on WTO agreements is even more deleterious, given the outdated security exceptions that remain unresponsive to risk-based cybersecurity measures. Moreover, the burgeoning surge in FDIs in digital assets, primarily intangible, exposes another lacuna in international law, conspicuously absent in contemporary investment treaties. These considerations underscore an imminent need to institute measures to mitigate the manifold issues arising from cyberattacks.\nPublic international law must evolve to address the specific nuances of cyberattacks and the consequent implications on State sovereignty, transborder crime, and national security. The ascendance of cyber aggression necessitates a re-examination of the fundamental tenets of international law, including the principles of Jus Ad Bellum and Jus In Bello, with a more nuanced lens. The complexities of attribution and the abstract nature of cyber warfare necessitate a shift in how we perceive sovereignty and territoriality in the digital age.\nIn the sphere of WTO law, the advent of cyber threats and the expansion of digital economies call for a revamp of trade rules and exceptions. It is crucial to establish a harmonized understanding of cybersecurity risks and potential countermeasures, with a balanced approach to cyber governance and free trade. Thus, a common vision is the need of the hour to work in collaboration internationally for ensuring cybersecurity and keeping cybercrimes at bay. The establishment of the Trade and Technology Council by the United States and the European Union represents a promising development in the quest for global consensus on trade and technology issues. This initiative holds the potential to facilitate increased collaboration and the harmonization of regulations across international borders.\nFinally, as cyberattacks increasingly target financial assets and systems, the role of investment law becomes paramount. The rise of data-driven businesses necessitates safeguarding digital assets and investments, requiring innovative legal mechanisms such as ‘digital-ready' BITs. Re-envisioning BITs to include digital assets, whilst establishing the scope of security provisions under the FET clause, can address potential investment claims from cyber risks. This would balance the need for a stable investment environment with the protection of digital assets, thereby fostering confidence amongst investors in the digital era.\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333",

There are several definitions produced by scholars, research organizations, and private enterprises. However, there is a need for a uniform/consensual legal definition to the term cyberattacks. Two definitions are frequently cited. The National Institute of Standards and Technology–Computer Security Resource Center: defines cyberattack as ‘[a]n attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information’. Secondly, the National Research Council’s Committee on Offensive Information Warfare defines cyber-attacks as ‘[e]fforts to alter, disrupt, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information or programs on them’.

The article adopts a multidisciplinary approach, integrating legal theory, international relations, and cyber law to analyze how digital security issues intersect with global economic transactions. Utilizing doctrinal legal analysis, the article delves into international treaties, case law, and policy documents, while a comparative method highlights variances and similarities across jurisdictions. The article identifies significant gaps in existing international legal frameworks that are ill-equipped to address the complexities and nuances of the digital age. It advocates for comprehensive legal reforms, encompassing cyber warfare, digital trade, and cross-border investments. The objective is to align international law with the digital era's realities, effectively balancing national security, economic growth, and individual rights in a globally interconnected environment. This article not only uncovers critical shortcomings in current legal structures but also proposes forward-looking legal strategies, essential for tackling emerging challenges at the cybersecurity, trade, and investment nexus. These strategies chart a course towards a more resilient and adaptive international legal system, equipped to address the multifaceted issues arising from the digital era's convergence.\nPublished with license by Koninklijke Brill BV | DOI:10.1163/22119000-12340327\n© XU QIAN, 2024 | ISSN: 1660-7112 (print) 2211-9000 (online)\nQIAN\n# Keywords\ncyberattack – cybersecurity – international investment law – international trade law\n# 1 Introduction\nToday's technology-driven world has fueled the growth of data-driven businesses that store necessarily sensitive and crucial information within certain digital information systems that become a part of a cyber environment. In its literal sense, cybersecurity can be termed as the practice of protecting or securing a network, server, or electronic device from any external intruders, targeted attackers, or malicious opportunists. 'Cybersecurity' refers to the protection from damage, unauthorized use, or exploitation of the information contained in electronic systems to maintain their integrity and confidentiality. In a nutshell, cybersecurity strives to protect sensitive information or the digital information system (that stores such sensitive information) against targeted security risks. This practice is crucial as it helps in preserving and maintaining the integrity or privacy of data.\nThe 'International Organization for Standardization (ISO)' and 'International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)', in ISO/ERC 27000 (Information\n O A Hathaway and others, 'The Law of Cyber-Attack' (2012) 100 (4) Cal L Rev 817.

An individual or a group can carry out such an act. Furthermore, an act of this magnitude could also be conducted by the State or an independent criminal. Cyberattacks can be analyzed through four primary criteria. Firstly, they possess the capacity to manipulate, destroy, or exfiltrate data, rendering them inherently disruptive and unpredictable. Their origin may be domestic or foreign, introducing complexities in attribution. Secondly, the nature of the perpetrator varies, ranging from individual criminals to organized groups or entities. Thirdly, the impact of cyberattacks is predominantly virtual, encompassing data loss or manipulation, which significantly diminishes the affected data’s commercial value. Moreover, attacks on critical infrastructure can precipitate severe disruptions to essential services. Lastly, the attribution of cyberattacks to state actors presents challenges, necessitating substantial evidence to establish\n IBM Services, ‘What is a Cyber-attack?’ (IBM, 11 November 2020) <www.ibm.com by-services=\"\" business-continuity=\"\" cyberattack#:~:text=\"The%20most%20well%2Dknown%20type,malware%20may%20not%20be%20immediate\" in-en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023. An attack is an ‘attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of anything that has value to the organization.’\n Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC), ‘Cyber Attack’ (National Institute of Standards and Technology, 27 February 2021) <https: cyscr.nist.gov=\"\" glossary=\"\" cyber_attack=\"\" term=\"\">. There are several definitions produced by scholars, research organizations, and private enterprises. However, there is a need for a uniform/consensual legal definition to the term cyberattacks. Two definitions are frequently cited. The National Institute of Standards and Technology–Computer Security Resource Center: defines cyberattack as ‘[a]n attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information’. Secondly, the National Research Council’s Committee on Offensive Information Warfare defines cyber-attacks as ‘[e]fforts to alter, disrupt, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information or programs on them’. See Matthew C Waxman, ‘Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)’ (2011) 36 Yale J Intl L 424.

In the same vein, it has warned by UK head of MI6 that China was exporting technology that allowed it to exert a ‘web of authoritarian control’ around the world. This may lead some countries to get caught in ‘data traps’ and digital currencies could be one such trap, see Roula Khalaf and Helen Warrell, ‘UK Spy Chief Raises Fears over China’s Digital Renminbi’ (Financial Times, 10 December 2021) <https: 128d7139-15d6-4f4d-a247-fc9228a53ebd=\"\" 128d7=\"\" content=\"\" www.ft.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:></www.ibm.com>\nQIAN\nculpability. For instance, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack attributed to the 'Guardians of Peace' raised suspicions of North Korean involvement, yet conclusive evidence remained elusive.\nThere is a major concern if these attacks can be attributed to a State;[7] such State attributable attacks would be considered, by virtue of 'Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter,' to be a volatile use of force.[8] The sovereignty of a State is transgressed when it falls prey to such attacks.[9] Attribution in cyberattacks poses significant challenges beyond simply identifying the responsible actor. Key issues include the lack of consensus on the required standards of proof, the debate over whether attributions should be made publicly or kept confidential, and the ambiguity surrounding the legal consequences of successful attribution. Additionally, while public attributions can serve purposes such as deterring future attacks and holding perpetrators accountable, they may also escalate tensions and risk revealing sensitive intelligence sources.[10] There might be a notable loss of information or reduction in its value which could pose significant threats to the economy and national security.[11] Due to their inherent characteristics, cyberattacks present a global challenge. Distinctively differing from conventional physical assaults, these cyber intrusions are swift, transcend borders, and exhibit no discernible pattern, rendering\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333</https:></www.iiss.org>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\ntheir prediction and management challenging. The United Nations General Assembly, in 2010, and the World Economic Forum, in 2019 have stressed the importance of cybersecurity by highlighting the global threat posed by cyberattacks. Consequently, there is burgeoning discourse surrounding the development of a cybersecurity treaty, paralleling established frameworks for managing other forms of strategic risk. However, crafting effective agreements necessitates a nuanced understanding of cyber incident typologies and their respective implications. Organizations such as the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) advocate for a comprehensive consideration of strategic risks inherent in cyber capabilities. Thus, addressing cyber threats mandates the formulation of holistic frameworks that reconcile national sovereignty, security imperatives, and international cooperation mandates.\nThis article draws upon theoretical foundations from international law, comparative law, and international relations to provide a thorough examination of the pressing issue of cyberattacks. Its conceptual framework illuminates the potential interpretation and development of international legal norms, compares distinct yet interconnected areas, and explores the broader geopolitical dimensions of this global challenge. By analyzing fundamental principles of international law – such as state sovereignty, the use of force, and state responsibility – within the context of cyber operations, the article raises critical questions about their applicability to emerging cyber realities. Furthermore, it employs comparative legal analysis to draw parallels between legal frameworks governing nuclear non-proliferation and potential cybersecurity frameworks, highlighting the importance of adapting existing legal mechanisms to address new challenges.

While clarity within general international law remains scarce, valuable insights can be gleaned from existing legal frameworks in international economic realms, such as international trade and investment law. The emergence of the cyber realm has introduced contemporary issues that challenge established norms and rules of international law, necessitating examination in terms of interpretation, application, and structure. Cyberattacks transcend mere technological phenomena, fundamentally reshaping traditional societal paradigms including concepts of capital[17] and warfare.[18] The article probes the adequacy of existing international legal and economic rules in defining cyberattacks and delineating breaches of established norms. It critically examines the efficacy of international law in regulating cyberattacks, recognizing the inherent complexities in defining and addressing such incidents. The article offers a nuanced definition of cyberattacks, recognizing their intricate nature that defies simple conceptualization. It contends that cyberattacks represent a modern manifestation of acts of war, a concept deeply rooted in international legal discourse spanning millennia. Exploring potential solutions, the article investigates the role of international economic law in mitigating cyber threats, particularly in safeguarding global data flows integral to contemporary globalization processes. Moreover, it delves into the potential applicability of investment treaties in regulating digital assets and scrutinizes existing parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation.[19] By examining how nuclear non-proliferation treaties serve as a precedent, the article explores the feasibility of developing a comprehensive set of international rules to govern cyberattacks, thereby addressing critical gaps in current regulatory frameworks.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nA cyberattack is any kind of malicious action aimed at obtaining unlawful access to information technology systems including the resources or valuable information of their users that they may encompass. Cyberattacks hit businesses every day, particularly targeting critical infrastructure, trade secrets, and intellectual property with commercial value, and other online information. Cyberattacks can peculiarly break into the defence systems which include defense capabilities and private military suppliers and can gravely threaten the security of the nation. Its effect on the economy cannot be ignored, especially in the case of the United States where approximately 90% of critical infrastructure is possessed by the private sector, and companies do not see any specific reason for investing in cybersecurity to secure public interest. By refusing to invest in cybersecurity, the private sector increases the exposure of the whole economy and society to cyber threats. The risk of cyberattacks that have the potential to cause large-scale shutdowns and huge amounts of other material harms are amplified by the digital transformation of the infrastructure of various sectors. Moreover, ‘information technology (IT)’, connected devices, cyber-physical systems, and industrial control systems are all potential\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\nattack vectors of critical infrastructure. The threat of cyber espionage is known and it may be centered on theft via access to cloud-based data platforms and malicious software. Finally, there exists a two-fold risk in the cyber-espionage area. First, any unauthorized person may access and steal sensitive personal information. Second, existing information may be altered to create a façade and disseminate fake news to the larger public. Furthermore, a major source of deceptive information and malicious publication could perhaps be, deep fake videos generated by ‘Artificial Intelligence (AI)’.\nIn the context of the growing importance of a data-driven economy for national economic progress, effective data governance emerges as a critical aspect of governance. Governments are increasingly prioritizing data governance and implementing measures to safeguard the digital economy against cyber threats. These measures include implementing export limitations and restricting foreign government access to national technology. One of the most significant and concerning cyberattacks targeted the US Government, its agencies, and numerous private companies – the ‘SolarWinds hack.’\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\n## 2.1 The Ambiguity of 'Cyberattack' within International Law\nDespite the pervasive phenomenon of cyberattacks in our increasingly interconnected contemporary society, where organisations are transitioning their operations and data storage to online platforms, international law remains ambivalent, lacking a precise and universally accepted legal definition for the term 'cyberattack'. This omission underscores a critical gap, especially as the digital realm continues to be a significant frontier for both commerce and potential conflict. The degree of digitization of economic activities is generally linked to the tendency of experiencing cyberattacks. A recent measure by the Indian government is the 'Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)' project. The process involves a biometric ID that assigns to each individual, a 12-digit number. It further requires, storing 10 fingerprints, iris scans and other necessary details such as names, addresses and date of birth to be recorded in the eGovernance cloud platform. Consequently, the practice involves an increased cybersecurity concern among the individuals, private organisations and the government agencies. In the absence of indigenous cybersecurity technology and patents in the nation, India's government has declared that it will be providing monetary incentives to Indian enterprises who acquire foreign firms with cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies. Perhaps worse, most of these threats have targeted small-scale industries that do not have the requisite means, instruments, or techniques to protect themselves and their business interests. Maintenance of cybersecurity is getting harder every year as cybercriminals continuously pose new threats, leverage new bugs, and carry out new sophisticated attacks; whilst regulatory institutions are still evolving and enhancing their standards.\n 'Scope of Russian Hacking Becomes Clear: Multiple U.S. Agencies Were Hit' (The New York Times, 14 December 2020), <https: 12=\"\" 14=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" rus=\"\" sia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Brett Van Niekerk, 'Suppression of Cyber-defences', IST-Africa Week Conference, Durban, 2016.

Projections by Cybersecurity Ventures suggest a dramatic rise in global cybercrime costs, with estimates indicating a potential annual total of USD 10.5 trillion by 2025, marking a considerable increase from USD 3 trillion in 2015. These figures underscore the immense economic impact of cybercrime, surpassing damages caused by natural disasters and even exceeding the collective value of significant illegal drug trades worldwide. Such crimes represent a substantial economic transfer globally, impeding innovation and investment. While no sector is immune to cyber threats, the financial services industry stands out as particularly vulnerable. The 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report highlights financial organizations as the most heavily targeted sector, followed by healthcare and public administration, respectively.\nThere has been no global consensus on the definition of cybersecurity. However, it has been defined by the International Telecommunication Union as 'a set of tools, policies, safeguards, and technologies that can protect the cyber environment and the assets of an organization or user.' Cybersecurity, therefore, seeks to protect and maintain the digital assets security of the organization or the user against the risks involved in the cyber environment. The approach offered by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) presents an intriguing perspective on cyberattacks. NIST's framework does not differentiate between state-sponsored actions and criminal activities, nor does it consider the distinct impact of cyber incidents on public versus private records, networks, and facilities. While prioritizing the integrity of information and information networks, NIST's framework fails to encompass broader societal goals such as national market growth, law enforcement access\n Steve Morgan, 'Cybercrime to Cost the World $10.5 Trillion Annually By 2025' (Cybercrime Magazine, 13 November 2020) <https: cybersecurityventures.com=\"\" hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Brian Cashell and others, 'The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attack' (United States Congressional Research Service, 1 April 2004) <https: ras.org=\"\" rl32331.pdf=\"\" sgp=\"\" crs=\"\" misc=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Kenning Arlitsch and Adam Edelman, 'Staying Safe: Cyber Security for People and Organizations' (2014) 54 J Libr Admin 46.\n '2020 Data Breach Investigation Report' (Verizon, 2020) <https: 2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf=\"\" enterprise.verizon.com=\"\" resources=\"\" reports=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023; the Public Administration sector manages with the administration of local, state and federal government.\n International Telecommunication Union, 'Overview of Cybersecurity: Recommendation ITU-T X.1205' (ITU-T, 4 August 2008) <https: rec=\"\" t-rec-x.1205-200804-i=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nAn alternative legal definition proposed by the United States National Research Council defines cyberattacks as purposeful actions aimed at altering, disrupting, deceiving, degrading, or destroying computer systems, networks, or the information and programs within them.43 While this definition offers rationality, it also highlights ambiguity, particularly in differentiating between basic cybercrimes and cyberattacks. This lack of clarity may lead to inconsistencies within the legal framework, hindering effective coordination among agencies.\n## 2.2 International Responses and Legal Implications\nThe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has introduced the Cyber Norms Index to monitor and compare significant achievements in negotiating and establishing norms for governmental actions in cyberspace. This index aids policymakers and observers in analyzing proposals for cyber norms, tracking their development, and assessing their uniform adoption by members of the global community. Users can utilize the index to examine multilateral outcomes and compare information using various groups or keywords. Additionally, there has been a widespread call for norms aimed at immunizing and stabilizing cyberspace.44 CSO Online45 has curated a list of\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</http:>\nQIAN\nnotable 21st-century security breaches, employing simple metrics such as the number of affected consumers and distinguishing between breaches resulting from malicious intent and those caused by accidental exposure. One notable breach involved theft of encrypted consumer payment information from Adobe's systems, affecting approximately 3 million customers, with login data manipulation for an unspecified number of users. More recently, Canva, an Australian web design app, experienced a significant breach compromising sensitive information of over 100 million consumers. Another prominent breach occurred in 2016 when Yahoo reported what is described as the largest privacy breach in history, compromising sensitive data of nearly five million users, including unauthorized access to full names, email addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers.\nBoth the private sector and governmental agencies are susceptible to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by various incidents. In February 2020, the US Department of Justice apprehended two Chinese citizens for allegedly laundering bitcoin on behalf of North Korean attackers. Similarly, the Mexican\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nAmong the most recent and significant cyberattacks is the SolarWinds breach. SolarWinds, a prominent US information technology company, fell victim to a cyberattack that went undetected for months,55 affecting its customers. US authorities suspect Russian hackers to be behind the attack, which targeted not the federal government or a private organization's network directly, but a third-party technology provider. This tactic, known as a 'Supply Chain' attack, exploited vulnerabilities in SolarWinds' Orion IT management tools, compromising high-ranking departments of the US government, including the Department of Homeland Security and Treasury, as well as private enterprises like FireEye.\n## 2.3 Cyber-Attacks on the Upswing: Risk for Worsening\nHacking groups and state-sponsored organizations have discovered that cyber-attacks are an effective weapon for balancing the playing field with rivals. The convergence of an attacker threat is highly risky and an expensive danger of insider manipulation or theft of intellectual property has generated a precarious environment in the private sector.56 While employee incompetence and human errors contribute to organizational vulnerabilities, recent years have witnessed a notable surge in attacks by malicious actors with access to sensitive business information. The global cybersecurity landscape is fraught with concerns regarding the likelihood of financial losses, misappropriation of classified data, and disruptions to critical infrastructure. The escalating scale and complexity of cyberattacks have not only heightened the risk of being caught off guard but have also increased the costs associated with preventing and recovering from such incidents.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.reuters.com>\nQIAN\nDespite media attention being drawn to high-profile cyberattacks targeting large corporations like Target, Netflix, and financial institutions such as JP Morgan, it is small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that remain the most vulnerable.[57] Industry analysts estimate that up to  $60\\%$  of SMEs may face collapse within six months due to cyberattacks, ranging from phishing scams to ransomware assaults.[58]\nChina's initiative to develop digital infrastructure, known as the 'Digital Silk Road,' alongside its traditional infrastructure projects, aims to enhance international connectivity in terms of communication and data flow.[59] This digital complement to the land-based 'Silk Road Economic Belt' and the 'Twenty-First Century Maritime Silk Road' seeks to bolster capacity for the exchange of goods.[60]\nIn light of these developments, states reliant on global interactions must prioritize the development of credible policies on cross-border data flow. As nations seek to thrive in the post-COVID-19 era and compete in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, facilitating cross-border data flow is imperative. Several governments have already issued warnings about the potential for large-scale cyber assaults, exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to lure individuals and companies into divulging personal and financial data.\n# 3 Paradigm Shift in Public International Law: Cyberattack as an Act of War\nThe world is rapidly transitioning towards intensive digitalization, a trend that has been ongoing for years but has recently accelerated unexpectedly.[61] The\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nDefining a cyberattack poses challenges, but it is widely accepted that such attacks aim to undermine or disrupt the function of a computer network.

Cyberattacks can have severe ramifications beyond the virtual realm, prompting states to focus on securing critical infrastructure and bolstering cybersecurity measures. Unlike traditional forms of warfare, cyberattacks occur in the digital domain but can have equally devastating consequences in the physical world.

Historically, such acts encompassed a wide range of actions, including unfriendly economic or commercial measures and actions that insulted a nation's pride. However, rapid technological advancements have challenged this traditional concept, rendering established legal categories inadequate to regulate contemporary activities.\nIn the context of cyberspace, clarifying the concept of *casus belli* serves to provide a clear standard against which states can assess their behavior and that of others when initiating or responding to cyberattacks. Traditional theories of *casus belli*, often emphasizing the violent and aggressive nature of armed operations, may not directly apply to cyberattacks due to their non-physical nature. Nevertheless, cyberattacks can be viewed as potential triggers for war if they cause substantial physical damage to the target's computer systems. While a destructive attack on computer systems by a nation-state may not necessarily constitute a *casus belli*, a significant strike solely targeting computer systems could potentially justify a defensive military response.\nClassifying cyber assaults, such as computer intrusions or communication disruptions, presents significant challenges. For instance, while both data breaches and attacks on air traffic control systems are invasive, the latter could result in greater damage and loss of life, potentially constituting an 'armed attack' rather than mere data theft. Additionally, attacks causing significant harm, regardless of the level of intrusion, may qualify as 'armed attacks.' Large-scale cyberattacks have the potential to incapacitate an opponent's ability to wage war effectively, surpassing the impact of traditional kinetic attacks. Such attacks can disrupt vital functions such as leadership, communication,\n Hannah Herbst, 'Cyber Attacks &amp; Modern Warfare' (*Denver J Intl L Pol*, 8 April 2020) <http: djilp.org=\"\" cyber-attacks-modern-warfare=\"\"></http:> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Colonel Charles J Dunlap, Jr, 'International Law and Terrorism' <http: dunlapterrorism.pdf=\"\" people.duke.edu=\"\" ~pfeaver=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Lawrence T Greenberg and others, *Information Warfare and International Law* (DOD Command Command and Control Research Program 1998).\n Charles C Poché, 'This Means War!

Consequently, cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure should be regarded as legitimate grounds for declaring a casus belli.\n## 3.2 Conceptualizing Cyber-Operation as Use of force\nThe United Nations (UN) Charter, a foundational document governing the use of force (*Jus Ad Bellum*), outlines in Article 2(4) that Member States must refrain from threatening or using force to undermine the territorial sovereignty or political independence of another state, unless justified by self-defense or authorized by the UN Security Council. Determining whether a cyberattack violates this prohibition requires an understanding of how ‘force’ is interpreted in international law and whether cyberattacks meet the criteria set out by these standards.\nA narrow interpretation of ‘force’ is recommended, aligning with the objectives outlined in the UN Charter’s preamble to maintain international peace and security and prevent war. However, the Charter does not exhaustively address all aspects of force regulation, and further guidance is sought from customary international law, as noted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Offensive cyber capabilities, such as implanting harmful code into computer networks, share similarities with traditional military actions, economic coercion, and subversion. The effects of cyberattacks can range from temporary disruptions, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, to severe physical damage and loss of life, such as disrupting emergency networks for first responders.\nCategorizing all cyberattacks as a ‘use of force’ under Article 2(4) would require an exceptionally broad interpretation. The Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare suggests that cyberattacks with tangible consequences in the physical\n UN Charter Art 2, para 4.\n Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ (2012) 30 Berkeley J Intl L 525.

The Tallinn Manual outlines criteria including severity, spontaneity, directness, intrusiveness, quantification, and presumptive legitimacy to evaluate cyberattack consequences against those of conventional attacks. If a cyberattack exhibits sufficient resemblance to these criteria, broadening the prohibition on force is warranted. Despite the United States' emphasis on consequences over methodology, modern society's heavy reliance on computer systems raises concerns about incapacitating physical infrastructure without tangible destruction.\nThe SolarWinds incident underscores the importance of characterizing cyberattacks as casus belli. SolarWinds, a company serving a vast clientele including major US government agencies, fell victim to cyber-attacks that compromised the integrity of their data. While some argue these attacks do not meet the casus belli threshold and constitute espionage, distinguishing between cyber-attacks and espionage remains challenging. Responses to cyber espionage must be strategized akin to other cyberattacks, especially in cases like supply chain attacks, where damage control may overshadow the actors' intent. While cyber espionage typically does not warrant casus belli, it may do so if aimed at undermining a state's political and social institutions. The intertwining of espionage and operational access in incidents like SolarWinds raises concerns about latent vulnerabilities and potential future attacks of unprecedented magnitude.

In the context of cyberattacks, ensuring proportionality requires a nuanced understanding of technical intricacies. For example, a cyber response coded into software demands extensive knowledge of potential targets, often obtained through conventional cyber exploitation methods.94 The Office of the Attorney General of California defined cyber exploitation as 'the non-consensual distribution or publication of intimate photos or videos\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nonline'.95 Cyber exploitation hurts the privacy of an individual and public safety by publishing photos or videos without appropriate consent.\nHence, for the fulfilment of the principle of necessity, it is essential that all the other remedies that do not involve such a use of force have been proven futile or have been exhausted, without success.96 According to the authors of The Tallinn Manual, the availability, or lack thereof, of accessible options that do not rise to the level of use of force is the key to doing a 'necessity analysis' in the cyber realm.97 If a State's military computer networks are breached as a result of a cyber-attack, it may take some time for the State to retaliate using cyber or kinetic means.98 When there is no other feasible choice and the assault is real and imminent, the victim state may invoke self-defense to justify reasonable, necessary, and proportional safeguards to maintain its security.99\n## 4 Global Data Flow and the Transformation of International Trade: Issues and Challenges for Trade Law\nThe growing digital trade landscape has heightened concerns regarding cybersecurity within the international rules-based trading system. Prior to the establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, bilateral trade was seen as beneficial for increasing demand for local products and improving living standards.100 However, the implementation of GATT and subsequent efforts to regulate and harmonize international trade introduced complexities, particularly regarding the interpretation of terms like non-state actors, terrorism, the environment, and cybersecurity measures at the domestic and international levels.101 During Ministerial Conference 11 in 2017, 71 World Trade Organization (WTO) members, both developed and developing, issued a Joint Statement on Electronic Commerce, expressing their commitment to exploring future negotiations on the trade-related aspects of electronic commerce. Currently, negotiations involve 90 WTO members, with The Gambia\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\nbeing the latest addition. An updated negotiation text from November 2023, under Section C, addresses cybersecurity. It emphasizes the evolving nature of cyber threats and outlines measures for member states to enhance cybersecurity capabilities. These measures include building the capabilities of national entities responsible for cybersecurity incident response, collaborating to identify and mitigate malicious intrusions or dissemination of malicious code affecting electronic networks, addressing cybercrime, and sharing information for awareness and best practices.\n## 4.1 Legal Pitfalls in the Context of Digital Trade\nIn the sphere of international trade, cybersecurity measures are employed to address illegal data breaches by non-state actors that affect legitimate trading activities among WTO Member States. However, the cybersecurity countermeasures are often justified by the States based upon the general and security exceptions under the GATT and ‘General Agreement on Trade in Services Agreement (GATS)’. With the advent of the WTO Panel decision in Russia-Traffic in Transit, it is now well established that recourse to exceptions under the WTO is justiciable and not entirely self-judging.\nBuilding on this, the concept of ‘national security unilateralism,’ as delineated by Chaisse and Georgopoulos, reflects an emerging trend where states increasingly prioritize their national security interests, sometimes contravening established international economic norms. A prominent example of this trend is the trade policies of the United States under the Trump administration, marked by unilateral tariff impositions that circumvent standard global trade procedures. This paradigm shift, moving away from a cooperative, rules-based approach in international economic relations to a more insular,\n WTO Electronic Commerce Negotiations Updated Consolidated Negotiating Text – November 2023 <https: img=\"\" pdf=\"\" wto_ji=\"\">\n Panel Report, Russia – Traffic in Transit, WT/DS512/R, adopted April 2019; Dylan Geraets, ‘WTO Issues Ruling in Russia – Traffic in Transit: Measures Justified on National Security Grounds Are Justiciable’ (Mayer Brown, 8 April 2019) <https: 04=\"\" 2019=\"\" en=\"\" en=\"\" publications=\"\" wto-issues-ruling-in-russia-traffic-in-transit-measures-justified-on-national-security-grounds-are-justiciable#_edn2=\"\" www.mayerbrown.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023. A provision is self-judging when the members can decide whether and how this exception can be applied to the measure.

On the other hand, the provision is justiciable if the phrases ‘it considers’ and ‘necessary’ are not read together.\n Julien Chaisse and Georgios Dimitropoulos, ‘Special Economic Zones in International Economic Law: Towards Unilateral Economic Law’ (2021) 24(2) JIEL 229–57.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:>\nQIAN\nsecurity-centric model, presents significant challenges to the traditional frameworks of international trade law.\nThe proliferation of digital trade raises concerns$^{105}$ pertaining to cross-border data flow, critical infrastructure of the trading countries, and vulnerability to cyberattacks, which can potentially lead to violation of trade obligations as envisaged under the GATT, GATS, and TBT Agreements. While the foundation of the GATT is based upon non-discrimination between domestic and foreign goods, an effective domestic policy to counter cyberattacks can result in restricting the access of certain suspicious manufacturers of goods to further participate in the supply chain.$^{106}$ The States have sought to justify these inherent trade-distorting measures based upon the general exception, under the GATT.\nSimilarly, in the context of the TBT Agreement, the Appellate Body in $EC - Asbestos$ held that where the risk associated with cross-border trade increases, the discretion of the Member States also increases in parallel.$^{107}$ Even under the GATS, Member States can take recourse to justify cybersecurity measures based upon the general and security exceptions although the scope of application of trade-restrictive measures is relatively less broad as compared to GATT. The regional free trade agreements have gone one step further by allowing commitments from reciprocating nations to allow the cross-border transfer of personal information and the restricted prohibition on the measures of data localization.\nWhile the security exceptions under the GATT and GATS are self-judging in nature, they are however not immune from panel review as highlighted in Russia – Traffic in Transit.$^{108}$ The general exceptions under the GATT and GATS are resorted to justify measures necessary to protect public morals or secure compliance with laws and regulations. Based upon these, the member nation must evidence whether the cybersecurity measure is ‘necessary’ in light of balancing the factors and whether less trade restricting alternatives are available.$^{109}$ It is, however, agreed to some extent that these\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</www.globaltradealert.org>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\ndomestic cybersecurity measures outweigh the costs associated with them leading to better information symmetry, regulatory oversight, and reducing business malpractices.\n## 4.2 Strengthening International Trade Law in the Digital Era\nThe sole reliance upon the general and security exceptions under the WTO covered agreements results in drastic trade distortion effects which can lead to justification for most, if not all, cybersecurity measures. Consequently, cooperation amongst Member States must be achieved to establish suitable standards such that the measures result in minimum trade distortion. On a preliminary level, it is essential that world governments agree upon a uniform understanding of the nature and scope of cybersecurity measures and the risks posed by them towards international trade. The domestic and international standard-setting organizations can prescribe certain standards for usage and regulation of cybersecurity measures in line with the ISO and IEC standards on cybersecurity.[110]\nThe WTO has made efforts to regulate cybercrime through initiatives such as the Consolidated E-Commerce Negotiating Text circulated in December 2020.[111] The most controversial clause in the document is a broad exception that has been proposed to be incorporated into the negotiated text.[112] This exception allows Member States to freely adopt measures, notwithstanding the obligations under the agreement, to guarantee cybersecurity, safeguard cyberspace sovereignty safeguard the lawful rights and interests of the citizens, juridical persons, and other organizations, and achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives.\"[113] The only limitation to this broad power is that the measures taken must not be arbitrary or discriminatory; they must\nRequirement case significantly clarifies the application of the national security exception in WTO law, particularly by establishing that such exceptions are not entirely self-judging and subject to review (United States – Origin Marking Requirement, WT/DS597/10, Panel report under appeal on 26 January 2023). It underscores the necessity for concrete evidence to justify invoking national security, thereby narrowing the scope for its arbitrary use in trade disputes. For a commentary, see J Chaisse and K Olaoye, 'United States – Origin Marking Requirement, WT/DS597/R' (2023) 117(3) AJIL 488–493.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></http:>\nQIAN\nbe applied in an equal manner to all nations without any discrimination. Further, these measures must not be 'a disguised restriction on trade' and should not be 'more than necessary' to attain the objective. While the official text of this clause remains unavailable, leaked information provides insights into its content. Despite references to the negotiating text on the WTO's official website, it remains inaccessible to the public. Nevertheless, preliminary observations can be made based on the leaked information.\nWhile the exception provides visibility to cybersecurity issues and nation-states with the autonomy to design rigorous cybersecurity mechanisms, the exception is not a comprehensive regulation of cybersecurity and is only an enabling provision. Cyber-security measures remain the prerogative of Member States to keep in place. As a result, there remains a lack of comprehensive regulation of cyber-related issues in international trade. This status quo is especially concerning in a vital and ever-growing area like e-commerce. How this exception will be invoked by Member States remains to be seen but backlash based on information freedom concerns can certainly be anticipated. Further, the exception could also prove to be overbroad. The exception, apart from empowering Member States to take cybersecurity-related measures, allows any measures taken to achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives'. Such a vague enabling provision could lead to disastrous consequences, which could undermine the foundations of international trade. The term 'public policy', typically used in relation to international commercial arbitration, has been held by numerous judgments to be an 'unruly horse'. Due to the inherent lack of a precise definition, arbitration scholars have found the concept to be excessively malleable, shaped by the subjective values and principles in each nation. Adding to the existing uncertainty around cyber-attacks and cyber-security, the insertion of an unruly horse that is 'public policy', would certainly be undesirable. The text must be revised to include a definition of public policy, or at the least illustrations of the term.\nMoreover, the establishment of standards alone is insufficient; robust compliance and enforcement mechanisms are necessary at the national level.

However, infrastructure encompasses not only physical structures but also digital infrastructure, which plays a crucial role in attracting foreign direct investments (FDI). The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of workplaces, leading to increased reliance on digital assets such as fiber networks and broadband connectivity. Consequently, enhancing a nation's digital infrastructure can attract more FDI, particularly from e-commerce and technology companies.\nNumerous prominent companies globally possess trade secrets and intellectual property rights crucial for their commercial viability. Cyber hackers pose a significant threat by potentially dismantling these assets within a short span, thereby jeopardizing not only the company's survival but also the broader economy. Emphasizing a robust cybersecurity framework becomes imperative as a prerequisite for engaging in any business endeavor. States\n Shin-yi Peng, “Private” Cybersecurity Standards?

Given the substantial contribution of digital trade to global GDP and its benefits to nations worldwide, addressing threats to the digital trade system becomes paramount. These considerations are of profound significance, particularly as e-commerce trade not only fosters corporate growth and profitability but also facilitates employment generation and mitigates socioeconomic inequalities. According to the UNCTAD report, e-commerce transactions amounted to over USD 29 trillion by 2017, constituting approximately 36% of global GDP. As the world increasingly embraces data-driven technology, the centrality of effective data governance becomes ever more apparent.\nThe evolution of international trade towards digital platforms has exposed nation-states to new challenges, particularly cyberattacks, which pose threats to data integrity. One key question is whether cyberattacks should be considered acts of war. Given that virtually all industries are potential targets for cyber hackers, a unified and international solution is necessary to address this problem. Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) could serve as a means to tackle this emerging issue. BITs provide fundamental protections to foreign investments and offer various dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration. Integrating substantive protection against cybercrimes into BITs would enhance the accountability of states and incentivize them to adopt robust data protection laws. This approach could contribute to mitigating the risks posed by cyberattacks in the context of international investment.\n## 5.1 Digital Assets as Emerging Investments\nThe initial task for investors is to ascertain whether digital assets meet the criteria to qualify as 'covered investments' under BITs. As investment tribunals grapple with claims related to cybercrime, they will face the challenge of addressing investment law policy arguments. Extending BIT provisions to encompass such crimes will inevitably entail implications for both investors\n ‘A Roadmap for Cross Border Data Flows: Future-Proofing Readiness and Cooperation in the New Data Economy: White Paper’ (World Economic Forum, 9 June 2020) <www3.we forum.org 2020.pdf=\"\" docs=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_Cross_Border_Data_Flows_2020.=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_cross_border_data_flows_2020.pdf=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Marina Dane, ‘Digitalisation, Trade, and Geopolitics in Asia’ (2020) <www.kas.de 2020=\"\" 8314289=\"\" documents=\"\" digitalisation%2c+trade%2c+and+geopolitics+in+asia.pdf=\"\" www.kas.de=\"\">/3bf29911-2dcb-6e72-d4aa-936f9b5082d0?version=1.0&amp;t=1608181259722&gt; accessed 19 October 2021.\n Aaronson and Struett (n 66); ‘Global e-Commerce Sales Surged to $29 Trillion’ (UNCTAD Press Release, 29 March 2019) <https: global-e-commerce-sales-surged-29-trillion=\"\" press-material=\"\" unctad.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.kas.de></www3.we>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nTribunals have typically referenced the definition provided in BITs and objective economic criteria to ascertain whether an investment has been established, contrasting it with a mere commercial transaction. In interpreting BIT provisions, tribunals often turn to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, which outlines the general rule for interpreting treaty provisions, taking into consideration the purpose of the BIT and its other provisions. Certain BITs, such as the German Model BIT, employ a broad asset-based definition of investment, encompassing phrases like ‘every kind of asset’, thereby potentially encompassing digital assets as well.\nWhen considering the inclusion of digital assets within the definition of an asset, it is crucial to carefully delineate the concept of digital assets itself. The primary concern regarding digital assets pertains to the data they encapsulate, which holds both intrinsic and extrinsic value. The economic worth of digital assets is intricately linked to their data content, with the value of a digital asset being inherently tied to the data it contains. Intrinsic value pertains to the core data itself, while extrinsic value encompasses additional elements such as customer metadata, which companies often monetize significantly. Furthermore, there exists a symbiotic relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic value, akin to the seeds and flesh of a fruit, respectively. While not all BITs offer a broad definition of investment, it is advisable to establish a clear understanding of digital assets within the context of investment arbitration to mitigate the risk of numerous arbitration claims stemming from uncertainties in this regard.\nApart from the definition of an investment, there are other factors that can affect the inclusion of digital assets under the definition of covered investments, such as economic factors. If the definition of investment\n Enikő Horváth and Severin Klinkmüller, ‘The Concept of “Investment” in the Digital Economy: The Case of Social Media Companies’ (2019) 20 JWIT 577, 593.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nprovided under Article 25 (1) ICSID is relied on, digital assets might very well be excluded as a covered investment. Therefore, a broad definition in the BIT would be ideal to bring digital assets within the investment arbitration regime. There are various definitions of investment in BITs which particularly limit the definition of investment by making it mandatory for investments to have some connection with economic factors such as expectations of profits or assumption of risk. For instance, in the case of Romak SA v Uzbekistan, the Tribunal adopted a restrictive approach in interpreting the definition of an investment.[126] It's essential for investment tribunals to recognize that digital companies often operate under long-term business models, where the initial investment is directed towards research and development.[127] These companies may take a considerable period to generate revenue, distinguishing them from single commercial transactions.[128]\nAnother pertinent issue relates to the requirement of a territorial link in various BITs, stipulating that investments must be made within the territory of the host State. Establishing the territorial presence of digital assets poses inherent challenges.[129] Jonathan Bick's categorization of digital assets into possession, location, and control underscores the importance of these factors in establishing a territorial link between the State and the investment. In Abaclat v Argentina,[130] the Tribunal emphasized that the nature of the investment is crucial in determining its location, focusing on how the funds were ultimately utilized rather than where they were initially disbursed. This interpretation helps alleviate some of the challenges in proving digital assets as covered investments. In Wena Hotel v Egypt, the Tribunal affirmed that expropriation encompasses both tangible and intangible assets, including digital\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333</www.businessinsider.in></www.bcg.com>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\nassets, under international law. In SPP v Egypt, the tribunal clarified that it is an accepted proposition that the protection of international law extends to contract rights and therefore compensation should be made for taking away these rights. Moreover, in Tippetts v Tams-Affa, Tribunal stated that under international law, even if the title in the property is not affected, its deprivation may occur by the interference of a State in the use or enjoyments of benefits attached to the property. Since the assumption of control does not imply that the property has been acquired by the government, compensation should be paid under international law, indicating that the owner was deprived of their fundamental right of ownership of the property.\n## 5.2 Investment Claims in the Age of Cybersecurity\nThe central concern in this context revolves around whether investors can pursue claims against states for cybercrimes. Studies from 2017 indicate that a single data breach can cost a company up to USD 3.62 million on average. The severity of costs varies depending on factors like the type and volume of data stolen; for instance, the leakage of trade secrets could pose an existential threat to a company. The principle of ‘Fair and Equitable Treatment’ (FET) is pivotal in this regard, as it obliges states to provide investors with essential conditions, potentially enabling investors to lodge claims for cybercrimes.\nTribunals typically assess whether state actions are arbitrary under FET provisions by referencing core principles. Regarding digital assets, FET claims may challenge alterations in measures related to national cybersecurity. ‘Transparency’ plays a crucial role for investors conducting business in a host state, and states are obligated to maintain transparency. While states have\n Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000) para 98.\n Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/84/3, Award (1992) para 164.\n Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v TAMS-AFFA Consulting, 225 6 IRAN-US CTR 219.\n Julien Chaisse and Cristen Bauer, ‘Cybersecurity and the Protection of Digital Assets: Assessing the Role of International Investment Law and Arbitration’ (2019) 21 Vand J Ent &amp; Tech L 549, 568.\n In Glamis Gold Ltd v United States, Award, IIC 380 (2009), it is mentioned that ‘fair and equitable treatment encompasses a universe of “fundamental” principles common throughout the world that include “the duty to act in good faith, due process, transparency and candor, and fairness and protection from arbitrariness’. In MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004), the Tribunal agreed with a legal opinion by Judge Schwebel that fair and equitable treatment encompassed such fundamental standards as good faith, due process, non-discrimination and proportionality.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nthe right to amend laws concerning national cybersecurity to achieve public policy objectives, such changes must not be inconsistent, as demonstrated in the case of PSEG Global v Republic of Turkey. In this case, Turkey's frequent changes to the law were deemed to create uncertainty for investors, violating FET provisions.\nAnother relevant case involving the implementation of inconsistent policies by a state is MTD Equity v Republic of Chile. The tribunal ruled that Chile violated FET provisions by adopting contradictory positions with the investor regarding data localization policies. Chile's support for these policies on national security grounds increased costs for foreign investors. Similarly, data localization policies initiated by the Vietnamese government have been challenged by tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Google on economic and human rights grounds. Regarding claims related to Denial of Justice, these typically entail the right to be heard. Such a right is infringed when the cyber legislation of the host state fails to provide effective opportunities for all parties to present their case.\nIn addition to the aforementioned considerations, claims may also arise based on the Full Protection and Security standard (FPS). These claims encompass not only threats from armed rebels but also modern dangers posed by cybercriminals. Cyberattacks can compromise the three primary pillars of security: confidentiality, availability, and integrity. A claim under FPS due to a cyberattack can be sustained if it can be demonstrated that the security assured by the host State extends beyond physical protection. Factors such as the standard liability of the host State and the potential overlap between FPS and FET provisions are also pivotal in determining whether the investment was deprived of legal protection.\nThe definition of investment has evolved over time, and similarly, the application of FPS has expanded. An investor can succeed in their claim even in the absence of a physical attack, as exemplified in the case of Azurix v Argentina, where the host State was deemed responsible for providing an overall safe environment to investors. Given that digital assets predominantly fall under the category of intangible assets, they can be interpreted to meet the criteria of covered investments, thus availing the protection of FPS provisions in BITs.\n PSEG Global Inc v Republic of Turkey, ICSID Case No ARB/02/5, Award (2007) paras 248–256.\n MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Republic of Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004) para 189.\n Azurix Corp v Argentina, ICSID Case No ARB/01/12, Award (2004) para 408.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nIn instances where host States lack cyber laws, courts have applied analogical reasoning, drawing from laws related to privacy and theft. However, if domestic courts fail to apply such principles and a void in cybersecurity laws persists, this absence could be deemed a violation of the FPS standard. The FPS standard underscores the State's duty to furnish investors with an adequate legal framework for protection. Intangible assets, if deemed investments under the relevant BIT, can be subject to expropriation, including indirect expropriation resulting in asset depreciation. Addressing these issues requires enhancing the contents of BITs by expanding the definition of investment to encompass digital assets. States must recognize that safeguarding investors from cybercrime not only benefits investors but also preserves the economy and the privacy of citizens, serving the public interest of the host State. Incorporating cyberattacks under the FPS provision in BITs can compel host States to fulfill their obligation and shield investors from cyber threats, which have the potential to devastate companies in an instant. Therefore, it is imperative to prohibit these detrimental criminal actions.\n## 5.3 National Security Exceptions in Investment Law\nVarious international investment agreements incorporate exceptions, including those related to national security. This exception grants host States the authority to implement precautionary measures. However, there is considerable debate within the Investor ISDS regime regarding the basis for invoking this national security exception. Some argue that it is a self-judging provision prone to arbitrary use by States, while others contend that it is based on necessity. From the perspective of host countries, national security interests are\n Wena Hotels LTD v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000).\n Occidental Exploration and Production Company v The Republic of Ecuador, LCIA Case No UN3467 (1976).\n Katia Yannaca-Small, 'Essential Security Interests under International Investment Law', in OECD (ed.), International Investment Perspectives: Freedom of Investment in a Changing World (2007).\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\ndeemed significant, both for developed and developing nations. Developed countries often invoke national security interests in response to attempted takeovers of industries, whereas developing countries may do so during economic crises.^[142]^\nHowever, prior to invoking this exception, States should adhere to the requirement of explicit good faith. Regular reviews should be conducted to assess the ongoing necessity of upholding security-related investment restrictions. In the author's view, all these remedies prevent this exception of national security from becoming a mere 'black and white' matter and a different solution should be adopted which can balance the rights of the contracting parties and foreign investors. Hence, the threat to cybersecurity such as cyber-attacks should be covered under the umbrella of national security. By invoking these exceptions, the States are likely to take certain measures to prevent these crimes that would violate the international investment agreements and would be able to justify such measures under existing exceptions.\n## 6 Making the Linkages: Nuclear Proliferation and Cyberattacks\nIn contemporary times, parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation are frequently drawn, owing to the escalating threat that cyberattacks pose to global security and diplomacy.^[143]^ Cybersecurity has transcended local boundaries to become a matter of international concern, impacting peace and security on a global scale. However, existing international law inadequately addresses these cybersecurity threats, necessitating the establishment of more robust and effective regulations. A recent report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) highlighted the strategic risks posed by cyberattacks, underscoring the urgent need for the introduction of a cybersecurity treaty. The international community must recognize and address the risks posed by cybersecurity, analogous to the approach taken with non-proliferation agreements.\nNuclear non-proliferation aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and associated delivery systems, with the overarching goal of averting nuclear conflict or catastrophe in the future. Conversely, cyberattacks encompass malicious attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or valuable data. The proliferation of cyberattacks has raised concerns among financial institutions, corporations, and governments regarding their potential\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nAs technology becomes increasingly integral to government, institutional, and personal operations, parallels between nuclear and cyber threats become apparent. For instance, the NC3 systems of nuclear-armed governments heavily rely on digital processors and computers, rendering them vulnerable to hacking and cyberattacks. Moreover, the nuclear force infrastructure encompasses weapons, launch sites, and command authorities interconnected through communication and data processing technologies, facilitating cyber vulnerabilities. Despite the reluctance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to address the convergence of nuclear and cyber threats, scholars and non-governmental experts have extensively documented their interactions. Without stronger protections against cyberattacks and illegal hacking, the realm of nuclear weapons and security remains susceptible to exploitation.\n## 6.1 Comparative Analysis of Legal Frameworks\nEfforts in nuclear non-proliferation have spanned approximately fifty years, originating in the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. The earliest initiatives began within the UN, with Article 11(1) of the UN Charter emphasizing the preservation of international peace and security. A significant development during this period was the conclusion of the Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) in 1963, although some countries abstained from signing due to perceived weaknesses in its provisions, notably the absence of international control mechanisms or spot inspections.\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis highlighted the need for a comprehensive framework to address nuclear proliferation. Consequently, the NPT was signed in 1968 by 62 countries, including nuclear weapon states like the US. Notably, China and France refrained from signing initially. The NPT came\n Stéphane Lhuissier and Fabien Tripier, *A Measure of the Evolution of Cyber Risk* (17 December 2021) <https: blog-entry=\"\" blocnotesdeleco.banque-france.fr=\"\" measure-evolution-cyber-risk=\"\" en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n Then, in 1946, the Atomic Energy Commission was set up to recommend measures for controlling atomic energy. In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was created with the goal of promoting and overseeing to promote and oversee the peaceful use of nuclear technology.\n The PTBT can be viewed as the first global and formal attempt towards non-proliferation. At first, the Treaty was only ratified by the USSR, the US, and the UK.\n For instance, China conducted Project 596 in 1964, which was its first atom bomb test. Due to its relatively small audience, and the fact that even its signatories continued to defy it, the PTBT was largely a failure.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\ninto force in 1970, categorizing countries into nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states, with the former defined as those that conducted nuclear tests before January 1967. Subsequent developments included the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, such as the Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America, and agreements like the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT-I) between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\nFollowing the end of the Cold War in 1991, efforts in non-proliferation intensified, with particular focus on strengthening the NPT. The revelation of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program after the Gulf War prompted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to introduce the Model Additional Protocol, enhancing its access to information and nuclear facilities. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 1996 marked a significant milestone, prohibiting all nuclear explosions and providing for on-site inspections and confidence-building measures.\nIn recent years, cybercrime and cyberattacks have emerged as significant threats to international security, paralleling the concerns posed by nuclear proliferation in the past. Analogous to the NPT for nuclear issues, there is a growing need for a comprehensive treaty addressing cybercrime, regulation of the internet, and law enforcement procedures for cross-border investigations. These issues carry profound implications for human rights, economic systems, and national security. International cooperation is crucial in developing effective regulatory frameworks for cyberspace, fostering confidence among stakeholders and ensuring a secure digital environment.\n## 6.2 Lessons from Nuclear Law for Cyber Regulation\nThe NPT is a three-part global pact intended at restricting the spread of nuclear weapons: (1) non-proliferation, (2) disarmament, and (3) peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The basic tenets of the treaty include the principle that nuclear weapons will not be acquired by States that do not have them, nuclear-weapon States will pursue disarmament, and all States have access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes under safeguards.\nAccording to Article IX of the NPT, 'nuclear weapon states (NWS)' are those that have detonated a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967,\n Following suit, states of the South Pacific established an NWFZ in 1985, Southeast Asia in 1995, Africa in 1996, and Central Asia in 2006.\n Seven years later, SALT-I was followed up by the signing of SALT-II by these two nations, which further limited their nuclear capabilities.\n Deborah Brown, 'Cybercrime is Dangerous, But a New UN Treaty Could Be Worse for Rights' (13 August 2021) <https: 08=\"\" 13=\"\" 2021=\"\" cybercrime-dangerous-new-un-treaty-could-be-worse-rights=\"\" news=\"\" www.hrw.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) supplements the NPT and includes a Protocol detailing the International Monitoring System (IMS), On-Site Inspections (OSI), and Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs). The CTBT prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, with provisions for redressing violations, ensuring compliance, and periodic review of its effectiveness.\nPresident John F. Kennedy's infamous fear in the 1960s, that 20 or perhaps 30 'Nuclear-Weapon States (NWSs)' would arise within a decade, did not come true. The number of nuclear powers or governments with active nuclear weapons programmes remains at ten even now. The NPT recognises five of them as lawful nuclear weapons possessors, which corresponds to the permanent five members of the 'UN Security Council (UNSC)'. Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are all said to have nuclear weapons or have demonstrated it through testing. Iran has long been accused of pursuing a zealous nuclear weapons development. In contrast, no less than 26 governments have renounced or been forced to abandon their pursuit of nuclear weapons, having completed feasibility studies, targeted weapon research or even development, or manufactured nuclear weapons (or inherited them following the collapse of the Soviet Union). Almost the whole phalanx of middle powers is made\n There are gaps in the current treaty framework. Firstly, there is the issue of countries like India, Pakistan, and Israel not joining the NPT. This leads to a significant amount of unsafeguarded nuclear activity. Another concern is that countries signatory may develop nuclear fuel cycle facilities and then subsequently opt-out of the Treaty as North Korea did. To avoid this, stronger and more regular inspection measures need to be enforced within the Treaty mechanism, with the aid of international bodies.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nup of these countries. When one considers that the CTBT names out 44 'nuclear capable' governments whose ratification is necessary before the treaty can be implemented, the miracle of non-proliferation becomes even greater. By comparing the 'before' and 'after,' we may obtain a sense of the consequences of international norms. The vast majority of 'nuclear aspirants' began their nuclear programmes before the NPT was signed. After the NPT was opened for signing, only Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, and (perhaps) Syria developed their programmes. Surprisingly, none of these nations were democracies at the time the pact was drafted. On the contrary, the vast majority of 'renouncers' halted their programmes during or after the discussions. As a result, for most of them, the NPT signified the line beyond which nuclear weapons ambitions lost their legitimacy.\nThe reliance of nuclear-armed governments, including the US, on computerized Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems underscores a critical vulnerability. These systems, integral to every aspect of nuclear force management, operate within cyberspace, making them susceptible to hacking and cyberattacks. NC3 systems encompass a network of communication and data-processing technologies linking weapons, radar systems, launch sites, and senior authorities responsible for nuclear decision-making. Despite extensive cybersecurity measures, the complexity and diversity of these systems render them inherently vulnerable, with numerous potential points of attack. Moreover, emerging technologies such as cyber capabilities, hypersonics, and encryption have the dual potential of exacerbating conflicts within the framework of the NPT while also offering avenues for achieving its objectives. While the NPT has been slow to address these evolving challenges, academia and non-governmental organizations have extensively studied their implications for nuclear issues. However, there remains a significant gap between civil society's engagement with emerging technologies and their integration into the NPT framework.[152]\nGiven its role as both a treaty and a forum, the NPT holds particular importance in addressing these challenges. States parties to the NPT have legal obligations regarding nuclear technology proliferation, making it essential\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nto consider the impact of emerging technologies on treaty compliance and verification. The NPT review process provides a unique opportunity for nuclear‐possessor and non‐possessor states to discuss and address a wide range of issues affecting nuclear order and treaty obligations. In light of these considerations, emerging technologies should be incorporated into all nuclear and non‐nuclear disarmament agreements, including the CTBT, the Conference on Disarmament (CD), and nuclear‐weapon‐free zones. However, the NPT, with its comprehensive legal framework and review mechanism, stands as a pivotal platform for addressing the challenges posed by emerging technologies to nuclear disarmament and non‐proliferation efforts.\nEdward Ifft highlights the CTBT innovative approach to addressing the challenge of unequal capacity among State parties to collect and evaluate data about compliance. The treaty establishes an IMS, comprising 337 globally distributed sites equipped with seismic, radionuclide, hydroacoustic, and infrared sensors. Ifft suggests that most States lack the resources to independently acquire and analyze this data. However, individual State parties can access professional technical analysis of IMS data and other relevant information free of charge from an international data center in Vienna. Drawing on the collaborative IMS model proposed by the CTBT, Ifft proposes the development of a Joint Attribution Mechanism (JAM) to assist nations with limited cyber forensic capabilities in collecting and analyzing data for attribution purposes. Such a mechanism could serve as a cost‐effective solution, encouraging nations to participate in a cyber treaty. Additionally, a JAM would enhance the credibility and legitimacy of the attribution process for nations with advanced cyber forensic capabilities. Ensuring reliable attribution is essential, but it is equally important to establish consistent consequences for cyber aggressors. This highlights the need for effective mechanisms to punish those responsible for cyberattacks consistently.\n## Conclusion\nThis article underscores the profound complexities and pressing challenges in the domain of cybersecurity, especially when viewed through the prism of international law. The pernicious implications of cyberattacks are ever more pertinent in an era increasingly dominated by digital data and connectivity. While the international community grapples with defining and responding to these cyber threats, our existing legal frameworks, rooted in conventional\nphysical paradigms, are inadequately equipped to address this novel form of virtual aggression.\nThe current structure of international law does not encapsulate an all-encompassing definition of cyberattacks, making it a precarious space in need of robust codification. The disruption wrought by cyberattacks on WTO agreements is even more deleterious, given the outdated security exceptions that remain unresponsive to risk-based cybersecurity measures. Moreover, the burgeoning surge in FDIs in digital assets, primarily intangible, exposes another lacuna in international law, conspicuously absent in contemporary investment treaties. These considerations underscore an imminent need to institute measures to mitigate the manifold issues arising from cyberattacks.\nPublic international law must evolve to address the specific nuances of cyberattacks and the consequent implications on State sovereignty, transborder crime, and national security. The ascendance of cyber aggression necessitates a re-examination of the fundamental tenets of international law, including the principles of Jus Ad Bellum and Jus In Bello, with a more nuanced lens. The complexities of attribution and the abstract nature of cyber warfare necessitate a shift in how we perceive sovereignty and territoriality in the digital age.\nIn the sphere of WTO law, the advent of cyber threats and the expansion of digital economies call for a revamp of trade rules and exceptions. It is crucial to establish a harmonized understanding of cybersecurity risks and potential countermeasures, with a balanced approach to cyber governance and free trade. Thus, a common vision is the need of the hour to work in collaboration internationally for ensuring cybersecurity and keeping cybercrimes at bay. The establishment of the Trade and Technology Council by the United States and the European Union represents a promising development in the quest for global consensus on trade and technology issues. This initiative holds the potential to facilitate increased collaboration and the harmonization of regulations across international borders.\nFinally, as cyberattacks increasingly target financial assets and systems, the role of investment law becomes paramount. The rise of data-driven businesses necessitates safeguarding digital assets and investments, requiring innovative legal mechanisms such as ‘digital-ready' BITs. Re-envisioning BITs to include digital assets, whilst establishing the scope of security provisions under the FET clause, can address potential investment claims from cyber risks. This would balance the need for a stable investment environment with the protection of digital assets, thereby fostering confidence amongst investors in the digital era.\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333"

This practice is crucial as it helps in preserving and maintaining the integrity or privacy of data.\nThe 'International Organization for Standardization (ISO)' and 'International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)', in ISO/ERC 27000 (Information\n¹ O A Hathaway and others, 'The Law of Cyber-Attack' (2012) 100 (4) Cal L Rev 817.

As per the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cybersecurity is 'the prevention of damage to, unauthorized use of, exploitation of, and – if needed – the restoration of electronic information and communications systems, and the information they contain, in order to strengthen the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these systems.'

Furthermore, an act of this magnitude could also be conducted by the State or an independent criminal.⁶ Cyberattacks can be analyzed through four primary criteria. Firstly, they possess the capacity to manipulate, destroy, or exfiltrate data, rendering them inherently disruptive and unpredictable. Their origin may be domestic or foreign, introducing complexities in attribution. Secondly, the nature of the perpetrator varies, ranging from individual criminals to organized groups or entities. Thirdly, the impact of cyberattacks is predominantly virtual, encompassing data loss or manipulation, which significantly diminishes the affected data’s commercial value. Moreover, attacks on critical infrastructure can precipitate severe disruptions to essential services. Lastly, the attribution of cyberattacks to state actors presents challenges, necessitating substantial evidence to establish\n⁴ IBM Services, ‘What is a Cyber-attack?’ (IBM, 11 November 2020) <www.ibm.com by-services=\"\" business-continuity=\"\" cyberattack#:~:text=\"The%20most%20well%2Dknown%20type,malware%20may%20not%20be%20immediate\" in-en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023. An attack is an ‘attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of anything that has value to the organization.’\n⁵ Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC), ‘Cyber Attack’ (National Institute of Standards and Technology, 27 February 2021) <https: cyscr.nist.gov=\"\" glossary=\"\" cyber_attack=\"\" term=\"\">. There are several definitions produced by scholars, research organizations, and private enterprises. However, there is a need for a uniform/consensual legal definition to the term cyberattacks. Two definitions are frequently cited. The National Institute of Standards and Technology–Computer Security Resource Center: defines cyberattack as ‘[a]n attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information’. Secondly, the National Research Council’s Committee on Offensive Information Warfare defines cyber-attacks as ‘[e]fforts to alter, disrupt, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information or programs on them’. See Matthew C Waxman, ‘Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)’ (2011) 36 Yale J Intl L 424.

In the same vein, it has warned by UK head of MI6 that China was exporting technology that allowed it to exert a ‘web of authoritarian control’ around the world. This may lead some countries to get caught in ‘data traps’ and digital currencies could be one such trap, see Roula Khalaf and Helen Warrell, ‘UK Spy Chief Raises Fears over China’s Digital Renminbi’ (Financial Times, 10 December 2021) <https: 128d7139-15d6-4f4d-a247-fc9228a53ebd=\"\" 128d7=\"\" content=\"\" www.ft.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:></www.ibm.com>\nQIAN\nculpability. For instance, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack attributed to the 'Guardians of Peace' raised suspicions of North Korean involvement, yet conclusive evidence remained elusive.\nThere is a major concern if these attacks can be attributed to a State; such State attributable attacks would be considered, by virtue of 'Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter,' to be a volatile use of force. The sovereignty of a State is transgressed when it falls prey to such attacks. Attribution in cyberattacks poses significant challenges beyond simply identifying the responsible actor. Key issues include the lack of consensus on the required standards of proof, the debate over whether attributions should be made publicly or kept confidential, and the ambiguity surrounding the legal consequences of successful attribution. Additionally, while public attributions can serve purposes such as deterring future attacks and holding perpetrators accountable, they may also escalate tensions and risk revealing sensitive intelligence sources. There might be a notable loss of information or reduction in its value which could pose significant threats to the economy and national security. Due to their inherent characteristics, cyberattacks present a global challenge. Distinctively differing from conventional physical assaults, these cyber intrusions are swift, transcend borders, and exhibit no discernible pattern, rendering\n7 Delbert Tran, 'The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attributing the Source of a Cyber-Attack' (2018) 20(1) Yale J L &amp; Tech 376.

The Institute classified the fifteen main players in this field of conflict into three categories, with one surprise: there is only one State in the first category; the United States is, according to the study, some ten years ahead of the Chinese. While the United States is the only one to tick all the boxes in the first category, there are more in the second category: China and Russia, but also France, the only European Union country on this list.

Consequently, there is burgeoning discourse surrounding the development of a cybersecurity treaty, paralleling established frameworks for managing other forms of strategic risk. However, crafting effective agreements necessitates a nuanced understanding of cyber incident typologies and their respective implications. Organizations such as the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) advocate for a comprehensive consideration of strategic risks inherent in cyber capabilities.¹⁵ Thus, addressing cyber threats mandates the formulation of holistic frameworks that reconcile national sovereignty, security imperatives, and international cooperation mandates.¹⁶\nThis article draws upon theoretical foundations from international law, comparative law, and international relations to provide a thorough examination of the pressing issue of cyberattacks. Its conceptual framework illuminates the potential interpretation and development of international legal norms, compares distinct yet interconnected areas, and explores the broader geopolitical dimensions of this global challenge. By analyzing fundamental principles of international law – such as state sovereignty, the use of force, and state responsibility – within the context of cyber operations, the article raises critical questions about their applicability to emerging cyber realities. Furthermore, it employs comparative legal analysis to draw parallels between legal frameworks governing nuclear non-proliferation and potential cybersecurity frameworks, highlighting the importance of adapting existing legal mechanisms to address new challenges. Additionally, the article considers the roles of both state and non-state actors in cybercrimes and examines the geopolitical implications of attributing cyberattacks to states.\nThis article establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the challenges posed by cyberattacks and the ongoing pursuit of bolstered cybersecurity\n¹² Marc Barrachin and Algirde Pipikaite, ‘We Need a Global Standard for Reporting Cyber Attacks’ (Harv Bus Rev, 8 November 2019) <https: 11=\"\" 2019=\"\" hbr.org=\"\" we-need-a-global-standard-for-reporting-cyber-attacks=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n¹³ United Nations General Assembly Res 64/211, ‘Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and Taking Stock of National Efforts to Protect Critical Information Infrastructures’ (17 March 2010) UN Doc A/RES/64/211.\n¹⁴ See Barrachin and Pipikaite (n 12).\n¹⁵ See Martha Finnermore and Duncan B Hollis, ‘Constructing Norms for Global Cybersecurity’ (2016) 110 AJIL 425.\n¹⁶ M Wohfeld and J Jasper, ‘Cyberattacks and Cyber Conflict: Where Is Conflict Resolution?’, in O Grech (ed), Contemporary Issues in Conflict Resolution (University of Malta 2018), 5–17.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\nwithin the domain of public international law. While clarity within general international law remains scarce, valuable insights can be gleaned from existing legal frameworks in international economic realms, such as international trade and investment law. The emergence of the cyber realm has introduced contemporary issues that challenge established norms and rules of international law, necessitating examination in terms of interpretation, application, and structure. Cyberattacks transcend mere technological phenomena, fundamentally reshaping traditional societal paradigms including concepts of capital and warfare. The article probes the adequacy of existing international legal and economic rules in defining cyberattacks and delineating breaches of established norms. It critically examines the efficacy of international law in regulating cyberattacks, recognizing the inherent complexities in defining and addressing such incidents. The article offers a nuanced definition of cyberattacks, recognizing their intricate nature that defies simple conceptualization. It contends that cyberattacks represent a modern manifestation of acts of war, a concept deeply rooted in international legal discourse spanning millennia. Exploring potential solutions, the article investigates the role of international economic law in mitigating cyber threats, particularly in safeguarding global data flows integral to contemporary globalization processes. Moreover, it delves into the potential applicability of investment treaties in regulating digital assets and scrutinizes existing parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation. By examining how nuclear non-proliferation treaties serve as a precedent, the article explores the feasibility of developing a comprehensive set of international rules to govern cyberattacks, thereby addressing critical gaps in current regulatory frameworks.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n301\n## 2 Delineating the Notion and Boundaries of Cyberattacks\nA cyberattack is any kind of malicious action aimed at obtaining unlawful access to information technology systems including the resources or valuable information of their users that they may encompass. Cyberattacks hit businesses every day, particularly targeting critical infrastructure, trade secrets, and intellectual property with commercial value, and other online information.²⁰ Cyberattacks can peculiarly break into the defence²¹ systems²² which include defense capabilities and private military suppliers²³ and can gravely threaten the security of the nation. Its effect on the economy cannot be ignored, especially in the case of the United States where approximately 90% of critical infrastructure is possessed by the private sector, and companies do not see any specific reason for investing in cybersecurity to secure public interest.²⁴ By refusing to invest in cybersecurity, the private sector increases the exposure of the whole economy and society to cyber threats. The risk of cyberattacks that have the potential to cause large-scale shutdowns and huge amounts of other material harms are amplified by the digital transformation of the infrastructure of various sectors.²⁵ Moreover, ‘information technology (IT)’, connected devices, cyber-physical systems, and industrial control systems are all potential\n20 Meltzer (n 6).\n21 Fred Cohen, ‘Simulating Cyberattacks, Defenses, and Consequences’ (1999) 18(6) Computers &amp; Security 479.\n22 The Honorable James Clapper and others, ‘Joint Statement for the Record to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Foreign Cyber Threats to the United States’ (United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, 5 January 2017) <https: clapper-lettre-rogers_01-05-16.pdf=\"\" imo=\"\" media=\"\" www.armed-services.senate.gov=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n23 For instance, in the United States, the defense industry comprises the Department of Defense (DOD) along with agencies responsible for national security and military equipment providers. Measures have been undertaken by the DOD to mitigate risks caused by acquisition of third-party goods and services. In this regard, the procurement process may face a cyber risk caused by insertion of a bad software or a rogue product along the supply chain capable of forcing itself into the national security systems.\n24 Meltzer (n 6).\n25 NIS Cooperation Group, ‘EU Coordinated Risk Assessment of the Cybersecurity of 5G Networks’ (2019); For instance, numerous power outages caused by the NotPetya cyberattack on the power network of Ukraine.

Finally, there exists a two-fold risk in the cyber-espionage area. First, any unauthorized person may access and steal sensitive personal information. Second, existing information may be altered to create a façade and disseminate fake news to the larger public.³⁰ Furthermore, a major source of deceptive information and malicious publication could perhaps be, deep fake videos generated by ‘Artificial Intelligence (AI)’.³¹\nIn the context of the growing importance of a data-driven economy for national economic progress, effective data governance emerges as a critical aspect of governance.³² Governments are increasingly prioritizing data governance and implementing measures to safeguard the digital economy against cyber threats. These measures include implementing export limitations and restricting foreign government access to national technology.³³ One of the most significant and concerning cyberattacks targeted the US Government, its agencies, and numerous private companies – the ‘SolarWinds hack.’³⁴\n26 ‘Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity: Version 1.1’ (NIST, 16 April 2018) <https: cswp=\"\" nistpcbs=\"\" nistpubs.nist.gov=\"\" nistpubs.nist.gov/ns162018.pdf=\"\" nistpubs=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n27 Critical infrastructure has been defined by the USA PATRIOT Act as physical or virtual systems that are so integral to the United States that their impairment or destruction would result in a ‘debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters’; USA Patriot Act, 42 USC § 5195c(e) (2001).

While the full extent of the attack remains uncertain, it is believed to have impacted entities such as the US Treasury, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Commerce, and parts of the Pentagon.³⁵\n## 2.1 The Ambiguity of 'Cyberattack' within International Law\nDespite the pervasive phenomenon of cyberattacks in our increasingly interconnected contemporary society, where organisations are transitioning their operations and data storage to online platforms, international law remains ambivalent, lacking a precise and universally accepted legal definition for the term 'cyberattack'. This omission underscores a critical gap, especially as the digital realm continues to be a significant frontier for both commerce and potential conflict.³⁶ The degree of digitization of economic activities is generally linked to the tendency of experiencing cyberattacks. A recent measure by the Indian government is the 'Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)' project. The process involves a biometric ID that assigns to each individual, a 12-digit number. It further requires, storing 10 fingerprints, iris scans and other necessary details such as names, addresses and date of birth to be recorded in the eGovernance cloud platform. Consequently, the practice involves an increased cybersecurity concern among the individuals, private organisations and the government agencies. In the absence of indigenous cybersecurity technology and patents in the nation, India's government has declared that it will be providing monetary incentives to Indian enterprises who acquire foreign firms with cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies.³⁷ Perhaps worse, most of these threats have targeted small-scale industries that do not have the requisite means, instruments, or techniques to protect themselves and their business interests. Maintenance of cybersecurity is getting harder every year as cybercriminals continuously pose new threats, leverage new bugs, and carry out new sophisticated attacks; whilst regulatory institutions are still evolving and enhancing their standards.\n³⁵ 'Scope of Russian Hacking Becomes Clear: Multiple U.S. Agencies Were Hit' (The New York Times, 14 December 2020), <https: 12=\"\" 14=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" rus=\"\" sia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n³⁶ Brett Van Niekerk, 'Suppression of Cyber-defences', IST-Africa Week Conference, Durban, 2016.

Projections by Cybersecurity Ventures suggest a dramatic rise in global cybercrime costs, with estimates indicating a potential annual total of USD 10.5 trillion by 2025, marking a considerable increase from USD 3 trillion in 2015.³⁸ These figures underscore the immense economic impact of cybercrime, surpassing damages caused by natural disasters and even exceeding the collective value of significant illegal drug trades worldwide. Such crimes represent a substantial economic transfer globally, impeding innovation and investment.³⁹ While no sector is immune to cyber threats, the financial services industry stands out as particularly vulnerable. The 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report highlights financial organizations⁴⁰ as the most heavily targeted sector, followed by healthcare and public administration, respectively.⁴¹\nThere has been no global consensus on the definition of cybersecurity. However, it has been defined by the International Telecommunication Union as 'a set of tools, policies, safeguards, and technologies that can protect the cyber environment and the assets of an organization or user.'⁴² Cybersecurity, therefore, seeks to protect and maintain the digital assets security of the organization or the user against the risks involved in the cyber environment. The approach offered by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) presents an intriguing perspective on cyberattacks. NIST's framework does not differentiate between state-sponsored actions and criminal activities, nor does it consider the distinct impact of cyber incidents on public versus private records, networks, and facilities. While prioritizing the integrity of information and information networks, NIST's framework fails to encompass broader societal goals such as national market growth, law enforcement access\n³⁸ Steve Morgan, 'Cybercrime to Cost the World $10.5 Trillion Annually By 2025' (Cybercrime Magazine, 13 November 2020) <https: cybersecurityventures.com=\"\" hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n³⁹ Brian Cashell and others, 'The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attack' (United States Congressional Research Service, 1 April 2004) <https: ras.org=\"\" rl32331.pdf=\"\" sgp=\"\" crs=\"\" misc=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n⁴⁰ Kenning Arlitsch and Adam Edelman, 'Staying Safe: Cyber Security for People and Organizations' (2014) 54 J Libr Admin 46.\n⁴¹ '2020 Data Breach Investigation Report' (Verizon, 2020) <https: 2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf=\"\" enterprise.verizon.com=\"\" resources=\"\" reports=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023; the Public Administration sector manages with the administration of local, state and federal government.\n⁴² International Telecommunication Union, 'Overview of Cybersecurity: Recommendation ITU-T X.1205' (ITU-T, 4 August 2008) <https: rec=\"\" t-rec-x.1205-200804-i=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n305\nto private data, information quality management, or social constraints. Consequently, the definition outlined by NIST primarily focuses on unauthorized use and confidentiality concerns but lacks clarity in distinguishing between state-driven actions and criminal activities.\nAn alternative legal definition proposed by the United States National Research Council defines cyberattacks as purposeful actions aimed at altering, disrupting, deceiving, degrading, or destroying computer systems, networks, or the information and programs within them.43 While this definition offers rationality, it also highlights ambiguity, particularly in differentiating between basic cybercrimes and cyberattacks. This lack of clarity may lead to inconsistencies within the legal framework, hindering effective coordination among agencies.\n## 2.2 International Responses and Legal Implications\nThe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has introduced the Cyber Norms Index to monitor and compare significant achievements in negotiating and establishing norms for governmental actions in cyberspace. This index aids policymakers and observers in analyzing proposals for cyber norms, tracking their development, and assessing their uniform adoption by members of the global community. Users can utilize the index to examine multilateral outcomes and compare information using various groups or keywords. Additionally, there has been a widespread call for norms aimed at immunizing and stabilizing cyberspace.44 CSO Online45 has curated a list of\n43 Owens William, Technology, Policy Law and Ethics Regarding U.S. Acquisition and Use of Cyberattack Capabilities (National Academies 2009).\n44 Henry Farrell, ‘Promoting Norms for Cyberspace’ (Council on Foreign Relations, 6 April 2015) <http: cybersecurity=\"\" p36358=\"\" promoting-norms-cyberspace=\"\" www.cfr.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023. Cyber norms may also evolve in a decentralised, bottom-up fashion rather than through top-down regulation. On this idea, see, eg, Bryan Druzin and Jessica Li, ‘Censorship’s Fragile Grip on the Internet: Can Online Speech be Controlled?’ (2016) 49 Cornell Intl L J 369 (arguing that cyber norms may evolve suddenly as the unintended consequence of decentralised behaviour). For the self-standardization of international legal norms more generally, see Bryan Druzin, ‘Why Does Soft Law Have Any Power Anyway?’ (2016) 7 Asian J Intl L 361 (arguing that many areas of soft law exhibit strong network effects, rendering it uniquely calibrated to induce voluntary adoption); Bryan Druzin, ‘Towards a Theory of Spontaneous Legal Standardization’ (2017) 8 JIDS 403 (positing a theory as to how legal normative standardization may occur in a decentralized, bottom-up fashion from network effect pressures).\n45 CSO Online is a publication that provides news, analysis, and research on a broad range of security and risk management topics.

In February 2020, the US Department of Justice apprehended two Chinese citizens for allegedly laundering bitcoin on behalf of North Korean attackers.⁵² Similarly, the Mexican\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n307\nfinance ministry reported a hacking attempt on its infrastructure, although no confidential information was compromises.53 In 2021, Russian hackers infiltrated a Ukrainian government file-sharing system, attempting to disseminate illicit records to compromised machines.54\nAmong the most recent and significant cyberattacks is the SolarWinds breach. SolarWinds, a prominent US information technology company, fell victim to a cyberattack that went undetected for months,55 affecting its customers. US authorities suspect Russian hackers to be behind the attack, which targeted not the federal government or a private organization's network directly, but a third-party technology provider. This tactic, known as a 'Supply Chain' attack, exploited vulnerabilities in SolarWinds' Orion IT management tools, compromising high-ranking departments of the US government, including the Department of Homeland Security and Treasury, as well as private enterprises like FireEye.\n## 2.3 Cyber-Attacks on the Upswing: Risk for Worsening\nHacking groups and state-sponsored organizations have discovered that cyber-attacks are an effective weapon for balancing the playing field with rivals. The convergence of an attacker threat is highly risky and an expensive danger of insider manipulation or theft of intellectual property has generated a precarious environment in the private sector.56 While employee incompetence and human errors contribute to organizational vulnerabilities, recent years have witnessed a notable surge in attacks by malicious actors with access to sensitive business information. The global cybersecurity landscape is fraught with concerns regarding the likelihood of financial losses, misappropriation of classified data, and disruptions to critical infrastructure. The escalating scale and complexity of cyberattacks have not only heightened the risk of being caught off guard but have also increased the costs associated with preventing and recovering from such incidents.\n53 Adriana Barrera, 'Mexico's Economy Ministry Hit by Cyber-attack' (Reuters, 25 February 2020) <www.reuters.com article=\"\" us-mexico-economy-cyberattack-iduskcn20jobi=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n54 Dan Goodin, 'Ukraine Says Russia Hacked Its Document Portal and Planted Malicious Files' (ARS Technica, 25 February 2021) <https: 02=\"\" 2021=\"\" arstechnica.com=\"\" information-technology=\"\" ukraine-says-russia-hacked-its-document-portal-and-planted-malicious-files=\"\" /=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n55 Richard Kugler, 'Deterrence of Cyber Attacks', in Franklin D Kramer and others (eds), Cyberpower and National Security (National Defense University Press 2009) 309.\n56 See Sesha Kethineni, 'Cybercrime in India: Laws, Regulations, and Enforcement Mechanisms', in T Holt and A Bossler (eds), The Palgrave Handbook of International Cybercrime and Cyberdeviance (Palgrave 2020) 305–26.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.reuters.com>\nQIAN\nDespite media attention being drawn to high-profile cyberattacks targeting large corporations like Target, Netflix, and financial institutions such as JP Morgan, it is small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that remain the most vulnerable. Industry analysts estimate that up to  $60\\%$  of SMEs may face collapse within six months due to cyberattacks, ranging from phishing scams to ransomware assaults.\nChina's initiative to develop digital infrastructure, known as the 'Digital Silk Road,' alongside its traditional infrastructure projects, aims to enhance international connectivity in terms of communication and data flow. This digital complement to the land-based 'Silk Road Economic Belt' and the 'Twenty-First Century Maritime Silk Road' seeks to bolster capacity for the exchange of goods.\nIn light of these developments, states reliant on global interactions must prioritize the development of credible policies on cross-border data flow. As nations seek to thrive in the post-COVID-19 era and compete in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, facilitating cross-border data flow is imperative. Several governments have already issued warnings about the potential for large-scale cyber assaults, exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to lure individuals and companies into divulging personal and financial data.\n# 3 Paradigm Shift in Public International Law: Cyberattack as an Act of War\nThe world is rapidly transitioning towards intensive digitalization, a trend that has been ongoing for years but has recently accelerated unexpectedly.

Historically, such acts encompassed a wide range of actions, including unfriendly economic or commercial measures and actions that insulted a nation's pride.⁷⁰ However, rapid technological advancements have challenged this traditional concept, rendering established legal categories inadequate to regulate contemporary activities.⁷¹\nIn the context of cyberspace, clarifying the concept of *casus belli* serves to provide a clear standard against which states can assess their behavior and that of others when initiating or responding to cyberattacks.⁷² Traditional theories of *casus belli*, often emphasizing the violent and aggressive nature of armed operations, may not directly apply to cyberattacks due to their non-physical nature. Nevertheless, cyberattacks can be viewed as potential triggers for war if they cause substantial physical damage to the target's computer systems. While a destructive attack on computer systems by a nation-state may not necessarily constitute a *casus belli*, a significant strike solely targeting computer systems could potentially justify a defensive military response.⁷³\nClassifying cyber assaults, such as computer intrusions or communication disruptions, presents significant challenges. For instance, while both data breaches and attacks on air traffic control systems are invasive, the latter could result in greater damage and loss of life, potentially constituting an 'armed attack' rather than mere data theft. Additionally, attacks causing significant harm, regardless of the level of intrusion, may qualify as 'armed attacks.' Large-scale cyberattacks have the potential to incapacitate an opponent's ability to wage war effectively, surpassing the impact of traditional kinetic attacks. Such attacks can disrupt vital functions such as leadership, communication,\n⁶⁹ Hannah Herbst, 'Cyber Attacks &amp; Modern Warfare' (*Denver J Intl L Pol*, 8 April 2020) <http: djilp.org=\"\" cyber-attacks-modern-warfare=\"\"></http:> accessed 25 November 2023.\n⁷⁰ Colonel Charles J Dunlap, Jr, 'International Law and Terrorism' <http: dunlapterrorism.pdf=\"\" people.duke.edu=\"\" ~pfeaver=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n⁷¹ Lawrence T Greenberg and others, *Information Warfare and International Law* (DOD Command Command and Control Research Program 1998).\n⁷² Charles C Poché, 'This Means War!

Consequently, cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure should be regarded as legitimate grounds for declaring a casus belli.\n## 3.2 Conceptualizing Cyber-Operation as Use of force\nThe United Nations (UN) Charter, a foundational document governing the use of force (*Jus Ad Bellum*), outlines in Article 2(4)⁷⁴ that Member States must refrain from threatening or using force to undermine the territorial sovereignty or political independence of another state, unless justified by self-defense or authorized by the UN Security Council. Determining whether a cyberattack violates this prohibition requires an understanding of how ‘force’ is interpreted in international law and whether cyberattacks meet the criteria set out by these standards.⁷⁵\nA narrow interpretation of ‘force’ is recommended, aligning with the objectives outlined in the UN Charter’s preamble to maintain international peace and security and prevent war.⁷⁶ However, the Charter does not exhaustively address all aspects of force regulation, and further guidance is sought from customary international law, as noted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).⁷⁷ Offensive cyber capabilities, such as implanting harmful code into computer networks, share similarities with traditional military actions, economic coercion, and subversion.⁷⁸ The effects of cyberattacks can range from temporary disruptions, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, to severe physical damage and loss of life, such as disrupting emergency networks for first responders.\nCategorizing all cyberattacks as a ‘use of force’ under Article 2(4) would require an exceptionally broad interpretation.⁷⁹ The Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare suggests that cyberattacks with tangible consequences in the physical\n⁷⁴ UN Charter Art 2, para 4.\n⁷⁵ Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ (2012) 30 Berkeley J Intl L 525.

The Tallinn Manual outlines criteria including severity, spontaneity, directness, intrusiveness, quantification, and presumptive legitimacy to evaluate cyberattack consequences against those of conventional attacks.⁸¹ If a cyberattack exhibits sufficient resemblance to these criteria, broadening the prohibition on force is warranted.⁸² Despite the United States' emphasis on consequences over methodology, modern society's heavy reliance on computer systems raises concerns about incapacitating physical infrastructure without tangible destruction.⁸³\nThe SolarWinds incident underscores the importance of characterizing cyberattacks as casus belli. SolarWinds, a company serving a vast clientele including major US government agencies, fell victim to cyber-attacks that compromised the integrity of their data. While some argue these attacks do not meet the casus belli threshold and constitute espionage,⁸⁴ distinguishing between cyber-attacks and espionage remains challenging. Responses to cyber espionage must be strategized akin to other cyberattacks, especially in cases like supply chain attacks, where damage control may overshadow the actors' intent.⁸⁵ While cyber espionage typically does not warrant casus belli, it may do so if aimed at undermining a state's political and social institutions.⁸⁶ The intertwining of espionage and operational access in incidents like SolarWinds raises concerns about latent vulnerabilities and potential future attacks of unprecedented magnitude. The evolving interpretation of international law\n⁸⁰ On the question of the threshold of cyber warfare and the difference between use of cyber force and cyber armed attack.

The declaration of SolarWinds as a casus belli hinges on the interpretation by relevant authorities, as exemplified by the French government's stance on cyberattacks causing system collapse.87 Therefore, if United States authorities deem SolarWinds attacks as a casus belli, access to critical systems by hackers can warrant such a classification.88\n## 3.3 Self-Defence in the International Law of Cyberattack\nCyber self-defense reactions that are similar to armed attacks must fulfill proportionality,89 necessity, and immediacy criteria.90 According to Article 51 of the UN Charter, 'Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.'91 The International Court of Justice in Nicaragua laid down that Article 51, like Articles 2(4) and 42 of the UN Charter, does not refer to specific weapons.92 Therefore, this rationale can be applied to cyber operations as well.\nAs a consequence, if a State is the target of a cyber-attack, it has the same right to employ force in self-defense as if it were attacked by armed forces.93 The ICJ has repeatedly found that the fundamental principles of 'individual', 'collective,' and 'self-defense' authorize only those means that are proportional to the armed assault and where it is reasonable to react with those measures. In the context of cyberattacks, ensuring proportionality requires a nuanced understanding of technical intricacies. For example, a cyber response coded into software demands extensive knowledge of potential targets, often obtained through conventional cyber exploitation methods.94 The Office of the Attorney General of California defined cyber exploitation as 'the non-consensual distribution or publication of intimate photos or videos\n87 Vindman (n 18).\n88 ibid.\n89 See generally on proportionality, Hensey A Fenton II, 'Proportionality and Its Applicability in the Realm of Cyber-Attacks' (2019) 29 Duke J Comp &amp; Intl L 335.\n90 Melzer (n 67).\n91 UN Charter art 51.

Prior to the establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, bilateral trade was seen as beneficial for increasing demand for local products and improving living standards.100 However, the implementation of GATT and subsequent efforts to regulate and harmonize international trade introduced complexities, particularly regarding the interpretation of terms like non-state actors, terrorism, the environment, and cybersecurity measures at the domestic and international levels.101 During Ministerial Conference 11 in 2017, 71 World Trade Organization (WTO) members, both developed and developing, issued a Joint Statement on Electronic Commerce, expressing their commitment to exploring future negotiations on the trade-related aspects of electronic commerce. Currently, negotiations involve 90 WTO members, with The Gambia\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\nbeing the latest addition. An updated negotiation text from November 2023, under Section C, addresses cybersecurity. It emphasizes the evolving nature of cyber threats and outlines measures for member states to enhance cybersecurity capabilities. These measures include building the capabilities of national entities responsible for cybersecurity incident response, collaborating to identify and mitigate malicious intrusions or dissemination of malicious code affecting electronic networks, addressing cybercrime, and sharing information for awareness and best practices.¹⁰²\n## 4.1 Legal Pitfalls in the Context of Digital Trade\nIn the sphere of international trade, cybersecurity measures are employed to address illegal data breaches by non-state actors that affect legitimate trading activities among WTO Member States. However, the cybersecurity countermeasures are often justified by the States based upon the general and security exceptions under the GATT and ‘General Agreement on Trade in Services Agreement (GATS)’. With the advent of the WTO Panel decision in Russia-Traffic in Transit, it is now well established that recourse to exceptions under the WTO is justiciable and not entirely self-judging.¹⁰³\nBuilding on this, the concept of ‘national security unilateralism,’ as delineated by Chaisse and Georgopoulos, reflects an emerging trend where states increasingly prioritize their national security interests, sometimes contravening established international economic norms.¹⁰⁴ A prominent example of this trend is the trade policies of the United States under the Trump administration, marked by unilateral tariff impositions that circumvent standard global trade procedures. This paradigm shift, moving away from a cooperative, rules-based approach in international economic relations to a more insular,\n¹⁰² WTO Electronic Commerce Negotiations Updated Consolidated Negotiating Text – November 2023 <https: img=\"\" pdf=\"\" wto_ji=\"\">\n¹⁰³ Panel Report, Russia – Traffic in Transit, WT/DS512/R, adopted April 2019; Dylan Geraets, ‘WTO Issues Ruling in Russia – Traffic in Transit: Measures Justified on National Security Grounds Are Justiciable’ (Mayer Brown, 8 April 2019) <https: 04=\"\" 2019=\"\" en=\"\" en=\"\" publications=\"\" wto-issues-ruling-in-russia-traffic-in-transit-measures-justified-on-national-security-grounds-are-justiciable#_edn2=\"\" www.mayerbrown.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023. A provision is self-judging when the members can decide whether and how this exception can be applied to the measure. On the one hand, it is non-justiciable when the issue cannot be subject to the findings of a WTO Panel or the adjudicative system. On the other hand, the provision is justiciable if the phrases ‘it considers’ and ‘necessary’ are not read together.\n¹⁰⁴ Julien Chaisse and Georgios Dimitropoulos, ‘Special Economic Zones in International Economic Law: Towards Unilateral Economic Law’ (2021) 24(2) JIEL 229–57.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:>\nQIAN\nsecurity-centric model, presents significant challenges to the traditional frameworks of international trade law.\nThe proliferation of digital trade raises concerns$^{105}$ pertaining to cross-border data flow, critical infrastructure of the trading countries, and vulnerability to cyberattacks, which can potentially lead to violation of trade obligations as envisaged under the GATT, GATS, and TBT Agreements. While the foundation of the GATT is based upon non-discrimination between domestic and foreign goods, an effective domestic policy to counter cyberattacks can result in restricting the access of certain suspicious manufacturers of goods to further participate in the supply chain.$^{106}$ The States have sought to justify these inherent trade-distorting measures based upon the general exception, under the GATT.\nSimilarly, in the context of the TBT Agreement, the Appellate Body in $EC - Asbestos$ held that where the risk associated with cross-border trade increases, the discretion of the Member States also increases in parallel.$^{107}$ Even under the GATS, Member States can take recourse to justify cybersecurity measures based upon the general and security exceptions although the scope of application of trade-restrictive measures is relatively less broad as compared to GATT. The regional free trade agreements have gone one step further by allowing commitments from reciprocating nations to allow the cross-border transfer of personal information and the restricted prohibition on the measures of data localization.\nWhile the security exceptions under the GATT and GATS are self-judging in nature, they are however not immune from panel review as highlighted in Russia – Traffic in Transit.$^{108}$ The general exceptions under the GATT and GATS are resorted to justify measures necessary to protect public morals or secure compliance with laws and regulations. Based upon these, the member nation must evidence whether the cybersecurity measure is ‘necessary’ in light of balancing the factors and whether less trade restricting alternatives are available.$^{109}$ It is, however, agreed to some extent that these\n105 Simon J Evenett and Johannes Fritz, ‘Mapping Policies Affecting Digital Trade’ (Global Trade Alert, 15 April 2021) <www.globaltradealert.org 68=\"\" reports=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n106 See Samm Sacks and others, ‘China’s Cybersecurity Reviews for “Critical” Systems Add Focus on Supply Chain, Foreign, Control’ (New America, 2020) <https: cbina=\"\" china-cybersecurity-reviews-critical-systems-add-focus-supply-chain-foreign-control-translation=\"\" blog=\"\" cybersecurityinitiative=\"\" digichina=\"\" www.newamerica.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 25 November 2023.\n107 Appellate Body Report, $EC - Asbestos$, WT/DS135/AB/R, adopted April 2001.\n108 Panel Report, Russia – Traffic in Transit, WT/DS512/R, adopted April 2019.\n109 Appellate Body Report, Brazil – Measures Affecting Imports of Retreaded Tyres, WT/DS332/AB/R, adopted December 2007.

Consequently, cooperation amongst Member States must be achieved to establish suitable standards such that the measures result in minimum trade distortion. On a preliminary level, it is essential that world governments agree upon a uniform understanding of the nature and scope of cybersecurity measures and the risks posed by them towards international trade. The domestic and international standard-setting organizations can prescribe certain standards for usage and regulation of cybersecurity measures in line with the ISO and IEC standards on cybersecurity.\nThe WTO has made efforts to regulate cybercrime through initiatives such as the Consolidated E-Commerce Negotiating Text circulated in December 2020. The most controversial clause in the document is a broad exception that has been proposed to be incorporated into the negotiated text. This exception allows Member States to freely adopt measures, notwithstanding the obligations under the agreement, to guarantee cybersecurity, safeguard cyberspace sovereignty safeguard the lawful rights and interests of the citizens, juridical persons, and other organizations, and achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives.\" The only limitation to this broad power is that the measures taken must not be arbitrary or discriminatory; they must\nRequirement case significantly clarifies the application of the national security exception in WTO law, particularly by establishing that such exceptions are not entirely self-judging and subject to review (United States – Origin Marking Requirement, WT/DS597/10, Panel report under appeal on 26 January 2023). It underscores the necessity for concrete evidence to justify invoking national security, thereby narrowing the scope for its arbitrary use in trade disputes.

Further, these measures must not be 'a disguised restriction on trade' and should not be 'more than necessary' to attain the objective.¹¹⁴ While the official text of this clause remains unavailable, leaked information provides insights into its content. Despite references to the negotiating text on the WTO's official website, it remains inaccessible to the public.¹¹⁵ Nevertheless, preliminary observations can be made based on the leaked information.\nWhile the exception provides visibility to cybersecurity issues and nation-states with the autonomy to design rigorous cybersecurity mechanisms, the exception is not a comprehensive regulation of cybersecurity and is only an enabling provision. Cyber-security measures remain the prerogative of Member States to keep in place. As a result, there remains a lack of comprehensive regulation of cyber-related issues in international trade. This status quo is especially concerning in a vital and ever-growing area like e-commerce. How this exception will be invoked by Member States remains to be seen but backlash based on information freedom concerns can certainly be anticipated. Further, the exception could also prove to be overbroad. The exception, apart from empowering Member States to take cybersecurity-related measures, allows any measures taken to achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives'. Such a vague enabling provision could lead to disastrous consequences, which could undermine the foundations of international trade. The term 'public policy', typically used in relation to international commercial arbitration, has been held by numerous judgments to be an 'unruly horse'.¹¹⁶ Due to the inherent lack of a precise definition, arbitration scholars have found the concept to be excessively malleable, shaped by the subjective values and principles in each nation.¹¹⁷ Adding to the existing uncertainty around cyber-attacks and cyber-security, the insertion of an unruly horse that is 'public policy', would certainly be undesirable. The text must be revised to include a definition of public policy, or at the least illustrations of the term.\nMoreover, the establishment of standards alone is insufficient; robust compliance and enforcement mechanisms are necessary at the national level. Real-time data sharing on suspicious activities is vital for effective\n¹¹⁴ ibid.\n¹¹⁵ Electronic Commerce Negotiations – Consolidated negotiating text – December 2020 – Revision, WTO Doc INF/ECOM/62/Rev 1 (14 December 2020).\n¹¹⁶ Richardson v Mellish, (1824) 2 Bing 229 at 252.\n¹¹⁷ Ibrahim Shehata, ‘The Ministerial Approval Requirement for Arbitration Agreements in Egypt: Revisiting the Public Policy Debate’ (2020) 37(3) J Intl Arb 391, 402; Anirudh Hariani, ‘Indian Arbitration and the Shifting Sands of Public Policy’ (2020) 6(2) Asian Intl Arb J 159, 160–161.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n319\nenforcement, requiring collaboration between regulators and enforcement agencies.¹¹⁸ Cross-border data flow is essential for accessing the vast quantities of data needed for effective enforcement. Lastly, regulatory bodies must adhere to good regulatory practices to ensure accountability and transparency in their actions.¹¹⁹ It should be further noted that on 20 June 2023, the European Commission and the High Representative published a Joint Communication on a European Economic Security Strategy, to minimize the risks to economic security in the context of increased geopolitical tensions and accelerated technological shifts, while preserving maximum levels of economic openness and dynamism. The Strategy proposes a thorough assessment of risks to economic security include physical and cyber security of critical infrastructure.¹²⁰\n## 5 International Investment Law and the Dynamics of Cybersecurity\nCountries with significant infrastructure development often attract substantial foreign investments from multinational corporations. However, infrastructure encompasses not only physical structures but also digital infrastructure, which plays a crucial role in attracting foreign direct investments (FDI). The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of workplaces, leading to increased reliance on digital assets such as fiber networks and broadband connectivity.¹²¹ Consequently, enhancing a nation's digital infrastructure can attract more FDI, particularly from e-commerce and technology companies.\nNumerous prominent companies globally possess trade secrets and intellectual property rights crucial for their commercial viability. Cyber hackers pose a significant threat by potentially dismantling these assets within a short span, thereby jeopardizing not only the company's survival but also the broader economy. Emphasizing a robust cybersecurity framework becomes imperative as a prerequisite for engaging in any business endeavor. States\n¹¹⁸ Shin-yi Peng, “Private” Cybersecurity Standards?

According to the UNCTAD report, e-commerce transactions amounted to over USD 29 trillion by 2017, constituting approximately 36% of global GDP. As the world increasingly embraces data-driven technology, the centrality of effective data governance becomes ever more apparent.¹²⁴\nThe evolution of international trade towards digital platforms has exposed nation-states to new challenges, particularly cyberattacks, which pose threats to data integrity. One key question is whether cyberattacks should be considered acts of war. Given that virtually all industries are potential targets for cyber hackers, a unified and international solution is necessary to address this problem. Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) could serve as a means to tackle this emerging issue. BITs provide fundamental protections to foreign investments and offer various dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration. Integrating substantive protection against cybercrimes into BITs would enhance the accountability of states and incentivize them to adopt robust data protection laws. This approach could contribute to mitigating the risks posed by cyberattacks in the context of international investment.\n## 5.1 Digital Assets as Emerging Investments\nThe initial task for investors is to ascertain whether digital assets meet the criteria to qualify as 'covered investments' under BITs. As investment tribunals grapple with claims related to cybercrime, they will face the challenge of addressing investment law policy arguments. Extending BIT provisions to encompass such crimes will inevitably entail implications for both investors\n¹²² ‘A Roadmap for Cross Border Data Flows: Future-Proofing Readiness and Cooperation in the New Data Economy: White Paper’ (World Economic Forum, 9 June 2020) <www3.we forum.org 2020.pdf=\"\" docs=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_Cross_Border_Data_Flows_2020.=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_cross_border_data_flows_2020.pdf=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n¹²³ Marina Dane, ‘Digitalisation, Trade, and Geopolitics in Asia’ (2020) <www.kas.de 2020=\"\" 8314289=\"\" documents=\"\" digitalisation%2c+trade%2c+and+geopolitics+in+asia.pdf=\"\" www.kas.de=\"\">/3bf29911-2dcb-6e72-d4aa-936f9b5082d0?version=1.0&amp;t=1608181259722&gt; accessed 19 October 2021.\n¹²⁴ Aaronson and Struett (n 66); ‘Global e-Commerce Sales Surged to $29 Trillion’ (UNCTAD Press Release, 29 March 2019) <https: global-e-commerce-sales-surged-29-trillion=\"\" press-material=\"\" unctad.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.kas.de></www3.we>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n321\nand States, and defining the jurisdiction of investment tribunals over such claims will prove to be challenging. Furthermore, to invoke the BIT regime, investors must establish the presence of an investment and demonstrate that it has been made within the territory of the host State. With regards to the existence of investment, tribunals have previously construed intangible assets like intellectual property rights and administrative rights as falling within the scope of investment. Given the liberal approach adopted thus far, digital assets may feasibly be encompassed within this definition. It is foreseeable that investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) claims concerning this issue will proliferate, particularly as foreign investment in digital firms – providing services such as e-commerce platforms and online payment support – continues to escalate.\nTribunals have typically referenced the definition provided in BITs and objective economic criteria to ascertain whether an investment has been established, contrasting it with a mere commercial transaction. In interpreting BIT provisions, tribunals often turn to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, which outlines the general rule for interpreting treaty provisions, taking into consideration the purpose of the BIT and its other provisions. Certain BITs, such as the German Model BIT, employ a broad asset-based definition of investment, encompassing phrases like ‘every kind of asset’, thereby potentially encompassing digital assets as well.\nWhen considering the inclusion of digital assets within the definition of an asset, it is crucial to carefully delineate the concept of digital assets itself. The primary concern regarding digital assets pertains to the data they encapsulate, which holds both intrinsic and extrinsic value. The economic worth of digital assets is intricately linked to their data content, with the value of a digital asset being inherently tied to the data it contains. Intrinsic value pertains to the core data itself, while extrinsic value encompasses additional elements such as customer metadata, which companies often monetize significantly. Furthermore, there exists a symbiotic relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic value, akin to the seeds and flesh of a fruit, respectively. While not all BITs offer a broad definition of investment, it is advisable to establish a clear understanding of digital assets within the context of investment arbitration to mitigate the risk of numerous arbitration claims stemming from uncertainties in this regard.\nApart from the definition of an investment, there are other factors that can affect the inclusion of digital assets under the definition of covered investments, such as economic factors.¹²⁵ If the definition of investment\n¹²⁵ Enikő Horváth and Severin Klinkmüller, ‘The Concept of “Investment” in the Digital Economy: The Case of Social Media Companies’ (2019) 20 JWIT 577, 593.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nprovided under Article 25 (1) ICSID is relied on, digital assets might very well be excluded as a covered investment. Therefore, a broad definition in the BIT would be ideal to bring digital assets within the investment arbitration regime. There are various definitions of investment in BITs which particularly limit the definition of investment by making it mandatory for investments to have some connection with economic factors such as expectations of profits or assumption of risk. For instance, in the case of Romak SA v Uzbekistan, the Tribunal adopted a restrictive approach in interpreting the definition of an investment. It's essential for investment tribunals to recognize that digital companies often operate under long-term business models, where the initial investment is directed towards research and development. These companies may take a considerable period to generate revenue, distinguishing them from single commercial transactions.\nAnother pertinent issue relates to the requirement of a territorial link in various BITs, stipulating that investments must be made within the territory of the host State. Establishing the territorial presence of digital assets poses inherent challenges. Jonathan Bick's categorization of digital assets into possession, location, and control underscores the importance of these factors in establishing a territorial link between the State and the investment. In Abaclat v Argentina, the Tribunal emphasized that the nature of the investment is crucial in determining its location, focusing on how the funds were ultimately utilized rather than where they were initially disbursed. This interpretation helps alleviate some of the challenges in proving digital assets as covered investments.

Since the assumption of control does not imply that the property has been acquired by the government, compensation should be paid under international law, indicating that the owner was deprived of their fundamental right of ownership of the property.¹³³\n## 5.2 Investment Claims in the Age of Cybersecurity\nThe central concern in this context revolves around whether investors can pursue claims against states for cybercrimes.¹³⁴ Studies from 2017 indicate that a single data breach can cost a company up to USD 3.62 million on average. The severity of costs varies depending on factors like the type and volume of data stolen; for instance, the leakage of trade secrets could pose an existential threat to a company. The principle of ‘Fair and Equitable Treatment’ (FET) is pivotal in this regard, as it obliges states to provide investors with essential conditions, potentially enabling investors to lodge claims for cybercrimes.\nTribunals typically assess whether state actions are arbitrary under FET provisions by referencing core principles.¹³⁵ Regarding digital assets, FET claims may challenge alterations in measures related to national cybersecurity. ‘Transparency’ plays a crucial role for investors conducting business in a host state, and states are obligated to maintain transparency. While states have\n¹³¹ Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000) para 98.\n¹³² Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/84/3, Award (1992) para 164.\n¹³³ Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v TAMS-AFFA Consulting, 225 6 IRAN-US CTR 219.\n¹³⁴ Julien Chaisse and Cristen Bauer, ‘Cybersecurity and the Protection of Digital Assets: Assessing the Role of International Investment Law and Arbitration’ (2019) 21 Vand J Ent &amp; Tech L 549, 568.\n¹³⁵ In Glamis Gold Ltd v United States, Award, IIC 380 (2009), it is mentioned that ‘fair and equitable treatment encompasses a universe of “fundamental” principles common throughout the world that include “the duty to act in good faith, due process, transparency and candor, and fairness and protection from arbitrariness’. In MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004), the Tribunal agreed with a legal opinion by Judge Schwebel that fair and equitable treatment encompassed such fundamental standards as good faith, due process, non-discrimination and proportionality.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nthe right to amend laws concerning national cybersecurity to achieve public policy objectives, such changes must not be inconsistent, as demonstrated in the case of PSEG Global v Republic of Turkey.¹³⁶ In this case, Turkey's frequent changes to the law were deemed to create uncertainty for investors, violating FET provisions.\nAnother relevant case involving the implementation of inconsistent policies by a state is MTD Equity v Republic of Chile.¹³⁷ The tribunal ruled that Chile violated FET provisions by adopting contradictory positions with the investor regarding data localization policies. Chile's support for these policies on national security grounds increased costs for foreign investors. Similarly, data localization policies initiated by the Vietnamese government have been challenged by tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Google on economic and human rights grounds. Regarding claims related to Denial of Justice, these typically entail the right to be heard. Such a right is infringed when the cyber legislation of the host state fails to provide effective opportunities for all parties to present their case.\nIn addition to the aforementioned considerations, claims may also arise based on the Full Protection and Security standard (FPS). These claims encompass not only threats from armed rebels but also modern dangers posed by cybercriminals. Cyberattacks can compromise the three primary pillars of security: confidentiality, availability, and integrity. A claim under FPS due to a cyberattack can be sustained if it can be demonstrated that the security assured by the host State extends beyond physical protection. Factors such as the standard liability of the host State and the potential overlap between FPS and FET provisions are also pivotal in determining whether the investment was deprived of legal protection.\nThe definition of investment has evolved over time, and similarly, the application of FPS has expanded. An investor can succeed in their claim even in the absence of a physical attack, as exemplified in the case of Azurix v Argentina,¹³⁸ where the host State was deemed responsible for providing an overall safe environment to investors. Given that digital assets predominantly fall under the category of intangible assets, they can be interpreted to meet the criteria of covered investments, thus availing the protection of FPS provisions in BITs.\n¹³⁶ PSEG Global Inc v Republic of Turkey, ICSID Case No ARB/02/5, Award (2007) paras 248–256.\n¹³⁷ MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Republic of Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004) para 189.\n¹³⁸ Azurix Corp v Argentina, ICSID Case No ARB/01/12, Award (2004) para 408.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n325\nStates are obligated to protect investments, necessitating them to exercise due diligence. In the realm of cybersecurity, a State can fulfill this obligation by ratifying agreements like the Budapest Convention, known for its comprehensive approach to cybercrime cooperation. The lack of protection for investors often stems from a deficiency in international cooperation. Regarding the interplay between FPS and FET, it primarily concerns legal security. Tribunals have ruled that a breach of the FET standard does not necessarily entail a breach of FPS, as seen in cases like Wena Hotels LTD v Egypt¹³⁹ and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v Ecuador.¹⁴⁰\nIn instances where host States lack cyber laws, courts have applied analogical reasoning, drawing from laws related to privacy and theft. However, if domestic courts fail to apply such principles and a void in cybersecurity laws persists, this absence could be deemed a violation of the FPS standard. The FPS standard underscores the State's duty to furnish investors with an adequate legal framework for protection. Intangible assets, if deemed investments under the relevant BIT, can be subject to expropriation, including indirect expropriation resulting in asset depreciation. Addressing these issues requires enhancing the contents of BITs by expanding the definition of investment to encompass digital assets. States must recognize that safeguarding investors from cybercrime not only benefits investors but also preserves the economy and the privacy of citizens, serving the public interest of the host State. Incorporating cyberattacks under the FPS provision in BITs can compel host States to fulfill their obligation and shield investors from cyber threats, which have the potential to devastate companies in an instant. Therefore, it is imperative to prohibit these detrimental criminal actions.\n## 5.3 National Security Exceptions in Investment Law\nVarious international investment agreements incorporate exceptions,¹⁴¹ including those related to national security. This exception grants host States the authority to implement precautionary measures. However, there is considerable debate within the Investor ISDS regime regarding the basis for invoking this national security exception. Some argue that it is a self-judging provision prone to arbitrary use by States, while others contend that it is based on necessity. From the perspective of host countries, national security interests are\n¹³⁹ Wena Hotels LTD v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000).\n¹⁴⁰ Occidental Exploration and Production Company v The Republic of Ecuador, LCIA Case No UN3467 (1976).\n¹⁴¹ Katia Yannaca-Small, 'Essential Security Interests under International Investment Law', in OECD (ed.), International Investment Perspectives: Freedom of Investment in a Changing World (2007).\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\ndeemed significant, both for developed and developing nations. Developed countries often invoke national security interests in response to attempted takeovers of industries, whereas developing countries may do so during economic crises.^^\nHowever, prior to invoking this exception, States should adhere to the requirement of explicit good faith. Regular reviews should be conducted to assess the ongoing necessity of upholding security-related investment restrictions. In the author's view, all these remedies prevent this exception of national security from becoming a mere 'black and white' matter and a different solution should be adopted which can balance the rights of the contracting parties and foreign investors. Hence, the threat to cybersecurity such as cyber-attacks should be covered under the umbrella of national security. By invoking these exceptions, the States are likely to take certain measures to prevent these crimes that would violate the international investment agreements and would be able to justify such measures under existing exceptions.\n## 6 Making the Linkages: Nuclear Proliferation and Cyberattacks\nIn contemporary times, parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation are frequently drawn, owing to the escalating threat that cyberattacks pose to global security and diplomacy.^^ Cybersecurity has transcended local boundaries to become a matter of international concern, impacting peace and security on a global scale. However, existing international law inadequately addresses these cybersecurity threats, necessitating the establishment of more robust and effective regulations. A recent report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) highlighted the strategic risks posed by cyberattacks, underscoring the urgent need for the introduction of a cybersecurity treaty. The international community must recognize and address the risks posed by cybersecurity, analogous to the approach taken with non-proliferation agreements.\nNuclear non-proliferation aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and associated delivery systems, with the overarching goal of averting nuclear conflict or catastrophe in the future. Conversely, cyberattacks encompass malicious attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or valuable data. The proliferation of cyberattacks has raised concerns among financial institutions, corporations, and governments regarding their potential\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n327\nimpact on financial and economic systems, prioritizing cyber risk alongside geopolitical and economic risks.¹⁴⁴\nAs technology becomes increasingly integral to government, institutional, and personal operations, parallels between nuclear and cyber threats become apparent. For instance, the NC3 systems of nuclear-armed governments heavily rely on digital processors and computers, rendering them vulnerable to hacking and cyberattacks. Moreover, the nuclear force infrastructure encompasses weapons, launch sites, and command authorities interconnected through communication and data processing technologies, facilitating cyber vulnerabilities. Despite the reluctance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to address the convergence of nuclear and cyber threats, scholars and non-governmental experts have extensively documented their interactions. Without stronger protections against cyberattacks and illegal hacking, the realm of nuclear weapons and security remains susceptible to exploitation.\n## 6.1 Comparative Analysis of Legal Frameworks\nEfforts in nuclear non-proliferation have spanned approximately fifty years, originating in the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. The earliest initiatives began within the UN, with Article 11(1) of the UN Charter emphasizing the preservation of international peace and security.¹⁴⁵ A significant development during this period was the conclusion of the Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) in 1963,¹⁴⁶ although some countries abstained from signing due to perceived weaknesses in its provisions, notably the absence of international control mechanisms or spot inspections.¹⁴⁷\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis highlighted the need for a comprehensive framework to address nuclear proliferation. Consequently, the NPT was signed in 1968 by 62 countries, including nuclear weapon states like the US. Notably, China and France refrained from signing initially. The NPT came\n¹⁴⁴ Stéphane Lhuissier and Fabien Tripier, *A Measure of the Evolution of Cyber Risk* (17 December 2021) <https: blog-entry=\"\" blocnotesdeleco.banque-france.fr=\"\" measure-evolution-cyber-risk=\"\" en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n¹⁴⁵ Then, in 1946, the Atomic Energy Commission was set up to recommend measures for controlling atomic energy. In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was created with the goal of promoting and overseeing to promote and oversee the peaceful use of nuclear technology.\n¹⁴⁶ The PTBT can be viewed as the first global and formal attempt towards non-proliferation. At first, the Treaty was only ratified by the USSR, the US, and the UK.\n¹⁴⁷ For instance, China conducted Project 596 in 1964, which was its first atom bomb test. Due to its relatively small audience, and the fact that even its signatories continued to defy it, the PTBT was largely a failure.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nQIAN\ninto force in 1970, categorizing countries into nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states,¹⁴⁸ with the former defined as those that conducted nuclear tests before January 1967. Subsequent developments included the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, such as the Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America, and agreements like the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT-I) between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.¹⁴⁹\nFollowing the end of the Cold War in 1991, efforts in non-proliferation intensified, with particular focus on strengthening the NPT. The revelation of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program after the Gulf War prompted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to introduce the Model Additional Protocol, enhancing its access to information and nuclear facilities. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 1996 marked a significant milestone, prohibiting all nuclear explosions and providing for on-site inspections and confidence-building measures.\nIn recent years, cybercrime and cyberattacks have emerged as significant threats to international security, paralleling the concerns posed by nuclear proliferation in the past. Analogous to the NPT for nuclear issues, there is a growing need for a comprehensive treaty addressing cybercrime, regulation of the internet, and law enforcement procedures for cross-border investigations. These issues carry profound implications for human rights, economic systems, and national security. International cooperation is crucial in developing effective regulatory frameworks for cyberspace,¹⁵⁰ fostering confidence among stakeholders and ensuring a secure digital environment.\n## 6.2 Lessons from Nuclear Law for Cyber Regulation\nThe NPT is a three-part global pact intended at restricting the spread of nuclear weapons: (1) non-proliferation, (2) disarmament, and (3) peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The basic tenets of the treaty include the principle that nuclear weapons will not be acquired by States that do not have them, nuclear-weapon States will pursue disarmament, and all States have access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes under safeguards.\nAccording to Article IX of the NPT, 'nuclear weapon states (NWS)' are those that have detonated a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967,\n¹⁴⁸ Following suit, states of the South Pacific established an NWFZ in 1985, Southeast Asia in 1995, Africa in 1996, and Central Asia in 2006.\n¹⁴⁹ Seven years later, SALT-I was followed up by the signing of SALT-II by these two nations, which further limited their nuclear capabilities.\n¹⁵⁰ Deborah Brown, 'Cybercrime is Dangerous, But a New UN Treaty Could Be Worse for Rights' (13 August 2021) <https: 08=\"\" 13=\"\" 2021=\"\" cybercrime-dangerous-new-un-treaty-could-be-worse-rights=\"\" news=\"\" www.hrw.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n329\nwhich includes China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These nuclear-weapon States are prohibited from transferring nuclear weapons to any recipient and from assisting, encouraging, or inducing any non-NWS to produce or acquire them. Non-nuclear weapons nations are similarly prohibited from receiving or manufacturing nuclear weapons from any source.¹⁵¹ Additionally, the Treaty mandates that all Parties must pursue talks on effective measures for nuclear disarmament and a treaty on general and comprehensive disarmament under international control. States retain the right to develop, produce, and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, provided such activities comply with the treaty's non-proliferation provisions. Moreover, the NPT allows groups of nations to enter into regional agreements to ensure the absence of nuclear weapons on their respective territories, known as nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties. The treaty also establishes mechanisms for periodic review and assessment of its implementation, as outlined in Article VIII.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) supplements the NPT and includes a Protocol detailing the International Monitoring System (IMS), On-Site Inspections (OSI), and Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs). The CTBT prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, with provisions for redressing violations, ensuring compliance, and periodic review of its effectiveness.\nPresident John F. Kennedy's infamous fear in the 1960s, that 20 or perhaps 30 'Nuclear-Weapon States (NWSs)' would arise within a decade, did not come true. The number of nuclear powers or governments with active nuclear weapons programmes remains at ten even now. The NPT recognises five of them as lawful nuclear weapons possessors, which corresponds to the permanent five members of the 'UN Security Council (UNSC)'. Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are all said to have nuclear weapons or have demonstrated it through testing. Iran has long been accused of pursuing a zealous nuclear weapons development. In contrast, no less than 26 governments have renounced or been forced to abandon their pursuit of nuclear weapons, having completed feasibility studies, targeted weapon research or even development, or manufactured nuclear weapons (or inherited them following the collapse of the Soviet Union). Almost the whole phalanx of middle powers is made\n¹⁵¹ There are gaps in the current treaty framework. Firstly, there is the issue of countries like India, Pakistan, and Israel not joining the NPT. This leads to a significant amount of unsafeguarded nuclear activity. Another concern is that countries signatory may develop nuclear fuel cycle facilities and then subsequently opt-out of the Treaty as North Korea did. To avoid this, stronger and more regular inspection measures need to be enforced within the Treaty mechanism, with the aid of international bodies.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333\nQIAN\nup of these countries. When one considers that the CTBT names out 44 'nuclear capable' governments whose ratification is necessary before the treaty can be implemented, the miracle of non-proliferation becomes even greater. By comparing the 'before' and 'after,' we may obtain a sense of the consequences of international norms. The vast majority of 'nuclear aspirants' began their nuclear programmes before the NPT was signed. After the NPT was opened for signing, only Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, and (perhaps) Syria developed their programmes. Surprisingly, none of these nations were democracies at the time the pact was drafted. On the contrary, the vast majority of 'renouncers' halted their programmes during or after the discussions. As a result, for most of them, the NPT signified the line beyond which nuclear weapons ambitions lost their legitimacy.\nThe reliance of nuclear-armed governments, including the US, on computerized Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems underscores a critical vulnerability. These systems, integral to every aspect of nuclear force management, operate within cyberspace, making them susceptible to hacking and cyberattacks. NC3 systems encompass a network of communication and data-processing technologies linking weapons, radar systems, launch sites, and senior authorities responsible for nuclear decision-making. Despite extensive cybersecurity measures, the complexity and diversity of these systems render them inherently vulnerable, with numerous potential points of attack. Moreover, emerging technologies such as cyber capabilities, hypersonics, and encryption have the dual potential of exacerbating conflicts within the framework of the NPT while also offering avenues for achieving its objectives. While the NPT has been slow to address these evolving challenges, academia and non-governmental organizations have extensively studied their implications for nuclear issues. However, there remains a significant gap between civil society's engagement with emerging technologies and their integration into the NPT framework.\nGiven its role as both a treaty and a forum, the NPT holds particular importance in addressing these challenges. States parties to the NPT have legal obligations regarding nuclear technology proliferation, making it essential\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333\nto consider the impact of emerging technologies on treaty compliance and verification. The NPT review process provides a unique opportunity for nuclear‐possessor and non‐possessor states to discuss and address a wide range of issues affecting nuclear order and treaty obligations. In light of these considerations, emerging technologies should be incorporated into all nuclear and non‐nuclear disarmament agreements, including the CTBT, the Conference on Disarmament (CD), and nuclear‐weapon‐free zones. However, the NPT, with its comprehensive legal framework and review mechanism, stands as a pivotal platform for addressing the challenges posed by emerging technologies to nuclear disarmament and non‐proliferation efforts.\nEdward Ifft highlights the CTBT innovative approach to addressing the challenge of unequal capacity among State parties to collect and evaluate data about compliance. The treaty establishes an IMS, comprising 337 globally distributed sites equipped with seismic, radionuclide, hydroacoustic, and infrared sensors. Ifft suggests that most States lack the resources to independently acquire and analyze this data. However, individual State parties can access professional technical analysis of IMS data and other relevant information free of charge from an international data center in Vienna. Drawing on the collaborative IMS model proposed by the CTBT, Ifft proposes the development of a Joint Attribution Mechanism (JAM) to assist nations with limited cyber forensic capabilities in collecting and analyzing data for attribution purposes. Such a mechanism could serve as a cost‐effective solution, encouraging nations to participate in a cyber treaty. Additionally, a JAM would enhance the credibility and legitimacy of the attribution process for nations with advanced cyber forensic capabilities. Ensuring reliable attribution is essential, but it is equally important to establish consistent consequences for cyber aggressors. This highlights the need for effective mechanisms to punish those responsible for cyberattacks consistently.\n## Conclusion\nThis article underscores the profound complexities and pressing challenges in the domain of cybersecurity, especially when viewed through the prism of international law. The pernicious implications of cyberattacks are ever more pertinent in an era increasingly dominated by digital data and connectivity. While the international community grapples with defining and responding to these cyber threats, our existing legal frameworks, rooted in conventional\nphysical paradigms, are inadequately equipped to address this novel form of virtual aggression.\nThe current structure of international law does not encapsulate an all-encompassing definition of cyberattacks, making it a precarious space in need of robust codification. The disruption wrought by cyberattacks on WTO agreements is even more deleterious, given the outdated security exceptions that remain unresponsive to risk-based cybersecurity measures. Moreover, the burgeoning surge in FDIs in digital assets, primarily intangible, exposes another lacuna in international law, conspicuously absent in contemporary investment treaties. These considerations underscore an imminent need to institute measures to mitigate the manifold issues arising from cyberattacks.\nPublic international law must evolve to address the specific nuances of cyberattacks and the consequent implications on State sovereignty, transborder crime, and national security. The ascendance of cyber aggression necessitates a re-examination of the fundamental tenets of international law, including the principles of Jus Ad Bellum and Jus In Bello, with a more nuanced lens. The complexities of attribution and the abstract nature of cyber warfare necessitate a shift in how we perceive sovereignty and territoriality in the digital age.\nIn the sphere of WTO law, the advent of cyber threats and the expansion of digital economies call for a revamp of trade rules and exceptions. It is crucial to establish a harmonized understanding of cybersecurity risks and potential countermeasures, with a balanced approach to cyber governance and free trade. Thus, a common vision is the need of the hour to work in collaboration internationally for ensuring cybersecurity and keeping cybercrimes at bay. The establishment of the Trade and Technology Council by the United States and the European Union represents a promising development in the quest for global consensus on trade and technology issues. This initiative holds the potential to facilitate increased collaboration and the harmonization of regulations across international borders.\nFinally, as cyberattacks increasingly target financial assets and systems, the role of investment law becomes paramount. The rise of data-driven businesses necessitates safeguarding digital assets and investments, requiring innovative legal mechanisms such as ‘digital-ready' BITs. Re-envisioning BITs to include digital assets, whilst establishing the scope of security provisions under the FET clause, can address potential investment claims from cyber risks. This would balance the need for a stable investment environment with the protection of digital assets, thereby fostering confidence amongst investors in the digital era.\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n333\nConclusively, the international legal community faces the arduous task of negotiating the fine line between national security, economic prosperity, and individual rights in the realm of cyberspace. As we stride further into the digital era, there is an urgent necessity for a comprehensive and balanced global legal framework to govern cybersecurity. Through learning from and building upon existing mechanisms such as nuclear non-proliferation treaties, we can forge a path towards establishing robust, comprehensive international rules to regulate cyberattacks. This challenge, albeit monumental, is imperative for the security and prosperity of nations in the evolving digital landscape.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333"

The article adopts a multidisciplinary approach, integrating legal theory, international relations, and cyber law to analyze how digital security issues intersect with global economic transactions. Utilizing doctrinal legal analysis, the article delves into international treaties, case law, and policy documents, while a comparative method highlights variances and similarities across jurisdictions. The article identifies significant gaps in existing international legal frameworks that are ill-equipped to address the complexities and nuances of the digital age. It advocates for comprehensive legal reforms, encompassing cyber warfare, digital trade, and cross-border investments. The objective is to align international law with the digital era's realities, effectively balancing national security, economic growth, and individual rights in a globally interconnected environment. This article not only uncovers critical shortcomings in current legal structures but also proposes forward-looking legal strategies, essential for tackling emerging challenges at the cybersecurity, trade, and investment nexus.

This practice is crucial as it helps in preserving and maintaining the integrity or privacy of data.\nThe 'International Organization for Standardization (ISO)' and 'International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)', in ISO/ERC 27000 (Information ¹ O A Hathaway and others, 'The Law of Cyber-Attack' (2012) 100 (4) Cal L Rev 817.

Furthermore, an act of this magnitude could also be conducted by the State or an independent criminal.⁶ Cyberattacks can be analyzed through four primary criteria. Firstly, they possess the capacity to manipulate, destroy, or exfiltrate data, rendering them inherently disruptive and unpredictable. Their origin may be domestic or foreign, introducing complexities in attribution. Secondly, the nature of the perpetrator varies, ranging from individual criminals to organized groups or entities. Thirdly, the impact of cyberattacks is predominantly virtual, encompassing data loss or manipulation, which significantly diminishes the affected data’s commercial value. Moreover, attacks on critical infrastructure can precipitate severe disruptions to essential services. Lastly, the attribution of cyberattacks to state actors presents challenges, necessitating substantial evidence to establish ⁴ IBM Services, ‘What is a Cyber-attack?’ (IBM, 11 November 2020) <www.ibm.com by-services=\"\"business-continuity=\"\"cyberattack#:~:text=\"The%20most%20well%2Dknown%20type,malware%20may%20not%20be%20immediate\"in-en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.

There are several definitions produced by scholars, research organizations, and private enterprises. However, there is a need for a uniform/consensual legal definition to the term cyberattacks. Two definitions are frequently cited. The National Institute of Standards and Technology–Computer Security Resource Center: defines cyberattack as ‘[a]n attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information’. Secondly, the National Research Council’s Committee on Offensive Information Warfare defines cyber-attacks as ‘[e]fforts to alter, disrupt, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information or programs on them’.

For instance, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack attributed to the 'Guardians of Peace' raised suspicions of North Korean involvement, yet conclusive evidence remained elusive.\nThere is a major concern if these attacks can be attributed to a State;[7] such State attributable attacks would be considered, by virtue of 'Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter,' to be a volatile use of force.[8] The sovereignty of a State is transgressed when it falls prey to such attacks.[9] Attribution in cyberattacks poses significant challenges beyond simply identifying the responsible actor. Key issues include the lack of consensus on the required standards of proof, the debate over whether attributions should be made publicly or kept confidential, and the ambiguity surrounding the legal consequences of successful attribution. Additionally, while public attributions can serve purposes such as deterring future attacks and holding perpetrators accountable, they may also escalate tensions and risk revealing sensitive intelligence sources.[10] There might be a notable loss of information or reduction in its value which could pose significant threats to the economy and national security.[11] Due to their inherent characteristics, cyberattacks present a global challenge.

Consequently, there is burgeoning discourse surrounding the development of a cybersecurity treaty, paralleling established frameworks for managing other forms of strategic risk. However, crafting effective agreements necessitates a nuanced understanding of cyber incident typologies and their respective implications. Organizations such as the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) advocate for a comprehensive consideration of strategic risks inherent in cyber capabilities.¹⁵ Thus, addressing cyber threats mandates the formulation of holistic frameworks that reconcile national sovereignty, security imperatives, and international cooperation mandates.¹⁶ This article draws upon theoretical foundations from international law, comparative law, and international relations to provide a thorough examination of the pressing issue of cyberattacks. Its conceptual framework illuminates the potential interpretation and development of international legal norms, compares distinct yet interconnected areas, and explores the broader geopolitical dimensions of this global challenge. By analyzing fundamental principles of international law – such as state sovereignty, the use of force, and state responsibility – within the context of cyber operations, the article raises critical questions about their applicability to emerging cyber realities. Furthermore, it employs comparative legal analysis to draw parallels between legal frameworks governing nuclear non-proliferation and potential cybersecurity frameworks, highlighting the importance of adapting existing legal mechanisms to address new challenges. Additionally, the article considers the roles of both state and non-state actors in cybercrimes and examines the geopolitical implications of attributing cyberattacks to states.\nThis article establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the challenges posed by cyberattacks and the ongoing pursuit of bolstered cybersecurity ¹² Marc Barrachin and Algirde Pipikaite, ‘We Need a Global Standard for Reporting Cyber Attacks’ (Harv Bus Rev, 8 November 2019) <https: 11=\"\"2019=\"\"hbr.org=\"\"we-need-a-global-standard-for-reporting-cyber-attacks=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n¹³ United Nations General Assembly Res 64/211, ‘Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity and Taking Stock of National Efforts to Protect Critical Information Infrastructures’ (17 March 2010) UN Doc A/RES/64/211.\n¹⁴ See Barrachin and Pipikaite (n 12).\n¹⁵ See Martha Finnermore and Duncan B Hollis, ‘Constructing Norms for Global Cybersecurity’ (2016) 110 AJIL 425.\n¹⁶ M Wohfeld and J Jasper, ‘Cyberattacks and Cyber Conflict: Where Is Conflict Resolution?’, in O Grech (ed), Contemporary Issues in Conflict Resolution (University of Malta 2018), 5–17.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:> QIAN within the domain of public international law. While clarity within general international law remains scarce, valuable insights can be gleaned from existing legal frameworks in international economic realms, such as international trade and investment law. The emergence of the cyber realm has introduced contemporary issues that challenge established norms and rules of international law, necessitating examination in terms of interpretation, application, and structure. Cyberattacks transcend mere technological phenomena, fundamentally reshaping traditional societal paradigms including concepts of capital[17] and warfare.[18] The article probes the adequacy of existing international legal and economic rules in defining cyberattacks and delineating breaches of established norms. It critically examines the efficacy of international law in regulating cyberattacks, recognizing the inherent complexities in defining and addressing such incidents. The article offers a nuanced definition of cyberattacks, recognizing their intricate nature that defies simple conceptualization. It contends that cyberattacks represent a modern manifestation of acts of war, a concept deeply rooted in international legal discourse spanning millennia. Exploring potential solutions, the article investigates the role of international economic law in mitigating cyber threats, particularly in safeguarding global data flows integral to contemporary globalization processes. Moreover, it delves into the potential applicability of investment treaties in regulating digital assets and scrutinizes existing parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation.[19] By examining how nuclear non-proliferation treaties serve as a precedent, the article explores the feasibility of developing a comprehensive set of international rules to govern cyberattacks, thereby addressing critical gaps in current regulatory frameworks.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333 REDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS A cyberattack is any kind of malicious action aimed at obtaining unlawful access to information technology systems including the resources or valuable information of their users that they may encompass. Cyberattacks hit businesses every day, particularly targeting critical infrastructure, trade secrets, and intellectual property with commercial value, and other online information.²⁰ Cyberattacks can peculiarly break into the defence²¹ systems²² which include defense capabilities and private military suppliers²³ and can gravely threaten the security of the nation. Its effect on the economy cannot be ignored, especially in the case of the United States where approximately 90% of critical infrastructure is possessed by the private sector, and companies do not see any specific reason for investing in cybersecurity to secure public interest.²⁴ By refusing to invest in cybersecurity, the private sector increases the exposure of the whole economy and society to cyber threats. The risk of cyberattacks that have the potential to cause large-scale shutdowns and huge amounts of other material harms are amplified by the digital transformation of the infrastructure of various sectors.²⁵ Moreover, ‘information technology (IT)’, connected devices, cyber-physical systems, and industrial control systems are all potential JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:> QIAN attack vectors²⁶ of critical infrastructure.²⁷ The threat of cyber espionage is known²⁸ and it²⁹ may be centered on theft via access to cloud-based data platforms and malicious software. Finally, there exists a two-fold risk in the cyber-espionage area. First, any unauthorized person may access and steal sensitive personal information. Second, existing information may be altered to create a façade and disseminate fake news to the larger public.³⁰ Furthermore, a major source of deceptive information and malicious publication could perhaps be, deep fake videos generated by ‘Artificial Intelligence (AI)’.³¹ In the context of the growing importance of a data-driven economy for national economic progress, effective data governance emerges as a critical aspect of governance.³² Governments are increasingly prioritizing data governance and implementing measures to safeguard the digital economy against cyber threats. These measures include implementing export limitations and restricting foreign government access to national technology.³³ One of the most significant and concerning cyberattacks targeted the US Government, its agencies, and numerous private companies – the ‘SolarWinds hack.’³⁴ JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:> REDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\n## 2.1 The Ambiguity of 'Cyberattack' within International Law\nDespite the pervasive phenomenon of cyberattacks in our increasingly interconnected contemporary society, where organisations are transitioning their operations and data storage to online platforms, international law remains ambivalent, lacking a precise and universally accepted legal definition for the term 'cyberattack'. This omission underscores a critical gap, especially as the digital realm continues to be a significant frontier for both commerce and potential conflict.³⁶ The degree of digitization of economic activities is generally linked to the tendency of experiencing cyberattacks. A recent measure by the Indian government is the 'Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)' project. The process involves a biometric ID that assigns to each individual, a 12-digit number. It further requires, storing 10 fingerprints, iris scans and other necessary details such as names, addresses and date of birth to be recorded in the eGovernance cloud platform. Consequently, the practice involves an increased cybersecurity concern among the individuals, private organisations and the government agencies. In the absence of indigenous cybersecurity technology and patents in the nation, India's government has declared that it will be providing monetary incentives to Indian enterprises who acquire foreign firms with cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies.³⁷ Perhaps worse, most of these threats have targeted small-scale industries that do not have the requisite means, instruments, or techniques to protect themselves and their business interests. Maintenance of cybersecurity is getting harder every year as cybercriminals continuously pose new threats, leverage new bugs, and carry out new sophisticated attacks; whilst regulatory institutions are still evolving and enhancing their standards.\n³⁵ 'Scope of Russian Hacking Becomes Clear: Multiple U.S. Agencies Were Hit' (The New York Times, 14 December 2020), <https: 12=\"\" 14=\"\" 2020=\"\" politics=\"\" us=\"\" politics=\"\" rus=\"\" sia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n³⁶ Brett Van Niekerk, 'Suppression of Cyber-defences', IST-Africa Week Conference, Durban, 2016.

Projections by Cybersecurity Ventures suggest a dramatic rise in global cybercrime costs, with estimates indicating a potential annual total of USD 10.5 trillion by 2025, marking a considerable increase from USD 3 trillion in 2015.³⁸ These figures underscore the immense economic impact of cybercrime, surpassing damages caused by natural disasters and even exceeding the collective value of significant illegal drug trades worldwide. Such crimes represent a substantial economic transfer globally, impeding innovation and investment.³⁹ While no sector is immune to cyber threats, the financial services industry stands out as particularly vulnerable. The 2020 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report highlights financial organizations⁴⁰ as the most heavily targeted sector, followed by healthcare and public administration, respectively.⁴¹\nThere has been no global consensus on the definition of cybersecurity. However, it has been defined by the International Telecommunication Union as 'a set of tools, policies, safeguards, and technologies that can protect the cyber environment and the assets of an organization or user.'⁴² Cybersecurity, therefore, seeks to protect and maintain the digital assets security of the organization or the user against the risks involved in the cyber environment. The approach offered by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) presents an intriguing perspective on cyberattacks. NIST's framework does not differentiate between state-sponsored actions and criminal activities, nor does it consider the distinct impact of cyber incidents on public versus private records, networks, and facilities. While prioritizing the integrity of information and information networks, NIST's framework fails to encompass broader societal goals such as national market growth, law enforcement access\n³⁸ Steve Morgan, 'Cybercrime to Cost the World $10.5 Trillion Annually By 2025' (Cybercrime Magazine, 13 November 2020) <https: cybersecurityventures.com=\"\" hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n³⁹ Brian Cashell and others, 'The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attack' (United States Congressional Research Service, 1 April 2004) <https: ras.org=\"\" rl32331.pdf=\"\" sgp=\"\" crs=\"\" misc=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n⁴⁰ Kenning Arlitsch and Adam Edelman, 'Staying Safe: Cyber Security for People and Organizations' (2014) 54 J Libr Admin 46.\n⁴¹ '2020 Data Breach Investigation Report'  <https: 2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf=\"\" enterprise.verizon.com=\"\" resources=\"\" reports=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023; the Public Administration sector manages with the administration of local, state and federal government.\n⁴² International Telecommunication Union, 'Overview of Cybersecurity: Recommendation ITU-T X.1205' (ITU-T, 4 August 2008) <https: rec=\"\" t-rec-x.1205-200804-i=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:></https:>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nAn alternative legal definition proposed by the United States National Research Council defines cyberattacks as purposeful actions aimed at altering, disrupting, deceiving, degrading, or destroying computer systems, networks, or the information and programs within them.43 While this definition offers rationality, it also highlights ambiguity, particularly in differentiating between basic cybercrimes and cyberattacks. This lack of clarity may lead to inconsistencies within the legal framework, hindering effective coordination among agencies.\n## 2.2 International Responses and Legal Implications The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has introduced the Cyber Norms Index to monitor and compare significant achievements in negotiating and establishing norms for governmental actions in cyberspace. This index aids policymakers and observers in analyzing proposals for cyber norms, tracking their development, and assessing their uniform adoption by members of the global community. Users can utilize the index to examine multilateral outcomes and compare information using various groups or keywords. Additionally, there has been a widespread call for norms aimed at immunizing and stabilizing cyberspace.44 CSO Online45 has curated a list of JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</http:> QIAN notable 21st-century security breaches, employing simple metrics such as the number of affected consumers and distinguishing between breaches resulting from malicious intent and those caused by accidental exposure.⁴⁶ One notable breach involved theft of encrypted consumer payment information from Adobe's systems,⁴⁷ affecting approximately 3 million customers, with login data manipulation for an unspecified number of users.⁴⁸ More recently, Canva, an Australian web design app, experienced a significant breach compromising sensitive information of over 100 million consumers.⁴⁹ Another prominent breach occurred in 2016 when Yahoo reported what is described as the largest privacy breach in history,⁵⁰ compromising sensitive data of nearly five million users, including unauthorized access to full names, email addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers.⁵¹ Both the private sector and governmental agencies are susceptible to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by various incidents. In February 2020, the US Department of Justice apprehended two Chinese citizens for allegedly laundering bitcoin on behalf of North Korean attackers.⁵² Similarly, the Mexican JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333 REDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS Among the most recent and significant cyberattacks is the SolarWinds breach. SolarWinds, a prominent US information technology company, fell victim to a cyberattack that went undetected for months,55 affecting its customers. US authorities suspect Russian hackers to be behind the attack, which targeted not the federal government or a private organization's network directly, but a third-party technology provider. This tactic, known as a 'Supply Chain' attack, exploited vulnerabilities in SolarWinds' Orion IT management tools, compromising high-ranking departments of the US government, including the Department of Homeland Security and Treasury, as well as private enterprises like FireEye.\n## 2.3 Cyber-Attacks on the Upswing: Risk for Worsening Hacking groups and state-sponsored organizations have discovered that cyber-attacks are an effective weapon for balancing the playing field with rivals. The convergence of an attacker threat is highly risky and an expensive danger of insider manipulation or theft of intellectual property has generated a precarious environment in the private sector.56 While employee incompetence and human errors contribute to organizational vulnerabilities, recent years have witnessed a notable surge in attacks by malicious actors with access to sensitive business information. The global cybersecurity landscape is fraught with concerns regarding the likelihood of financial losses, misappropriation of classified data, and disruptions to critical infrastructure. The escalating scale and complexity of cyberattacks have not only heightened the risk of being caught off guard but have also increased the costs associated with preventing and recovering from such incidents.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.reuters.com> QIAN Despite media attention being drawn to high-profile cyberattacks targeting large corporations like Target, Netflix, and financial institutions such as JP Morgan, it is small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that remain the most vulnerable.[57] Industry analysts estimate that up to $60\\%$ of SMEs may face collapse within six months due to cyberattacks, ranging from phishing scams to ransomware assaults.[58] China's initiative to develop digital infrastructure, known as the 'Digital Silk Road,' alongside its traditional infrastructure projects, aims to enhance international connectivity in terms of communication and data flow.[59] This digital complement to the land-based 'Silk Road Economic Belt' and the 'Twenty-First Century Maritime Silk Road' seeks to bolster capacity for the exchange of goods.[60] In light of these developments, states reliant on global interactions must prioritize the development of credible policies on cross-border data flow. As nations seek to thrive in the post-COVID-19 era and compete in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, facilitating cross-border data flow is imperative. Several governments have already issued warnings about the potential for large-scale cyber assaults, exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to lure individuals and companies into divulging personal and financial data.\n# 3 Paradigm Shift in Public International Law: Cyberattack as an Act of War The world is rapidly transitioning towards intensive digitalization, a trend that has been ongoing for years but has recently accelerated unexpectedly.[61] The JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333 REDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS Defining a cyberattack poses challenges, but it is widely accepted that such attacks aim to undermine or disrupt the function of a computer network.⁶⁶ The growing reliance on technology makes nations vulnerable to cyber threats, with many ill-equipped to handle serious cyber incidents.⁶⁷ Cyberattacks can have severe ramifications beyond the virtual realm, prompting states to focus on securing critical infrastructure and bolstering cybersecurity measures. Unlike traditional forms of warfare, cyberattacks occur in the digital domain but can have equally devastating consequences in the physical world.⁶⁸ Recent incidents, such as the SolarWinds attacks, highlight the surprise element inherent in cyber warfare.

Historically, such acts encompassed a wide range of actions, including unfriendly economic or commercial measures and actions that insulted a nation's pride.⁷⁰ However, rapid technological advancements have challenged this traditional concept, rendering established legal categories inadequate to regulate contemporary activities.⁷¹ In the context of cyberspace, clarifying the concept of *casus belli* serves to provide a clear standard against which states can assess their behavior and that of others when initiating or responding to cyberattacks.⁷² Traditional theories of *casus belli*, often emphasizing the violent and aggressive nature of armed operations, may not directly apply to cyberattacks due to their non-physical nature. Nevertheless, cyberattacks can be viewed as potential triggers for war if they cause substantial physical damage to the target's computer systems. While a destructive attack on computer systems by a nation-state may not necessarily constitute a *casus belli*, a significant strike solely targeting computer systems could potentially justify a defensive military response.⁷³ Classifying cyber assaults, such as computer intrusions or communication disruptions, presents significant challenges. For instance, while both data breaches and attacks on air traffic control systems are invasive, the latter could result in greater damage and loss of life, potentially constituting an 'armed attack' rather than mere data theft. Additionally, attacks causing significant harm, regardless of the level of intrusion, may qualify as 'armed attacks.' Large-scale cyberattacks have the potential to incapacitate an opponent's ability to wage war effectively, surpassing the impact of traditional kinetic attacks. Such attacks can disrupt vital functions such as leadership, communication, ⁶⁹ Hannah Herbst, 'Cyber Attacks &amp; Modern Warfare' (*Denver J Intl L Pol*, 8 April 2020) <http: djilp.org=\"\"cyber-attacks-modern-warfare=\"\"></http:> accessed 25 November 2023.\n⁷⁰ Colonel Charles J Dunlap, Jr, 'International Law and Terrorism' <http: dunlapterrorism.pdf=\"\"people.duke.edu=\"\"~pfeaver=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n⁷¹ Lawrence T Greenberg and others, *Information Warfare and International Law* (DOD Command Command and Control Research Program 1998).\n⁷² Charles C Poché, 'This Means War!

Consequently, cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure should be regarded as legitimate grounds for declaring a casus belli.\n## 3.2 Conceptualizing Cyber-Operation as Use of force The United Nations (UN) Charter, a foundational document governing the use of force (*Jus Ad Bellum*), outlines in Article 2(4)⁷⁴ that Member States must refrain from threatening or using force to undermine the territorial sovereignty or political independence of another state, unless justified by self-defense or authorized by the UN Security Council. Determining whether a cyberattack violates this prohibition requires an understanding of how ‘force’ is interpreted in international law and whether cyberattacks meet the criteria set out by these standards.⁷⁵ A narrow interpretation of ‘force’ is recommended, aligning with the objectives outlined in the UN Charter’s preamble to maintain international peace and security and prevent war.⁷⁶ However, the Charter does not exhaustively address all aspects of force regulation, and further guidance is sought from customary international law, as noted by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).⁷⁷ Offensive cyber capabilities, such as implanting harmful code into computer networks, share similarities with traditional military actions, economic coercion, and subversion.⁷⁸ The effects of cyberattacks can range from temporary disruptions, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, to severe physical damage and loss of life, such as disrupting emergency networks for first responders.\nCategorizing all cyberattacks as a ‘use of force’ under Article 2(4) would require an exceptionally broad interpretation.⁷⁹ The Tallinn Manual on Cyber Warfare suggests that cyberattacks with tangible consequences in the physical ⁷⁴ UN Charter Art 2, para 4.\n⁷⁵ Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ (2012) 30 Berkeley J Intl L 525.

The Tallinn Manual outlines criteria including severity, spontaneity, directness, intrusiveness, quantification, and presumptive legitimacy to evaluate cyberattack consequences against those of conventional attacks.⁸¹ If a cyberattack exhibits sufficient resemblance to these criteria, broadening the prohibition on force is warranted.⁸² Despite the United States' emphasis on consequences over methodology, modern society's heavy reliance on computer systems raises concerns about incapacitating physical infrastructure without tangible destruction.⁸³ The SolarWinds incident underscores the importance of characterizing cyberattacks as casus belli. SolarWinds, a company serving a vast clientele including major US government agencies, fell victim to cyber-attacks that compromised the integrity of their data. While some argue these attacks do not meet the casus belli threshold and constitute espionage,⁸⁴ distinguishing between cyber-attacks and espionage remains challenging. Responses to cyber espionage must be strategized akin to other cyberattacks, especially in cases like supply chain attacks, where damage control may overshadow the actors' intent.⁸⁵ While cyber espionage typically does not warrant casus belli, it may do so if aimed at undermining a state's political and social institutions.⁸⁶ The intertwining of espionage and operational access in incidents like SolarWinds raises concerns about latent vulnerabilities and potential future attacks of unprecedented magnitude.

In the context of cyberattacks, ensuring proportionality requires a nuanced understanding of technical intricacies. For example, a cyber response coded into software demands extensive knowledge of potential targets, often obtained through conventional cyber exploitation methods.94 The Office of the Attorney General of California defined cyber exploitation as 'the non-consensual distribution or publication of intimate photos or videos\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333 QIAN online'.95 Cyber exploitation hurts the privacy of an individual and public safety by publishing photos or videos without appropriate consent.\nHence, for the fulfilment of the principle of necessity, it is essential that all the other remedies that do not involve such a use of force have been proven futile or have been exhausted, without success.96 According to the authors of The Tallinn Manual, the availability, or lack thereof, of accessible options that do not rise to the level of use of force is the key to doing a 'necessity analysis' in the cyber realm.97 If a State's military computer networks are breached as a result of a cyber-attack, it may take some time for the State to retaliate using cyber or kinetic means.98 When there is no other feasible choice and the assault is real and imminent, the victim state may invoke self-defense to justify reasonable, necessary, and proportional safeguards to maintain its security.99 ## 4 Global Data Flow and the Transformation of International Trade: Issues and Challenges for Trade Law The growing digital trade landscape has heightened concerns regarding cybersecurity within the international rules-based trading system. Prior to the establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, bilateral trade was seen as beneficial for increasing demand for local products and improving living standards.100 However, the implementation of GATT and subsequent efforts to regulate and harmonize international trade introduced complexities, particularly regarding the interpretation of terms like non-state actors, terrorism, the environment, and cybersecurity measures at the domestic and international levels.101 During Ministerial Conference 11 in 2017, 71 World Trade Organization (WTO) members, both developed and developing, issued a Joint Statement on Electronic Commerce, expressing their commitment to exploring future negotiations on the trade-related aspects of electronic commerce. Currently, negotiations involve 90 WTO members, with The Gambia JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333 REDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS being the latest addition. An updated negotiation text from November 2023, under Section C, addresses cybersecurity. It emphasizes the evolving nature of cyber threats and outlines measures for member states to enhance cybersecurity capabilities. These measures include building the capabilities of national entities responsible for cybersecurity incident response, collaborating to identify and mitigate malicious intrusions or dissemination of malicious code affecting electronic networks, addressing cybercrime, and sharing information for awareness and best practices.¹⁰² ## 4.1 Legal Pitfalls in the Context of Digital Trade In the sphere of international trade, cybersecurity measures are employed to address illegal data breaches by non-state actors that affect legitimate trading activities among WTO Member States. However, the cybersecurity countermeasures are often justified by the States based upon the general and security exceptions under the GATT and ‘General Agreement on Trade in Services Agreement (GATS)’. With the advent of the WTO Panel decision in Russia-Traffic in Transit, it is now well established that recourse to exceptions under the WTO is justiciable and not entirely self-judging.¹⁰³ Building on this, the concept of ‘national security unilateralism,’ as delineated by Chaisse and Georgopoulos, reflects an emerging trend where states increasingly prioritize their national security interests, sometimes contravening established international economic norms.¹⁰⁴ A prominent example of this trend is the trade policies of the United States under the Trump administration, marked by unilateral tariff impositions that circumvent standard global trade procedures. This paradigm shift, moving away from a cooperative, rules-based approach in international economic relations to a more insular, ¹⁰² WTO Electronic Commerce Negotiations Updated Consolidated Negotiating Text – November 2023 <https: img=\"\"pdf=\"\"wto_ji=\"\"> ¹⁰³ Panel Report, Russia – Traffic in Transit, WT/DS512/R, adopted April 2019; Dylan Geraets, ‘WTO Issues Ruling in Russia – Traffic in Transit: Measures Justified on National Security Grounds Are Justiciable’ (Mayer Brown, 8 April 2019) <https: 04=\"\"2019=\"\"en=\"\"en=\"\"publications=\"\"wto-issues-ruling-in-russia-traffic-in-transit-measures-justified-on-national-security-grounds-are-justiciable#_edn2=\"\"www.mayerbrown.com=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023. A provision is self-judging when the members can decide whether and how this exception can be applied to the measure. On the one hand, it is non-justiciable when the issue cannot be subject to the findings of a WTO Panel or the adjudicative system. On the other hand, the provision is justiciable if the phrases ‘it considers’ and ‘necessary’ are not read together.\n¹⁰⁴ Julien Chaisse and Georgios Dimitropoulos, ‘Special Economic Zones in International Economic Law: Towards Unilateral Economic Law’ (2021) 24(2) JIEL 229–57.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></https:> QIAN security-centric model, presents significant challenges to the traditional frameworks of international trade law.\nThe proliferation of digital trade raises concerns pertaining to cross-border data flow, critical infrastructure of the trading countries, and vulnerability to cyberattacks, which can potentially lead to violation of trade obligations as envisaged under the GATT, GATS, and TBT Agreements. While the foundation of the GATT is based upon non-discrimination between domestic and foreign goods, an effective domestic policy to counter cyberattacks can result in restricting the access of certain suspicious manufacturers of goods to further participate in the supply chain. The States have sought to justify these inherent trade-distorting measures based upon the general exception, under the GATT.\nSimilarly, in the context of the TBT Agreement, the Appellate Body in $EC - Asbestos$ held that where the risk associated with cross-border trade increases, the discretion of the Member States also increases in parallel. Even under the GATS, Member States can take recourse to justify cybersecurity measures based upon the general and security exceptions although the scope of application of trade-restrictive measures is relatively less broad as compared to GATT. The regional free trade agreements have gone one step further by allowing commitments from reciprocating nations to allow the cross-border transfer of personal information and the restricted prohibition on the measures of data localization.\nWhile the security exceptions under the GATT and GATS are self-judging in nature, they are however not immune from panel review as highlighted in Russia – Traffic in Transit. The general exceptions under the GATT and GATS are resorted to justify measures necessary to protect public morals or secure compliance with laws and regulations. Based upon these, the member nation must evidence whether the cybersecurity measure is ‘necessary’ in light of balancing the factors and whether less trade restricting alternatives are available. It is, however, agreed to some extent that these JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</www.globaltradealert.org> REDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS domestic cybersecurity measures outweigh the costs associated with them leading to better information symmetry, regulatory oversight, and reducing business malpractices.\n## 4.2 Strengthening International Trade Law in the Digital Era The sole reliance upon the general and security exceptions under the WTO covered agreements results in drastic trade distortion effects which can lead to justification for most, if not all, cybersecurity measures. Consequently, cooperation amongst Member States must be achieved to establish suitable standards such that the measures result in minimum trade distortion. On a preliminary level, it is essential that world governments agree upon a uniform understanding of the nature and scope of cybersecurity measures and the risks posed by them towards international trade. The domestic and international standard-setting organizations can prescribe certain standards for usage and regulation of cybersecurity measures in line with the ISO and IEC standards on cybersecurity.[110] The WTO has made efforts to regulate cybercrime through initiatives such as the Consolidated E-Commerce Negotiating Text circulated in December 2020.[111] The most controversial clause in the document is a broad exception that has been proposed to be incorporated into the negotiated text.[112] This exception allows Member States to freely adopt measures, notwithstanding the obligations under the agreement, to guarantee cybersecurity, safeguard cyberspace sovereignty safeguard the lawful rights and interests of the citizens, juridical persons, and other organizations, and achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives.\"[113] The only limitation to this broad power is that the measures taken must not be arbitrary or discriminatory; they must Requirement case significantly clarifies the application of the national security exception in WTO law, particularly by establishing that such exceptions are not entirely self-judging and subject to review (United States – Origin Marking Requirement, WT/DS597/10, Panel report under appeal on 26 January 2023). It underscores the necessity for concrete evidence to justify invoking national security, thereby narrowing the scope for its arbitrary use in trade disputes. For a commentary, see J Chaisse and K Olaoye, 'United States – Origin Marking Requirement, WT/DS597/R' (2023) 117(3) AJIL 488–493.\n\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></http:> QIAN be applied in an equal manner to all nations without any discrimination. Further, these measures must not be 'a disguised restriction on trade' and should not be 'more than necessary' to attain the objective.¹¹⁴ While the official text of this clause remains unavailable, leaked information provides insights into its content. Despite references to the negotiating text on the WTO's official website, it remains inaccessible to the public.¹¹⁵ Nevertheless, preliminary observations can be made based on the leaked information.\nWhile the exception provides visibility to cybersecurity issues and nation-states with the autonomy to design rigorous cybersecurity mechanisms, the exception is not a comprehensive regulation of cybersecurity and is only an enabling provision. Cyber-security measures remain the prerogative of Member States to keep in place. As a result, there remains a lack of comprehensive regulation of cyber-related issues in international trade. This status quo is especially concerning in a vital and ever-growing area like e-commerce. How this exception will be invoked by Member States remains to be seen but backlash based on information freedom concerns can certainly be anticipated. Further, the exception could also prove to be overbroad. The exception, apart from empowering Member States to take cybersecurity-related measures, allows any measures taken to achieve 'other legitimate public policy objectives'. Such a vague enabling provision could lead to disastrous consequences, which could undermine the foundations of international trade. The term 'public policy', typically used in relation to international commercial arbitration, has been held by numerous judgments to be an 'unruly horse'.¹¹⁶ Due to the inherent lack of a precise definition, arbitration scholars have found the concept to be excessively malleable, shaped by the subjective values and principles in each nation.¹¹⁷ Adding to the existing uncertainty around cyber-attacks and cyber-security, the insertion of an unruly horse that is 'public policy', would certainly be undesirable. The text must be revised to include a definition of public policy, or at the least illustrations of the term.\nMoreover, the establishment of standards alone is insufficient; robust compliance and enforcement mechanisms are necessary at the national level. Real-time data sharing on suspicious activities is vital for effective ¹¹⁴ ibid.\n¹¹⁵ Electronic Commerce Negotiations – Consolidated negotiating text – December 2020 – Revision, WTO Doc INF/ECOM/62/Rev 1 (14 December 2020).\n¹¹⁶ Richardson v Mellish, (1824) 2 Bing 229 at 252.\n¹¹⁷ Ibrahim Shehata, ‘The Ministerial Approval Requirement for Arbitration Agreements in Egypt: Revisiting the Public Policy Debate’ (2020) 37(3) J Intl Arb 391, 402; Anirudh Hariani, ‘Indian Arbitration and the Shifting Sands of Public Policy’ (2020) 6(2) Asian Intl Arb J 159, 160–161.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333 REDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\n## 5 International Investment Law and the Dynamics of Cybersecurity\nCountries with significant infrastructure development often attract substantial foreign investments from multinational corporations. However, infrastructure encompasses not only physical structures but also digital infrastructure, which plays a crucial role in attracting foreign direct investments (FDI). The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of workplaces, leading to increased reliance on digital assets such as fiber networks and broadband connectivity.¹²¹ Consequently, enhancing a nation's digital infrastructure can attract more FDI, particularly from e-commerce and technology companies.\nNumerous prominent companies globally possess trade secrets and intellectual property rights crucial for their commercial viability. Cyber hackers pose a significant threat by potentially dismantling these assets within a short span, thereby jeopardizing not only the company's survival but also the broader economy. Emphasizing a robust cybersecurity framework becomes imperative as a prerequisite for engaging in any business endeavor. States\n¹¹⁸ Shin-yi Peng, “Private” Cybersecurity Standards?

According to the UNCTAD report, e-commerce transactions amounted to over USD 29 trillion by 2017, constituting approximately 36% of global GDP. As the world increasingly embraces data-driven technology, the centrality of effective data governance becomes ever more apparent.¹²⁴\nThe evolution of international trade towards digital platforms has exposed nation-states to new challenges, particularly cyberattacks, which pose threats to data integrity. One key question is whether cyberattacks should be considered acts of war. Given that virtually all industries are potential targets for cyber hackers, a unified and international solution is necessary to address this problem. Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) could serve as a means to tackle this emerging issue. BITs provide fundamental protections to foreign investments and offer various dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration. Integrating substantive protection against cybercrimes into BITs would enhance the accountability of states and incentivize them to adopt robust data protection laws. This approach could contribute to mitigating the risks posed by cyberattacks in the context of international investment.\n## 5.1 Digital Assets as Emerging Investments\nThe initial task for investors is to ascertain whether digital assets meet the criteria to qualify as 'covered investments' under BITs. As investment tribunals grapple with claims related to cybercrime, they will face the challenge of addressing investment law policy arguments. Extending BIT provisions to encompass such crimes will inevitably entail implications for both investors\n¹²² ‘A Roadmap for Cross Border Data Flows: Future-Proofing Readiness and Cooperation in the New Data Economy: White Paper’ (World Economic Forum, 9 June 2020) <www3.we forum.org 2020.pdf=\"\" docs=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_Cross_Border_Data_Flows_2020.=\"\" wef_a_roadmap_for_cross_border_data_flows_2020.pdf=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n¹²³ Marina Dane, ‘Digitalisation, Trade, and Geopolitics in Asia’ (2020) <www.kas.de 2020=\"\" 8314289=\"\" documents=\"\" digitalisation%2c+trade%2c+and+geopolitics+in+asia.pdf=\"\" www.kas.de=\"\">/3bf29911-2dcb-6e72-d4aa-936f9b5082d0?version=1.0&amp;t=1608181259722&gt; accessed 19 October 2021.\n¹²⁴ Aaronson and Struett (n 66); ‘Global e-Commerce Sales Surged to $29 Trillion’ (UNCTAD Press Release, 29 March 2019) <https: global-e-commerce-sales-surged-29-trillion=\"\" press-material=\"\" unctad.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:></www.kas.de></www3.we>\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS\n\nTribunals have typically referenced the definition provided in BITs and objective economic criteria to ascertain whether an investment has been established, contrasting it with a mere commercial transaction. In interpreting BIT provisions, tribunals often turn to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, which outlines the general rule for interpreting treaty provisions, taking into consideration the purpose of the BIT and its other provisions. Certain BITs, such as the German Model BIT, employ a broad asset-based definition of investment, encompassing phrases like ‘every kind of asset’, thereby potentially encompassing digital assets as well.\nWhen considering the inclusion of digital assets within the definition of an asset, it is crucial to carefully delineate the concept of digital assets itself. The primary concern regarding digital assets pertains to the data they encapsulate, which holds both intrinsic and extrinsic value. The economic worth of digital assets is intricately linked to their data content, with the value of a digital asset being inherently tied to the data it contains. Intrinsic value pertains to the core data itself, while extrinsic value encompasses additional elements such as customer metadata, which companies often monetize significantly. Furthermore, there exists a symbiotic relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic value, akin to the seeds and flesh of a fruit, respectively. While not all BITs offer a broad definition of investment, it is advisable to establish a clear understanding of digital assets within the context of investment arbitration to mitigate the risk of numerous arbitration claims stemming from uncertainties in this regard.\nApart from the definition of an investment, there are other factors that can affect the inclusion of digital assets under the definition of covered investments, such as economic factors.¹²⁵ If the definition of investment ¹²⁵ Enikő Horváth and Severin Klinkmüller, ‘The Concept of “Investment” in the Digital Economy: The Case of Social Media Companies’ (2019) 20 JWIT 577, 593.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333 QIAN provided under Article 25 (1) ICSID is relied on, digital assets might very well be excluded as a covered investment. Therefore, a broad definition in the BIT would be ideal to bring digital assets within the investment arbitration regime. There are various definitions of investment in BITs which particularly limit the definition of investment by making it mandatory for investments to have some connection with economic factors such as expectations of profits or assumption of risk. For instance, in the case of Romak SA v Uzbekistan, the Tribunal adopted a restrictive approach in interpreting the definition of an investment.[126] It's essential for investment tribunals to recognize that digital companies often operate under long-term business models, where the initial investment is directed towards research and development.[127] These companies may take a considerable period to generate revenue, distinguishing them from single commercial transactions.[128] Another pertinent issue relates to the requirement of a territorial link in various BITs, stipulating that investments must be made within the territory of the host State. Establishing the territorial presence of digital assets poses inherent challenges.[129] Jonathan Bick's categorization of digital assets into possession, location, and control underscores the importance of these factors in establishing a territorial link between the State and the investment. In Abaclat v Argentina,[130] the Tribunal emphasized that the nature of the investment is crucial in determining its location, focusing on how the funds were ultimately utilized rather than where they were initially disbursed. This interpretation helps alleviate some of the challenges in proving digital assets as covered investments. In Wena Hotel v Egypt, the Tribunal affirmed that expropriation encompasses both tangible and intangible assets, including digital JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333</www.businessinsider.in></www.bcg.com> REDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS assets, under international law.¹³¹ In SPP v Egypt, the tribunal clarified that it is an accepted proposition that the protection of international law extends to contract rights and therefore compensation should be made for taking away these rights.¹³² Moreover, in Tippetts v Tams-Affa, Tribunal stated that under international law, even if the title in the property is not affected, its deprivation may occur by the interference of a State in the use or enjoyments of benefits attached to the property. Since the assumption of control does not imply that the property has been acquired by the government, compensation should be paid under international law, indicating that the owner was deprived of their fundamental right of ownership of the property.¹³³ ## 5.2 Investment Claims in the Age of Cybersecurity The central concern in this context revolves around whether investors can pursue claims against states for cybercrimes.¹³⁴ Studies from 2017 indicate that a single data breach can cost a company up to USD 3.62 million on average. The severity of costs varies depending on factors like the type and volume of data stolen; for instance, the leakage of trade secrets could pose an existential threat to a company. The principle of ‘Fair and Equitable Treatment’ (FET) is pivotal in this regard, as it obliges states to provide investors with essential conditions, potentially enabling investors to lodge claims for cybercrimes.\nTribunals typically assess whether state actions are arbitrary under FET provisions by referencing core principles.¹³⁵ Regarding digital assets, FET claims may challenge alterations in measures related to national cybersecurity. ‘Transparency’ plays a crucial role for investors conducting business in a host state, and states are obligated to maintain transparency. While states have ¹³¹ Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000) para 98.\n¹³² Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/84/3, Award (1992) para 164.\n¹³³ Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v TAMS-AFFA Consulting, 225 6 IRAN-US CTR 219.\n¹³⁴ Julien Chaisse and Cristen Bauer, ‘Cybersecurity and the Protection of Digital Assets: Assessing the Role of International Investment Law and Arbitration’ (2019) 21 Vand J Ent &amp; Tech L 549, 568.\n¹³⁵ In Glamis Gold Ltd v United States, Award, IIC 380 (2009), it is mentioned that ‘fair and equitable treatment encompasses a universe of “fundamental” principles common throughout the world that include “the duty to act in good faith, due process, transparency and candor, and fairness and protection from arbitrariness’. In MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004), the Tribunal agreed with a legal opinion by Judge Schwebel that fair and equitable treatment encompassed such fundamental standards as good faith, due process, non-discrimination and proportionality.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333 QIAN the right to amend laws concerning national cybersecurity to achieve public policy objectives, such changes must not be inconsistent, as demonstrated in the case of PSEG Global v Republic of Turkey.¹³⁶ In this case, Turkey's frequent changes to the law were deemed to create uncertainty for investors, violating FET provisions.\nAnother relevant case involving the implementation of inconsistent policies by a state is MTD Equity v Republic of Chile.¹³⁷ The tribunal ruled that Chile violated FET provisions by adopting contradictory positions with the investor regarding data localization policies. Chile's support for these policies on national security grounds increased costs for foreign investors. Similarly, data localization policies initiated by the Vietnamese government have been challenged by tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Google on economic and human rights grounds. Regarding claims related to Denial of Justice, these typically entail the right to be heard. Such a right is infringed when the cyber legislation of the host state fails to provide effective opportunities for all parties to present their case.\nIn addition to the aforementioned considerations, claims may also arise based on the Full Protection and Security standard (FPS). These claims encompass not only threats from armed rebels but also modern dangers posed by cybercriminals. Cyberattacks can compromise the three primary pillars of security: confidentiality, availability, and integrity. A claim under FPS due to a cyberattack can be sustained if it can be demonstrated that the security assured by the host State extends beyond physical protection. Factors such as the standard liability of the host State and the potential overlap between FPS and FET provisions are also pivotal in determining whether the investment was deprived of legal protection.\nThe definition of investment has evolved over time, and similarly, the application of FPS has expanded. An investor can succeed in their claim even in the absence of a physical attack, as exemplified in the case of Azurix v Argentina,¹³⁸ where the host State was deemed responsible for providing an overall safe environment to investors. Given that digital assets predominantly fall under the category of intangible assets, they can be interpreted to meet the criteria of covered investments, thus availing the protection of FPS provisions in BITs.\n¹³⁶ PSEG Global Inc v Republic of Turkey, ICSID Case No ARB/02/5, Award (2007) paras 248–256.\n¹³⁷ MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v Republic of Chile, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Award (2004) para 189.\n¹³⁸ Azurix Corp v Argentina, ICSID Case No ARB/01/12, Award (2004) para 408.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333 REDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS In instances where host States lack cyber laws, courts have applied analogical reasoning, drawing from laws related to privacy and theft. However, if domestic courts fail to apply such principles and a void in cybersecurity laws persists, this absence could be deemed a violation of the FPS standard. The FPS standard underscores the State's duty to furnish investors with an adequate legal framework for protection. Intangible assets, if deemed investments under the relevant BIT, can be subject to expropriation, including indirect expropriation resulting in asset depreciation. Addressing these issues requires enhancing the contents of BITs by expanding the definition of investment to encompass digital assets. States must recognize that safeguarding investors from cybercrime not only benefits investors but also preserves the economy and the privacy of citizens, serving the public interest of the host State. Incorporating cyberattacks under the FPS provision in BITs can compel host States to fulfill their obligation and shield investors from cyber threats, which have the potential to devastate companies in an instant. Therefore, it is imperative to prohibit these detrimental criminal actions.\n## 5.3 National Security Exceptions in Investment Law Various international investment agreements incorporate exceptions,¹⁴¹ including those related to national security. This exception grants host States the authority to implement precautionary measures. However, there is considerable debate within the Investor ISDS regime regarding the basis for invoking this national security exception. Some argue that it is a self-judging provision prone to arbitrary use by States, while others contend that it is based on necessity. From the perspective of host countries, national security interests are ¹³⁹ Wena Hotels LTD v Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4, Award (2000).\n¹⁴⁰ Occidental Exploration and Production Company v The Republic of Ecuador, LCIA Case No UN3467 (1976).\n¹⁴¹ Katia Yannaca-Small, 'Essential Security Interests under International Investment Law', in OECD (ed.), International Investment Perspectives: Freedom of Investment in a Changing World (2007).\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333 QIAN deemed significant, both for developed and developing nations. Developed countries often invoke national security interests in response to attempted takeovers of industries, whereas developing countries may do so during economic crises.^[142]^ However, prior to invoking this exception, States should adhere to the requirement of explicit good faith. Regular reviews should be conducted to assess the ongoing necessity of upholding security-related investment restrictions. In the author's view, all these remedies prevent this exception of national security from becoming a mere 'black and white' matter and a different solution should be adopted which can balance the rights of the contracting parties and foreign investors. Hence, the threat to cybersecurity such as cyber-attacks should be covered under the umbrella of national security. By invoking these exceptions, the States are likely to take certain measures to prevent these crimes that would violate the international investment agreements and would be able to justify such measures under existing exceptions.\n## 6 Making the Linkages: Nuclear Proliferation and Cyberattacks In contemporary times, parallels between nuclear law and cyber risk regulation are frequently drawn, owing to the escalating threat that cyberattacks pose to global security and diplomacy.^[143]^ Cybersecurity has transcended local boundaries to become a matter of international concern, impacting peace and security on a global scale. However, existing international law inadequately addresses these cybersecurity threats, necessitating the establishment of more robust and effective regulations. A recent report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) highlighted the strategic risks posed by cyberattacks, underscoring the urgent need for the introduction of a cybersecurity treaty. The international community must recognize and address the risks posed by cybersecurity, analogous to the approach taken with non-proliferation agreements.\nNuclear non-proliferation aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and associated delivery systems, with the overarching goal of averting nuclear conflict or catastrophe in the future. Conversely, cyberattacks encompass malicious attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or valuable data. The proliferation of cyberattacks has raised concerns among financial institutions, corporations, and governments regarding their potential JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333 REDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS As technology becomes increasingly integral to government, institutional, and personal operations, parallels between nuclear and cyber threats become apparent. For instance, the NC3 systems of nuclear-armed governments heavily rely on digital processors and computers, rendering them vulnerable to hacking and cyberattacks. Moreover, the nuclear force infrastructure encompasses weapons, launch sites, and command authorities interconnected through communication and data processing technologies, facilitating cyber vulnerabilities. Despite the reluctance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to address the convergence of nuclear and cyber threats, scholars and non-governmental experts have extensively documented their interactions. Without stronger protections against cyberattacks and illegal hacking, the realm of nuclear weapons and security remains susceptible to exploitation.\n## 6.1 Comparative Analysis of Legal Frameworks Efforts in nuclear non-proliferation have spanned approximately fifty years, originating in the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. The earliest initiatives began within the UN, with Article 11(1) of the UN Charter emphasizing the preservation of international peace and security.¹⁴⁵ A significant development during this period was the conclusion of the Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) in 1963,¹⁴⁶ although some countries abstained from signing due to perceived weaknesses in its provisions, notably the absence of international control mechanisms or spot inspections.¹⁴⁷ The Cuban Missile Crisis highlighted the need for a comprehensive framework to address nuclear proliferation. Consequently, the NPT was signed in 1968 by 62 countries, including nuclear weapon states like the US. Notably, China and France refrained from signing initially. The NPT came ¹⁴⁴ Stéphane Lhuissier and Fabien Tripier, *A Measure of the Evolution of Cyber Risk* (17 December 2021) <https: blog-entry=\"\"blocnotesdeleco.banque-france.fr=\"\"measure-evolution-cyber-risk=\"\"en=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\n¹⁴⁵ Then, in 1946, the Atomic Energy Commission was set up to recommend measures for controlling atomic energy. In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was created with the goal of promoting and overseeing to promote and oversee the peaceful use of nuclear technology.\n¹⁴⁶ The PTBT can be viewed as the first global and formal attempt towards non-proliferation. At first, the Treaty was only ratified by the USSR, the US, and the UK.\n¹⁴⁷ For instance, China conducted Project 596 in 1964, which was its first atom bomb test. Due to its relatively small audience, and the fact that even its signatories continued to defy it, the PTBT was largely a failure.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:> QIAN into force in 1970, categorizing countries into nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states,¹⁴⁸ with the former defined as those that conducted nuclear tests before January 1967. Subsequent developments included the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, such as the Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America, and agreements like the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT-I) between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.¹⁴⁹ Following the end of the Cold War in 1991, efforts in non-proliferation intensified, with particular focus on strengthening the NPT. The revelation of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program after the Gulf War prompted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to introduce the Model Additional Protocol, enhancing its access to information and nuclear facilities. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 1996 marked a significant milestone, prohibiting all nuclear explosions and providing for on-site inspections and confidence-building measures.\nIn recent years, cybercrime and cyberattacks have emerged as significant threats to international security, paralleling the concerns posed by nuclear proliferation in the past. Analogous to the NPT for nuclear issues, there is a growing need for a comprehensive treaty addressing cybercrime, regulation of the internet, and law enforcement procedures for cross-border investigations. These issues carry profound implications for human rights, economic systems, and national security. International cooperation is crucial in developing effective regulatory frameworks for cyberspace,¹⁵⁰ fostering confidence among stakeholders and ensuring a secure digital environment.\n## 6.2 Lessons from Nuclear Law for Cyber Regulation The NPT is a three-part global pact intended at restricting the spread of nuclear weapons: (1) non-proliferation, (2) disarmament, and (3) peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The basic tenets of the treaty include the principle that nuclear weapons will not be acquired by States that do not have them, nuclear-weapon States will pursue disarmament, and all States have access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes under safeguards.\nAccording to Article IX of the NPT, 'nuclear weapon states (NWS)' are those that have detonated a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967, ¹⁴⁸ Following suit, states of the South Pacific established an NWFZ in 1985, Southeast Asia in 1995, Africa in 1996, and Central Asia in 2006.\n¹⁴⁹ Seven years later, SALT-I was followed up by the signing of SALT-II by these two nations, which further limited their nuclear capabilities.\n¹⁵⁰ Deborah Brown, 'Cybercrime is Dangerous, But a New UN Treaty Could Be Worse for Rights' (13 August 2021) <https: 08=\"\"13=\"\"2021=\"\"cybercrime-dangerous-new-un-treaty-could-be-worse-rights=\"\"news=\"\"www.hrw.org=\"\"> accessed 25 November 2023.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333</https:> REDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) supplements the NPT and includes a Protocol detailing the International Monitoring System (IMS), On-Site Inspections (OSI), and Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs). The CTBT prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, with provisions for redressing violations, ensuring compliance, and periodic review of its effectiveness.\nPresident John F. Kennedy's infamous fear in the 1960s, that 20 or perhaps 30 'Nuclear-Weapon States (NWSs)' would arise within a decade, did not come true. The number of nuclear powers or governments with active nuclear weapons programmes remains at ten even now. The NPT recognises five of them as lawful nuclear weapons possessors, which corresponds to the permanent five members of the 'UN Security Council (UNSC)'. Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are all said to have nuclear weapons or have demonstrated it through testing. Iran has long been accused of pursuing a zealous nuclear weapons development. In contrast, no less than 26 governments have renounced or been forced to abandon their pursuit of nuclear weapons, having completed feasibility studies, targeted weapon research or even development, or manufactured nuclear weapons (or inherited them following the collapse of the Soviet Union). Almost the whole phalanx of middle powers is made ¹⁵¹ There are gaps in the current treaty framework. Firstly, there is the issue of countries like India, Pakistan, and Israel not joining the NPT. This leads to a significant amount of unsafeguarded nuclear activity. Another concern is that countries signatory may develop nuclear fuel cycle facilities and then subsequently opt-out of the Treaty as North Korea did. To avoid this, stronger and more regular inspection measures need to be enforced within the Treaty mechanism, with the aid of international bodies.\nJOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333 QIAN up of these countries. When one considers that the CTBT names out 44 'nuclear capable' governments whose ratification is necessary before the treaty can be implemented, the miracle of non-proliferation becomes even greater. By comparing the 'before' and 'after,' we may obtain a sense of the consequences of international norms. The vast majority of 'nuclear aspirants' began their nuclear programmes before the NPT was signed. After the NPT was opened for signing, only Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, and (perhaps) Syria developed their programmes. Surprisingly, none of these nations were democracies at the time the pact was drafted. On the contrary, the vast majority of 'renouncers' halted their programmes during or after the discussions. As a result, for most of them, the NPT signified the line beyond which nuclear weapons ambitions lost their legitimacy.\nThe reliance of nuclear-armed governments, including the US, on computerized Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems underscores a critical vulnerability. These systems, integral to every aspect of nuclear force management, operate within cyberspace, making them susceptible to hacking and cyberattacks. NC3 systems encompass a network of communication and data-processing technologies linking weapons, radar systems, launch sites, and senior authorities responsible for nuclear decision-making. Despite extensive cybersecurity measures, the complexity and diversity of these systems render them inherently vulnerable, with numerous potential points of attack. Moreover, emerging technologies such as cyber capabilities, hypersonics, and encryption have the dual potential of exacerbating conflicts within the framework of the NPT while also offering avenues for achieving its objectives. While the NPT has been slow to address these evolving challenges, academia and non-governmental organizations have extensively studied their implications for nuclear issues. However, there remains a significant gap between civil society's engagement with emerging technologies and their integration into the NPT framework.[152] Given its role as both a treaty and a forum, the NPT holds particular importance in addressing these challenges. States parties to the NPT have legal obligations regarding nuclear technology proliferation, making it essential JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295-333 to consider the impact of emerging technologies on treaty compliance and verification. The NPT review process provides a unique opportunity for nuclear‐possessor and non‐possessor states to discuss and address a wide range of issues affecting nuclear order and treaty obligations. In light of these considerations, emerging technologies should be incorporated into all nuclear and non‐nuclear disarmament agreements, including the CTBT, the Conference on Disarmament (CD), and nuclear‐weapon‐free zones. However, the NPT, with its comprehensive legal framework and review mechanism, stands as a pivotal platform for addressing the challenges posed by emerging technologies to nuclear disarmament and non‐proliferation efforts.\nEdward Ifft highlights the CTBT innovative approach to addressing the challenge of unequal capacity among State parties to collect and evaluate data about compliance. The treaty establishes an IMS, comprising 337 globally distributed sites equipped with seismic, radionuclide, hydroacoustic, and infrared sensors. Ifft suggests that most States lack the resources to independently acquire and analyze this data. However, individual State parties can access professional technical analysis of IMS data and other relevant information free of charge from an international data center in Vienna. Drawing on the collaborative IMS model proposed by the CTBT, Ifft proposes the development of a Joint Attribution Mechanism (JAM) to assist nations with limited cyber forensic capabilities in collecting and analyzing data for attribution purposes. Such a mechanism could serve as a cost‐effective solution, encouraging nations to participate in a cyber treaty. Additionally, a JAM would enhance the credibility and legitimacy of the attribution process for nations with advanced cyber forensic capabilities. Ensuring reliable attribution is essential, but it is equally important to establish consistent consequences for cyber aggressors. This highlights the need for effective mechanisms to punish those responsible for cyberattacks consistently.\n## Conclusion This article underscores the profound complexities and pressing challenges in the domain of cybersecurity, especially when viewed through the prism of international law. The pernicious implications of cyberattacks are ever more pertinent in an era increasingly dominated by digital data and connectivity. While the international community grapples with defining and responding to these cyber threats, our existing legal frameworks, rooted in conventional physical paradigms, are inadequately equipped to address this novel form of virtual aggression.\nThe current structure of international law does not encapsulate an all-encompassing definition of cyberattacks, making it a precarious space in need of robust codification. The disruption wrought by cyberattacks on WTO agreements is even more deleterious, given the outdated security exceptions that remain unresponsive to risk-based cybersecurity measures. Moreover, the burgeoning surge in FDIs in digital assets, primarily intangible, exposes another lacuna in international law, conspicuously absent in contemporary investment treaties. These considerations underscore an imminent need to institute measures to mitigate the manifold issues arising from cyberattacks.\nPublic international law must evolve to address the specific nuances of cyberattacks and the consequent implications on State sovereignty, transborder crime, and national security. The ascendance of cyber aggression necessitates a re-examination of the fundamental tenets of international law, including the principles of Jus Ad Bellum and Jus In Bello, with a more nuanced lens. The complexities of attribution and the abstract nature of cyber warfare necessitate a shift in how we perceive sovereignty and territoriality in the digital age.\nIn the sphere of WTO law, the advent of cyber threats and the expansion of digital economies call for a revamp of trade rules and exceptions. It is crucial to establish a harmonized understanding of cybersecurity risks and potential countermeasures, with a balanced approach to cyber governance and free trade. Thus, a common vision is the need of the hour to work in collaboration internationally for ensuring cybersecurity and keeping cybercrimes at bay. The establishment of the Trade and Technology Council by the United States and the European Union represents a promising development in the quest for global consensus on trade and technology issues. This initiative holds the potential to facilitate increased collaboration and the harmonization of regulations across international borders.\nFinally, as cyberattacks increasingly target financial assets and systems, the role of investment law becomes paramount. The rise of data-driven businesses necessitates safeguarding digital assets and investments, requiring innovative legal mechanisms such as ‘digital-ready' BITs. Re-envisioning BITs to include digital assets, whilst establishing the scope of security provisions under the FET clause, can address potential investment claims from cyber risks. This would balance the need for a stable investment environment with the protection of digital assets, thereby fostering confidence amongst investors in the digital era.\nREDEFINING INTERNATIONAL LAW PARADIGMS JOURNAL OF WORLD INVESTMENT &amp; TRADE 25 (2024) 295–333"

    "abstract": "This paper critically examines the evolving intersections of cybersecurity, trade, and investment within the framework of international law, thereby seeking to redefine its normative paradigms. The article adopts a multidisciplinary approach, integrating legal theory, international relations, and cyber law to analyze how digital security issues intersect with global economic transactions. Utilizing doctrinal legal analysis, the article delves into international treaties, case law, and policy documents, while a comparative method highlights variances and similarities across jurisdictions. The article identifies significant gaps in existing international legal frameworks that are ill-equipped to address the complexities and nuances of the digital age. It advocates for comprehensive legal reforms, encompassing cyber warfare, digital trade, and cross-border investments. The objective is to align international law with the digital era's realities, effectively balancing national security, economic growth, and individual rights in a globally interconnected environment. This article not only uncovers critical shortcomings in current legal structures but also proposes forward-looking legal strategies, essential for tackling emerging challenges at the cybersecurity, trade, and investment nexus. These strategies chart a course towards a more resilient and adaptive international legal system, equipped to address the multifaceted issues arising from the digital era's convergence.
