France is no exception. We have seen in recent months a revival of its efforts to secure its citizens and interests in cyber space. French President Emmanuel Macron presented in late 2018 the \"Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace\", a package of norms of good behaviour bringing together states, private corporations and the civil society¹. All the while, in the past two years, the government designed its very first Cyber Defence Strategy² and the Armed Forces unveiled some elements of their offensive and defensive cyber operations³. How can we make sense of it all?\nWe frame the current picture by following Allison and Zelikow's three conceptual models of decision-making: Rational actor, organisational behaviour, and government politics⁴. In accordance with each model, we seek to answer the following questions, respectively:\nR1: What are the underlying principles, goals and objectives of French national defence and security, in general terms and in the cyber domain?\nR2: What are the institutions involved in cyber security and defence, their perimeters of action and organisational culture?\nR3: What are the processes and individuals involved in cyber security and defence policy-making at the politico-strategic level?\nTo do so we combine an extensive review of the literature with a series of interviews with senior French officials from ministries, as well as national agencies and other specialised institutions.\n# Objectives and limitations\nThe objective of this paper is three-fold: describing, explaining and, by extension, predicting. First, we hope to provide a better understanding of the current French cyber security and defence policy picture its founding political and doctrinal principles. Second, by applying Allison and Zelikow's models to this picture, we seek to explain how policy-making in this area happens in practice. This approach diverges slightly from the models' original purpose, which is to analyse a specific case-study and its cluster of decisions (\"Why did the Soviets smuggle nuclear missiles into Cuba?\" \"Why did the US respond by imposing a naval blockade?\"). This paper does not ambition to explain why France launched the Paris Call or why it published parts of the armed forces' offensive cyber operations doctrine. Scholars⁵ and journalists⁶ have already started answering them. Rather, it seeks to provide a toolkit so that scholars, practitioners or journalists can design more accurate hypotheses about why future decision X or Y was taken in that domain. There is no doubt this toolkit will be incomplete and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nimperfect. Not all policy documents are public, some processes and institutions are still recent, and we lack the ability to stand back so that we can grasp how some processes work-out in practice. Another obstacle is that these principles, policies, doctrines, processes and institutions live through the minds and acts of leaders, policy-makers and practitioners, whom the author has not been able to all interview. In particular, the author was unable to meet officials from SGDSN itself, the Élysée Palace and Prime Minister's Office. This is where the work of Bastien Irondelle becomes key⁷. The third -indirect- objective of this paper, is prediction. As Allison and Zelikow highlight, it is “the logical flipside of explanations”⁸. If we understand more accurately the processes and factors that lead to decisions, we can extrapolate about future events. The predictive power of the model will however be highly dependent on the strength of its explanatory qualities.\n## Acknowledgement and appreciation\nThe author is grateful to IRSEM for hosting him and the warm welcome.

This is the rational actor model. In our case, France is the identified state. More often than not, political cycles lead to new policies and strategies. When relevant, the state thus becomes personified, in relation to a specific presidency. In this model we adopt a bounded rationality viewpoint, whereas we accept that “values, beliefs and stereotypes” play a role in the actors’ rationality⁹.\n## 1. Political concepts, principles and goals\nIn this first part we analyse France’s core political concepts of sovereignty and strategic autonomy, the rationale behind the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence apparatus, and the one behind its communication and attribution stance.\n### a. France’s sovereignty, national and European strategic autonomy\nFrance has a conceptualisation of sovereignty that makes it stand out of its peers. Baezner and Robin found in their comparative analysis that “France was unique among the states examined in that it used the word “sovereignty” more frequently and in different contexts”¹⁰. Sovereignty, in its French understanding, cannot be restrained to hard sovereignty, i.e. the protection of its citizens, borders and other existential interests¹¹. French sovereignty is a wide spectrum that implies strategic autonomy. The 2017 Strategic Review defines strategic autonomy as a two pillar concept entailing 1) a high level of industrial and technological autonomy, and 2) an operational autonomy¹². On technological autonomy, the Ministry of the Armed Forces has recently ramped up its strategy, with the creation of a dedicated investment fund, DefInvest¹³. Its first investments were made in microprocessors and high precision optics manufacturers. Operational autonomy means the ability to reach an informed decision and to take action, in particular in the context of political or military crises. The French military operation in Mali, for instance, is a good illustration of operational autonomy: the ability to engage in full scope – low to high intensity– operations, with allies or on its own if necessary.\nFrench strategic autonomy can be best described as neo-Gaullist. It is characterised by a strong sense of national independence but recognises the need for a powerful political Europe¹⁴. Its historical drivers and roots come indeed from a traditional Gaullist doctrine of national autonomy, which is more self-reliant. The perceived need for self-reliance played a major role in driving De Gaulle to transform France into a nuclear power and to leave NATO integrated command in 1966. Some key historical events such as the 1940 surrender, the intelligence frustrations of the 1992 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq war further fuelled perceptions that France needed both a credible nuclear arsenal, and autonomous intelligence capabilities¹⁵.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n---\n⁹ Allison and Zelikow.

See para. 159 of the 2017 Strategic Review.\n¹² See Para. 157. “Revue stratégique de défense et de sécurité nationale,” La Documentation Française (Paris: Présidence de la République, October 2017), http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/174000744/index.shtml.\n¹³ “Le Ministère Des Armées et Bpifrance Lancent Definvest,” BPI France, November 17, 2017, https://presse.bpifrance.fr/le-ministere-des-armees-et-bpifrance-lancent-definvest/.\n¹⁴ Serge Berstein, *Histoire Du Gaullisme* (Paris: Perrin, 2001).\n¹⁵ The Military Intelligence Agency was created in the aftermath of the Gulf War. Claude Faure, “Bref historique des services de renseignement et de sécurité français contemporains,” *Revue historique des armées*, no. 247 (June 15, 2007): 70–81.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThis spirit of autonomy remains today, but with a wider pragmatic recognition of the need for cooperation and integration. France re-joined NATO command in 2009 for mainly pragmatism and influence reasons¹⁶. However the French nuclear arsenal remains outside of NATO command and its intelligence apparatus outside of the 5-Eyes community. France' strategic autonomy is also reliant on a European strategic autonomy, which it seeks to develop. The Hubert Védrine report recommended that the country's return into NATO command is accompanied by a strengthening of European defence integration and cooperation, especially in the R&amp;D of technological and industrial capacities¹⁷. It encourages the development of mutual interdependence with entities who share critical interests, particularly within the EU. This policy shift initiated in 1992 with the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy was confirmed in the 2008 White Paper, placing the EU as \"a central tenet of [France's] security policy\"¹⁸. This central place was reaffirmed ever since, including in the last cyber strategy document¹⁹.\nb) Domestic apparatus: Offense / defence separation\nDomestically, the French approach contrasts with that embraced by the United States or the United Kingdom. Most notably, France assumes a clear separation between offensive and defensive cyber operations. This means that, contrary to the U.S.' National Security Agency (NSA) or the U.K.'s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), France's leading agency for cybersecurity is exclusively dedicated to defensive operations and not part of the intelligence community. This is a defining element of the Cyber Strategy Review and infuses the whole structure of French cyberdefence. The rationale is that having a distinct defensive agency separate from offense-oriented military intelligence agencies \"facilitates the acceptance of state intervention [...] whether in public administration or the economic sphere\"²⁰.\nc) A counter-threat model based on direct communication rather than public attribution\nPeculiarities of the French model are not limited to its conceptualisation of sovereignty. On the diplomatic stage, France has also adopted a different stance than most of its counterparts²¹. A number of NATO allies are increasingly inclined to \"name and shame\" states involved in cyber attacks. One telling example can be found in October 2018, when the U.S., U.K., Canada and the Netherlands denounced Russian attempts at disrupting the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons²². Paris expressed its solidarity but fell short of blaming Moscow²³. Already in 2015, when what then seemed to be ISIS took down TV5Monde in a major hack, no official attribution was made. ANSSI, the national cybersecurity agency, however briefed four dozen media outlets with details of its forensic investigation and indicators of compromise. These details were then analysed by private security firms which pointed the finger at persistent threat actor (APT) ²⁸²⁴. Additionally, TV5Monde director Yves Bigot reported in L'Express\n\"France favours red phones over the megaphone.\"\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nthat ANSSI personnel suggested it was a false-flag (\"un leurre\")²⁵. More recently, in the case of the #MacronLeaks, France did not issue any kind of attribution either. G. Poupard, head of ANSSI, refused to do so arguing \"the attack was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone\"²⁶. More recently, the Secretary General for Defence and National Security clarified France's official policy: attribution can only be performed on the basis of elements collected or verified by French services, typically ANSSI and DGSE²⁷.\nThis does not mean that it does not have attribution capabilities. As we will see in Chapter II, attributing cyber-attacks is one of the main missions of the French cyberdefence apparatus. But even when it knows, France prefers forthright bilateral dialogues with Russia and other cyber powers such as the U.S., China, India, Brazil and Japan²⁸. It appears it even opened a deconfliction cell with the Russian Security Council on cyber matters²⁹. Only in last resort will France take part in public name and shame³⁰. In other words, it favours red phones over the megaphone.\nThere is only one recorded instance of public attribution, and it is indirect. At the unveiling of the offensive cyber doctrine, Minister Parly revealed that an APT targeted email accounts of high-ranking officials between 2017 and 2018, with the objective of uncovering the navy's oil supply chain³¹. Though the Minister stopped short of explicitly recognizing the group's affiliation with the Russian Federation, she indirectly attributed the attacker's mode of operation to a specific group known as Turla.\nUnder Egloff's definition, France engages in two attribution processes³². First a process of sense-making attribution, for the benefit of its own factual understanding, that it rarely communicates publicly. Second, in a meaning-making process, with regards to its adversaries. But again, it does so rather privately than publicly. Overall, French strategy with attribution seem to fit a counter-threat model³³.\nIn this first part, we have detailed how France conceives its sovereignty and what it means by strategic autonomy. We have also sought to explain its rationale behind the offence / defence separation and to describe its policy of non-public attribution.\n## 2. The evolution and granularization of objectives of French cyber security and defence\nIn this second part we review the cyber security and defence objectives produced by political and military authorities, from 2011 to 2019. We identify three main themes: active discouragement, risk limitation and direct communication.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe Defence and National Security White Paper 2008 is the first of its kind to mention Internet-related threats³⁴ and leads to the creation of ANSSI. The Agency releases in 2011 the “National Strategy for the Defence and Security of Information Systems”. It’s four goals are:\n- For France to become a top-tier cyber power,\n- To guarantee freedom of decision through confidentiality of state secrets,\n- To reinforce the security of critical infrastructures,\n- To ensure cybersecurity to public and private actors alike.\nThe second version of the Strategy revolved around 1) state secrets and critical infrastructures, 2) digital privacy and cybercrime, 3) public sensitisation and training, 4) business and export strategies, and 5) Europe, digital sovereignty and norms³⁵.\nFollowing the election of Emmanuel Macron to the Presidency, the President requests officially tasks the Armed Forces Ministry to create a panel of experts with a view to write a new defence white paper. The Strategic Review for Defence and National Security, as it is then known, is released in 2017. It promotes digital sovereignty and cybersecurity to top priorities of national defence³⁶.\nIn February 2018, the country’s first National Strategy for Cyber Defence clarified both the organization and integration of cyber operations among all government entities³⁷ as well as the national and international legal framework surrounding their use³⁸. It sets-out goals and processes as part of a “robust national cyber security and defence apparatus”³⁹.\nThe seven principles underpinning the Strategy are:\n1. To make the security of French information and communication systems a priority,\n2. To embrace a policy of active discouragement⁴⁰ and coordinated response,\n3. To fully exercise its digital sovereignty,\n4. To bring an efficient judicial response to cybercriminality,\n5. To promote a shared cybersecurity culture,\n6. To contribute to a trusted and safe digital Europe,\n7. To act internationally for a collective governance of cyberspace.\nTo achieve said goals, the Strategy sets-out a number of policy-making and coordination processes (see Chapter III). In practice, three main themes appear: Active discouragement, risk limitation and multilateralism.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n³⁴ Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n³⁵ Services du Premier Ministre, “Stratégie Nationale Pour La Sécurité Du Numérique” (Paris, October 16, 2015), https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/la-strategie-nationale-pour-la-securite-du-numerique-une-reponse-aux-nouveaux-enjeux-des-usages-numeriques/.\n³⁶ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n³⁷ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n³⁸ Francois Delerue and Aude Gery, “France’s Cyberdefense Strategic Review and International Law,” Lawfare, March 23, 2018, https://www.lawfareblog.com/frances-cyberdefense-strategic-review-and-international-law.\n³⁹ In French as « Dispositif national de protection et de défense informatique robuste ». “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n⁴⁰ France reserves its concept of deterrence (dissuasion) to the nuclear domain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Active discouragement\nFrance has adopted a posture of active discouragement against advanced threats. It relies on direct communication with the adversary, as we have detailed earlier, and on an increasingly explicit declaratory strategy.\nIn January 2019 Minister Florence Parly unveiled the offensive and defensive cyber operations doctrines of the armed forces. The announcement is the latest and strongest step taken by the country as part of its declaratory strategy⁴¹. In response to cyber and other threats, France is “not afraid” of using cyber weapons⁴². The country did not wait until then to perform offensive operations or even to publicly admit doing so. Such operations were first mentioned in the 2008 White Paper⁴³ and then again with more details in 2013. The case for proportional reprisals in response to a major attack was also made clearly by then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian:\n“In times of war, cyber weapons may be the response, or part of our response, to an armed attack [aggression armée], being of a cyber nature or otherwise”⁴⁴.\nb) Risk limitation and infrastructure sanctuarisation\nRisks that are inherent to cyberspace and operations are a recurrent topic in policy documents.\nThe offensive doctrine places great emphasis on the consideration and mitigation of political, legal and military risks. It mandates a risk balancing exercise in the preparation and conduct of offensive operations: against the risk of escalation in an asymmetric environment, or against the risk of collateral or indirect damage on civilian infrastructures. This balancing exercise – and the need not to reveal too much details – may be the reason the doctrine does not clearly mention⁴⁵ physical destruction of information systems.\nInternationally, France aims to promote existing institutional mechanisms to “limit hacking and destabilising activities” in cyberspace, notably through an international initiative, the “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace”⁴⁶, unveiled in November 2018.\nIn terms of international law, the document encourages more extensive and better coordinated regulation of cyberspace in the spirit of founding principles of the U.N. Charter, notably the maintenance of international peace and security. It recognizes not only the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyberspace, but of international human rights and customary international law more broadly as well. It also advocates for the development of new ways to prevent intellectual property theft, i.e. industrial espionage.\nAnother key theme of the document is the importance of protecting individuals and critical infrastructures from harm. The document presses to safeguard the “public core of the Internet” from hostile actors. This is a clear demonstration of support for a package of norms unveiled by the Global\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n41 Taillat, “Signaling, Victory, and Strategy in France’s Military Cyber Doctrine.”\n42 Parly, “Stratégie Cyber Des Armées (Speech).”\n43 Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n44 Jean-Yves Le Drian, “Déclaration de M.

Reflecting the view of most states on the matter, the Call promotes the exclusive role of sovereign states in hostile acts in cyberspace. It condemns corporate hack-back and other offensive operations from non-state actors. It also appeals for measures preventing interference with elections, another contemporary hot topic.\nClearly absent in the text are issues of espionage and state-lead low-intensity offensive operations. The need to compromise and willingness to gather support across states with various political mindsets means offensive cyber operations was probably out of scope of the Call from its inception.\nc) Multilateralism and stakeholderism\nOn the international stage, one of France's goals relates to the diplomatic process itself. The country seeks to maintain a form of inclusive multilateralism⁴⁸, and in parallel to open-up debates on cyberspace governance to non-state actors.\nIts International Digital Strategy puts great emphasis into promoting an \"open, diverse and trusted\" cyberspace in which it envisions the European Union as a key player⁴⁹. The Strategy itself was subject to public consultations.\nThe Paris Call comes in the wake of the strategy. In addition to its normative nature we detailed earlier, to engage industries and civil society, the document also promotes everyday good practices (\"cyber hygiene\") and the implementation of \"security by design\" in products and services. It is not the first initiative of its kind. In April 2018, Microsoft launched its \"Digital Peace\" campaign⁵⁰ along with a \"Cybersecurity Tech Accord\"⁵¹ aimed at getting the internet and the technology industry to better protect their customers' privacy and security against cyberattacks. Similarly, Siemens unveiled in May 2018 a \"Charter of Trust\" that seeks to develop adherence to security principles and processes, with the aim of developing a \"global standard\" for cybersecurity⁵².\nUntil those recent developments, norm-building initiatives were the prerogative of states. In 2015, the U.N.'s Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recognized that international humanitarian law applied to cyberspace⁵³, though it then deadlocked when at the end of 2017. Although a new process was put in place for 2019 up to 2021, the two blocs—one group led by the United States and another by China and Russia—are unlikely to solve the stalemate.\nApproaching the issue from various stakeholders' perspectives, the Paris Call is an attempt to move away from this international deadlock. Macron, at its unveiling at UNESCO, made the case for rebuffing what he described as a binary choice between \"a Californian Internet and a Chinese\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nInternet\"54. So far, he argued, these two opposite narratives have monopolized the debate and imposed two radically different yet unsatisfactory alternatives: either a model of mere technical governance led by Silicon Valley, or an overwhelming regulation led by authoritarian regimes. While the former does not address issues of privacy and malicious actors, the latter cracks down on human rights and could lead to a \"balkanisation\" of internet and of wider cyberspace55.\nAccording to Le Monde, Microsoft first approached the French government to obtain its support for the Tech Accord56. However, the country found the Accord too narrow and industry-oriented. Recognizing a trend of norms fragmentation coupled with diplomatic deadlocks, France saw an opportunity to take the lead on governance. But this was only possible if the call achieved two things: First, it needed to widen the scope of existing sector-specific initiatives (Tech Accord, GGE, For The Web) into meaningful norms all actors could get behind. Second, it needed to gather and federate existing initiatives, otherwise it would just contribute to the further fragmentation of norms. So far the call seems to have mostly succeeded, with a notable caveat among state signatories.\nAmong the 64 state signatories, European countries are the most heavily present. However, almost every continent is represented: among them we find Qatar, South Korea, Mexico, Japan, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Senegal and New-Zealand. Critically, on release day, key potential signatories such as India or Brazil are not on the list. The absence of such countries may become problematic. While the U.S. (at least for now), China and Russia are unlikely to join, the Call will rely on support from States like India and Brazil in order to gain traction within international institutions, primarily the United Nations. Macron, aware of this challenge, suggested that the Internet Governance Forum—a U.N. event—become responsible for monitoring the effective implementation of the call and be moved under the direct supervision of the U.N. Secretary General57.\nThe document has already drawn support from influential non-governmental groups. The World Leadership Alliance, Chatham House, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Internet Society have committed to its principles. Technical governance bodies, such as the Number Resource Organization and the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre—the region's internet registry—expressed interest too. Powerful business lobbies are another prominent group of signatories, including notably, Indian business guilds such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Internet and Mobile Association of India and the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum. In total, as many as 300 universities, NGOs and professional associations have committed to the call.\nIn the industrial landscape, France succeeded in attracting both major initiatives: The Tech Accord and the Charter of Trust represent a significant share of the private-sector signatories, as together they represent 85 powerful corporations such as Airbus, Cisco and Facebook. But the call is not a mere shell for existing groups. Notable newcomers include Google, Samsung Electronics, Intel Corporation, Kaspersky Lab, Thales and many other companies, ranging from the banking and insurance industries, to law, commerce and defence.\nInitiatives to create norms in cyberspace are multiplying. But more than anything else, these initiatives seem to have fragmented political will and have so far failed to gather support across the board. Emmanuel Macron hopes the Paris Call will bring fresh momentum to the issue by mounting support from influential parties, notably Silicon Valley's top companies and emerging powers. The Call is\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n54 Anonymous, \"IGF 2018 Speech by French President Emmanuel Macron,\" Text, Internet Governance Forum, November 14, 2018, https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/igf-2018-speech-by-french-president-emmanuel-macron.\n55 Cattaruzza et al., \"Sovereignty in Cyberspace.\"\n56 \"La France veut relancer les négociations sur la paix dans le cyberespace.\"\n57 Anonymous, \"IGF 2018 Speech by French President Emmanuel Macron.\"\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nrestrained in scope, avoiding the most sensitive activities such as espionage and offensive operations, but this restraint makes it more likely to receive support across a wider group of stakeholders. It is far from a silver bullet; rather it offers a fresh starting point and framework for further negotiations on values and norms of behaviour in cyberspace.\nFigure 1 - The pyramid of means (centre) and their respective objectives (right).\nOverall, the objectives of French cyber security and defence are three-fold: Actively discourage adversaries through a declaratory strategy that includes offensive operations, limit the escalation potential of crises by sanctuarising core infrastructures, and promote a third way model to cyberspace governance.\n## 2. Threat perception\nA state's perception of threats is based on a variety of factors: strategic goals, history and precedent, one's perception of its own weaknesses and dependencies$^{58}$. It is a key concept within rational models such as the one Allison and Zelikow describe. While France approached cybersecurity issues from a dominantly technical perspective at its beginnings, Desforges argues, it shifted towards a model that goes beyond security and defence issues$^{59}$. The Snowden leaks, the rise of jihadist propaganda and the increasingly geopolitical impact of major attacks pushed France to consider broader societal challenges and actors in defining its strategies and policies.\n$^{58}$ Raymond Cohen, “Threat Perception in International Crisis,” *Political Science Quarterly* 93, no. 1 (1978): 93, https://doi.org/10/d95kwg.\n$^{59}$ Alix Desforges, “Approche Géopolitique Du Cyberespace, Enjeux Pour La Défense et La Sécurité Nationale, l’exemple de La France” (Université Paris 8 - Vincennes / Saint-Denis, 2018).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Threat realisation centred around technology and intelligence (2008-2013)\nThe 2008 White Paper$^{(a)}$ mentions Internet in its first chapter, but first as an example of a positive trend, highlighting the rise in connectedness of people around the world. The other side of the coin, it later states, is the challenge of keeping up with the high-paced spread of information and ideas, in other words information control and propaganda. The Paper also dedicates a full-page box to serious cyberattacks detailing the full CIA spectrum. While it does not mention the attacks on Estonia, the Paper foresees such attacks will be multiplying in the following 15 years and considers the risk of a large-scale attack on its critical infrastructures a major threat. It mentions \"cyberwar\" as one of the scenarios which could involve the Atlantic Alliance. In consequence, the Paper mandates 1) a switch from a passive to active defence model, 2) the development of offensive cyber capabilities, strategy and doctrine all focusing on adversarial military systems.\nIt is the very first time France acknowledges cyber threats and decides to act on them in a national public policy document. The Paper also creates a new strategic role for the armed forces known as \"knowledge and anticipation\".\nFigure 2\nStrategic and prospective policy documents in context (yellow, red and green).

It ambitions to dedicate more human and financial resources to intelligence and operational capabilities, mandates the creation of a cyber reserve force and calls for a broad societal effort from international cooperation to training and public awareness.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nb) Broadening to societal challenges and capabilities build-up (2013-2015)\nThe 2013 White Paper mandated the creation of a national doctrine for major cyber threats response: a coordinated defensive posture mixed with a graduated response from diplomatic, judicial and law enforcement powers to military means when vital interests are at stake. The strategic mission “knowledge and anticipation”, created in 2008, now includes information control in its widest sense (maîtrise de l’information), from trends in cryptography to intelligence gathering and critical infrastructure security. A joint doctrine puts in place a strategic anticipation group which is tasked with mid-term (one to two years) prospective on operational preparedness, military intelligence and international relations[62]. Most critically, the Paper contains France’s official recognition of cyberspace as an operational domain by stating that “cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own”. This is two years after the United States[63] and three years before NATO[64].\n## “Cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own.”\nThe ensuing pluriannual defence finance law (LPM, 2014-2019) set-out an operational cyberdefence chain integrated to conventional military operations. It reiterated the need for both defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, granting overall 1 billion EUR to cyberdefence.\nIn 2015, the Digital Security Strategy stated that a serious threat (“atteinte significative”) to French citizens data could constitute a national security matter, notably in the context of espionage, propaganda or political destabilisation[65]. The complete shutdown of news channel TV5 Monde that year represented a moment of reckoning for the country’s security agencies, while the leaking of documents stolen from the Macron campaign on the eve of the 2017 election sounded alarm bells at the possibility of foreign meddling in domestic politics, echoing the Clinton campaign.\nc) Institutional and doctrinal military structuring (2017-2019)\nThe 2017 Review emphasises the increasing role of Internet and digital giants (GAFAM, Baidu) on geopolitics and sovereignty, as well as on “strategic intimidation” facilitated by the combination of economic, military and informational pressures such as territorial fait-accompli and mass social network trolling. It also mentions the risk of escalation in cyber and space conflicts, not the least because of first strike temptations. Currently, ANSSI states “destabilisation, espionage and sabotage” as the primary threats it faces[66].\nThe Cyberdefence Review dedicates a significant part (32 pages) to the evolution of the threat landscape. It relies on the “new normal” scenario to highlight the risks brought by quantum\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\ncomputers, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. It concludes that their level of security will be determining factors for societal safety⁶⁸.\nThe next LPM (2019-2025) reflects this evolution of French threat perception and the impetus granted to the “knowledge and anticipation” mission of the armed forces. The defence budget for 2019 amounts to 35,9 billion EUR, or 1.82% of GDP, pensions excluded⁶⁹. It is planned to increase over the next four years, reaching 44 billion EUR and 2% of GDP in 2023⁷⁰. In 2019, intelligence and cyberdefence constitute already 73% of the Ministry’s hiring effort (+450 personnel in total)⁷¹. By 2025, the armed forces are expected to count on 4000 so-called cyber-combatants, which represent an increase of 25% over six years⁷². Cyberdefence will receive over this period a budget of 1.6 billion Euros, excluding payroll⁷³.\n***\nOver the past decade, France went through three main major evolution stages in its cyber security and defence structuring: threat realisation (2008-2011), capabilities build-up (2013-2015) and an institutional and doctrinal military structuring accompanied by a strong diplomatic impetus (2017-2019). The recently released offensive doctrine is the culmination of this deep transformation. It particularly represents a turning point for the armed forces, breaking offensive operations from their intelligence silo. The wording of the document and of the accompanying speech by Minister Parly also represents a less veiled signal to Russia, a message France had previously been reluctant to send publicly. The Paris Call, in parallel, is an unprecedented attempt at bringing states, major corporations and the civil society together around key values and principles.\n&gt; “France aims to promote international rules and stability [...] to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks [...] to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion.”\nOverall, France aims to promote international rules and stability in the cyber domain to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks room to manoeuvre to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion. Such balance is and will remain delicate, which only reinforces the need for a better understanding of actors’ rationales and policy coordination.\n# Chapter II – Relevant organisations, their goals and capabilities\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n⁶⁸ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.” P.31.\n⁶⁹ Ministère des Armées, “Communiqué - Budget 2019 : LPM année 1,” September 25, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/communaute-defense/communique-du-ministere-des-armees_-budget-2019-lpm-annee-1.\n⁷⁰ Ministère des Armées.\n⁷¹ Ministère des Armées.\n⁷² Ministère des Armées, “Guide Explicitatif: Les Réserves Cyber,” November 15, 2016, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/491674/7859279/file/20161115_EMACYBER_Guide_explicitatif.pdf.\n⁷³ Ministère des Armées, “Projet de Loi Relatif à La Programmation Militaire Pour Les Années 2019 à 2025 et Portant Diverses Dispositions Intéressant La Défense,” February 6, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/523150/8769279/file/LPM%202019-2025%20-%20Rapport%20annexe.pdf.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFollowing the organisational behaviour model of Allison and Zelikow, we now turn to the main institutional players in cyber security and defence. As we will see, the offence / defence separation principle impact deeply the institutions goals, capabilities and culture.\n1. ANSSI\na) Status, history and relationship with SGDSN\nIn response to the 2008 White Paper, the National Cyber Security Agency, abbreviated in French as ANSSI, was established a year later under the Prime Minister's General Secretary for Defence and National Security (SGDSN). It is a service that exercises national authority on the security of information systems⁷⁴.\nWhile SGDSN is in charge of security issues at large, ANSSI deals with digital affairs widely. It has a specific focus on cybersecurity, but in its widest sense: ANSSI supports the private sector, helps draft France foreign policy on digital issues and works on societal resilience. For instance, its Cyber Anticipation Cell is currently tasked with securing the Paris Olympics 2024⁷⁵. Acting as a strategy, policy and plans cell (J5, in military jargon), its main responsibilities is to advise decision-makers. This difference of scope between ANSSI and SGDSN explains why the Agency reports to the Secretary-General directly (the person), and not the Secretariat-General (as in, the institution)⁷⁶.\nWhy is not ANSSI directly attached to the Prime Minister then? Because belonging to SGDSN provides the Agency with institutional protection against potentially hindering senior civil servants in higher spheres of the government⁷⁷. Indeed, SGDSN reports to the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General is a permanent member of the presidential Defence Councils.\nIts predecessor, the Central Directory for Information Systems Security (DCSSI) was created in 2001 also under the SGDSN, and was itself the successor to the Central Service for Information Systems Security, which existed since 1986. Despite its new name and national authority status, ANSSI has thus deep historical roots.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n⁷⁴ “Décret N° 2009-834 Du 7 Juillet 2009 Portant Création d’un Service à Compétence Nationale Dénommé « Agence Nationale de La Sécurité Des Systèmes d’information »,” 2009-834 § (2009).\n⁷⁵ Emmanuel Germain, ANSSI Deputy Director, Paris, June 27, 2019.\n⁷⁶ Germain.\n⁷⁷ Germain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFigure 3 - The missions and actors of French cyberdefence (Desforges 2018).\nb) Responsibilities\nANSSI has responsibility for coordination of the state's cyber security, hosts the national Computer Emergency Response Team and acts as a regulatory body for the public and private sector alike, primarily for critical infrastructure operators. It plays an unequal role in all six missions of French cyber defence as described in the 2018 Cyber Defence Strategy: cyber threat prevention, anticipation, protection, detection, attribution and reaction. The latter entails technical remediation as well as legal and military action. Alix Desforges78 clarified some of the responsibility sharing that the Cyber Defence Strategy sets-out. While prevention is a cross-government and multistakeholder assignment (ministries, local security representatives, chambers of commerce), anticipation is in essence a threat intelligence task fulfilled by ANSSI and intelligence agencies. Protection (defensive cyber operations and measures) and detection remain the responsibility of ANSSI and its subsidiaries, especially when it comes to private critical infrastructure operators. Attribution of attacks is a joint ANSSI and intelligence services task, while reaction (remediation) is another mission that benefits from subsidiarity.\nThe recognition of cyberspace as a domain of conflict in the 2013 White Paper comes with a new finance law. The 2014-2019 LPM contained two key measures to widen the capabilities of ANSSI. First, it created heavy regulatory obligations on critical infrastructure operators, public and private alike, in terms of their network and industrial control system security, threat detection capabilities and penetration testing, which ANSSI can now perform79. In light of such new powers, it also granted ANSSI with derogations80 with regards to the French Computer Misuse Act81. According to its Deputy Director, ANSSI deals with around 20 attacks from APTs every year82; and these are only those that are detected.\nc) People, identity and organisational culture\nANSSI brings together experts, practitioners and strategists in seven different laboratories and departments. Its two most prominent organisational traits are its exclusive defensive purpose, and its start-up spirit.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFirst, as we described earlier, ANSSI's identity relies mostly on its exclusive defensive purpose. This is the foundation of the French model. Its Director Guillaume Poupard regularly insists on this feature, which seems to infuse very deeply into its operations. Tools that could be dual-use (i.e. for both defensive and offensive purposes) are separately developed at both DGSE (for offense) and ANSSI (for defence), even if it duplicates the effort[83]. However, because of the high pressure on its human resources, DGSE and ANSSI are pooling and sharing their people and increasingly\n# Of a defensive culture by nature and legal status, [ANSSI] is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need.\nsharing intelligence[84]. The separation between offense and defence is thus institutional and not absolute. Second, the Agency enjoys describing itself as a start-up, at least in its spirit[85]. This tag however hides large disparities in its workforce: 80% are temporary staff, with a mean age of 30 years old[86]. The remaining 20% are the managers, mostly military or civilian engineers[87]. Overall, the mean age is of 34 years[88].\nOf a defensive culture by nature and legal status, it is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need. Although its nature and role is less ambiguous than its Anglo-Saxon peers (GCHQ, NSA) its responsibilities make its activities deeply intertwined with those of intelligence agencies, primarily DGSE.\n## 2. Armed Forces and the intelligence community\nThe armed forces play a role in all six cyber security and defence missions we highlighted just below. While they are in charge of defending only their own systems, they have heightened responsibilities with regards to anticipation, detection, attribution and reaction. But each organisation has specific tasks and roles.\n### a) Organisation of military cyber operations\nThe armed forces learned to perform cyber operations \"as they went\", developing capabilities and skills as they needed[89]. The 2008 White Paper however was a major doctrinal disruption[90], as well as a wake-up call in the aftermath of the Estonian attacks. In addition to the following White Paper and LPM, the then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian launched in 2014 the Cyber Defence Pact. This additional policy document set-out the overall structuring of military cyber defence through six pillars:\n- Hardening the security of its own information and weapon systems,\n- Anticipating technical disruptions by investing in research and development,\n- Reinforcing and structuring human resources dedicated to cyberdefence,\n- Developing a national centre of excellence in Brittany,\n- Reinforcing cooperation with allies in Europe and the Atlantic Alliance,\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n- Fostering a national cyberdefence community and network of trusted partners.\nAs a follow-up to the 2017 Review and as a further step to this military structuring, the Armed Forces ministry established a Cyber Defence Command to coordinate cyber operations within the armed forces. ComCyber, as it is colloquially known, sits directly under the Joint Chief of Staff. Defensively, it serves as an hypervision body, a concept that has a specific meaning in that context:91 it receives and correlates all relevant data related to its systems' security. However, in accordance with a recently released ministerial instruction92, each corps and service remains responsible for its own defensive cyber operations and has its own SOC (Security Operations Centre)93. CALID, the Ministry's SOC, assesses global cyber risk so that ComCyber is able to act and advise political authorities to the best of their knowledge. In other words, defensive cyber operations are modelled on subsidiarity.\nFigure 4 - Simplified graph of military cyber operations, broke-down by their offensive or defensive nature.\nComCyber performs defensive operations by delegation of ANSSI, and must notify the Agency of them94. Consequently, and because both institutions need to share data between each other, CALID is partly co-located with ANSSI. ANSSI typically shares non-military IoCs and ComCyber military ones that may impact civilian systems95. This cooperation and the wider relationship between ANSSI and ComCyber is defined in a specific protocol96.\nNew capabilities for the armed forces: Integrating the cyber domain in conventional and influence operations\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe defensive cyber doctrine entails the prevention, anticipation, detection of and protection against cyber attacks⁹⁷. The scope of the doctrine is limited to reacting to and attributing the attack — within defensive and non-military measures. To perform these tasks, the doctrine sets up an adaptive Permanent Cyber Security Posture, orienting France’s military cyber units to be prepared for what the summary describes as a “peace-crisis-war” continuum⁹⁸. The document thus seems to acknowledge what has been described as a state of unpeace, a state of hostility that falls short of full conflict⁹⁹. This defensive policy is the result of Ministerial Instruction 101000 (Joint Doctrine 3.20)¹⁰⁰. Thus, it covers the whole Ministry and not merely the armed forces.¹⁰¹\nFigure 5\nCovers of the offensive and defensive cyber operations documents.\nIn contrast, the offensive doctrine is only relevant to the armed forces.\nUntil the release of this document, the armed forces had focused on defending their own systems—although with an understood element of active defence—while DGSE was in charge of the most sensitive operations, namely, espionage and disruption of adverse systems.\nWhat is new in the offensive doctrine is the integration of cyber activity in conventional military operations. The offensive approach is described as stealthy actions aimed at denying the availability or\nconfidentiality of adverse systems. Implicitly, the doctrine seems to exclude operations with destructive kinetic effects. It mentions the neutralization of enemy systems, but the concept is ambiguous. Offensive operations can prepare or complement conventional operations—acting as a force multiplier—or substitute them entirely where appropriate. The offensive doctrine also includes counterinfluence operations, aimed at protecting conventional action in cyberspace. Such operations are already performed in the conventional domain through the CIAE, or Joint Centre for Environmental Action, the military influence and civil-military cooperation branch of the French armed forces that was created in 2012. This doctrinal shift reflects an increased perception by the armed forces of propaganda and disinformation threats that could hamper its conventional deployments.\nThe new offensive cyber doctrine expands and details the scope of offensive cyber operations. It assumes their preparation and conduct, not only in a clandestine context but also as an integral part of -or substitute for- conventional military operations¹⁰². As we noted however, it also imposes constraints and rules of engagement on the basis of a strict risk management.\nb) DGSE\nDGSE is the foreign security service and additionally serves as France’s main signals intelligence agency. It sits directly under the Armed Forces Ministry. Until 2014, not much was known publicly by\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nDGSE's activities in the cyber domain. Offensive and espionage operations were deemed to be its responsibilities, but these has been absent from public sight, until forensic analysis¹⁰³ and Snowden-leaks published by Le Monde¹⁰⁴ unveiled a diverse panel of advanced malwares (Casper, Bunny, Babar, Dino) attributed to a French intelligence agency. The leaks seem to have broken an internal taboo. A former DGSE executive, Bernard Barbier, shed some light on such operations shortly after, admitting the agency \"started hacking in 1992\"¹⁰⁵.\nc) DGA\nDGA, the Defence Procurement Agency, has long developed a cybersecurity department, which sits into its \"maîtrise de l'information\" branch. It is tasked with protecting the information and weapon systems of the armed forces, providing technical expertise in threat intelligence, upstream research (also known as discovery stage) and crisis support¹⁰⁶. As part of such responsibilities, it conducts vulnerability research on armed forces' systems¹⁰⁷ and since 2015 organises cyber-wargames¹⁰⁸.\nThe offensive doctrine indicated DGA will adapt its procurement processes to take into account the tempo of operations and nature of these weapons¹⁰⁹. Current processes designed to procure vehicles or submarines, or even major software programs, would be ill-suited. This may hint at the creation of an ad hoc procurement process designed from the ground up to research vulnerabilities and develop exploits and payloads.\n3. Competition and opposition of views\nParochial priorities and perceptions of the respective institutions depend mostly on the structuring of the cyber security and defence apparatus, which core principle is offense-defence separation.\na) Opposition of views between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA\nThe opposition of views or the impact of parochial competition appears most clearly between ANSSI and the armed forces, on two different issues: vulnerability disclosure and end-to-end encryption.\nContrary to the U.S. or, more recently, the U.K., France has no public vulnerability equities process (VEP). Currently, disclosure and sharing between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA is not formalised and happens on a case-by-case basis¹¹⁰. Guillaume Poupard, ANSSI director, communicated briefly about vulnerability research and disclosure at the agency's end-of-year report. In practice, Poupard said, in case of doubt as to the balance of risk, \"the vulnerability goes to the defence\"¹¹¹.

Although there is no obvious conflict of views on that topic, the debate on the right risk balancing illustrates well how each agencies' responsibilities and culture influences their stance in critical debates such as this one.\nWe can witness a more obvious conflict of views on the encryption debate. Poupard, circulated within the government in March 2016 a note arguing strongly against \"exceptional access\" legislation, which would allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bypass encryption, either on device or in transit. The Parliament of Australia recently passed such a law, not without public outcry¹¹⁴. In his note, Poupard states:\n“To impose a wide weakening of cryptographic means would affect both digital safety and the freedom of the large majority of law-abiding users, while remaining ineffective against the intended minority target.”\nIt appears that, at the time, DGSE was voicing its concerns against encryption¹¹⁵. In 2018, the head of its technical services, Patrick Pailloux, promoted publicly the idea of in-transit exceptional access, while reaffirming the importance of strong (but not end-to-end by definition) encryption¹¹⁶. It is thus likely that Poupard’s note was a direct rebuke to DGSE’s pressures. In such case, it may be a good example of two principles edited by Allison and Zelkow. First, that where you stand depends on where you sit. Less colloquially known as “the face of the issue differs from seat to seat”¹¹⁷, it explains that, as the head of a defensive agency open to the wider public and private sector, it is expected that its director will oppose the weakening of end-to-end encryption. On the opposite, it is expected that DGSE will seek to extend its interception capabilities, as a signals intelligence agency dedicated to foreign security. Second, this “row” may also be the result of the “51-49 principle”. Even if one isn’t completely convinced by the side of the argument, they must “argue much more confidently than they would if they were detached judges”¹¹⁸ because of parochial competition.\nb) The role of Foreign Affairs and its relationship with other actors.\nThe International Digital Strategy (December 2017) was released only a few months before the Cyber Defence Review (February 2018). Presented as “France’s international strategy”, it could be potentially interpreted as a willingness of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to defend its prerogative in that area. In May 2017, Jean-Yves Le Drian had become Foreign Affairs Minister after almost five years at the Defence Ministry. Although it may have been perceived as such by some in the Armed Forces Ministry¹¹⁹, the international strategy was actually two-years in the making¹²⁰, a long process due in part to its submission to public review. As for the Paris Call, the initiative came from the Cybersecurity and Strategic Affairs division, which then pushed it through to the Minister, who ensured political\nMacron dans les locaux de la DGA-MI à Bruz :pic.twitter.com/elKwQM0k9w,” #WarGames on Twitter (blog), April 15, 2019, https://twitter.com/amaelle_g/status/1117803882032304128.\n¹¹² Guiton.\n¹¹³ Guiton.\n¹¹⁴ Catherine Chapman, “Australian Cybersecurity Industry Reels over Anti-Encryption Law,” The Daily Swig | Web security digest, January 25, 2019, https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/australian-cybersecurity-industry-reels-over-anti-encryption-law.\n¹¹⁵ A ComCyber official, April 18, 2019.\n¹¹⁶ Valéry Marchive, “Le renseignement aime le chiffrement, mais il veut bien des points de clair,” LeMagIT, July 4, 2018, https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252444227/Le-renseignement-aimé-le-chiffrement-mais-il-veut-bien-des-points-de-clair.\n¹¹⁷ Allison and Zelikow, Essence of Decision.

It is a very tentative chapter, because of time and interview constraints. To complete the analysis, more interviews should be conducted at higher political levels.\n## 1) Key individuals in decision and action, and factors influencing their perceptions, preferences and stands\nDuring its annual press conference, ANSSI director stated, on the topic of vulnerabilities disclosure, that in a structure that separates offence and defence, \"the level of where both meet [in the policy-making tree] is very high. It means that sometimes, we must mobilise the highest authorities on these issues\"¹²³.\nBastien Irondelle, in its seminal work on the decision-making process behind the end of French military conscription in 1996, highlighted the everlasting importance of the President.¹²⁴ He detailed how the political impetus Jacques Chirac gave to this major policy decision, in particular during the Defence Councils, made the reform happen¹²⁵. We have demonstrated so far that in the case at hand, French cyber security and defence, the evolution has been gradual, taking place over a decade. However, the same key individuals and processes remain.\nIn practice, the range of meaningful decision-making in cyber security and defence starts at ministerial cabinets, up to the Prime Minister and the President¹²⁶. Major crisis and policy decisions are taken at the presidential level, during Defence Councils.¹²⁷ ANSSI is represented by the SGDSN, ComCyber by the Joint Chief of Staff,¹²⁸ who remains responsible for the military action chain¹²⁹.\nThe Cyber Club identified by Desforges still exists today and brings together the directors of ANSSI, DGA, ComCyber and the technical departments of both domestic and foreign intelligence agencies (DGSI, DGSE)¹³⁰.\nAnother noteworthy trend is the overwhelming majority of military profiles among ANSSI executives. Out of the seven directors and deputy-directors, five have spent most of their careers in the armed forces¹³¹. Such numbers however hide some atypical career paths: the deputy director is a military engineer with a doctorate in public law and an MBA.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n¹²³ Guiton, \"[Thread] [Team #Wargames] Comment est gérée la question des vulnérabilités dites 'zero-day' en France, où on sépare les missions d'attaque et de défense ?

Because of the number of involved actors and their overlap in each mission, the Strategy established four “operational chains” to centralize and streamline public action in the field. They are referred to as the protection, intelligence, judicial investigations and military-action chains. While it is still unclear how these chains work in practice, we were able to collect more information on the committees and groups that coordinate cyber security and defence policy, in theory and in practice.\n### a) Recently formalised processes\nThe Cyber Strategy created two new committees: An Executive Committee, under the President’s Office, and a Steering Committee, under the SGDSN. Political decisions and policy orientations related to cyberdefence are taken during meetings of the National Security and Defence Council. The Executive Committee is tasked with high-level implementation of the Council’s decisions.\nThe Steering Committee’s responsibility is to report on the Strategy’s implementation to the Prime Minister and to prepare the meetings of the Executive Committee[132]. It meets every semester. SGDSN transmits the impetus of political leadership, sets the agenda and ensures the application of the previously decided measures[133]. Ministries and agencies are free to bring forward suggestions[134].\nAdditionally, a Cyber Crisis Coordination Centre “supervises cyberdefence”[135] and informs decision-makers. The Centre consists of different groups that act at various timelines, even though their names suggest a short-term crisis perimeter. While the Technical Group acts on short-term incidents, Strategy is a “sub-political”[136] group that acts on mid-term strategy to prepare steering committee meetings. It is open to other ministries,[137] of which most individuals present are administration directors (directeurs d’administration centrale)[138]. They offer regular situation reports to the Prime Minister and the President, and suggests policy options. They meet monthly[139]. The Technico-Operational Group (TechOps), on the other hand, is a restricted group with few institutions represented. Its main purpose is to share specific threat intelligence, and it thus open to only a handful of intelligence agencies[140].\n### b) Importance of informal coordination processes\nTechOps is only very briefly described in official documents[141]. However it reminds of the “Cyber Club” Alix Desforges described in her thesis[142]. This informal grouping of agency heads took another dimension with the writing process of the Cyber Strategy. According to an official[143], the writing\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nprocess itself greatly enhanced communication between relevant stakeholders. In other words, the process of creating processes, enhanced communication and coordination between actors. At its creation, TechOps the people and institutions involved warmly welcomed it, and it quickly became indispensable$^{144}$. Some degree of informality remains today. In addition to what we have already described, informal ad-hoc meetings keep happening to deal with specific issues.\n***\nWhen it comes to formal processes, the highest political authorities remain in charge of major policy-decisions. Informal meetings have lead to the formalisation of intelligence sharing and mid to low level policy coordination.\n*\n*\n# Conclusion\nFrom its sovereign principles to the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence institutions, France revendicates an atypical model. At the top, strategic autonomy infuses major political, financial and policy decisions. Domestically, although officials strongly reaffirm the separation of offence and defence activities, in practice such separation can be described as institutional at best, due to the fluidity of human resources between agencies. This separation has nonetheless a genuine impact on policy-making and public debates: differences in parochial priorities and organisational cultures between ANSSI and the armed forces create conflicting views on tough topics such as end-to-end encryption or vulnerability disclosure. Finally, while the executive remains key in decision-making, informal processes and meta-processes have been instrumental in the development of an efficient state cyber security and defence community. To complete and build-up on this exploratory paper, further research on how such processes work out in practice could be conducted.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# GLOSSARY (non-exhaustive)\n807 CTRS: 807th Transmission Company.

France is no exception. We have seen in recent months a revival of its efforts to secure its citizens and interests in cyber space. French President Emmanuel Macron presented in late 2018 the \"Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace\", a package of norms of good behaviour bringing together states, private corporations and the civil society. All the while, in the past two years, the government designed its very first Cyber Defence Strategy and the Armed Forces unveiled some elements of their offensive and defensive cyber operations. How can we make sense of it all?\nWe frame the current picture by following Allison and Zelikow's three conceptual models of decision-making: Rational actor, organisational behaviour, and government politics. In accordance with each model, we seek to answer the following questions, respectively:\nR1: What are the underlying principles, goals and objectives of French national defence and security, in general terms and in the cyber domain?\nR2: What are the institutions involved in cyber security and defence, their perimeters of action and organisational culture?\nR3: What are the processes and individuals involved in cyber security and defence policy-making at the politico-strategic level?\nTo do so we combine an extensive review of the literature with a series of interviews with senior French officials from ministries, as well as national agencies and other specialised institutions.\n# Objectives and limitations\nThe objective of this paper is three-fold: describing, explaining and, by extension, predicting. First, we hope to provide a better understanding of the current French cyber security and defence policy picture its founding political and doctrinal principles. Second, by applying Allison and Zelikow's models to this picture, we seek to explain how policy-making in this area happens in practice. This approach diverges slightly from the models' original purpose, which is to analyse a specific case-study and its cluster of decisions (\"Why did the Soviets smuggle nuclear missiles into Cuba?\" \"Why did the US respond by imposing a naval blockade?\"). This paper does not ambition to explain why France launched the Paris Call or why it published parts of the armed forces' offensive cyber operations doctrine. Scholars and journalists have already started answering them. Rather, it seeks to provide a toolkit so that scholars, practitioners or journalists can design more accurate hypotheses about why future decision X or Y was taken in that domain. There is no doubt this toolkit will be incomplete and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nimperfect. Not all policy documents are public, some processes and institutions are still recent, and we lack the ability to stand back so that we can grasp how some processes work-out in practice. Another obstacle is that these principles, policies, doctrines, processes and institutions live through the minds and acts of leaders, policy-makers and practitioners, whom the author has not been able to all interview. In particular, the author was unable to meet officials from SGDSN itself, the Élysée Palace and Prime Minister's Office. This is where the work of Bastien Irondelle becomes key. The third -indirect- objective of this paper, is prediction. As Allison and Zelikow highlight, it is “the logical flipside of explanations”. If we understand more accurately the processes and factors that lead to decisions, we can extrapolate about future events. The predictive power of the model will however be highly dependent on the strength of its explanatory qualities.\n## Acknowledgement and appreciation\nThe author is grateful to IRSEM for hosting him and the warm welcome.

This is the rational actor model. In our case, France is the identified state. More often than not, political cycles lead to new policies and strategies. When relevant, the state thus becomes personified, in relation to a specific presidency. In this model we adopt a bounded rationality viewpoint, whereas we accept that “values, beliefs and stereotypes” play a role in the actors’ rationality.\n## 1. Political concepts, principles and goals\nIn this first part we analyse France’s core political concepts of sovereignty and strategic autonomy, the rationale behind the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence apparatus, and the one behind its communication and attribution stance.\n### a. France’s sovereignty, national and European strategic autonomy\nFrance has a conceptualisation of sovereignty that makes it stand out of its peers. Baezner and Robin found in their comparative analysis that “France was unique among the states examined in that it used the word “sovereignty” more frequently and in different contexts”. Sovereignty, in its French understanding, cannot be restrained to hard sovereignty, i.e. the protection of its citizens, borders and other existential interests. French sovereignty is a wide spectrum that implies strategic autonomy. The 2017 Strategic Review defines strategic autonomy as a two pillar concept entailing 1) a high level of industrial and technological autonomy, and 2) an operational autonomy. On technological autonomy, the Ministry of the Armed Forces has recently ramped up its strategy, with the creation of a dedicated investment fund, DefInvest. Its first investments were made in microprocessors and high precision optics manufacturers. Operational autonomy means the ability to reach an informed decision and to take action, in particular in the context of political or military crises. The French military operation in Mali, for instance, is a good illustration of operational autonomy: the ability to engage in full scope – low to high intensity– operations, with allies or on its own if necessary.\nFrench strategic autonomy can be best described as neo-Gaullist. It is characterised by a strong sense of national independence but recognises the need for a powerful political Europe. Its historical drivers and roots come indeed from a traditional Gaullist doctrine of national autonomy, which is more self-reliant. The perceived need for self-reliance played a major role in driving De Gaulle to transform France into a nuclear power and to leave NATO integrated command in 1966. Some key historical events such as the 1940 surrender, the intelligence frustrations of the 1992 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq war further fuelled perceptions that France needed both a credible nuclear arsenal, and autonomous intelligence capabilities.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n---\n Allison and Zelikow.

Claude Faure, “Bref historique des services de renseignement et de sécurité français contemporains,” *Revue historique des armées*, no. 247 (June 15, 2007): 70–81.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThis spirit of autonomy remains today, but with a wider pragmatic recognition of the need for cooperation and integration. France re-joined NATO command in 2009 for mainly pragmatism and influence reasons. However the French nuclear arsenal remains outside of NATO command and its intelligence apparatus outside of the 5-Eyes community. France' strategic autonomy is also reliant on a European strategic autonomy, which it seeks to develop. The Hubert Védrine report recommended that the country's return into NATO command is accompanied by a strengthening of European defence integration and cooperation, especially in the R&amp;D of technological and industrial capacities. It encourages the development of mutual interdependence with entities who share critical interests, particularly within the EU. This policy shift initiated in 1992 with the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy was confirmed in the 2008 White Paper, placing the EU as \"a central tenet of [France's] security policy\". This central place was reaffirmed ever since, including in the last cyber strategy document.\nb) Domestic apparatus: Offense / defence separation\nDomestically, the French approach contrasts with that embraced by the United States or the United Kingdom. Most notably, France assumes a clear separation between offensive and defensive cyber operations. This means that, contrary to the U.S.' National Security Agency (NSA) or the U.K.'s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), France's leading agency for cybersecurity is exclusively dedicated to defensive operations and not part of the intelligence community. This is a defining element of the Cyber Strategy Review and infuses the whole structure of French cyberdefence. The rationale is that having a distinct defensive agency separate from offense-oriented military intelligence agencies \"facilitates the acceptance of state intervention [...] whether in public administration or the economic sphere\".\nc) A counter-threat model based on direct communication rather than public attribution\nPeculiarities of the French model are not limited to its conceptualisation of sovereignty. On the diplomatic stage, France has also adopted a different stance than most of its counterparts. A number of NATO allies are increasingly inclined to \"name and shame\" states involved in cyber attacks. One telling example can be found in October 2018, when the U.S., U.K., Canada and the Netherlands denounced Russian attempts at disrupting the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Paris expressed its solidarity but fell short of blaming Moscow. Already in 2015, when what then seemed to be ISIS took down TV5Monde in a major hack, no official attribution was made. ANSSI, the national cybersecurity agency, however briefed four dozen media outlets with details of its forensic investigation and indicators of compromise. These details were then analysed by private security firms which pointed the finger at persistent threat actor (APT) . Additionally, TV5Monde director Yves Bigot reported in L'Express\n\"France favours red phones over the megaphone.\"\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nthat ANSSI personnel suggested it was a false-flag (\"un leurre\"). More recently, in the case of the #MacronLeaks, France did not issue any kind of attribution either. G. Poupard, head of ANSSI, refused to do so arguing \"the attack was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone\". More recently, the Secretary General for Defence and National Security clarified France's official policy: attribution can only be performed on the basis of elements collected or verified by French services, typically ANSSI and DGSE.\nThis does not mean that it does not have attribution capabilities. As we will see in Chapter II, attributing cyber-attacks is one of the main missions of the French cyberdefence apparatus. But even when it knows, France prefers forthright bilateral dialogues with Russia and other cyber powers such as the U.S., China, India, Brazil and Japan. It appears it even opened a deconfliction cell with the Russian Security Council on cyber matters. Only in last resort will France take part in public name and shame. In other words, it favours red phones over the megaphone.\nThere is only one recorded instance of public attribution, and it is indirect. At the unveiling of the offensive cyber doctrine, Minister Parly revealed that an APT targeted email accounts of high-ranking officials between 2017 and 2018, with the objective of uncovering the navy's oil supply chain. Though the Minister stopped short of explicitly recognizing the group's affiliation with the Russian Federation, she indirectly attributed the attacker's mode of operation to a specific group known as Turla.\nUnder Egloff's definition, France engages in two attribution processes. First a process of sense-making attribution, for the benefit of its own factual understanding, that it rarely communicates publicly. Second, in a meaning-making process, with regards to its adversaries. But again, it does so rather privately than publicly. Overall, French strategy with attribution seem to fit a counter-threat model.\nIn this first part, we have detailed how France conceives its sovereignty and what it means by strategic autonomy. We have also sought to explain its rationale behind the offence / defence separation and to describe its policy of non-public attribution.\n## 2. The evolution and granularization of objectives of French cyber security and defence\nIn this second part we review the cyber security and defence objectives produced by political and military authorities, from 2011 to 2019. We identify three main themes: active discouragement, risk limitation and direct communication.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe Defence and National Security White Paper 2008 is the first of its kind to mention Internet-related threats and leads to the creation of ANSSI. The Agency releases in 2011 the “National Strategy for the Defence and Security of Information Systems”. It’s four goals are:\n- For France to become a top-tier cyber power,\n- To guarantee freedom of decision through confidentiality of state secrets,\n- To reinforce the security of critical infrastructures,\n- To ensure cybersecurity to public and private actors alike.\nThe second version of the Strategy revolved around 1) state secrets and critical infrastructures, 2) digital privacy and cybercrime, 3) public sensitisation and training, 4) business and export strategies, and 5) Europe, digital sovereignty and norms.\nFollowing the election of Emmanuel Macron to the Presidency, the President requests officially tasks the Armed Forces Ministry to create a panel of experts with a view to write a new defence white paper. The Strategic Review for Defence and National Security, as it is then known, is released in 2017. It promotes digital sovereignty and cybersecurity to top priorities of national defence.\nIn February 2018, the country’s first National Strategy for Cyber Defence clarified both the organization and integration of cyber operations among all government entities as well as the national and international legal framework surrounding their use. It sets-out goals and processes as part of a “robust national cyber security and defence apparatus”.\nThe seven principles underpinning the Strategy are:\n1. To make the security of French information and communication systems a priority,\n2. To embrace a policy of active discouragement and coordinated response,\n3. To fully exercise its digital sovereignty,\n4. To bring an efficient judicial response to cybercriminality,\n5. To promote a shared cybersecurity culture,\n6. To contribute to a trusted and safe digital Europe,\n7. To act internationally for a collective governance of cyberspace.\nTo achieve said goals, the Strategy sets-out a number of policy-making and coordination processes (see Chapter III). In practice, three main themes appear: Active discouragement, risk limitation and multilateralism.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n Services du Premier Ministre, “Stratégie Nationale Pour La Sécurité Du Numérique” (Paris, October 16, 2015), https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/la-strategie-nationale-pour-la-securite-du-numerique-une-reponse-aux-nouveaux-enjeux-des-usages-numeriques/.\n “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n Francois Delerue and Aude Gery, “France’s Cyberdefense Strategic Review and International Law,” Lawfare, March 23, 2018, https://www.lawfareblog.com/frances-cyberdefense-strategic-review-and-international-law.\n In French as « Dispositif national de protection et de défense informatique robuste ». “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n France reserves its concept of deterrence (dissuasion) to the nuclear domain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Active discouragement\nFrance has adopted a posture of active discouragement against advanced threats. It relies on direct communication with the adversary, as we have detailed earlier, and on an increasingly explicit declaratory strategy.\nIn January 2019 Minister Florence Parly unveiled the offensive and defensive cyber operations doctrines of the armed forces. The announcement is the latest and strongest step taken by the country as part of its declaratory strategy. In response to cyber and other threats, France is “not afraid” of using cyber weapons. The country did not wait until then to perform offensive operations or even to publicly admit doing so. Such operations were first mentioned in the 2008 White Paper and then again with more details in 2013. The case for proportional reprisals in response to a major attack was also made clearly by then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian:\n“In times of war, cyber weapons may be the response, or part of our response, to an armed attack [aggression armée], being of a cyber nature or otherwise”.\nb) Risk limitation and infrastructure sanctuarisation\nRisks that are inherent to cyberspace and operations are a recurrent topic in policy documents.\nThe offensive doctrine places great emphasis on the consideration and mitigation of political, legal and military risks. It mandates a risk balancing exercise in the preparation and conduct of offensive operations: against the risk of escalation in an asymmetric environment, or against the risk of collateral or indirect damage on civilian infrastructures. This balancing exercise – and the need not to reveal too much details – may be the reason the doctrine does not clearly mention physical destruction of information systems.\nInternationally, France aims to promote existing institutional mechanisms to “limit hacking and destabilising activities” in cyberspace, notably through an international initiative, the “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace”, unveiled in November 2018.\nIn terms of international law, the document encourages more extensive and better coordinated regulation of cyberspace in the spirit of founding principles of the U.N. Charter, notably the maintenance of international peace and security. It recognizes not only the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyberspace, but of international human rights and customary international law more broadly as well. It also advocates for the development of new ways to prevent intellectual property theft, i.e. industrial espionage.\nAnother key theme of the document is the importance of protecting individuals and critical infrastructures from harm. The document presses to safeguard the “public core of the Internet” from hostile actors. This is a clear demonstration of support for a package of norms unveiled by the Global\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nCommission for the Stability of Cyberspace on Nov. 8 in Singapore. Reflecting the view of most states on the matter, the Call promotes the exclusive role of sovereign states in hostile acts in cyberspace. It condemns corporate hack-back and other offensive operations from non-state actors. It also appeals for measures preventing interference with elections, another contemporary hot topic.\nClearly absent in the text are issues of espionage and state-lead low-intensity offensive operations. The need to compromise and willingness to gather support across states with various political mindsets means offensive cyber operations was probably out of scope of the Call from its inception.\nc) Multilateralism and stakeholderism\nOn the international stage, one of France's goals relates to the diplomatic process itself. The country seeks to maintain a form of inclusive multilateralism, and in parallel to open-up debates on cyberspace governance to non-state actors.\nIts International Digital Strategy puts great emphasis into promoting an \"open, diverse and trusted\" cyberspace in which it envisions the European Union as a key player. The Strategy itself was subject to public consultations.\nThe Paris Call comes in the wake of the strategy. In addition to its normative nature we detailed earlier, to engage industries and civil society, the document also promotes everyday good practices (\"cyber hygiene\") and the implementation of \"security by design\" in products and services. It is not the first initiative of its kind. In April 2018, Microsoft launched its \"Digital Peace\" campaign along with a \"Cybersecurity Tech Accord\" aimed at getting the internet and the technology industry to better protect their customers' privacy and security against cyberattacks. Similarly, Siemens unveiled in May 2018 a \"Charter of Trust\" that seeks to develop adherence to security principles and processes, with the aim of developing a \"global standard\" for cybersecurity.\nUntil those recent developments, norm-building initiatives were the prerogative of states. In 2015, the U.N.'s Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recognized that international humanitarian law applied to cyberspace, though it then deadlocked when at the end of 2017. Although a new process was put in place for 2019 up to 2021, the two blocs—one group led by the United States and another by China and Russia—are unlikely to solve the stalemate.\nApproaching the issue from various stakeholders' perspectives, the Paris Call is an attempt to move away from this international deadlock. Macron, at its unveiling at UNESCO, made the case for rebuffing what he described as a binary choice between \"a Californian Internet and a Chinese\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nInternet\"54. So far, he argued, these two opposite narratives have monopolized the debate and imposed two radically different yet unsatisfactory alternatives: either a model of mere technical governance led by Silicon Valley, or an overwhelming regulation led by authoritarian regimes. While the former does not address issues of privacy and malicious actors, the latter cracks down on human rights and could lead to a \"balkanisation\" of internet and of wider cyberspace55.\nAccording to Le Monde, Microsoft first approached the French government to obtain its support for the Tech Accord56. However, the country found the Accord too narrow and industry-oriented. Recognizing a trend of norms fragmentation coupled with diplomatic deadlocks, France saw an opportunity to take the lead on governance. But this was only possible if the call achieved two things: First, it needed to widen the scope of existing sector-specific initiatives (Tech Accord, GGE, For The Web) into meaningful norms all actors could get behind. Second, it needed to gather and federate existing initiatives, otherwise it would just contribute to the further fragmentation of norms. So far the call seems to have mostly succeeded, with a notable caveat among state signatories.\nAmong the 64 state signatories, European countries are the most heavily present. However, almost every continent is represented: among them we find Qatar, South Korea, Mexico, Japan, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Senegal and New-Zealand. Critically, on release day, key potential signatories such as India or Brazil are not on the list. The absence of such countries may become problematic. While the U.S. (at least for now), China and Russia are unlikely to join, the Call will rely on support from States like India and Brazil in order to gain traction within international institutions, primarily the United Nations. Macron, aware of this challenge, suggested that the Internet Governance Forum—a U.N. event—become responsible for monitoring the effective implementation of the call and be moved under the direct supervision of the U.N. Secretary General57.\nThe document has already drawn support from influential non-governmental groups. The World Leadership Alliance, Chatham House, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Internet Society have committed to its principles. Technical governance bodies, such as the Number Resource Organization and the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre—the region's internet registry—expressed interest too. Powerful business lobbies are another prominent group of signatories, including notably, Indian business guilds such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Internet and Mobile Association of India and the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum. In total, as many as 300 universities, NGOs and professional associations have committed to the call.\nIn the industrial landscape, France succeeded in attracting both major initiatives: The Tech Accord and the Charter of Trust represent a significant share of the private-sector signatories, as together they represent 85 powerful corporations such as Airbus, Cisco and Facebook. But the call is not a mere shell for existing groups. Notable newcomers include Google, Samsung Electronics, Intel Corporation, Kaspersky Lab, Thales and many other companies, ranging from the banking and insurance industries, to law, commerce and defence.\nInitiatives to create norms in cyberspace are multiplying. But more than anything else, these initiatives seem to have fragmented political will and have so far failed to gather support across the board. Emmanuel Macron hopes the Paris Call will bring fresh momentum to the issue by mounting support from influential parties, notably Silicon Valley's top companies and emerging powers. The Call is\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nrestrained in scope, avoiding the most sensitive activities such as espionage and offensive operations, but this restraint makes it more likely to receive support across a wider group of stakeholders. It is far from a silver bullet; rather it offers a fresh starting point and framework for further negotiations on values and norms of behaviour in cyberspace.\nFigure 1 - The pyramid of means (centre) and their respective objectives (right).\nOverall, the objectives of French cyber security and defence are three-fold: Actively discourage adversaries through a declaratory strategy that includes offensive operations, limit the escalation potential of crises by sanctuarising core infrastructures, and promote a third way model to cyberspace governance.\n## 2. Threat perception\nA state's perception of threats is based on a variety of factors: strategic goals, history and precedent, one's perception of its own weaknesses and dependencies$^{58}$. It is a key concept within rational models such as the one Allison and Zelikow describe. While France approached cybersecurity issues from a dominantly technical perspective at its beginnings, Desforges argues, it shifted towards a model that goes beyond security and defence issues$^{59}$. The Snowden leaks, the rise of jihadist propaganda and the increasingly geopolitical impact of major attacks pushed France to consider broader societal challenges and actors in defining its strategies and policies.\n$^{58}$ Raymond Cohen, “Threat Perception in International Crisis,” *Political Science Quarterly* 93, no. 1 (1978): 93, https://doi.org/10/d95kwg.\n$^{59}$ Alix Desforges, “Approche Géopolitique Du Cyberespace, Enjeux Pour La Défense et La Sécurité Nationale, l’exemple de La France” (Université Paris 8 - Vincennes / Saint-Denis, 2018).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Threat realisation centred around technology and intelligence (2008-2013)\nThe 2008 White Paper$^{(a)}$ mentions Internet in its first chapter, but first as an example of a positive trend, highlighting the rise in connectedness of people around the world. The other side of the coin, it later states, is the challenge of keeping up with the high-paced spread of information and ideas, in other words information control and propaganda. The Paper also dedicates a full-page box to serious cyberattacks detailing the full CIA spectrum. While it does not mention the attacks on Estonia, the Paper foresees such attacks will be multiplying in the following 15 years and considers the risk of a large-scale attack on its critical infrastructures a major threat. It mentions \"cyberwar\" as one of the scenarios which could involve the Atlantic Alliance. In consequence, the Paper mandates 1) a switch from a passive to active defence model, 2) the development of offensive cyber capabilities, strategy and doctrine all focusing on adversarial military systems.\nIt is the very first time France acknowledges cyber threats and decides to act on them in a national public policy document. The Paper also creates a new strategic role for the armed forces known as \"knowledge and anticipation\".\nFigure 2\nStrategic and prospective policy documents in context (yellow, red and green).

TRL: Technology Readiness Level.\nFive years after the wake-up call of the 2008 White Paper, its successor recognises that the fast-paced evolution of threats and capabilities require to go one \"step further\" in cyberdefence$^{(c)}$. It ambitions to dedicate more human and financial resources to intelligence and operational capabilities, mandates the creation of a cyber reserve force and calls for a broad societal effort from international cooperation to training and public awareness.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nb) Broadening to societal challenges and capabilities build-up (2013-2015)\nThe 2013 White Paper mandated the creation of a national doctrine for major cyber threats response: a coordinated defensive posture mixed with a graduated response from diplomatic, judicial and law enforcement powers to military means when vital interests are at stake. The strategic mission “knowledge and anticipation”, created in 2008, now includes information control in its widest sense (maîtrise de l’information), from trends in cryptography to intelligence gathering and critical infrastructure security. A joint doctrine puts in place a strategic anticipation group which is tasked with mid-term (one to two years) prospective on operational preparedness, military intelligence and international relations[62]. Most critically, the Paper contains France’s official recognition of cyberspace as an operational domain by stating that “cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own”. This is two years after the United States[63] and three years before NATO[64].\n## “Cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own.”\nThe ensuing pluriannual defence finance law (LPM, 2014-2019) set-out an operational cyberdefence chain integrated to conventional military operations. It reiterated the need for both defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, granting overall 1 billion EUR to cyberdefence.\nIn 2015, the Digital Security Strategy stated that a serious threat (“atteinte significative”) to French citizens data could constitute a national security matter, notably in the context of espionage, propaganda or political destabilisation[65]. The complete shutdown of news channel TV5 Monde that year represented a moment of reckoning for the country’s security agencies, while the leaking of documents stolen from the Macron campaign on the eve of the 2017 election sounded alarm bells at the possibility of foreign meddling in domestic politics, echoing the Clinton campaign.\nc) Institutional and doctrinal military structuring (2017-2019)\nThe 2017 Review emphasises the increasing role of Internet and digital giants (GAFAM, Baidu) on geopolitics and sovereignty, as well as on “strategic intimidation” facilitated by the combination of economic, military and informational pressures such as territorial fait-accompli and mass social network trolling. It also mentions the risk of escalation in cyber and space conflicts, not the least because of first strike temptations. Currently, ANSSI states “destabilisation, espionage and sabotage” as the primary threats it faces[66].\nThe Cyberdefence Review dedicates a significant part (32 pages) to the evolution of the threat landscape. It relies on the “new normal” scenario to highlight the risks brought by quantum\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\ncomputers, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. It concludes that their level of security will be determining factors for societal safety.\nThe next LPM (2019-2025) reflects this evolution of French threat perception and the impetus granted to the “knowledge and anticipation” mission of the armed forces. The defence budget for 2019 amounts to 35,9 billion EUR, or 1.82% of GDP, pensions excluded. It is planned to increase over the next four years, reaching 44 billion EUR and 2% of GDP in 2023. In 2019, intelligence and cyberdefence constitute already 73% of the Ministry’s hiring effort (+450 personnel in total). By 2025, the armed forces are expected to count on 4000 so-called cyber-combatants, which represent an increase of 25% over six years. Cyberdefence will receive over this period a budget of 1.6 billion Euros, excluding payroll.\n***\nOver the past decade, France went through three main major evolution stages in its cyber security and defence structuring: threat realisation (2008-2011), capabilities build-up (2013-2015) and an institutional and doctrinal military structuring accompanied by a strong diplomatic impetus (2017-2019). The recently released offensive doctrine is the culmination of this deep transformation. It particularly represents a turning point for the armed forces, breaking offensive operations from their intelligence silo. The wording of the document and of the accompanying speech by Minister Parly also represents a less veiled signal to Russia, a message France had previously been reluctant to send publicly. The Paris Call, in parallel, is an unprecedented attempt at bringing states, major corporations and the civil society together around key values and principles.\n&gt; “France aims to promote international rules and stability [...] to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks [...] to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion.”\nOverall, France aims to promote international rules and stability in the cyber domain to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks room to manoeuvre to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion. Such balance is and will remain delicate, which only reinforces the need for a better understanding of actors’ rationales and policy coordination.\n# Chapter II – Relevant organisations, their goals and capabilities\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.” P.31.\n Ministère des Armées, “Communiqué - Budget 2019 : LPM année 1,” September 25, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/communaute-defense/communique-du-ministere-des-armees_-budget-2019-lpm-annee-1.\n Ministère des Armées.\n Ministère des Armées.\n Ministère des Armées, “Guide Explicitatif: Les Réserves Cyber,” November 15, 2016, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/491674/7859279/file/20161115_EMACYBER_Guide_explicitatif.pdf.\n Ministère des Armées, “Projet de Loi Relatif à La Programmation Militaire Pour Les Années 2019 à 2025 et Portant Diverses Dispositions Intéressant La Défense,” February 6, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/523150/8769279/file/LPM%202019-2025%20-%20Rapport%20annexe.pdf.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFollowing the organisational behaviour model of Allison and Zelikow, we now turn to the main institutional players in cyber security and defence. As we will see, the offence / defence separation principle impact deeply the institutions goals, capabilities and culture.\n1. ANSSI\na) Status, history and relationship with SGDSN\nIn response to the 2008 White Paper, the National Cyber Security Agency, abbreviated in French as ANSSI, was established a year later under the Prime Minister's General Secretary for Defence and National Security (SGDSN). It is a service that exercises national authority on the security of information systems.\nWhile SGDSN is in charge of security issues at large, ANSSI deals with digital affairs widely. It has a specific focus on cybersecurity, but in its widest sense: ANSSI supports the private sector, helps draft France foreign policy on digital issues and works on societal resilience. For instance, its Cyber Anticipation Cell is currently tasked with securing the Paris Olympics 2024. Acting as a strategy, policy and plans cell (J5, in military jargon), its main responsibilities is to advise decision-makers. This difference of scope between ANSSI and SGDSN explains why the Agency reports to the Secretary-General directly (the person), and not the Secretariat-General (as in, the institution).\nWhy is not ANSSI directly attached to the Prime Minister then? Because belonging to SGDSN provides the Agency with institutional protection against potentially hindering senior civil servants in higher spheres of the government. Indeed, SGDSN reports to the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General is a permanent member of the presidential Defence Councils.\nIts predecessor, the Central Directory for Information Systems Security (DCSSI) was created in 2001 also under the SGDSN, and was itself the successor to the Central Service for Information Systems Security, which existed since 1986. Despite its new name and national authority status, ANSSI has thus deep historical roots.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n “Décret N° 2009-834 Du 7 Juillet 2009 Portant Création d’un Service à Compétence Nationale Dénommé « Agence Nationale de La Sécurité Des Systèmes d’information »,” 2009-834 § (2009).\n Emmanuel Germain, ANSSI Deputy Director, Paris, June 27, 2019.\n Germain.\n Germain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFigure 3 - The missions and actors of French cyberdefence (Desforges 2018).\nb) Responsibilities\nANSSI has responsibility for coordination of the state's cyber security, hosts the national Computer Emergency Response Team and acts as a regulatory body for the public and private sector alike, primarily for critical infrastructure operators. It plays an unequal role in all six missions of French cyber defence as described in the 2018 Cyber Defence Strategy: cyber threat prevention, anticipation, protection, detection, attribution and reaction. The latter entails technical remediation as well as legal and military action. Alix Desforges78 clarified some of the responsibility sharing that the Cyber Defence Strategy sets-out. While prevention is a cross-government and multistakeholder assignment (ministries, local security representatives, chambers of commerce), anticipation is in essence a threat intelligence task fulfilled by ANSSI and intelligence agencies. Protection (defensive cyber operations and measures) and detection remain the responsibility of ANSSI and its subsidiaries, especially when it comes to private critical infrastructure operators. Attribution of attacks is a joint ANSSI and intelligence services task, while reaction (remediation) is another mission that benefits from subsidiarity.\nThe recognition of cyberspace as a domain of conflict in the 2013 White Paper comes with a new finance law. The 2014-2019 LPM contained two key measures to widen the capabilities of ANSSI. First, it created heavy regulatory obligations on critical infrastructure operators, public and private alike, in terms of their network and industrial control system security, threat detection capabilities and penetration testing, which ANSSI can now perform79. In light of such new powers, it also granted ANSSI with derogations80 with regards to the French Computer Misuse Act81. According to its Deputy Director, ANSSI deals with around 20 attacks from APTs every year82; and these are only those that are detected.\nc) People, identity and organisational culture\nANSSI brings together experts, practitioners and strategists in seven different laboratories and departments. Its two most prominent organisational traits are its exclusive defensive purpose, and its start-up spirit.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFirst, as we described earlier, ANSSI's identity relies mostly on its exclusive defensive purpose. This is the foundation of the French model. Its Director Guillaume Poupard regularly insists on this feature, which seems to infuse very deeply into its operations. Tools that could be dual-use (i.e. for both defensive and offensive purposes) are separately developed at both DGSE (for offense) and ANSSI (for defence), even if it duplicates the effort[83]. However, because of the high pressure on its human resources, DGSE and ANSSI are pooling and sharing their people and increasingly\n# Of a defensive culture by nature and legal status, [ANSSI] is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need.\nsharing intelligence[84]. The separation between offense and defence is thus institutional and not absolute. Second, the Agency enjoys describing itself as a start-up, at least in its spirit[85]. This tag however hides large disparities in its workforce: 80% are temporary staff, with a mean age of 30 years old[86]. The remaining 20% are the managers, mostly military or civilian engineers[87]. Overall, the mean age is of 34 years[88].\nOf a defensive culture by nature and legal status, it is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need. Although its nature and role is less ambiguous than its Anglo-Saxon peers (GCHQ, NSA) its responsibilities make its activities deeply intertwined with those of intelligence agencies, primarily DGSE.\n## 2. Armed Forces and the intelligence community\nThe armed forces play a role in all six cyber security and defence missions we highlighted just below. While they are in charge of defending only their own systems, they have heightened responsibilities with regards to anticipation, detection, attribution and reaction. But each organisation has specific tasks and roles.\n### a) Organisation of military cyber operations\nThe armed forces learned to perform cyber operations \"as they went\", developing capabilities and skills as they needed[89]. The 2008 White Paper however was a major doctrinal disruption[90], as well as a wake-up call in the aftermath of the Estonian attacks. In addition to the following White Paper and LPM, the then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian launched in 2014 the Cyber Defence Pact. This additional policy document set-out the overall structuring of military cyber defence through six pillars:\n- Hardening the security of its own information and weapon systems,\n- Anticipating technical disruptions by investing in research and development,\n- Reinforcing and structuring human resources dedicated to cyberdefence,\n- Developing a national centre of excellence in Brittany,\n- Reinforcing cooperation with allies in Europe and the Atlantic Alliance,\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n- Fostering a national cyberdefence community and network of trusted partners.\nAs a follow-up to the 2017 Review and as a further step to this military structuring, the Armed Forces ministry established a Cyber Defence Command to coordinate cyber operations within the armed forces. ComCyber, as it is colloquially known, sits directly under the Joint Chief of Staff. Defensively, it serves as an hypervision body, a concept that has a specific meaning in that context:91 it receives and correlates all relevant data related to its systems' security. However, in accordance with a recently released ministerial instruction92, each corps and service remains responsible for its own defensive cyber operations and has its own SOC (Security Operations Centre)93. CALID, the Ministry's SOC, assesses global cyber risk so that ComCyber is able to act and advise political authorities to the best of their knowledge. In other words, defensive cyber operations are modelled on subsidiarity.\nFigure 4 - Simplified graph of military cyber operations, broke-down by their offensive or defensive nature.\nComCyber performs defensive operations by delegation of ANSSI, and must notify the Agency of them94. Consequently, and because both institutions need to share data between each other, CALID is partly co-located with ANSSI. ANSSI typically shares non-military IoCs and ComCyber military ones that may impact civilian systems95. This cooperation and the wider relationship between ANSSI and ComCyber is defined in a specific protocol96.\nNew capabilities for the armed forces: Integrating the cyber domain in conventional and influence operations\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe defensive cyber doctrine entails the prevention, anticipation, detection of and protection against cyber attacks. The scope of the doctrine is limited to reacting to and attributing the attack — within defensive and non-military measures. To perform these tasks, the doctrine sets up an adaptive Permanent Cyber Security Posture, orienting France’s military cyber units to be prepared for what the summary describes as a “peace-crisis-war” continuum. The document thus seems to acknowledge what has been described as a state of unpeace, a state of hostility that falls short of full conflict. This defensive policy is the result of Ministerial Instruction 101000 (Joint Doctrine 3.20). Thus, it covers the whole Ministry and not merely the armed forces.\nFigure 5\nCovers of the offensive and defensive cyber operations documents.\nIn contrast, the offensive doctrine is only relevant to the armed forces.\nUntil the release of this document, the armed forces had focused on defending their own systems—although with an understood element of active defence—while DGSE was in charge of the most sensitive operations, namely, espionage and disruption of adverse systems.\nWhat is new in the offensive doctrine is the integration of cyber activity in conventional military operations. The offensive approach is described as stealthy actions aimed at denying the availability or\nconfidentiality of adverse systems. Implicitly, the doctrine seems to exclude operations with destructive kinetic effects. It mentions the neutralization of enemy systems, but the concept is ambiguous. Offensive operations can prepare or complement conventional operations—acting as a force multiplier—or substitute them entirely where appropriate. The offensive doctrine also includes counterinfluence operations, aimed at protecting conventional action in cyberspace. Such operations are already performed in the conventional domain through the CIAE, or Joint Centre for Environmental Action, the military influence and civil-military cooperation branch of the French armed forces that was created in 2012. This doctrinal shift reflects an increased perception by the armed forces of propaganda and disinformation threats that could hamper its conventional deployments.\nThe new offensive cyber doctrine expands and details the scope of offensive cyber operations. It assumes their preparation and conduct, not only in a clandestine context but also as an integral part of -or substitute for- conventional military operations. As we noted however, it also imposes constraints and rules of engagement on the basis of a strict risk management.\nb) DGSE\nDGSE is the foreign security service and additionally serves as France’s main signals intelligence agency. It sits directly under the Armed Forces Ministry. Until 2014, not much was known publicly by\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nDGSE's activities in the cyber domain. Offensive and espionage operations were deemed to be its responsibilities, but these has been absent from public sight, until forensic analysis and Snowden-leaks published by Le Monde unveiled a diverse panel of advanced malwares (Casper, Bunny, Babar, Dino) attributed to a French intelligence agency. The leaks seem to have broken an internal taboo. A former DGSE executive, Bernard Barbier, shed some light on such operations shortly after, admitting the agency \"started hacking in 1992\".\nc) DGA\nDGA, the Defence Procurement Agency, has long developed a cybersecurity department, which sits into its \"maîtrise de l'information\" branch. It is tasked with protecting the information and weapon systems of the armed forces, providing technical expertise in threat intelligence, upstream research (also known as discovery stage) and crisis support. As part of such responsibilities, it conducts vulnerability research on armed forces' systems and since 2015 organises cyber-wargames.\nThe offensive doctrine indicated DGA will adapt its procurement processes to take into account the tempo of operations and nature of these weapons. Current processes designed to procure vehicles or submarines, or even major software programs, would be ill-suited. This may hint at the creation of an ad hoc procurement process designed from the ground up to research vulnerabilities and develop exploits and payloads.\n3. Competition and opposition of views\nParochial priorities and perceptions of the respective institutions depend mostly on the structuring of the cyber security and defence apparatus, which core principle is offense-defence separation.\na) Opposition of views between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA\nThe opposition of views or the impact of parochial competition appears most clearly between ANSSI and the armed forces, on two different issues: vulnerability disclosure and end-to-end encryption.\nContrary to the U.S. or, more recently, the U.K., France has no public vulnerability equities process (VEP). Currently, disclosure and sharing between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA is not formalised and happens on a case-by-case basis. Guillaume Poupard, ANSSI director, communicated briefly about vulnerability research and disclosure at the agency's end-of-year report. In practice, Poupard said, in case of doubt as to the balance of risk, \"the vulnerability goes to the defence\".

This means ANSSI is not aware of all vulnerabilities discovered. Although there is no obvious conflict of views on that topic, the debate on the right risk balancing illustrates well how each agencies' responsibilities and culture influences their stance in critical debates such as this one.\nWe can witness a more obvious conflict of views on the encryption debate. Poupard, circulated within the government in March 2016 a note arguing strongly against \"exceptional access\" legislation, which would allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bypass encryption, either on device or in transit. The Parliament of Australia recently passed such a law, not without public outcry. In his note, Poupard states:\n“To impose a wide weakening of cryptographic means would affect both digital safety and the freedom of the large majority of law-abiding users, while remaining ineffective against the intended minority target.”\nIt appears that, at the time, DGSE was voicing its concerns against encryption. In 2018, the head of its technical services, Patrick Pailloux, promoted publicly the idea of in-transit exceptional access, while reaffirming the importance of strong (but not end-to-end by definition) encryption. It is thus likely that Poupard’s note was a direct rebuke to DGSE’s pressures. In such case, it may be a good example of two principles edited by Allison and Zelkow. First, that where you stand depends on where you sit. Less colloquially known as “the face of the issue differs from seat to seat”, it explains that, as the head of a defensive agency open to the wider public and private sector, it is expected that its director will oppose the weakening of end-to-end encryption. On the opposite, it is expected that DGSE will seek to extend its interception capabilities, as a signals intelligence agency dedicated to foreign security. Second, this “row” may also be the result of the “51-49 principle”. Even if one isn’t completely convinced by the side of the argument, they must “argue much more confidently than they would if they were detached judges” because of parochial competition.\nb) The role of Foreign Affairs and its relationship with other actors.\nThe International Digital Strategy (December 2017) was released only a few months before the Cyber Defence Review (February 2018). Presented as “France’s international strategy”, it could be potentially interpreted as a willingness of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to defend its prerogative in that area. In May 2017, Jean-Yves Le Drian had become Foreign Affairs Minister after almost five years at the Defence Ministry. Although it may have been perceived as such by some in the Armed Forces Ministry, the international strategy was actually two-years in the making, a long process due in part to its submission to public review. As for the Paris Call, the initiative came from the Cybersecurity and Strategic Affairs division, which then pushed it through to the Minister, who ensured political\nMacron dans les locaux de la DGA-MI à Bruz :pic.twitter.com/elKwQM0k9w,” #WarGames on Twitter (blog), April 15, 2019, https://twitter.com/amaelle_g/status/1117803882032304128.\n Guiton.\n Guiton.\n Catherine Chapman, “Australian Cybersecurity Industry Reels over Anti-Encryption Law,” The Daily Swig | Web security digest, January 25, 2019, https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/australian-cybersecurity-industry-reels-over-anti-encryption-law.\n A ComCyber official, April 18, 2019.\n Valéry Marchive, “Le renseignement aime le chiffrement, mais il veut bien des points de clair,” LeMagIT, July 4, 2018, https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252444227/Le-renseignement-aimé-le-chiffrement-mais-il-veut-bien-des-points-de-clair.\n Allison and Zelikow, Essence of Decision.

It is a very tentative chapter, because of time and interview constraints. To complete the analysis, more interviews should be conducted at higher political levels.\n## 1) Key individuals in decision and action, and factors influencing their perceptions, preferences and stands\nDuring its annual press conference, ANSSI director stated, on the topic of vulnerabilities disclosure, that in a structure that separates offence and defence, \"the level of where both meet [in the policy-making tree] is very high. It means that sometimes, we must mobilise the highest authorities on these issues\".\nBastien Irondelle, in its seminal work on the decision-making process behind the end of French military conscription in 1996, highlighted the everlasting importance of the President. He detailed how the political impetus Jacques Chirac gave to this major policy decision, in particular during the Defence Councils, made the reform happen. We have demonstrated so far that in the case at hand, French cyber security and defence, the evolution has been gradual, taking place over a decade. However, the same key individuals and processes remain.\nIn practice, the range of meaningful decision-making in cyber security and defence starts at ministerial cabinets, up to the Prime Minister and the President. Major crisis and policy decisions are taken at the presidential level, during Defence Councils. ANSSI is represented by the SGDSN, ComCyber by the Joint Chief of Staff, who remains responsible for the military action chain.\nThe Cyber Club identified by Desforges still exists today and brings together the directors of ANSSI, DGA, ComCyber and the technical departments of both domestic and foreign intelligence agencies (DGSI, DGSE).\nAnother noteworthy trend is the overwhelming majority of military profiles among ANSSI executives. Out of the seven directors and deputy-directors, five have spent most of their careers in the armed forces. Such numbers however hide some atypical career paths: the deputy director is a military engineer with a doctorate in public law and an MBA.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n Guiton, \"[Thread] [Team #Wargames] Comment est gérée la question des vulnérabilités dites 'zero-day' en France, où on sépare les missions d'attaque et de défense ?

Because of the number of involved actors and their overlap in each mission, the Strategy established four “operational chains” to centralize and streamline public action in the field. They are referred to as the protection, intelligence, judicial investigations and military-action chains. While it is still unclear how these chains work in practice, we were able to collect more information on the committees and groups that coordinate cyber security and defence policy, in theory and in practice.\n### a) Recently formalised processes\nThe Cyber Strategy created two new committees: An Executive Committee, under the President’s Office, and a Steering Committee, under the SGDSN. Political decisions and policy orientations related to cyberdefence are taken during meetings of the National Security and Defence Council. The Executive Committee is tasked with high-level implementation of the Council’s decisions.\nThe Steering Committee’s responsibility is to report on the Strategy’s implementation to the Prime Minister and to prepare the meetings of the Executive Committee[132]. It meets every semester. SGDSN transmits the impetus of political leadership, sets the agenda and ensures the application of the previously decided measures[133]. Ministries and agencies are free to bring forward suggestions[134].\nAdditionally, a Cyber Crisis Coordination Centre “supervises cyberdefence”[135] and informs decision-makers. The Centre consists of different groups that act at various timelines, even though their names suggest a short-term crisis perimeter. While the Technical Group acts on short-term incidents, Strategy is a “sub-political”[136] group that acts on mid-term strategy to prepare steering committee meetings. It is open to other ministries,[137] of which most individuals present are administration directors (directeurs d’administration centrale)[138]. They offer regular situation reports to the Prime Minister and the President, and suggests policy options. They meet monthly[139]. The Technico-Operational Group (TechOps), on the other hand, is a restricted group with few institutions represented. Its main purpose is to share specific threat intelligence, and it thus open to only a handful of intelligence agencies[140].\n### b) Importance of informal coordination processes\nTechOps is only very briefly described in official documents[141]. However it reminds of the “Cyber Club” Alix Desforges described in her thesis[142]. This informal grouping of agency heads took another dimension with the writing process of the Cyber Strategy. According to an official[143], the writing\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nprocess itself greatly enhanced communication between relevant stakeholders. In other words, the process of creating processes, enhanced communication and coordination between actors. At its creation, TechOps the people and institutions involved warmly welcomed it, and it quickly became indispensable$^{144}$. Some degree of informality remains today. In addition to what we have already described, informal ad-hoc meetings keep happening to deal with specific issues.\n***\nWhen it comes to formal processes, the highest political authorities remain in charge of major policy-decisions. Informal meetings have lead to the formalisation of intelligence sharing and mid to low level policy coordination.\n*\n*\n# Conclusion\nFrom its sovereign principles to the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence institutions, France revendicates an atypical model. At the top, strategic autonomy infuses major political, financial and policy decisions. Domestically, although officials strongly reaffirm the separation of offence and defence activities, in practice such separation can be described as institutional at best, due to the fluidity of human resources between agencies. This separation has nonetheless a genuine impact on policy-making and public debates: differences in parochial priorities and organisational cultures between ANSSI and the armed forces create conflicting views on tough topics such as end-to-end encryption or vulnerability disclosure. Finally, while the executive remains key in decision-making, informal processes and meta-processes have been instrumental in the development of an efficient state cyber security and defence community. To complete and build-up on this exploratory paper, further research on how such processes work out in practice could be conducted.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# GLOSSARY (non-exhaustive)\n\nANSSI National Information Systems Security Agency.\nCALID Centre for Defensive Cyber Operations.\nCASSI Centre for Information Systems Auditing.\nCIAE Joint Centre for Environmental Action.\nComCyber Cyber Defence Command.\nDGA Directorate General for Armament.\nDGSE Directorate General for External Security.\nIoC Indicator of Compromise.\nLPM Pluriannual Military Finance Law\nSGDSN General Secretariat for Defence and National Security.\nSOC Security Operations Centre.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# CHRONOLOGY (non-exhaustive)\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# INTERVIEWS\nA ComCyber official.

    "# Introduction": "From Ministries to national agencies or cyber commands, the amount of public institutions involved in cyber defence and security matters is multiplying in most states, in a trend that reflects the pervasive nature of the domain. France is no exception. We have seen in recent months a revival of its efforts to secure its citizens and interests in cyber space. French President Emmanuel Macron presented in late 2018 the \"Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace\", a package of norms of good behaviour bringing together states, private corporations and the civil society¹. All the while, in the past two years, the government designed its very first Cyber Defence Strategy² and the Armed Forces unveiled some elements of their offensive and defensive cyber operations³. How can we make sense of it all?\nWe frame the current picture by following Allison and Zelikow's three conceptual models of decision-making: Rational actor, organisational behaviour, and government politics⁴. In accordance with each model, we seek to answer the following questions, respectively:\nR1: What are the underlying principles, goals and objectives of French national defence and security, in general terms and in the cyber domain?\nR2: What are the institutions involved in cyber security and defence, their perimeters of action and organisational culture?\nR3: What are the processes and individuals involved in cyber security and defence policy-making at the politico-strategic level?\nTo do so we combine an extensive review of the literature with a series of interviews with senior French officials from ministries, as well as national agencies and other specialised institutions.",
    "# Objectives and limitations": "The objective of this paper is three-fold: describing, explaining and, by extension, predicting. First, we hope to provide a better understanding of the current French cyber security and defence policy picture its founding political and doctrinal principles. Second, by applying Allison and Zelikow's models to this picture, we seek to explain how policy-making in this area happens in practice. This approach diverges slightly from the models' original purpose, which is to analyse a specific case-study and its cluster of decisions (\"Why did the Soviets smuggle nuclear missiles into Cuba?\" \"Why did the US respond by imposing a naval blockade?\"). This paper does not ambition to explain why France launched the Paris Call or why it published parts of the armed forces' offensive cyber operations doctrine. Scholars⁵ and journalists⁶ have already started answering them. Rather, it seeks to provide a toolkit so that scholars, practitioners or journalists can design more accurate hypotheses about why future decision X or Y was taken in that domain. There is no doubt this toolkit will be incomplete and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nimperfect. Not all policy documents are public, some processes and institutions are still recent, and we lack the ability to stand back so that we can grasp how some processes work-out in practice. Another obstacle is that these principles, policies, doctrines, processes and institutions live through the minds and acts of leaders, policy-makers and practitioners, whom the author has not been able to all interview. In particular, the author was unable to meet officials from SGDSN itself, the Élysée Palace and Prime Minister's Office. This is where the work of Bastien Irondelle becomes key⁷. The third -indirect- objective of this paper, is prediction. As Allison and Zelikow highlight, it is “the logical flipside of explanations”⁸. If we understand more accurately the processes and factors that lead to decisions, we can extrapolate about future events. The predictive power of the model will however be highly dependent on the strength of its explanatory qualities.\n## Acknowledgement and appreciation\nThe author is grateful to IRSEM for hosting him and the warm welcome.

    "# Chapter I - The state as a unitary rational entity": "The first model set-out by Allison and Zelikow envisions the state as a black box; a rational unitary entity driven by its interests. This is the rational actor model. In our case, France is the identified state. More often than not, political cycles lead to new policies and strategies. When relevant, the state thus becomes personified, in relation to a specific presidency. In this model we adopt a bounded rationality viewpoint, whereas we accept that “values, beliefs and stereotypes” play a role in the actors’ rationality⁹.\n## 1. Political concepts, principles and goals\nIn this first part we analyse France’s core political concepts of sovereignty and strategic autonomy, the rationale behind the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence apparatus, and the one behind its communication and attribution stance.\n### a. France’s sovereignty, national and European strategic autonomy\nFrance has a conceptualisation of sovereignty that makes it stand out of its peers. Baezner and Robin found in their comparative analysis that “France was unique among the states examined in that it used the word “sovereignty” more frequently and in different contexts”¹⁰. Sovereignty, in its French understanding, cannot be restrained to hard sovereignty, i.e. the protection of its citizens, borders and other existential interests¹¹. French sovereignty is a wide spectrum that implies strategic autonomy. The 2017 Strategic Review defines strategic autonomy as a two pillar concept entailing 1) a high level of industrial and technological autonomy, and 2) an operational autonomy¹². On technological autonomy, the Ministry of the Armed Forces has recently ramped up its strategy, with the creation of a dedicated investment fund, DefInvest¹³. Its first investments were made in microprocessors and high precision optics manufacturers. Operational autonomy means the ability to reach an informed decision and to take action, in particular in the context of political or military crises. The French military operation in Mali, for instance, is a good illustration of operational autonomy: the ability to engage in full scope – low to high intensity– operations, with allies or on its own if necessary.\nFrench strategic autonomy can be best described as neo-Gaullist. It is characterised by a strong sense of national independence but recognises the need for a powerful political Europe¹⁴. Its historical drivers and roots come indeed from a traditional Gaullist doctrine of national autonomy, which is more self-reliant. The perceived need for self-reliance played a major role in driving De Gaulle to transform France into a nuclear power and to leave NATO integrated command in 1966. Some key historical events such as the 1940 surrender, the intelligence frustrations of the 1992 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq war further fuelled perceptions that France needed both a credible nuclear arsenal, and autonomous intelligence capabilities¹⁵.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n---\n⁹ Allison and Zelikow. P.20.\n¹⁰ Marie Baezner and Patrice Robin, “Trend Analysis: Cyber Sovereignty” (Zurich: Center for Security Studies (CSS), ETH Zürich, 2018).\n¹¹ Existential interests are not clearly defined so that there remains strategic uncertainty, in the context of France’s nuclear deterrence. See para. 159 of the 2017 Strategic Review.\n¹² See Para. 157. “Revue stratégique de défense et de sécurité nationale,” La Documentation Française (Paris: Présidence de la République, October 2017), http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/174000744/index.shtml.\n¹³ “Le Ministère Des Armées et Bpifrance Lancent Definvest,” BPI France, November 17, 2017, https://presse.bpifrance.fr/le-ministere-des-armees-et-bpifrance-lancent-definvest/.\n¹⁴ Serge Berstein, *Histoire Du Gaullisme* (Paris: Perrin, 2001).\n¹⁵ The Military Intelligence Agency was created in the aftermath of the Gulf War. Claude Faure, “Bref historique des services de renseignement et de sécurité français contemporains,” *Revue historique des armées*, no. 247 (June 15, 2007): 70–81.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThis spirit of autonomy remains today, but with a wider pragmatic recognition of the need for cooperation and integration. France re-joined NATO command in 2009 for mainly pragmatism and influence reasons¹⁶. However the French nuclear arsenal remains outside of NATO command and its intelligence apparatus outside of the 5-Eyes community. France' strategic autonomy is also reliant on a European strategic autonomy, which it seeks to develop. The Hubert Védrine report recommended that the country's return into NATO command is accompanied by a strengthening of European defence integration and cooperation, especially in the R&amp;D of technological and industrial capacities¹⁷. It encourages the development of mutual interdependence with entities who share critical interests, particularly within the EU. This policy shift initiated in 1992 with the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy was confirmed in the 2008 White Paper, placing the EU as \"a central tenet of [France's] security policy\"¹⁸. This central place was reaffirmed ever since, including in the last cyber strategy document¹⁹.\nb) Domestic apparatus: Offense / defence separation\nDomestically, the French approach contrasts with that embraced by the United States or the United Kingdom. Most notably, France assumes a clear separation between offensive and defensive cyber operations. This means that, contrary to the U.S.' National Security Agency (NSA) or the U.K.'s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), France's leading agency for cybersecurity is exclusively dedicated to defensive operations and not part of the intelligence community. This is a defining element of the Cyber Strategy Review and infuses the whole structure of French cyberdefence. The rationale is that having a distinct defensive agency separate from offense-oriented military intelligence agencies \"facilitates the acceptance of state intervention [...] whether in public administration or the economic sphere\"²⁰.\nc) A counter-threat model based on direct communication rather than public attribution\nPeculiarities of the French model are not limited to its conceptualisation of sovereignty. On the diplomatic stage, France has also adopted a different stance than most of its counterparts²¹. A number of NATO allies are increasingly inclined to \"name and shame\" states involved in cyber attacks. One telling example can be found in October 2018, when the U.S., U.K., Canada and the Netherlands denounced Russian attempts at disrupting the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons²². Paris expressed its solidarity but fell short of blaming Moscow²³. Already in 2015, when what then seemed to be ISIS took down TV5Monde in a major hack, no official attribution was made. ANSSI, the national cybersecurity agency, however briefed four dozen media outlets with details of its forensic investigation and indicators of compromise. These details were then analysed by private security firms which pointed the finger at persistent threat actor (APT) ²⁸²⁴. Additionally, TV5Monde director Yves Bigot reported in L'Express\n\"France favours red phones over the megaphone.\"\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nthat ANSSI personnel suggested it was a false-flag (\"un leurre\")²⁵. More recently, in the case of the #MacronLeaks, France did not issue any kind of attribution either. G. Poupard, head of ANSSI, refused to do so arguing \"the attack was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone\"²⁶. More recently, the Secretary General for Defence and National Security clarified France's official policy: attribution can only be performed on the basis of elements collected or verified by French services, typically ANSSI and DGSE²⁷.\nThis does not mean that it does not have attribution capabilities. As we will see in Chapter II, attributing cyber-attacks is one of the main missions of the French cyberdefence apparatus. But even when it knows, France prefers forthright bilateral dialogues with Russia and other cyber powers such as the U.S., China, India, Brazil and Japan²⁸. It appears it even opened a deconfliction cell with the Russian Security Council on cyber matters²⁹. Only in last resort will France take part in public name and shame³⁰. In other words, it favours red phones over the megaphone.\nThere is only one recorded instance of public attribution, and it is indirect. At the unveiling of the offensive cyber doctrine, Minister Parly revealed that an APT targeted email accounts of high-ranking officials between 2017 and 2018, with the objective of uncovering the navy's oil supply chain³¹. Though the Minister stopped short of explicitly recognizing the group's affiliation with the Russian Federation, she indirectly attributed the attacker's mode of operation to a specific group known as Turla.\nUnder Egloff's definition, France engages in two attribution processes³². First a process of sense-making attribution, for the benefit of its own factual understanding, that it rarely communicates publicly. Second, in a meaning-making process, with regards to its adversaries. But again, it does so rather privately than publicly. Overall, French strategy with attribution seem to fit a counter-threat model³³.\nIn this first part, we have detailed how France conceives its sovereignty and what it means by strategic autonomy. We have also sought to explain its rationale behind the offence / defence separation and to describe its policy of non-public attribution.\n## 2. The evolution and granularization of objectives of French cyber security and defence\nIn this second part we review the cyber security and defence objectives produced by political and military authorities, from 2011 to 2019. We identify three main themes: active discouragement, risk limitation and direct communication.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe Defence and National Security White Paper 2008 is the first of its kind to mention Internet-related threats³⁴ and leads to the creation of ANSSI. The Agency releases in 2011 the “National Strategy for the Defence and Security of Information Systems”. It’s four goals are:\n- For France to become a top-tier cyber power,\n- To guarantee freedom of decision through confidentiality of state secrets,\n- To reinforce the security of critical infrastructures,\n- To ensure cybersecurity to public and private actors alike.\nThe second version of the Strategy revolved around 1) state secrets and critical infrastructures, 2) digital privacy and cybercrime, 3) public sensitisation and training, 4) business and export strategies, and 5) Europe, digital sovereignty and norms³⁵.\nFollowing the election of Emmanuel Macron to the Presidency, the President requests officially tasks the Armed Forces Ministry to create a panel of experts with a view to write a new defence white paper. The Strategic Review for Defence and National Security, as it is then known, is released in 2017. It promotes digital sovereignty and cybersecurity to top priorities of national defence³⁶.\nIn February 2018, the country’s first National Strategy for Cyber Defence clarified both the organization and integration of cyber operations among all government entities³⁷ as well as the national and international legal framework surrounding their use³⁸. It sets-out goals and processes as part of a “robust national cyber security and defence apparatus”³⁹.\nThe seven principles underpinning the Strategy are:\n1. To make the security of French information and communication systems a priority,\n2. To embrace a policy of active discouragement⁴⁰ and coordinated response,\n3. To fully exercise its digital sovereignty,\n4. To bring an efficient judicial response to cybercriminality,\n5. To promote a shared cybersecurity culture,\n6. To contribute to a trusted and safe digital Europe,\n7. To act internationally for a collective governance of cyberspace.\nTo achieve said goals, the Strategy sets-out a number of policy-making and coordination processes (see Chapter III). In practice, three main themes appear: Active discouragement, risk limitation and multilateralism.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n³⁴ Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n³⁵ Services du Premier Ministre, “Stratégie Nationale Pour La Sécurité Du Numérique” (Paris, October 16, 2015), https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/la-strategie-nationale-pour-la-securite-du-numerique-une-reponse-aux-nouveaux-enjeux-des-usages-numeriques/.\n³⁶ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n³⁷ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n³⁸ Francois Delerue and Aude Gery, “France’s Cyberdefense Strategic Review and International Law,” Lawfare, March 23, 2018, https://www.lawfareblog.com/frances-cyberdefense-strategic-review-and-international-law.\n³⁹ In French as « Dispositif national de protection et de défense informatique robuste ». “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n⁴⁰ France reserves its concept of deterrence (dissuasion) to the nuclear domain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Active discouragement\nFrance has adopted a posture of active discouragement against advanced threats. It relies on direct communication with the adversary, as we have detailed earlier, and on an increasingly explicit declaratory strategy.\nIn January 2019 Minister Florence Parly unveiled the offensive and defensive cyber operations doctrines of the armed forces. The announcement is the latest and strongest step taken by the country as part of its declaratory strategy⁴¹. In response to cyber and other threats, France is “not afraid” of using cyber weapons⁴². The country did not wait until then to perform offensive operations or even to publicly admit doing so. Such operations were first mentioned in the 2008 White Paper⁴³ and then again with more details in 2013. The case for proportional reprisals in response to a major attack was also made clearly by then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian:\n“In times of war, cyber weapons may be the response, or part of our response, to an armed attack [aggression armée], being of a cyber nature or otherwise”⁴⁴.\nb) Risk limitation and infrastructure sanctuarisation\nRisks that are inherent to cyberspace and operations are a recurrent topic in policy documents.\nThe offensive doctrine places great emphasis on the consideration and mitigation of political, legal and military risks. It mandates a risk balancing exercise in the preparation and conduct of offensive operations: against the risk of escalation in an asymmetric environment, or against the risk of collateral or indirect damage on civilian infrastructures. This balancing exercise – and the need not to reveal too much details – may be the reason the doctrine does not clearly mention⁴⁵ physical destruction of information systems.\nInternationally, France aims to promote existing institutional mechanisms to “limit hacking and destabilising activities” in cyberspace, notably through an international initiative, the “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace”⁴⁶, unveiled in November 2018.\nIn terms of international law, the document encourages more extensive and better coordinated regulation of cyberspace in the spirit of founding principles of the U.N. Charter, notably the maintenance of international peace and security. It recognizes not only the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyberspace, but of international human rights and customary international law more broadly as well. It also advocates for the development of new ways to prevent intellectual property theft, i.e. industrial espionage.\nAnother key theme of the document is the importance of protecting individuals and critical infrastructures from harm. The document presses to safeguard the “public core of the Internet” from hostile actors. This is a clear demonstration of support for a package of norms unveiled by the Global\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n41 Taillat, “Signaling, Victory, and Strategy in France’s Military Cyber Doctrine.”\n42 Parly, “Stratégie Cyber Des Armées (Speech).”\n43 Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n44 Jean-Yves Le Drian, “Déclaration de M. Jean-Yves Le Drian, ministre de la défense, sur la cyberdéfense, à Bruz le 12 décembre 2016.,” text, http://www.defense.gouv.fr, le 13 décembre 2016, December 12, 2016, http://discours.vie-publique.fr/notices/163003632.html.\n45 “Neutralisation” could be interpreted as mere disablement and does not necessarily entail physical destruction.\n46 “Cybersecurity: Paris Call of 12 November 2018 for Trust and Security in Cyberspace” (Paris: Ministère de l’Europe et des Affaires étrangères), accessed May 6, 2019, https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/digital-diplomacy/france-and-cyber-security/article/cybersecurity-paris-call-of-12-november-2018-for-trust-and-security-in.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nCommission for the Stability of Cyberspace on Nov. 8 in Singapore⁴⁷. Reflecting the view of most states on the matter, the Call promotes the exclusive role of sovereign states in hostile acts in cyberspace. It condemns corporate hack-back and other offensive operations from non-state actors. It also appeals for measures preventing interference with elections, another contemporary hot topic.\nClearly absent in the text are issues of espionage and state-lead low-intensity offensive operations. The need to compromise and willingness to gather support across states with various political mindsets means offensive cyber operations was probably out of scope of the Call from its inception.\nc) Multilateralism and stakeholderism\nOn the international stage, one of France's goals relates to the diplomatic process itself. The country seeks to maintain a form of inclusive multilateralism⁴⁸, and in parallel to open-up debates on cyberspace governance to non-state actors.\nIts International Digital Strategy puts great emphasis into promoting an \"open, diverse and trusted\" cyberspace in which it envisions the European Union as a key player⁴⁹. The Strategy itself was subject to public consultations.\nThe Paris Call comes in the wake of the strategy. In addition to its normative nature we detailed earlier, to engage industries and civil society, the document also promotes everyday good practices (\"cyber hygiene\") and the implementation of \"security by design\" in products and services. It is not the first initiative of its kind. In April 2018, Microsoft launched its \"Digital Peace\" campaign⁵⁰ along with a \"Cybersecurity Tech Accord\"⁵¹ aimed at getting the internet and the technology industry to better protect their customers' privacy and security against cyberattacks. Similarly, Siemens unveiled in May 2018 a \"Charter of Trust\" that seeks to develop adherence to security principles and processes, with the aim of developing a \"global standard\" for cybersecurity⁵².\nUntil those recent developments, norm-building initiatives were the prerogative of states. In 2015, the U.N.'s Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recognized that international humanitarian law applied to cyberspace⁵³, though it then deadlocked when at the end of 2017. Although a new process was put in place for 2019 up to 2021, the two blocs—one group led by the United States and another by China and Russia—are unlikely to solve the stalemate.\nApproaching the issue from various stakeholders' perspectives, the Paris Call is an attempt to move away from this international deadlock. Macron, at its unveiling at UNESCO, made the case for rebuffing what he described as a binary choice between \"a Californian Internet and a Chinese\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nInternet\"54. So far, he argued, these two opposite narratives have monopolized the debate and imposed two radically different yet unsatisfactory alternatives: either a model of mere technical governance led by Silicon Valley, or an overwhelming regulation led by authoritarian regimes. While the former does not address issues of privacy and malicious actors, the latter cracks down on human rights and could lead to a \"balkanisation\" of internet and of wider cyberspace55.\nAccording to Le Monde, Microsoft first approached the French government to obtain its support for the Tech Accord56. However, the country found the Accord too narrow and industry-oriented. Recognizing a trend of norms fragmentation coupled with diplomatic deadlocks, France saw an opportunity to take the lead on governance. But this was only possible if the call achieved two things: First, it needed to widen the scope of existing sector-specific initiatives (Tech Accord, GGE, For The Web) into meaningful norms all actors could get behind. Second, it needed to gather and federate existing initiatives, otherwise it would just contribute to the further fragmentation of norms. So far the call seems to have mostly succeeded, with a notable caveat among state signatories.\nAmong the 64 state signatories, European countries are the most heavily present. However, almost every continent is represented: among them we find Qatar, South Korea, Mexico, Japan, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Senegal and New-Zealand. Critically, on release day, key potential signatories such as India or Brazil are not on the list. The absence of such countries may become problematic. While the U.S. (at least for now), China and Russia are unlikely to join, the Call will rely on support from States like India and Brazil in order to gain traction within international institutions, primarily the United Nations. Macron, aware of this challenge, suggested that the Internet Governance Forum—a U.N. event—become responsible for monitoring the effective implementation of the call and be moved under the direct supervision of the U.N. Secretary General57.\nThe document has already drawn support from influential non-governmental groups. The World Leadership Alliance, Chatham House, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Internet Society have committed to its principles. Technical governance bodies, such as the Number Resource Organization and the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre—the region's internet registry—expressed interest too. Powerful business lobbies are another prominent group of signatories, including notably, Indian business guilds such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Internet and Mobile Association of India and the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum. In total, as many as 300 universities, NGOs and professional associations have committed to the call.\nIn the industrial landscape, France succeeded in attracting both major initiatives: The Tech Accord and the Charter of Trust represent a significant share of the private-sector signatories, as together they represent 85 powerful corporations such as Airbus, Cisco and Facebook. But the call is not a mere shell for existing groups. Notable newcomers include Google, Samsung Electronics, Intel Corporation, Kaspersky Lab, Thales and many other companies, ranging from the banking and insurance industries, to law, commerce and defence.\nInitiatives to create norms in cyberspace are multiplying. But more than anything else, these initiatives seem to have fragmented political will and have so far failed to gather support across the board. Emmanuel Macron hopes the Paris Call will bring fresh momentum to the issue by mounting support from influential parties, notably Silicon Valley's top companies and emerging powers.

It is far from a silver bullet; rather it offers a fresh starting point and framework for further negotiations on values and norms of behaviour in cyberspace.\nFigure 1 - The pyramid of means (centre) and their respective objectives (right).\nOverall, the objectives of French cyber security and defence are three-fold: Actively discourage adversaries through a declaratory strategy that includes offensive operations, limit the escalation potential of crises by sanctuarising core infrastructures, and promote a third way model to cyberspace governance.\n## 2. Threat perception\nA state's perception of threats is based on a variety of factors: strategic goals, history and precedent, one's perception of its own weaknesses and dependencies$^{58}$. It is a key concept within rational models such as the one Allison and Zelikow describe. While France approached cybersecurity issues from a dominantly technical perspective at its beginnings, Desforges argues, it shifted towards a model that goes beyond security and defence issues$^{59}$. The Snowden leaks, the rise of jihadist propaganda and the increasingly geopolitical impact of major attacks pushed France to consider broader societal challenges and actors in defining its strategies and policies.\n$^{58}$ Raymond Cohen, “Threat Perception in International Crisis,” *Political Science Quarterly* 93, no. 1 (1978): 93, https://doi.org/10/d95kwg.\n$^{59}$ Alix Desforges, “Approche Géopolitique Du Cyberespace, Enjeux Pour La Défense et La Sécurité Nationale, l’exemple de La France” (Université Paris 8 - Vincennes / Saint-Denis, 2018).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Threat realisation centred around technology and intelligence (2008-2013)\nThe 2008 White Paper$^{(a)}$ mentions Internet in its first chapter, but first as an example of a positive trend, highlighting the rise in connectedness of people around the world. The other side of the coin, it later states, is the challenge of keeping up with the high-paced spread of information and ideas, in other words information control and propaganda. The Paper also dedicates a full-page box to serious cyberattacks detailing the full CIA spectrum. While it does not mention the attacks on Estonia, the Paper foresees such attacks will be multiplying in the following 15 years and considers the risk of a large-scale attack on its critical infrastructures a major threat. It mentions \"cyberwar\" as one of the scenarios which could involve the Atlantic Alliance. In consequence, the Paper mandates 1) a switch from a passive to active defence model, 2) the development of offensive cyber capabilities, strategy and doctrine all focusing on adversarial military systems.\nIt is the very first time France acknowledges cyber threats and decides to act on them in a national public policy document. The Paper also creates a new strategic role for the armed forces known as \"knowledge and anticipation\".\nFigure 2\nStrategic and prospective policy documents in context (yellow, red and green). They are part of complex financial and procurement cycles and reflect well French threat perceptions.\nSources: DGA, CICDE, NATO, EDA. Graph design and editing: by the author. TRL: Technology Readiness Level.\nFive years after the wake-up call of the 2008 White Paper, its successor recognises that the fast-paced evolution of threats and capabilities require to go one \"step further\" in cyberdefence$^{(c)}$. It ambitions to dedicate more human and financial resources to intelligence and operational capabilities, mandates the creation of a cyber reserve force and calls for a broad societal effort from international cooperation to training and public awareness.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nb) Broadening to societal challenges and capabilities build-up (2013-2015)\nThe 2013 White Paper mandated the creation of a national doctrine for major cyber threats response: a coordinated defensive posture mixed with a graduated response from diplomatic, judicial and law enforcement powers to military means when vital interests are at stake. The strategic mission “knowledge and anticipation”, created in 2008, now includes information control in its widest sense (maîtrise de l’information), from trends in cryptography to intelligence gathering and critical infrastructure security. A joint doctrine puts in place a strategic anticipation group which is tasked with mid-term (one to two years) prospective on operational preparedness, military intelligence and international relations. Most critically, the Paper contains France’s official recognition of cyberspace as an operational domain by stating that “cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own”. This is two years after the United States and three years before NATO.\n## “Cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own.”\nThe ensuing pluriannual defence finance law (LPM, 2014-2019) set-out an operational cyberdefence chain integrated to conventional military operations. It reiterated the need for both defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, granting overall 1 billion EUR to cyberdefence.\nIn 2015, the Digital Security Strategy stated that a serious threat (“atteinte significative”) to French citizens data could constitute a national security matter, notably in the context of espionage, propaganda or political destabilisation. The complete shutdown of news channel TV5 Monde that year represented a moment of reckoning for the country’s security agencies, while the leaking of documents stolen from the Macron campaign on the eve of the 2017 election sounded alarm bells at the possibility of foreign meddling in domestic politics, echoing the Clinton campaign.\nc) Institutional and doctrinal military structuring (2017-2019)\nThe 2017 Review emphasises the increasing role of Internet and digital giants (GAFAM, Baidu) on geopolitics and sovereignty, as well as on “strategic intimidation” facilitated by the combination of economic, military and informational pressures such as territorial fait-accompli and mass social network trolling. It also mentions the risk of escalation in cyber and space conflicts, not the least because of first strike temptations. Currently, ANSSI states “destabilisation, espionage and sabotage” as the primary threats it faces.\nThe Cyberdefence Review dedicates a significant part (32 pages) to the evolution of the threat landscape. It relies on the “new normal” scenario to highlight the risks brought by quantum\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\ncomputers, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. It concludes that their level of security will be determining factors for societal safety⁶⁸.\nThe next LPM (2019-2025) reflects this evolution of French threat perception and the impetus granted to the “knowledge and anticipation” mission of the armed forces. The defence budget for 2019 amounts to 35,9 billion EUR, or 1.82% of GDP, pensions excluded⁶⁹. It is planned to increase over the next four years, reaching 44 billion EUR and 2% of GDP in 2023⁷⁰. In 2019, intelligence and cyberdefence constitute already 73% of the Ministry’s hiring effort (+450 personnel in total)⁷¹. By 2025, the armed forces are expected to count on 4000 so-called cyber-combatants, which represent an increase of 25% over six years⁷². Cyberdefence will receive over this period a budget of 1.6 billion Euros, excluding payroll⁷³.\n***\nOver the past decade, France went through three main major evolution stages in its cyber security and defence structuring: threat realisation (2008-2011), capabilities build-up (2013-2015) and an institutional and doctrinal military structuring accompanied by a strong diplomatic impetus (2017-2019). The recently released offensive doctrine is the culmination of this deep transformation. It particularly represents a turning point for the armed forces, breaking offensive operations from their intelligence silo. The wording of the document and of the accompanying speech by Minister Parly also represents a less veiled signal to Russia, a message France had previously been reluctant to send publicly. The Paris Call, in parallel, is an unprecedented attempt at bringing states, major corporations and the civil society together around key values and principles.\n&gt; “France aims to promote international rules and stability [...] to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks [...] to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion.”\nOverall, France aims to promote international rules and stability in the cyber domain to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks room to manoeuvre to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion. Such balance is and will remain delicate, which only reinforces the need for a better understanding of actors’ rationales and policy coordination.",

As we will see, the offence / defence separation principle impact deeply the institutions goals, capabilities and culture.\n1. ANSSI\na) Status, history and relationship with SGDSN\nIn response to the 2008 White Paper, the National Cyber Security Agency, abbreviated in French as ANSSI, was established a year later under the Prime Minister's General Secretary for Defence and National Security (SGDSN). It is a service that exercises national authority on the security of information systems⁷⁴.\nWhile SGDSN is in charge of security issues at large, ANSSI deals with digital affairs widely. It has a specific focus on cybersecurity, but in its widest sense: ANSSI supports the private sector, helps draft France foreign policy on digital issues and works on societal resilience. For instance, its Cyber Anticipation Cell is currently tasked with securing the Paris Olympics 2024⁷⁵. Acting as a strategy, policy and plans cell (J5, in military jargon), its main responsibilities is to advise decision-makers. This difference of scope between ANSSI and SGDSN explains why the Agency reports to the Secretary-General directly (the person), and not the Secretariat-General (as in, the institution)⁷⁶.\nWhy is not ANSSI directly attached to the Prime Minister then? Because belonging to SGDSN provides the Agency with institutional protection against potentially hindering senior civil servants in higher spheres of the government⁷⁷. Indeed, SGDSN reports to the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General is a permanent member of the presidential Defence Councils.\nIts predecessor, the Central Directory for Information Systems Security (DCSSI) was created in 2001 also under the SGDSN, and was itself the successor to the Central Service for Information Systems Security, which existed since 1986. Despite its new name and national authority status, ANSSI has thus deep historical roots.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n⁷⁴ “Décret N° 2009-834 Du 7 Juillet 2009 Portant Création d’un Service à Compétence Nationale Dénommé « Agence Nationale de La Sécurité Des Systèmes d’information »,” 2009-834 § (2009).\n⁷⁵ Emmanuel Germain, ANSSI Deputy Director, Paris, June 27, 2019.\n⁷⁶ Germain.\n⁷⁷ Germain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFigure 3 - The missions and actors of French cyberdefence (Desforges 2018).\nb) Responsibilities\nANSSI has responsibility for coordination of the state's cyber security, hosts the national Computer Emergency Response Team and acts as a regulatory body for the public and private sector alike, primarily for critical infrastructure operators. It plays an unequal role in all six missions of French cyber defence as described in the 2018 Cyber Defence Strategy: cyber threat prevention, anticipation, protection, detection, attribution and reaction. The latter entails technical remediation as well as legal and military action. Alix Desforges78 clarified some of the responsibility sharing that the Cyber Defence Strategy sets-out. While prevention is a cross-government and multistakeholder assignment (ministries, local security representatives, chambers of commerce), anticipation is in essence a threat intelligence task fulfilled by ANSSI and intelligence agencies. Protection (defensive cyber operations and measures) and detection remain the responsibility of ANSSI and its subsidiaries, especially when it comes to private critical infrastructure operators. Attribution of attacks is a joint ANSSI and intelligence services task, while reaction (remediation) is another mission that benefits from subsidiarity.\nThe recognition of cyberspace as a domain of conflict in the 2013 White Paper comes with a new finance law. The 2014-2019 LPM contained two key measures to widen the capabilities of ANSSI. First, it created heavy regulatory obligations on critical infrastructure operators, public and private alike, in terms of their network and industrial control system security, threat detection capabilities and penetration testing, which ANSSI can now perform79. In light of such new powers, it also granted ANSSI with derogations80 with regards to the French Computer Misuse Act81. According to its Deputy Director, ANSSI deals with around 20 attacks from APTs every year82; and these are only those that are detected.\nc) People, identity and organisational culture\nANSSI brings together experts, practitioners and strategists in seven different laboratories and departments. Its two most prominent organisational traits are its exclusive defensive purpose, and its start-up spirit.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFirst, as we described earlier, ANSSI's identity relies mostly on its exclusive defensive purpose. This is the foundation of the French model. Its Director Guillaume Poupard regularly insists on this feature, which seems to infuse very deeply into its operations. Tools that could be dual-use (i.e. for both defensive and offensive purposes) are separately developed at both DGSE (for offense) and ANSSI (for defence), even if it duplicates the effort. However, because of the high pressure on its human resources, DGSE and ANSSI are pooling and sharing their people and increasingly",
    "# Of a defensive culture by nature and legal status, [ANSSI] is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need.": "sharing intelligence. The separation between offense and defence is thus institutional and not absolute. Second, the Agency enjoys describing itself as a start-up, at least in its spirit. This tag however hides large disparities in its workforce: 80% are temporary staff, with a mean age of 30 years old. The remaining 20% are the managers, mostly military or civilian engineers. Overall, the mean age is of 34 years.\nOf a defensive culture by nature and legal status, it is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need. Although its nature and role is less ambiguous than its Anglo-Saxon peers (GCHQ, NSA) its responsibilities make its activities deeply intertwined with those of intelligence agencies, primarily DGSE.\n## 2. Armed Forces and the intelligence community\nThe armed forces play a role in all six cyber security and defence missions we highlighted just below. While they are in charge of defending only their own systems, they have heightened responsibilities with regards to anticipation, detection, attribution and reaction. But each organisation has specific tasks and roles.\n### a) Organisation of military cyber operations\nThe armed forces learned to perform cyber operations \"as they went\", developing capabilities and skills as they needed. The 2008 White Paper however was a major doctrinal disruption, as well as a wake-up call in the aftermath of the Estonian attacks. In addition to the following White Paper and LPM, the then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian launched in 2014 the Cyber Defence Pact. This additional policy document set-out the overall structuring of military cyber defence through six pillars:\n- Hardening the security of its own information and weapon systems,\n- Anticipating technical disruptions by investing in research and development,\n- Reinforcing and structuring human resources dedicated to cyberdefence,\n- Developing a national centre of excellence in Brittany,\n- Reinforcing cooperation with allies in Europe and the Atlantic Alliance,\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n- Fostering a national cyberdefence community and network of trusted partners.\nAs a follow-up to the 2017 Review and as a further step to this military structuring, the Armed Forces ministry established a Cyber Defence Command to coordinate cyber operations within the armed forces. ComCyber, as it is colloquially known, sits directly under the Joint Chief of Staff. Defensively, it serves as an hypervision body, a concept that has a specific meaning in that context:91 it receives and correlates all relevant data related to its systems' security. However, in accordance with a recently released ministerial instruction92, each corps and service remains responsible for its own defensive cyber operations and has its own SOC (Security Operations Centre)93. CALID, the Ministry's SOC, assesses global cyber risk so that ComCyber is able to act and advise political authorities to the best of their knowledge. In other words, defensive cyber operations are modelled on subsidiarity.\nFigure 4 - Simplified graph of military cyber operations, broke-down by their offensive or defensive nature.\nComCyber performs defensive operations by delegation of ANSSI, and must notify the Agency of them94. Consequently, and because both institutions need to share data between each other, CALID is partly co-located with ANSSI. ANSSI typically shares non-military IoCs and ComCyber military ones that may impact civilian systems95. This cooperation and the wider relationship between ANSSI and ComCyber is defined in a specific protocol96.\nNew capabilities for the armed forces: Integrating the cyber domain in conventional and influence operations\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe defensive cyber doctrine entails the prevention, anticipation, detection of and protection against cyber attacks⁹⁷. The scope of the doctrine is limited to reacting to and attributing the attack — within defensive and non-military measures. To perform these tasks, the doctrine sets up an adaptive Permanent Cyber Security Posture, orienting France’s military cyber units to be prepared for what the summary describes as a “peace-crisis-war” continuum⁹⁸. The document thus seems to acknowledge what has been described as a state of unpeace, a state of hostility that falls short of full conflict⁹⁹. This defensive policy is the result of Ministerial Instruction 101000 (Joint Doctrine 3.20)¹⁰⁰. Thus, it covers the whole Ministry and not merely the armed forces.¹⁰¹\nFigure 5\nCovers of the offensive and defensive cyber operations documents.\nIn contrast, the offensive doctrine is only relevant to the armed forces.\nUntil the release of this document, the armed forces had focused on defending their own systems—although with an understood element of active defence—while DGSE was in charge of the most sensitive operations, namely, espionage and disruption of adverse systems.\nWhat is new in the offensive doctrine is the integration of cyber activity in conventional military operations. The offensive approach is described as stealthy actions aimed at denying the availability or\nconfidentiality of adverse systems. Implicitly, the doctrine seems to exclude operations with destructive kinetic effects. It mentions the neutralization of enemy systems, but the concept is ambiguous. Offensive operations can prepare or complement conventional operations—acting as a force multiplier—or substitute them entirely where appropriate. The offensive doctrine also includes counterinfluence operations, aimed at protecting conventional action in cyberspace. Such operations are already performed in the conventional domain through the CIAE, or Joint Centre for Environmental Action, the military influence and civil-military cooperation branch of the French armed forces that was created in 2012. This doctrinal shift reflects an increased perception by the armed forces of propaganda and disinformation threats that could hamper its conventional deployments.\nThe new offensive cyber doctrine expands and details the scope of offensive cyber operations. It assumes their preparation and conduct, not only in a clandestine context but also as an integral part of -or substitute for- conventional military operations¹⁰². As we noted however, it also imposes constraints and rules of engagement on the basis of a strict risk management.\nb) DGSE\nDGSE is the foreign security service and additionally serves as France’s main signals intelligence agency. It sits directly under the Armed Forces Ministry. Until 2014, not much was known publicly by\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nDGSE's activities in the cyber domain. Offensive and espionage operations were deemed to be its responsibilities, but these has been absent from public sight, until forensic analysis¹⁰³ and Snowden-leaks published by Le Monde¹⁰⁴ unveiled a diverse panel of advanced malwares (Casper, Bunny, Babar, Dino) attributed to a French intelligence agency. The leaks seem to have broken an internal taboo. A former DGSE executive, Bernard Barbier, shed some light on such operations shortly after, admitting the agency \"started hacking in 1992\"¹⁰⁵.\nc) DGA\nDGA, the Defence Procurement Agency, has long developed a cybersecurity department, which sits into its \"maîtrise de l'information\" branch. It is tasked with protecting the information and weapon systems of the armed forces, providing technical expertise in threat intelligence, upstream research (also known as discovery stage) and crisis support¹⁰⁶. As part of such responsibilities, it conducts vulnerability research on armed forces' systems¹⁰⁷ and since 2015 organises cyber-wargames¹⁰⁸.\nThe offensive doctrine indicated DGA will adapt its procurement processes to take into account the tempo of operations and nature of these weapons¹⁰⁹. Current processes designed to procure vehicles or submarines, or even major software programs, would be ill-suited. This may hint at the creation of an ad hoc procurement process designed from the ground up to research vulnerabilities and develop exploits and payloads.\n3. Competition and opposition of views\nParochial priorities and perceptions of the respective institutions depend mostly on the structuring of the cyber security and defence apparatus, which core principle is offense-defence separation.\na) Opposition of views between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA\nThe opposition of views or the impact of parochial competition appears most clearly between ANSSI and the armed forces, on two different issues: vulnerability disclosure and end-to-end encryption.\nContrary to the U.S. or, more recently, the U.K., France has no public vulnerability equities process (VEP). Currently, disclosure and sharing between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA is not formalised and happens on a case-by-case basis¹¹⁰. Guillaume Poupard, ANSSI director, communicated briefly about vulnerability research and disclosure at the agency's end-of-year report. In practice, Poupard said, in case of doubt as to the balance of risk, \"the vulnerability goes to the defence\"¹¹¹. However when the\n¹⁰³ Joan Calvet, \"Dino – the Latest Spying Malware from an Allegedly French Espionage Group Analyzed,\" *WeLiveSecurity by ESET* (blog), June 30, 2015, https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/06/30/dino-spying-malware-analyzed/.\n¹⁰⁴ Martin Untersinger and Jacques Follorou, \"La France suspectée de cyberespionnage,\" *Le Monde*, March 21, 2014, https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2014/03/21/la-france-suspectee-de-cyberattaque_4387232_3210.html.\n¹⁰⁵ \"France's Ex-Cyber Spy Chief Speaks Candidly about Hacking Operations,\" *IntelNews.Org* (blog), September 16, 2016, https://intelnews.org/2016/09/16/01-1978/.\n¹⁰⁶ *Défense et Sécurité Nationale* 2013.\n¹⁰⁷ Alexandra Valetta Ardisson and Bastien Lachaud, \"Rapport d'information de Mme Alexandra Valetta Ardisson et M.

Although there is no obvious conflict of views on that topic, the debate on the right risk balancing illustrates well how each agencies' responsibilities and culture influences their stance in critical debates such as this one.\nWe can witness a more obvious conflict of views on the encryption debate. Poupard, circulated within the government in March 2016 a note arguing strongly against \"exceptional access\" legislation, which would allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bypass encryption, either on device or in transit. The Parliament of Australia recently passed such a law, not without public outcry¹¹⁴. In his note, Poupard states:\n“To impose a wide weakening of cryptographic means would affect both digital safety and the freedom of the large majority of law-abiding users, while remaining ineffective against the intended minority target.”\nIt appears that, at the time, DGSE was voicing its concerns against encryption¹¹⁵. In 2018, the head of its technical services, Patrick Pailloux, promoted publicly the idea of in-transit exceptional access, while reaffirming the importance of strong (but not end-to-end by definition) encryption¹¹⁶. It is thus likely that Poupard’s note was a direct rebuke to DGSE’s pressures. In such case, it may be a good example of two principles edited by Allison and Zelkow. First, that where you stand depends on where you sit. Less colloquially known as “the face of the issue differs from seat to seat”¹¹⁷, it explains that, as the head of a defensive agency open to the wider public and private sector, it is expected that its director will oppose the weakening of end-to-end encryption. On the opposite, it is expected that DGSE will seek to extend its interception capabilities, as a signals intelligence agency dedicated to foreign security. Second, this “row” may also be the result of the “51-49 principle”. Even if one isn’t completely convinced by the side of the argument, they must “argue much more confidently than they would if they were detached judges”¹¹⁸ because of parochial competition.\nb) The role of Foreign Affairs and its relationship with other actors.\nThe International Digital Strategy (December 2017) was released only a few months before the Cyber Defence Review (February 2018). Presented as “France’s international strategy”, it could be potentially interpreted as a willingness of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to defend its prerogative in that area. In May 2017, Jean-Yves Le Drian had become Foreign Affairs Minister after almost five years at the Defence Ministry. Although it may have been perceived as such by some in the Armed Forces Ministry¹¹⁹, the international strategy was actually two-years in the making¹²⁰, a long process due in part to its submission to public review. As for the Paris Call, the initiative came from the Cybersecurity and Strategic Affairs division, which then pushed it through to the Minister, who ensured political\nMacron dans les locaux de la DGA-MI à Bruz :pic.twitter.com/elKwQM0k9w,” #WarGames on Twitter (blog), April 15, 2019, https://twitter.com/amaelle_g/status/1117803882032304128.\n¹¹² Guiton.\n¹¹³ Guiton.\n¹¹⁴ Catherine Chapman, “Australian Cybersecurity Industry Reels over Anti-Encryption Law,” The Daily Swig | Web security digest, January 25, 2019, https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/australian-cybersecurity-industry-reels-over-anti-encryption-law.\n¹¹⁵ A ComCyber official, April 18, 2019.\n¹¹⁶ Valéry Marchive, “Le renseignement aime le chiffrement, mais il veut bien des points de clair,” LeMagIT, July 4, 2018, https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252444227/Le-renseignement-aimé-le-chiffrement-mais-il-veut-bien-des-points-de-clair.\n¹¹⁷ Allison and Zelikow, Essence of Decision.

    "# Chapter III - Individuals and processes": "In this short chapter, we attempt a review of key individuals and processes in decision-making. It is a very tentative chapter, because of time and interview constraints. To complete the analysis, more interviews should be conducted at higher political levels.\n## 1) Key individuals in decision and action, and factors influencing their perceptions, preferences and stands\nDuring its annual press conference, ANSSI director stated, on the topic of vulnerabilities disclosure, that in a structure that separates offence and defence, \"the level of where both meet [in the policy-making tree] is very high. It means that sometimes, we must mobilise the highest authorities on these issues\"¹²³.\nBastien Irondelle, in its seminal work on the decision-making process behind the end of French military conscription in 1996, highlighted the everlasting importance of the President.¹²⁴ He detailed how the political impetus Jacques Chirac gave to this major policy decision, in particular during the Defence Councils, made the reform happen¹²⁵. We have demonstrated so far that in the case at hand, French cyber security and defence, the evolution has been gradual, taking place over a decade. However, the same key individuals and processes remain.\nIn practice, the range of meaningful decision-making in cyber security and defence starts at ministerial cabinets, up to the Prime Minister and the President¹²⁶. Major crisis and policy decisions are taken at the presidential level, during Defence Councils.¹²⁷ ANSSI is represented by the SGDSN, ComCyber by the Joint Chief of Staff,¹²⁸ who remains responsible for the military action chain¹²⁹.\nThe Cyber Club identified by Desforges still exists today and brings together the directors of ANSSI, DGA, ComCyber and the technical departments of both domestic and foreign intelligence agencies (DGSI, DGSE)¹³⁰.\nAnother noteworthy trend is the overwhelming majority of military profiles among ANSSI executives. Out of the seven directors and deputy-directors, five have spent most of their careers in the armed forces¹³¹. Such numbers however hide some atypical career paths: the deputy director is a military engineer with a doctorate in public law and an MBA.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n¹²³ Guiton, \"[Thread] [Team #Wargames] Comment est gérée la question des vulnérabilités dites 'zero-day' en France, où on sépare les missions d'attaque et de défense ?

Because of the number of involved actors and their overlap in each mission, the Strategy established four “operational chains” to centralize and streamline public action in the field. They are referred to as the protection, intelligence, judicial investigations and military-action chains. While it is still unclear how these chains work in practice, we were able to collect more information on the committees and groups that coordinate cyber security and defence policy, in theory and in practice.\n### a) Recently formalised processes\nThe Cyber Strategy created two new committees: An Executive Committee, under the President’s Office, and a Steering Committee, under the SGDSN. Political decisions and policy orientations related to cyberdefence are taken during meetings of the National Security and Defence Council. The Executive Committee is tasked with high-level implementation of the Council’s decisions.\nThe Steering Committee’s responsibility is to report on the Strategy’s implementation to the Prime Minister and to prepare the meetings of the Executive Committee. It meets every semester. SGDSN transmits the impetus of political leadership, sets the agenda and ensures the application of the previously decided measures. Ministries and agencies are free to bring forward suggestions.\nAdditionally, a Cyber Crisis Coordination Centre “supervises cyberdefence” and informs decision-makers. The Centre consists of different groups that act at various timelines, even though their names suggest a short-term crisis perimeter. While the Technical Group acts on short-term incidents, Strategy is a “sub-political” group that acts on mid-term strategy to prepare steering committee meetings. It is open to other ministries, of which most individuals present are administration directors (directeurs d’administration centrale). They offer regular situation reports to the Prime Minister and the President, and suggests policy options. They meet monthly. The Technico-Operational Group (TechOps), on the other hand, is a restricted group with few institutions represented. Its main purpose is to share specific threat intelligence, and it thus open to only a handful of intelligence agencies.\n### b) Importance of informal coordination processes\nTechOps is only very briefly described in official documents. However it reminds of the “Cyber Club” Alix Desforges described in her thesis. This informal grouping of agency heads took another dimension with the writing process of the Cyber Strategy. According to an official, the writing\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nprocess itself greatly enhanced communication between relevant stakeholders. In other words, the process of creating processes, enhanced communication and coordination between actors. At its creation, TechOps the people and institutions involved warmly welcomed it, and it quickly became indispensable$^{144}$. Some degree of informality remains today. In addition to what we have already described, informal ad-hoc meetings keep happening to deal with specific issues.\n***\nWhen it comes to formal processes, the highest political authorities remain in charge of major policy-decisions. Informal meetings have lead to the formalisation of intelligence sharing and mid to low level policy coordination.\n*\n*",
    "# Conclusion": "From its sovereign principles to the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence institutions, France revendicates an atypical model. At the top, strategic autonomy infuses major political, financial and policy decisions. Domestically, although officials strongly reaffirm the separation of offence and defence activities, in practice such separation can be described as institutional at best, due to the fluidity of human resources between agencies. This separation has nonetheless a genuine impact on policy-making and public debates: differences in parochial priorities and organisational cultures between ANSSI and the armed forces create conflicting views on tough topics such as end-to-end encryption or vulnerability disclosure. Finally, while the executive remains key in decision-making, informal processes and meta-processes have been instrumental in the development of an efficient state cyber security and defence community. To complete and build-up on this exploratory paper, further research on how such processes work out in practice could be conducted.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)",

France is no exception. We have seen in recent months a revival of its efforts to secure its citizens and interests in cyber space. French President Emmanuel Macron presented in late 2018 the \"Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace\", a package of norms of good behaviour bringing together states, private corporations and the civil society. All the while, in the past two years, the government designed its very first Cyber Defence Strategy and the Armed Forces unveiled some elements of their offensive and defensive cyber operations. How can we make sense of it all?\nWe frame the current picture by following Allison and Zelikow's three conceptual models of decision-making: Rational actor, organisational behaviour, and government politics. In accordance with each model, we seek to answer the following questions, respectively:\nR1: What are the underlying principles, goals and objectives of French national defence and security, in general terms and in the cyber domain?\nR2: What are the institutions involved in cyber security and defence, their perimeters of action and organisational culture?\nR3: What are the processes and individuals involved in cyber security and defence policy-making at the politico-strategic level?\nTo do so we combine an extensive review of the literature with a series of interviews with senior French officials from ministries, as well as national agencies and other specialised institutions.\n# Objectives and limitations\nThe objective of this paper is three-fold: describing, explaining and, by extension, predicting. First, we hope to provide a better understanding of the current French cyber security and defence policy picture its founding political and doctrinal principles. Second, by applying Allison and Zelikow's models to this picture, we seek to explain how policy-making in this area happens in practice. This approach diverges slightly from the models' original purpose, which is to analyse a specific case-study and its cluster of decisions (\"Why did the Soviets smuggle nuclear missiles into Cuba?\" \"Why did the US respond by imposing a naval blockade?\"). This paper does not ambition to explain why France launched the Paris Call or why it published parts of the armed forces' offensive cyber operations doctrine. Scholars and journalists have already started answering them. Rather, it seeks to provide a toolkit so that scholars, practitioners or journalists can design more accurate hypotheses about why future decision X or Y was taken in that domain. There is no doubt this toolkit will be incomplete and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nimperfect. Not all policy documents are public, some processes and institutions are still recent, and we lack the ability to stand back so that we can grasp how some processes work-out in practice. Another obstacle is that these principles, policies, doctrines, processes and institutions live through the minds and acts of leaders, policy-makers and practitioners, whom the author has not been able to all interview. In particular, the author was unable to meet officials from SGDSN itself, the Élysée Palace and Prime Minister's Office. This is where the work of Bastien Irondelle becomes key. The third -indirect- objective of this paper, is prediction. As Allison and Zelikow highlight, it is “the logical flipside of explanations”. If we understand more accurately the processes and factors that lead to decisions, we can extrapolate about future events. The predictive power of the model will however be highly dependent on the strength of its explanatory qualities.\n## Acknowledgement and appreciation\nThe author is grateful to IRSEM for hosting him and the warm welcome.

This is the rational actor model. In our case, France is the identified state. More often than not, political cycles lead to new policies and strategies. When relevant, the state thus becomes personified, in relation to a specific presidency. In this model we adopt a bounded rationality viewpoint, whereas we accept that “values, beliefs and stereotypes” play a role in the actors’ rationality.\n## 1. Political concepts, principles and goals\nIn this first part we analyse France’s core political concepts of sovereignty and strategic autonomy, the rationale behind the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence apparatus, and the one behind its communication and attribution stance.\n### a. France’s sovereignty, national and European strategic autonomy\nFrance has a conceptualisation of sovereignty that makes it stand out of its peers. Baezner and Robin found in their comparative analysis that “France was unique among the states examined in that it used the word “sovereignty” more frequently and in different contexts”. Sovereignty, in its French understanding, cannot be restrained to hard sovereignty, i.e. the protection of its citizens, borders and other existential interests. French sovereignty is a wide spectrum that implies strategic autonomy. The 2017 Strategic Review defines strategic autonomy as a two pillar concept entailing 1) a high level of industrial and technological autonomy, and 2) an operational autonomy. On technological autonomy, the Ministry of the Armed Forces has recently ramped up its strategy, with the creation of a dedicated investment fund, DefInvest. Its first investments were made in microprocessors and high precision optics manufacturers. Operational autonomy means the ability to reach an informed decision and to take action, in particular in the context of political or military crises. The French military operation in Mali, for instance, is a good illustration of operational autonomy: the ability to engage in full scope – low to high intensity– operations, with allies or on its own if necessary.\nFrench strategic autonomy can be best described as neo-Gaullist. It is characterised by a strong sense of national independence but recognises the need for a powerful political Europe. Its historical drivers and roots come indeed from a traditional Gaullist doctrine of national autonomy, which is more self-reliant. The perceived need for self-reliance played a major role in driving De Gaulle to transform France into a nuclear power and to leave NATO integrated command in 1966. Some key historical events such as the 1940 surrender, the intelligence frustrations of the 1992 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq war further fuelled perceptions that France needed both a credible nuclear arsenal, and autonomous intelligence capabilities.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n---\n Allison and Zelikow.

Claude Faure, “Bref historique des services de renseignement et de sécurité français contemporains,” *Revue historique des armées*, no. 247 (June 15, 2007): 70–81.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThis spirit of autonomy remains today, but with a wider pragmatic recognition of the need for cooperation and integration. France re-joined NATO command in 2009 for mainly pragmatism and influence reasons. However the French nuclear arsenal remains outside of NATO command and its intelligence apparatus outside of the 5-Eyes community. France' strategic autonomy is also reliant on a European strategic autonomy, which it seeks to develop. The Hubert Védrine report recommended that the country's return into NATO command is accompanied by a strengthening of European defence integration and cooperation, especially in the R&amp;D of technological and industrial capacities. It encourages the development of mutual interdependence with entities who share critical interests, particularly within the EU. This policy shift initiated in 1992 with the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy was confirmed in the 2008 White Paper, placing the EU as \"a central tenet of [France's] security policy\". This central place was reaffirmed ever since, including in the last cyber strategy document.\nb) Domestic apparatus: Offense / defence separation\nDomestically, the French approach contrasts with that embraced by the United States or the United Kingdom. Most notably, France assumes a clear separation between offensive and defensive cyber operations. This means that, contrary to the U.S.' National Security Agency (NSA) or the U.K.'s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), France's leading agency for cybersecurity is exclusively dedicated to defensive operations and not part of the intelligence community. This is a defining element of the Cyber Strategy Review and infuses the whole structure of French cyberdefence. The rationale is that having a distinct defensive agency separate from offense-oriented military intelligence agencies \"facilitates the acceptance of state intervention [...] whether in public administration or the economic sphere\".\nc) A counter-threat model based on direct communication rather than public attribution\nPeculiarities of the French model are not limited to its conceptualisation of sovereignty. On the diplomatic stage, France has also adopted a different stance than most of its counterparts. A number of NATO allies are increasingly inclined to \"name and shame\" states involved in cyber attacks. One telling example can be found in October 2018, when the U.S., U.K., Canada and the Netherlands denounced Russian attempts at disrupting the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Paris expressed its solidarity but fell short of blaming Moscow. Already in 2015, when what then seemed to be ISIS took down TV5Monde in a major hack, no official attribution was made. ANSSI, the national cybersecurity agency, however briefed four dozen media outlets with details of its forensic investigation and indicators of compromise. These details were then analysed by private security firms which pointed the finger at persistent threat actor (APT) . Additionally, TV5Monde director Yves Bigot reported in L'Express\n\"France favours red phones over the megaphone.\"\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nthat ANSSI personnel suggested it was a false-flag (\"un leurre\"). More recently, in the case of the #MacronLeaks, France did not issue any kind of attribution either. G. Poupard, head of ANSSI, refused to do so arguing \"the attack was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone\". More recently, the Secretary General for Defence and National Security clarified France's official policy: attribution can only be performed on the basis of elements collected or verified by French services, typically ANSSI and DGSE.\nThis does not mean that it does not have attribution capabilities. As we will see in Chapter II, attributing cyber-attacks is one of the main missions of the French cyberdefence apparatus. But even when it knows, France prefers forthright bilateral dialogues with Russia and other cyber powers such as the U.S., China, India, Brazil and Japan. It appears it even opened a deconfliction cell with the Russian Security Council on cyber matters. Only in last resort will France take part in public name and shame. In other words, it favours red phones over the megaphone.\nThere is only one recorded instance of public attribution, and it is indirect. At the unveiling of the offensive cyber doctrine, Minister Parly revealed that an APT targeted email accounts of high-ranking officials between 2017 and 2018, with the objective of uncovering the navy's oil supply chain. Though the Minister stopped short of explicitly recognizing the group's affiliation with the Russian Federation, she indirectly attributed the attacker's mode of operation to a specific group known as Turla.\nUnder Egloff's definition, France engages in two attribution processes. First a process of sense-making attribution, for the benefit of its own factual understanding, that it rarely communicates publicly. Second, in a meaning-making process, with regards to its adversaries. But again, it does so rather privately than publicly. Overall, French strategy with attribution seem to fit a counter-threat model.\nIn this first part, we have detailed how France conceives its sovereignty and what it means by strategic autonomy. We have also sought to explain its rationale behind the offence / defence separation and to describe its policy of non-public attribution.\n## 2. The evolution and granularization of objectives of French cyber security and defence\nIn this second part we review the cyber security and defence objectives produced by political and military authorities, from 2011 to 2019. We identify three main themes: active discouragement, risk limitation and direct communication.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe Defence and National Security White Paper 2008 is the first of its kind to mention Internet-related threats and leads to the creation of ANSSI. The Agency releases in 2011 the “National Strategy for the Defence and Security of Information Systems”. It’s four goals are:\n- For France to become a top-tier cyber power,\n- To guarantee freedom of decision through confidentiality of state secrets,\n- To reinforce the security of critical infrastructures,\n- To ensure cybersecurity to public and private actors alike.\nThe second version of the Strategy revolved around 1) state secrets and critical infrastructures, 2) digital privacy and cybercrime, 3) public sensitisation and training, 4) business and export strategies, and 5) Europe, digital sovereignty and norms.\nFollowing the election of Emmanuel Macron to the Presidency, the President requests officially tasks the Armed Forces Ministry to create a panel of experts with a view to write a new defence white paper. The Strategic Review for Defence and National Security, as it is then known, is released in 2017. It promotes digital sovereignty and cybersecurity to top priorities of national defence.\nIn February 2018, the country’s first National Strategy for Cyber Defence clarified both the organization and integration of cyber operations among all government entities as well as the national and international legal framework surrounding their use. It sets-out goals and processes as part of a “robust national cyber security and defence apparatus”.\nThe seven principles underpinning the Strategy are:\n1. To make the security of French information and communication systems a priority,\n2. To embrace a policy of active discouragement and coordinated response,\n3. To fully exercise its digital sovereignty,\n4. To bring an efficient judicial response to cybercriminality,\n5. To promote a shared cybersecurity culture,\n6. To contribute to a trusted and safe digital Europe,\n7. To act internationally for a collective governance of cyberspace.\nTo achieve said goals, the Strategy sets-out a number of policy-making and coordination processes (see Chapter III). In practice, three main themes appear: Active discouragement, risk limitation and multilateralism.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n Services du Premier Ministre, “Stratégie Nationale Pour La Sécurité Du Numérique” (Paris, October 16, 2015), https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/la-strategie-nationale-pour-la-securite-du-numerique-une-reponse-aux-nouveaux-enjeux-des-usages-numeriques/.\n “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n Francois Delerue and Aude Gery, “France’s Cyberdefense Strategic Review and International Law,” Lawfare, March 23, 2018, https://www.lawfareblog.com/frances-cyberdefense-strategic-review-and-international-law.\n In French as « Dispositif national de protection et de défense informatique robuste ». “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n France reserves its concept of deterrence (dissuasion) to the nuclear domain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Active discouragement\nFrance has adopted a posture of active discouragement against advanced threats. It relies on direct communication with the adversary, as we have detailed earlier, and on an increasingly explicit declaratory strategy.\nIn January 2019 Minister Florence Parly unveiled the offensive and defensive cyber operations doctrines of the armed forces. The announcement is the latest and strongest step taken by the country as part of its declaratory strategy. In response to cyber and other threats, France is “not afraid” of using cyber weapons. The country did not wait until then to perform offensive operations or even to publicly admit doing so. Such operations were first mentioned in the 2008 White Paper and then again with more details in 2013. The case for proportional reprisals in response to a major attack was also made clearly by then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian:\n“In times of war, cyber weapons may be the response, or part of our response, to an armed attack [aggression armée], being of a cyber nature or otherwise”.\nb) Risk limitation and infrastructure sanctuarisation\nRisks that are inherent to cyberspace and operations are a recurrent topic in policy documents.\nThe offensive doctrine places great emphasis on the consideration and mitigation of political, legal and military risks. It mandates a risk balancing exercise in the preparation and conduct of offensive operations: against the risk of escalation in an asymmetric environment, or against the risk of collateral or indirect damage on civilian infrastructures. This balancing exercise – and the need not to reveal too much details – may be the reason the doctrine does not clearly mention physical destruction of information systems.\nInternationally, France aims to promote existing institutional mechanisms to “limit hacking and destabilising activities” in cyberspace, notably through an international initiative, the “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace”, unveiled in November 2018.\nIn terms of international law, the document encourages more extensive and better coordinated regulation of cyberspace in the spirit of founding principles of the U.N. Charter, notably the maintenance of international peace and security. It recognizes not only the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyberspace, but of international human rights and customary international law more broadly as well. It also advocates for the development of new ways to prevent intellectual property theft, i.e. industrial espionage.\nAnother key theme of the document is the importance of protecting individuals and critical infrastructures from harm. The document presses to safeguard the “public core of the Internet” from hostile actors. This is a clear demonstration of support for a package of norms unveiled by the Global\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nCommission for the Stability of Cyberspace on Nov. 8 in Singapore. Reflecting the view of most states on the matter, the Call promotes the exclusive role of sovereign states in hostile acts in cyberspace. It condemns corporate hack-back and other offensive operations from non-state actors. It also appeals for measures preventing interference with elections, another contemporary hot topic.\nClearly absent in the text are issues of espionage and state-lead low-intensity offensive operations. The need to compromise and willingness to gather support across states with various political mindsets means offensive cyber operations was probably out of scope of the Call from its inception.\nc) Multilateralism and stakeholderism\nOn the international stage, one of France's goals relates to the diplomatic process itself. The country seeks to maintain a form of inclusive multilateralism, and in parallel to open-up debates on cyberspace governance to non-state actors.\nIts International Digital Strategy puts great emphasis into promoting an \"open, diverse and trusted\" cyberspace in which it envisions the European Union as a key player. The Strategy itself was subject to public consultations.\nThe Paris Call comes in the wake of the strategy. In addition to its normative nature we detailed earlier, to engage industries and civil society, the document also promotes everyday good practices (\"cyber hygiene\") and the implementation of \"security by design\" in products and services. It is not the first initiative of its kind. In April 2018, Microsoft launched its \"Digital Peace\" campaign along with a \"Cybersecurity Tech Accord\" aimed at getting the internet and the technology industry to better protect their customers' privacy and security against cyberattacks. Similarly, Siemens unveiled in May 2018 a \"Charter of Trust\" that seeks to develop adherence to security principles and processes, with the aim of developing a \"global standard\" for cybersecurity.\nUntil those recent developments, norm-building initiatives were the prerogative of states. In 2015, the U.N.'s Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recognized that international humanitarian law applied to cyberspace, though it then deadlocked when at the end of 2017. Although a new process was put in place for 2019 up to 2021, the two blocs—one group led by the United States and another by China and Russia—are unlikely to solve the stalemate.\nApproaching the issue from various stakeholders' perspectives, the Paris Call is an attempt to move away from this international deadlock. Macron, at its unveiling at UNESCO, made the case for rebuffing what he described as a binary choice between \"a Californian Internet and a Chinese\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nInternet\"54. So far, he argued, these two opposite narratives have monopolized the debate and imposed two radically different yet unsatisfactory alternatives: either a model of mere technical governance led by Silicon Valley, or an overwhelming regulation led by authoritarian regimes. While the former does not address issues of privacy and malicious actors, the latter cracks down on human rights and could lead to a \"balkanisation\" of internet and of wider cyberspace55.\nAccording to Le Monde, Microsoft first approached the French government to obtain its support for the Tech Accord56. However, the country found the Accord too narrow and industry-oriented. Recognizing a trend of norms fragmentation coupled with diplomatic deadlocks, France saw an opportunity to take the lead on governance. But this was only possible if the call achieved two things: First, it needed to widen the scope of existing sector-specific initiatives (Tech Accord, GGE, For The Web) into meaningful norms all actors could get behind. Second, it needed to gather and federate existing initiatives, otherwise it would just contribute to the further fragmentation of norms. So far the call seems to have mostly succeeded, with a notable caveat among state signatories.\nAmong the 64 state signatories, European countries are the most heavily present. However, almost every continent is represented: among them we find Qatar, South Korea, Mexico, Japan, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Senegal and New-Zealand. Critically, on release day, key potential signatories such as India or Brazil are not on the list. The absence of such countries may become problematic. While the U.S. (at least for now), China and Russia are unlikely to join, the Call will rely on support from States like India and Brazil in order to gain traction within international institutions, primarily the United Nations. Macron, aware of this challenge, suggested that the Internet Governance Forum—a U.N. event—become responsible for monitoring the effective implementation of the call and be moved under the direct supervision of the U.N. Secretary General57.\nThe document has already drawn support from influential non-governmental groups. The World Leadership Alliance, Chatham House, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Internet Society have committed to its principles. Technical governance bodies, such as the Number Resource Organization and the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre—the region's internet registry—expressed interest too. Powerful business lobbies are another prominent group of signatories, including notably, Indian business guilds such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Internet and Mobile Association of India and the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum. In total, as many as 300 universities, NGOs and professional associations have committed to the call.\nIn the industrial landscape, France succeeded in attracting both major initiatives: The Tech Accord and the Charter of Trust represent a significant share of the private-sector signatories, as together they represent 85 powerful corporations such as Airbus, Cisco and Facebook. But the call is not a mere shell for existing groups. Notable newcomers include Google, Samsung Electronics, Intel Corporation, Kaspersky Lab, Thales and many other companies, ranging from the banking and insurance industries, to law, commerce and defence.\nInitiatives to create norms in cyberspace are multiplying. But more than anything else, these initiatives seem to have fragmented political will and have so far failed to gather support across the board. Emmanuel Macron hopes the Paris Call will bring fresh momentum to the issue by mounting support from influential parties, notably Silicon Valley's top companies and emerging powers. The Call is\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nrestrained in scope, avoiding the most sensitive activities such as espionage and offensive operations, but this restraint makes it more likely to receive support across a wider group of stakeholders. It is far from a silver bullet; rather it offers a fresh starting point and framework for further negotiations on values and norms of behaviour in cyberspace.\nFigure 1 - The pyramid of means (centre) and their respective objectives (right).\nOverall, the objectives of French cyber security and defence are three-fold: Actively discourage adversaries through a declaratory strategy that includes offensive operations, limit the escalation potential of crises by sanctuarising core infrastructures, and promote a third way model to cyberspace governance.\n## 2. Threat perception\nA state's perception of threats is based on a variety of factors: strategic goals, history and precedent, one's perception of its own weaknesses and dependencies$^{58}$. It is a key concept within rational models such as the one Allison and Zelikow describe. While France approached cybersecurity issues from a dominantly technical perspective at its beginnings, Desforges argues, it shifted towards a model that goes beyond security and defence issues$^{59}$. The Snowden leaks, the rise of jihadist propaganda and the increasingly geopolitical impact of major attacks pushed France to consider broader societal challenges and actors in defining its strategies and policies.\n$^{58}$ Raymond Cohen, “Threat Perception in International Crisis,” *Political Science Quarterly* 93, no. 1 (1978): 93, https://doi.org/10/d95kwg.\n$^{59}$ Alix Desforges, “Approche Géopolitique Du Cyberespace, Enjeux Pour La Défense et La Sécurité Nationale, l’exemple de La France” (Université Paris 8 - Vincennes / Saint-Denis, 2018).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Threat realisation centred around technology and intelligence (2008-2013)\nThe 2008 White Paper$^{(a)}$ mentions Internet in its first chapter, but first as an example of a positive trend, highlighting the rise in connectedness of people around the world. The other side of the coin, it later states, is the challenge of keeping up with the high-paced spread of information and ideas, in other words information control and propaganda. The Paper also dedicates a full-page box to serious cyberattacks detailing the full CIA spectrum. While it does not mention the attacks on Estonia, the Paper foresees such attacks will be multiplying in the following 15 years and considers the risk of a large-scale attack on its critical infrastructures a major threat. It mentions \"cyberwar\" as one of the scenarios which could involve the Atlantic Alliance. In consequence, the Paper mandates 1) a switch from a passive to active defence model, 2) the development of offensive cyber capabilities, strategy and doctrine all focusing on adversarial military systems.\nIt is the very first time France acknowledges cyber threats and decides to act on them in a national public policy document. The Paper also creates a new strategic role for the armed forces known as \"knowledge and anticipation\".\nFigure 2\nStrategic and prospective policy documents in context (yellow, red and green).

TRL: Technology Readiness Level.\nFive years after the wake-up call of the 2008 White Paper, its successor recognises that the fast-paced evolution of threats and capabilities require to go one \"step further\" in cyberdefence$^{(c)}$. It ambitions to dedicate more human and financial resources to intelligence and operational capabilities, mandates the creation of a cyber reserve force and calls for a broad societal effort from international cooperation to training and public awareness.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nb) Broadening to societal challenges and capabilities build-up (2013-2015)\nThe 2013 White Paper mandated the creation of a national doctrine for major cyber threats response: a coordinated defensive posture mixed with a graduated response from diplomatic, judicial and law enforcement powers to military means when vital interests are at stake. The strategic mission “knowledge and anticipation”, created in 2008, now includes information control in its widest sense (maîtrise de l’information), from trends in cryptography to intelligence gathering and critical infrastructure security. A joint doctrine puts in place a strategic anticipation group which is tasked with mid-term (one to two years) prospective on operational preparedness, military intelligence and international relations[62]. Most critically, the Paper contains France’s official recognition of cyberspace as an operational domain by stating that “cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own”. This is two years after the United States[63] and three years before NATO[64].\n## “Cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own.”\nThe ensuing pluriannual defence finance law (LPM, 2014-2019) set-out an operational cyberdefence chain integrated to conventional military operations. It reiterated the need for both defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, granting overall 1 billion EUR to cyberdefence.\nIn 2015, the Digital Security Strategy stated that a serious threat (“atteinte significative”) to French citizens data could constitute a national security matter, notably in the context of espionage, propaganda or political destabilisation[65]. The complete shutdown of news channel TV5 Monde that year represented a moment of reckoning for the country’s security agencies, while the leaking of documents stolen from the Macron campaign on the eve of the 2017 election sounded alarm bells at the possibility of foreign meddling in domestic politics, echoing the Clinton campaign.\nc) Institutional and doctrinal military structuring (2017-2019)\nThe 2017 Review emphasises the increasing role of Internet and digital giants (GAFAM, Baidu) on geopolitics and sovereignty, as well as on “strategic intimidation” facilitated by the combination of economic, military and informational pressures such as territorial fait-accompli and mass social network trolling. It also mentions the risk of escalation in cyber and space conflicts, not the least because of first strike temptations. Currently, ANSSI states “destabilisation, espionage and sabotage” as the primary threats it faces[66].\nThe Cyberdefence Review dedicates a significant part (32 pages) to the evolution of the threat landscape. It relies on the “new normal” scenario to highlight the risks brought by quantum\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\ncomputers, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. It concludes that their level of security will be determining factors for societal safety.\nThe next LPM (2019-2025) reflects this evolution of French threat perception and the impetus granted to the “knowledge and anticipation” mission of the armed forces. The defence budget for 2019 amounts to 35,9 billion EUR, or 1.82% of GDP, pensions excluded. It is planned to increase over the next four years, reaching 44 billion EUR and 2% of GDP in 2023. In 2019, intelligence and cyberdefence constitute already 73% of the Ministry’s hiring effort (+450 personnel in total). By 2025, the armed forces are expected to count on 4000 so-called cyber-combatants, which represent an increase of 25% over six years. Cyberdefence will receive over this period a budget of 1.6 billion Euros, excluding payroll.\n***\nOver the past decade, France went through three main major evolution stages in its cyber security and defence structuring: threat realisation (2008-2011), capabilities build-up (2013-2015) and an institutional and doctrinal military structuring accompanied by a strong diplomatic impetus (2017-2019). The recently released offensive doctrine is the culmination of this deep transformation. It particularly represents a turning point for the armed forces, breaking offensive operations from their intelligence silo. The wording of the document and of the accompanying speech by Minister Parly also represents a less veiled signal to Russia, a message France had previously been reluctant to send publicly. The Paris Call, in parallel, is an unprecedented attempt at bringing states, major corporations and the civil society together around key values and principles.\n&gt; “France aims to promote international rules and stability [...] to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks [...] to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion.”\nOverall, France aims to promote international rules and stability in the cyber domain to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks room to manoeuvre to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion. Such balance is and will remain delicate, which only reinforces the need for a better understanding of actors’ rationales and policy coordination.\n# Chapter II – Relevant organisations, their goals and capabilities\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.” P.31.\n Ministère des Armées, “Communiqué - Budget 2019 : LPM année 1,” September 25, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/communaute-defense/communique-du-ministere-des-armees_-budget-2019-lpm-annee-1.\n Ministère des Armées.\n Ministère des Armées.\n Ministère des Armées, “Guide Explicitatif: Les Réserves Cyber,” November 15, 2016, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/491674/7859279/file/20161115_EMACYBER_Guide_explicitatif.pdf.\n Ministère des Armées, “Projet de Loi Relatif à La Programmation Militaire Pour Les Années 2019 à 2025 et Portant Diverses Dispositions Intéressant La Défense,” February 6, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/523150/8769279/file/LPM%202019-2025%20-%20Rapport%20annexe.pdf.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFollowing the organisational behaviour model of Allison and Zelikow, we now turn to the main institutional players in cyber security and defence. As we will see, the offence / defence separation principle impact deeply the institutions goals, capabilities and culture.\n1. ANSSI\na) Status, history and relationship with SGDSN\nIn response to the 2008 White Paper, the National Cyber Security Agency, abbreviated in French as ANSSI, was established a year later under the Prime Minister's General Secretary for Defence and National Security (SGDSN). It is a service that exercises national authority on the security of information systems.\nWhile SGDSN is in charge of security issues at large, ANSSI deals with digital affairs widely. It has a specific focus on cybersecurity, but in its widest sense: ANSSI supports the private sector, helps draft France foreign policy on digital issues and works on societal resilience. For instance, its Cyber Anticipation Cell is currently tasked with securing the Paris Olympics 2024. Acting as a strategy, policy and plans cell (J5, in military jargon), its main responsibilities is to advise decision-makers. This difference of scope between ANSSI and SGDSN explains why the Agency reports to the Secretary-General directly (the person), and not the Secretariat-General (as in, the institution).\nWhy is not ANSSI directly attached to the Prime Minister then? Because belonging to SGDSN provides the Agency with institutional protection against potentially hindering senior civil servants in higher spheres of the government. Indeed, SGDSN reports to the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General is a permanent member of the presidential Defence Councils.\nIts predecessor, the Central Directory for Information Systems Security (DCSSI) was created in 2001 also under the SGDSN, and was itself the successor to the Central Service for Information Systems Security, which existed since 1986. Despite its new name and national authority status, ANSSI has thus deep historical roots.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n “Décret N° 2009-834 Du 7 Juillet 2009 Portant Création d’un Service à Compétence Nationale Dénommé « Agence Nationale de La Sécurité Des Systèmes d’information »,” 2009-834 § (2009).\n Emmanuel Germain, ANSSI Deputy Director, Paris, June 27, 2019.\n Germain.\n Germain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFigure 3 - The missions and actors of French cyberdefence (Desforges 2018).\nb) Responsibilities\nANSSI has responsibility for coordination of the state's cyber security, hosts the national Computer Emergency Response Team and acts as a regulatory body for the public and private sector alike, primarily for critical infrastructure operators. It plays an unequal role in all six missions of French cyber defence as described in the 2018 Cyber Defence Strategy: cyber threat prevention, anticipation, protection, detection, attribution and reaction. The latter entails technical remediation as well as legal and military action. Alix Desforges78 clarified some of the responsibility sharing that the Cyber Defence Strategy sets-out. While prevention is a cross-government and multistakeholder assignment (ministries, local security representatives, chambers of commerce), anticipation is in essence a threat intelligence task fulfilled by ANSSI and intelligence agencies. Protection (defensive cyber operations and measures) and detection remain the responsibility of ANSSI and its subsidiaries, especially when it comes to private critical infrastructure operators. Attribution of attacks is a joint ANSSI and intelligence services task, while reaction (remediation) is another mission that benefits from subsidiarity.\nThe recognition of cyberspace as a domain of conflict in the 2013 White Paper comes with a new finance law. The 2014-2019 LPM contained two key measures to widen the capabilities of ANSSI. First, it created heavy regulatory obligations on critical infrastructure operators, public and private alike, in terms of their network and industrial control system security, threat detection capabilities and penetration testing, which ANSSI can now perform79. In light of such new powers, it also granted ANSSI with derogations80 with regards to the French Computer Misuse Act81. According to its Deputy Director, ANSSI deals with around 20 attacks from APTs every year82; and these are only those that are detected.\nc) People, identity and organisational culture\nANSSI brings together experts, practitioners and strategists in seven different laboratories and departments. Its two most prominent organisational traits are its exclusive defensive purpose, and its start-up spirit.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFirst, as we described earlier, ANSSI's identity relies mostly on its exclusive defensive purpose. This is the foundation of the French model. Its Director Guillaume Poupard regularly insists on this feature, which seems to infuse very deeply into its operations. Tools that could be dual-use (i.e. for both defensive and offensive purposes) are separately developed at both DGSE (for offense) and ANSSI (for defence), even if it duplicates the effort[83]. However, because of the high pressure on its human resources, DGSE and ANSSI are pooling and sharing their people and increasingly\n# Of a defensive culture by nature and legal status, [ANSSI] is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need.\nsharing intelligence[84]. The separation between offense and defence is thus institutional and not absolute. Second, the Agency enjoys describing itself as a start-up, at least in its spirit[85]. This tag however hides large disparities in its workforce: 80% are temporary staff, with a mean age of 30 years old[86]. The remaining 20% are the managers, mostly military or civilian engineers[87]. Overall, the mean age is of 34 years[88].\nOf a defensive culture by nature and legal status, it is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need. Although its nature and role is less ambiguous than its Anglo-Saxon peers (GCHQ, NSA) its responsibilities make its activities deeply intertwined with those of intelligence agencies, primarily DGSE.\n## 2. Armed Forces and the intelligence community\nThe armed forces play a role in all six cyber security and defence missions we highlighted just below. While they are in charge of defending only their own systems, they have heightened responsibilities with regards to anticipation, detection, attribution and reaction. But each organisation has specific tasks and roles.\n### a) Organisation of military cyber operations\nThe armed forces learned to perform cyber operations \"as they went\", developing capabilities and skills as they needed[89]. The 2008 White Paper however was a major doctrinal disruption[90], as well as a wake-up call in the aftermath of the Estonian attacks. In addition to the following White Paper and LPM, the then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian launched in 2014 the Cyber Defence Pact. This additional policy document set-out the overall structuring of military cyber defence through six pillars:\n- Hardening the security of its own information and weapon systems,\n- Anticipating technical disruptions by investing in research and development,\n- Reinforcing and structuring human resources dedicated to cyberdefence,\n- Developing a national centre of excellence in Brittany,\n- Reinforcing cooperation with allies in Europe and the Atlantic Alliance,\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n- Fostering a national cyberdefence community and network of trusted partners.\nAs a follow-up to the 2017 Review and as a further step to this military structuring, the Armed Forces ministry established a Cyber Defence Command to coordinate cyber operations within the armed forces. ComCyber, as it is colloquially known, sits directly under the Joint Chief of Staff. Defensively, it serves as an hypervision body, a concept that has a specific meaning in that context:91 it receives and correlates all relevant data related to its systems' security. However, in accordance with a recently released ministerial instruction92, each corps and service remains responsible for its own defensive cyber operations and has its own SOC (Security Operations Centre)93. CALID, the Ministry's SOC, assesses global cyber risk so that ComCyber is able to act and advise political authorities to the best of their knowledge. In other words, defensive cyber operations are modelled on subsidiarity.\nFigure 4 - Simplified graph of military cyber operations, broke-down by their offensive or defensive nature.\nComCyber performs defensive operations by delegation of ANSSI, and must notify the Agency of them94. Consequently, and because both institutions need to share data between each other, CALID is partly co-located with ANSSI. ANSSI typically shares non-military IoCs and ComCyber military ones that may impact civilian systems95. This cooperation and the wider relationship between ANSSI and ComCyber is defined in a specific protocol96.\nNew capabilities for the armed forces: Integrating the cyber domain in conventional and influence operations\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe defensive cyber doctrine entails the prevention, anticipation, detection of and protection against cyber attacks. The scope of the doctrine is limited to reacting to and attributing the attack — within defensive and non-military measures. To perform these tasks, the doctrine sets up an adaptive Permanent Cyber Security Posture, orienting France’s military cyber units to be prepared for what the summary describes as a “peace-crisis-war” continuum. The document thus seems to acknowledge what has been described as a state of unpeace, a state of hostility that falls short of full conflict. This defensive policy is the result of Ministerial Instruction 101000 (Joint Doctrine 3.20). Thus, it covers the whole Ministry and not merely the armed forces.\nFigure 5\nCovers of the offensive and defensive cyber operations documents.\nIn contrast, the offensive doctrine is only relevant to the armed forces.\nUntil the release of this document, the armed forces had focused on defending their own systems—although with an understood element of active defence—while DGSE was in charge of the most sensitive operations, namely, espionage and disruption of adverse systems.\nWhat is new in the offensive doctrine is the integration of cyber activity in conventional military operations. The offensive approach is described as stealthy actions aimed at denying the availability or\nconfidentiality of adverse systems. Implicitly, the doctrine seems to exclude operations with destructive kinetic effects. It mentions the neutralization of enemy systems, but the concept is ambiguous. Offensive operations can prepare or complement conventional operations—acting as a force multiplier—or substitute them entirely where appropriate. The offensive doctrine also includes counterinfluence operations, aimed at protecting conventional action in cyberspace. Such operations are already performed in the conventional domain through the CIAE, or Joint Centre for Environmental Action, the military influence and civil-military cooperation branch of the French armed forces that was created in 2012. This doctrinal shift reflects an increased perception by the armed forces of propaganda and disinformation threats that could hamper its conventional deployments.\nThe new offensive cyber doctrine expands and details the scope of offensive cyber operations. It assumes their preparation and conduct, not only in a clandestine context but also as an integral part of -or substitute for- conventional military operations. As we noted however, it also imposes constraints and rules of engagement on the basis of a strict risk management.\nb) DGSE\nDGSE is the foreign security service and additionally serves as France’s main signals intelligence agency. It sits directly under the Armed Forces Ministry. Until 2014, not much was known publicly by\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nDGSE's activities in the cyber domain. Offensive and espionage operations were deemed to be its responsibilities, but these has been absent from public sight, until forensic analysis and Snowden-leaks published by Le Monde unveiled a diverse panel of advanced malwares (Casper, Bunny, Babar, Dino) attributed to a French intelligence agency. The leaks seem to have broken an internal taboo. A former DGSE executive, Bernard Barbier, shed some light on such operations shortly after, admitting the agency \"started hacking in 1992\".\nc) DGA\nDGA, the Defence Procurement Agency, has long developed a cybersecurity department, which sits into its \"maîtrise de l'information\" branch. It is tasked with protecting the information and weapon systems of the armed forces, providing technical expertise in threat intelligence, upstream research (also known as discovery stage) and crisis support. As part of such responsibilities, it conducts vulnerability research on armed forces' systems and since 2015 organises cyber-wargames.\nThe offensive doctrine indicated DGA will adapt its procurement processes to take into account the tempo of operations and nature of these weapons. Current processes designed to procure vehicles or submarines, or even major software programs, would be ill-suited. This may hint at the creation of an ad hoc procurement process designed from the ground up to research vulnerabilities and develop exploits and payloads.\n3. Competition and opposition of views\nParochial priorities and perceptions of the respective institutions depend mostly on the structuring of the cyber security and defence apparatus, which core principle is offense-defence separation.\na) Opposition of views between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA\nThe opposition of views or the impact of parochial competition appears most clearly between ANSSI and the armed forces, on two different issues: vulnerability disclosure and end-to-end encryption.\nContrary to the U.S. or, more recently, the U.K., France has no public vulnerability equities process (VEP). Currently, disclosure and sharing between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA is not formalised and happens on a case-by-case basis. Guillaume Poupard, ANSSI director, communicated briefly about vulnerability research and disclosure at the agency's end-of-year report. In practice, Poupard said, in case of doubt as to the balance of risk, \"the vulnerability goes to the defence\".

This means ANSSI is not aware of all vulnerabilities discovered. Although there is no obvious conflict of views on that topic, the debate on the right risk balancing illustrates well how each agencies' responsibilities and culture influences their stance in critical debates such as this one.\nWe can witness a more obvious conflict of views on the encryption debate. Poupard, circulated within the government in March 2016 a note arguing strongly against \"exceptional access\" legislation, which would allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bypass encryption, either on device or in transit. The Parliament of Australia recently passed such a law, not without public outcry. In his note, Poupard states:\n“To impose a wide weakening of cryptographic means would affect both digital safety and the freedom of the large majority of law-abiding users, while remaining ineffective against the intended minority target.”\nIt appears that, at the time, DGSE was voicing its concerns against encryption. In 2018, the head of its technical services, Patrick Pailloux, promoted publicly the idea of in-transit exceptional access, while reaffirming the importance of strong (but not end-to-end by definition) encryption. It is thus likely that Poupard’s note was a direct rebuke to DGSE’s pressures. In such case, it may be a good example of two principles edited by Allison and Zelkow. First, that where you stand depends on where you sit. Less colloquially known as “the face of the issue differs from seat to seat”, it explains that, as the head of a defensive agency open to the wider public and private sector, it is expected that its director will oppose the weakening of end-to-end encryption. On the opposite, it is expected that DGSE will seek to extend its interception capabilities, as a signals intelligence agency dedicated to foreign security. Second, this “row” may also be the result of the “51-49 principle”. Even if one isn’t completely convinced by the side of the argument, they must “argue much more confidently than they would if they were detached judges” because of parochial competition.\nb) The role of Foreign Affairs and its relationship with other actors.\nThe International Digital Strategy (December 2017) was released only a few months before the Cyber Defence Review (February 2018). Presented as “France’s international strategy”, it could be potentially interpreted as a willingness of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to defend its prerogative in that area. In May 2017, Jean-Yves Le Drian had become Foreign Affairs Minister after almost five years at the Defence Ministry. Although it may have been perceived as such by some in the Armed Forces Ministry, the international strategy was actually two-years in the making, a long process due in part to its submission to public review. As for the Paris Call, the initiative came from the Cybersecurity and Strategic Affairs division, which then pushed it through to the Minister, who ensured political\nMacron dans les locaux de la DGA-MI à Bruz :pic.twitter.com/elKwQM0k9w,” #WarGames on Twitter (blog), April 15, 2019, https://twitter.com/amaelle_g/status/1117803882032304128.\n Guiton.\n Guiton.\n Catherine Chapman, “Australian Cybersecurity Industry Reels over Anti-Encryption Law,” The Daily Swig | Web security digest, January 25, 2019, https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/australian-cybersecurity-industry-reels-over-anti-encryption-law.\n A ComCyber official, April 18, 2019.\n Valéry Marchive, “Le renseignement aime le chiffrement, mais il veut bien des points de clair,” LeMagIT, July 4, 2018, https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252444227/Le-renseignement-aimé-le-chiffrement-mais-il-veut-bien-des-points-de-clair.\n Allison and Zelikow, Essence of Decision.

It is a very tentative chapter, because of time and interview constraints. To complete the analysis, more interviews should be conducted at higher political levels.\n## 1) Key individuals in decision and action, and factors influencing their perceptions, preferences and stands\nDuring its annual press conference, ANSSI director stated, on the topic of vulnerabilities disclosure, that in a structure that separates offence and defence, \"the level of where both meet [in the policy-making tree] is very high. It means that sometimes, we must mobilise the highest authorities on these issues\".\nBastien Irondelle, in its seminal work on the decision-making process behind the end of French military conscription in 1996, highlighted the everlasting importance of the President. He detailed how the political impetus Jacques Chirac gave to this major policy decision, in particular during the Defence Councils, made the reform happen. We have demonstrated so far that in the case at hand, French cyber security and defence, the evolution has been gradual, taking place over a decade. However, the same key individuals and processes remain.\nIn practice, the range of meaningful decision-making in cyber security and defence starts at ministerial cabinets, up to the Prime Minister and the President. Major crisis and policy decisions are taken at the presidential level, during Defence Councils. ANSSI is represented by the SGDSN, ComCyber by the Joint Chief of Staff, who remains responsible for the military action chain.\nThe Cyber Club identified by Desforges still exists today and brings together the directors of ANSSI, DGA, ComCyber and the technical departments of both domestic and foreign intelligence agencies (DGSI, DGSE).\nAnother noteworthy trend is the overwhelming majority of military profiles among ANSSI executives. Out of the seven directors and deputy-directors, five have spent most of their careers in the armed forces. Such numbers however hide some atypical career paths: the deputy director is a military engineer with a doctorate in public law and an MBA.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n Guiton, \"[Thread] [Team #Wargames] Comment est gérée la question des vulnérabilités dites 'zero-day' en France, où on sépare les missions d'attaque et de défense ?

Because of the number of involved actors and their overlap in each mission, the Strategy established four “operational chains” to centralize and streamline public action in the field. They are referred to as the protection, intelligence, judicial investigations and military-action chains. While it is still unclear how these chains work in practice, we were able to collect more information on the committees and groups that coordinate cyber security and defence policy, in theory and in practice.\n### a) Recently formalised processes\nThe Cyber Strategy created two new committees: An Executive Committee, under the President’s Office, and a Steering Committee, under the SGDSN. Political decisions and policy orientations related to cyberdefence are taken during meetings of the National Security and Defence Council. The Executive Committee is tasked with high-level implementation of the Council’s decisions.\nThe Steering Committee’s responsibility is to report on the Strategy’s implementation to the Prime Minister and to prepare the meetings of the Executive Committee[132]. It meets every semester. SGDSN transmits the impetus of political leadership, sets the agenda and ensures the application of the previously decided measures[133]. Ministries and agencies are free to bring forward suggestions[134].\nAdditionally, a Cyber Crisis Coordination Centre “supervises cyberdefence”[135] and informs decision-makers. The Centre consists of different groups that act at various timelines, even though their names suggest a short-term crisis perimeter. While the Technical Group acts on short-term incidents, Strategy is a “sub-political”[136] group that acts on mid-term strategy to prepare steering committee meetings. It is open to other ministries,[137] of which most individuals present are administration directors (directeurs d’administration centrale)[138]. They offer regular situation reports to the Prime Minister and the President, and suggests policy options. They meet monthly[139]. The Technico-Operational Group (TechOps), on the other hand, is a restricted group with few institutions represented. Its main purpose is to share specific threat intelligence, and it thus open to only a handful of intelligence agencies[140].\n### b) Importance of informal coordination processes\nTechOps is only very briefly described in official documents[141]. However it reminds of the “Cyber Club” Alix Desforges described in her thesis[142]. This informal grouping of agency heads took another dimension with the writing process of the Cyber Strategy. According to an official[143], the writing\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nprocess itself greatly enhanced communication between relevant stakeholders. In other words, the process of creating processes, enhanced communication and coordination between actors. At its creation, TechOps the people and institutions involved warmly welcomed it, and it quickly became indispensable$^{144}$. Some degree of informality remains today. In addition to what we have already described, informal ad-hoc meetings keep happening to deal with specific issues.\n***\nWhen it comes to formal processes, the highest political authorities remain in charge of major policy-decisions. Informal meetings have lead to the formalisation of intelligence sharing and mid to low level policy coordination.\n*\n*\n# Conclusion\nFrom its sovereign principles to the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence institutions, France revendicates an atypical model. At the top, strategic autonomy infuses major political, financial and policy decisions. Domestically, although officials strongly reaffirm the separation of offence and defence activities, in practice such separation can be described as institutional at best, due to the fluidity of human resources between agencies. This separation has nonetheless a genuine impact on policy-making and public debates: differences in parochial priorities and organisational cultures between ANSSI and the armed forces create conflicting views on tough topics such as end-to-end encryption or vulnerability disclosure. Finally, while the executive remains key in decision-making, informal processes and meta-processes have been instrumental in the development of an efficient state cyber security and defence community. To complete and build-up on this exploratory paper, further research on how such processes work out in practice could be conducted.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# GLOSSARY (non-exhaustive)\n\nANSSI National Information Systems Security Agency.\nCALID Centre for Defensive Cyber Operations.\nCASSI Centre for Information Systems Auditing.\nCIAE Joint Centre for Environmental Action.\nComCyber Cyber Defence Command.\nDGA Directorate General for Armament.\nDGSE Directorate General for External Security.\nIoC Indicator of Compromise.\nLPM Pluriannual Military Finance Law\nSGDSN General Secretariat for Defence and National Security.\nSOC Security Operations Centre.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# CHRONOLOGY (non-exhaustive)\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# INTERVIEWS\nA ComCyber official.

France is no exception. We have seen in recent months a revival of its efforts to secure its citizens and interests in cyber space. French President Emmanuel Macron presented in late 2018 the \"Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace\", a package of norms of good behaviour bringing together states, private corporations and the civil society. All the while, in the past two years, the government designed its very first Cyber Defence Strategy and the Armed Forces unveiled some elements of their offensive and defensive cyber operations. How can we make sense of it all?\nWe frame the current picture by following Allison and Zelikow's three conceptual models of decision-making: Rational actor, organisational behaviour, and government politics. In accordance with each model, we seek to answer the following questions, respectively:\nR1: What are the underlying principles, goals and objectives of French national defence and security, in general terms and in the cyber domain?\nR2: What are the institutions involved in cyber security and defence, their perimeters of action and organisational culture?\nR3: What are the processes and individuals involved in cyber security and defence policy-making at the politico-strategic level?\nTo do so we combine an extensive review of the literature with a series of interviews with senior French officials from ministries, as well as national agencies and other specialised institutions.\n# Objectives and limitations\nThe objective of this paper is three-fold: describing, explaining and, by extension, predicting. First, we hope to provide a better understanding of the current French cyber security and defence policy picture its founding political and doctrinal principles. Second, by applying Allison and Zelikow's models to this picture, we seek to explain how policy-making in this area happens in practice. This approach diverges slightly from the models' original purpose, which is to analyse a specific case-study and its cluster of decisions (\"Why did the Soviets smuggle nuclear missiles into Cuba?\" \"Why did the US respond by imposing a naval blockade?\"). This paper does not ambition to explain why France launched the Paris Call or why it published parts of the armed forces' offensive cyber operations doctrine. Scholars and journalists have already started answering them. Rather, it seeks to provide a toolkit so that scholars, practitioners or journalists can design more accurate hypotheses about why future decision X or Y was taken in that domain. There is no doubt this toolkit will be incomplete and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nimperfect. Not all policy documents are public, some processes and institutions are still recent, and we lack the ability to stand back so that we can grasp how some processes work-out in practice. Another obstacle is that these principles, policies, doctrines, processes and institutions live through the minds and acts of leaders, policy-makers and practitioners, whom the author has not been able to all interview. In particular, the author was unable to meet officials from SGDSN itself, the Élysée Palace and Prime Minister's Office. This is where the work of Bastien Irondelle becomes key. The third -indirect- objective of this paper, is prediction. As Allison and Zelikow highlight, it is “the logical flipside of explanations”. If we understand more accurately the processes and factors that lead to decisions, we can extrapolate about future events. The predictive power of the model will however be highly dependent on the strength of its explanatory qualities.\n## Acknowledgement and appreciation\nThe author is grateful to IRSEM for hosting him and the warm welcome.

This is the rational actor model. In our case, France is the identified state. More often than not, political cycles lead to new policies and strategies. When relevant, the state thus becomes personified, in relation to a specific presidency. In this model we adopt a bounded rationality viewpoint, whereas we accept that “values, beliefs and stereotypes” play a role in the actors’ rationality.\n## 1. Political concepts, principles and goals\nIn this first part we analyse France’s core political concepts of sovereignty and strategic autonomy, the rationale behind the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence apparatus, and the one behind its communication and attribution stance.\n### a. France’s sovereignty, national and European strategic autonomy\nFrance has a conceptualisation of sovereignty that makes it stand out of its peers. Baezner and Robin found in their comparative analysis that “France was unique among the states examined in that it used the word “sovereignty” more frequently and in different contexts”. Sovereignty, in its French understanding, cannot be restrained to hard sovereignty, i.e. the protection of its citizens, borders and other existential interests. French sovereignty is a wide spectrum that implies strategic autonomy. The 2017 Strategic Review defines strategic autonomy as a two pillar concept entailing 1) a high level of industrial and technological autonomy, and 2) an operational autonomy. On technological autonomy, the Ministry of the Armed Forces has recently ramped up its strategy, with the creation of a dedicated investment fund, DefInvest. Its first investments were made in microprocessors and high precision optics manufacturers. Operational autonomy means the ability to reach an informed decision and to take action, in particular in the context of political or military crises. The French military operation in Mali, for instance, is a good illustration of operational autonomy: the ability to engage in full scope – low to high intensity– operations, with allies or on its own if necessary.\nFrench strategic autonomy can be best described as neo-Gaullist. It is characterised by a strong sense of national independence but recognises the need for a powerful political Europe. Its historical drivers and roots come indeed from a traditional Gaullist doctrine of national autonomy, which is more self-reliant. The perceived need for self-reliance played a major role in driving De Gaulle to transform France into a nuclear power and to leave NATO integrated command in 1966. Some key historical events such as the 1940 surrender, the intelligence frustrations of the 1992 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq war further fuelled perceptions that France needed both a credible nuclear arsenal, and autonomous intelligence capabilities.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n---\n Allison and Zelikow.

Claude Faure, “Bref historique des services de renseignement et de sécurité français contemporains,” *Revue historique des armées*, no. 247 (June 15, 2007): 70–81.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThis spirit of autonomy remains today, but with a wider pragmatic recognition of the need for cooperation and integration. France re-joined NATO command in 2009 for mainly pragmatism and influence reasons. However the French nuclear arsenal remains outside of NATO command and its intelligence apparatus outside of the 5-Eyes community. France' strategic autonomy is also reliant on a European strategic autonomy, which it seeks to develop. The Hubert Védrine report recommended that the country's return into NATO command is accompanied by a strengthening of European defence integration and cooperation, especially in the R&amp;D of technological and industrial capacities. It encourages the development of mutual interdependence with entities who share critical interests, particularly within the EU. This policy shift initiated in 1992 with the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy was confirmed in the 2008 White Paper, placing the EU as \"a central tenet of [France's] security policy\". This central place was reaffirmed ever since, including in the last cyber strategy document.\nb) Domestic apparatus: Offense / defence separation\nDomestically, the French approach contrasts with that embraced by the United States or the United Kingdom. Most notably, France assumes a clear separation between offensive and defensive cyber operations. This means that, contrary to the U.S.' National Security Agency (NSA) or the U.K.'s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), France's leading agency for cybersecurity is exclusively dedicated to defensive operations and not part of the intelligence community. This is a defining element of the Cyber Strategy Review and infuses the whole structure of French cyberdefence. The rationale is that having a distinct defensive agency separate from offense-oriented military intelligence agencies \"facilitates the acceptance of state intervention [...] whether in public administration or the economic sphere\".\nc) A counter-threat model based on direct communication rather than public attribution\nPeculiarities of the French model are not limited to its conceptualisation of sovereignty. On the diplomatic stage, France has also adopted a different stance than most of its counterparts. A number of NATO allies are increasingly inclined to \"name and shame\" states involved in cyber attacks. One telling example can be found in October 2018, when the U.S., U.K., Canada and the Netherlands denounced Russian attempts at disrupting the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Paris expressed its solidarity but fell short of blaming Moscow. Already in 2015, when what then seemed to be ISIS took down TV5Monde in a major hack, no official attribution was made. ANSSI, the national cybersecurity agency, however briefed four dozen media outlets with details of its forensic investigation and indicators of compromise. These details were then analysed by private security firms which pointed the finger at persistent threat actor (APT) . Additionally, TV5Monde director Yves Bigot reported in L'Express\n\"France favours red phones over the megaphone.\"\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nthat ANSSI personnel suggested it was a false-flag (\"un leurre\"). More recently, in the case of the #MacronLeaks, France did not issue any kind of attribution either. G. Poupard, head of ANSSI, refused to do so arguing \"the attack was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone\". More recently, the Secretary General for Defence and National Security clarified France's official policy: attribution can only be performed on the basis of elements collected or verified by French services, typically ANSSI and DGSE.\nThis does not mean that it does not have attribution capabilities. As we will see in Chapter II, attributing cyber-attacks is one of the main missions of the French cyberdefence apparatus. But even when it knows, France prefers forthright bilateral dialogues with Russia and other cyber powers such as the U.S., China, India, Brazil and Japan. It appears it even opened a deconfliction cell with the Russian Security Council on cyber matters. Only in last resort will France take part in public name and shame. In other words, it favours red phones over the megaphone.\nThere is only one recorded instance of public attribution, and it is indirect. At the unveiling of the offensive cyber doctrine, Minister Parly revealed that an APT targeted email accounts of high-ranking officials between 2017 and 2018, with the objective of uncovering the navy's oil supply chain. Though the Minister stopped short of explicitly recognizing the group's affiliation with the Russian Federation, she indirectly attributed the attacker's mode of operation to a specific group known as Turla.\nUnder Egloff's definition, France engages in two attribution processes. First a process of sense-making attribution, for the benefit of its own factual understanding, that it rarely communicates publicly. Second, in a meaning-making process, with regards to its adversaries. But again, it does so rather privately than publicly. Overall, French strategy with attribution seem to fit a counter-threat model.\nIn this first part, we have detailed how France conceives its sovereignty and what it means by strategic autonomy. We have also sought to explain its rationale behind the offence / defence separation and to describe its policy of non-public attribution.\n## 2. The evolution and granularization of objectives of French cyber security and defence\nIn this second part we review the cyber security and defence objectives produced by political and military authorities, from 2011 to 2019. We identify three main themes: active discouragement, risk limitation and direct communication.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe Defence and National Security White Paper 2008 is the first of its kind to mention Internet-related threats and leads to the creation of ANSSI. The Agency releases in 2011 the “National Strategy for the Defence and Security of Information Systems”. It’s four goals are:\n- For France to become a top-tier cyber power,\n- To guarantee freedom of decision through confidentiality of state secrets,\n- To reinforce the security of critical infrastructures,\n- To ensure cybersecurity to public and private actors alike.\nThe second version of the Strategy revolved around 1) state secrets and critical infrastructures, 2) digital privacy and cybercrime, 3) public sensitisation and training, 4) business and export strategies, and 5) Europe, digital sovereignty and norms.\nFollowing the election of Emmanuel Macron to the Presidency, the President requests officially tasks the Armed Forces Ministry to create a panel of experts with a view to write a new defence white paper. The Strategic Review for Defence and National Security, as it is then known, is released in 2017. It promotes digital sovereignty and cybersecurity to top priorities of national defence.\nIn February 2018, the country’s first National Strategy for Cyber Defence clarified both the organization and integration of cyber operations among all government entities as well as the national and international legal framework surrounding their use. It sets-out goals and processes as part of a “robust national cyber security and defence apparatus”.\nThe seven principles underpinning the Strategy are:\n1. To make the security of French information and communication systems a priority,\n2. To embrace a policy of active discouragement and coordinated response,\n3. To fully exercise its digital sovereignty,\n4. To bring an efficient judicial response to cybercriminality,\n5. To promote a shared cybersecurity culture,\n6. To contribute to a trusted and safe digital Europe,\n7. To act internationally for a collective governance of cyberspace.\nTo achieve said goals, the Strategy sets-out a number of policy-making and coordination processes (see Chapter III). In practice, three main themes appear: Active discouragement, risk limitation and multilateralism.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n Services du Premier Ministre, “Stratégie Nationale Pour La Sécurité Du Numérique” (Paris, October 16, 2015), https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/la-strategie-nationale-pour-la-securite-du-numerique-une-reponse-aux-nouveaux-enjeux-des-usages-numeriques/.\n “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n Francois Delerue and Aude Gery, “France’s Cyberdefense Strategic Review and International Law,” Lawfare, March 23, 2018, https://www.lawfareblog.com/frances-cyberdefense-strategic-review-and-international-law.\n In French as « Dispositif national de protection et de défense informatique robuste ». “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n France reserves its concept of deterrence (dissuasion) to the nuclear domain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Active discouragement\nFrance has adopted a posture of active discouragement against advanced threats. It relies on direct communication with the adversary, as we have detailed earlier, and on an increasingly explicit declaratory strategy.\nIn January 2019 Minister Florence Parly unveiled the offensive and defensive cyber operations doctrines of the armed forces. The announcement is the latest and strongest step taken by the country as part of its declaratory strategy. In response to cyber and other threats, France is “not afraid” of using cyber weapons. The country did not wait until then to perform offensive operations or even to publicly admit doing so. Such operations were first mentioned in the 2008 White Paper and then again with more details in 2013. The case for proportional reprisals in response to a major attack was also made clearly by then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian:\n“In times of war, cyber weapons may be the response, or part of our response, to an armed attack [aggression armée], being of a cyber nature or otherwise”.\nb) Risk limitation and infrastructure sanctuarisation\nRisks that are inherent to cyberspace and operations are a recurrent topic in policy documents.\nThe offensive doctrine places great emphasis on the consideration and mitigation of political, legal and military risks. It mandates a risk balancing exercise in the preparation and conduct of offensive operations: against the risk of escalation in an asymmetric environment, or against the risk of collateral or indirect damage on civilian infrastructures. This balancing exercise – and the need not to reveal too much details – may be the reason the doctrine does not clearly mention physical destruction of information systems.\nInternationally, France aims to promote existing institutional mechanisms to “limit hacking and destabilising activities” in cyberspace, notably through an international initiative, the “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace”, unveiled in November 2018.\nIn terms of international law, the document encourages more extensive and better coordinated regulation of cyberspace in the spirit of founding principles of the U.N. Charter, notably the maintenance of international peace and security. It recognizes not only the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyberspace, but of international human rights and customary international law more broadly as well. It also advocates for the development of new ways to prevent intellectual property theft, i.e. industrial espionage.\nAnother key theme of the document is the importance of protecting individuals and critical infrastructures from harm. The document presses to safeguard the “public core of the Internet” from hostile actors. This is a clear demonstration of support for a package of norms unveiled by the Global\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nCommission for the Stability of Cyberspace on Nov. 8 in Singapore. Reflecting the view of most states on the matter, the Call promotes the exclusive role of sovereign states in hostile acts in cyberspace. It condemns corporate hack-back and other offensive operations from non-state actors. It also appeals for measures preventing interference with elections, another contemporary hot topic.\nClearly absent in the text are issues of espionage and state-lead low-intensity offensive operations. The need to compromise and willingness to gather support across states with various political mindsets means offensive cyber operations was probably out of scope of the Call from its inception.\nc) Multilateralism and stakeholderism\nOn the international stage, one of France's goals relates to the diplomatic process itself. The country seeks to maintain a form of inclusive multilateralism, and in parallel to open-up debates on cyberspace governance to non-state actors.\nIts International Digital Strategy puts great emphasis into promoting an \"open, diverse and trusted\" cyberspace in which it envisions the European Union as a key player. The Strategy itself was subject to public consultations.\nThe Paris Call comes in the wake of the strategy. In addition to its normative nature we detailed earlier, to engage industries and civil society, the document also promotes everyday good practices (\"cyber hygiene\") and the implementation of \"security by design\" in products and services. It is not the first initiative of its kind. In April 2018, Microsoft launched its \"Digital Peace\" campaign along with a \"Cybersecurity Tech Accord\" aimed at getting the internet and the technology industry to better protect their customers' privacy and security against cyberattacks. Similarly, Siemens unveiled in May 2018 a \"Charter of Trust\" that seeks to develop adherence to security principles and processes, with the aim of developing a \"global standard\" for cybersecurity.\nUntil those recent developments, norm-building initiatives were the prerogative of states. In 2015, the U.N.'s Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recognized that international humanitarian law applied to cyberspace, though it then deadlocked when at the end of 2017. Although a new process was put in place for 2019 up to 2021, the two blocs—one group led by the United States and another by China and Russia—are unlikely to solve the stalemate.\nApproaching the issue from various stakeholders' perspectives, the Paris Call is an attempt to move away from this international deadlock. Macron, at its unveiling at UNESCO, made the case for rebuffing what he described as a binary choice between \"a Californian Internet and a Chinese\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nInternet\"54. So far, he argued, these two opposite narratives have monopolized the debate and imposed two radically different yet unsatisfactory alternatives: either a model of mere technical governance led by Silicon Valley, or an overwhelming regulation led by authoritarian regimes. While the former does not address issues of privacy and malicious actors, the latter cracks down on human rights and could lead to a \"balkanisation\" of internet and of wider cyberspace55.\nAccording to Le Monde, Microsoft first approached the French government to obtain its support for the Tech Accord56. However, the country found the Accord too narrow and industry-oriented. Recognizing a trend of norms fragmentation coupled with diplomatic deadlocks, France saw an opportunity to take the lead on governance. But this was only possible if the call achieved two things: First, it needed to widen the scope of existing sector-specific initiatives (Tech Accord, GGE, For The Web) into meaningful norms all actors could get behind. Second, it needed to gather and federate existing initiatives, otherwise it would just contribute to the further fragmentation of norms. So far the call seems to have mostly succeeded, with a notable caveat among state signatories.\nAmong the 64 state signatories, European countries are the most heavily present. However, almost every continent is represented: among them we find Qatar, South Korea, Mexico, Japan, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Senegal and New-Zealand. Critically, on release day, key potential signatories such as India or Brazil are not on the list. The absence of such countries may become problematic. While the U.S. (at least for now), China and Russia are unlikely to join, the Call will rely on support from States like India and Brazil in order to gain traction within international institutions, primarily the United Nations. Macron, aware of this challenge, suggested that the Internet Governance Forum—a U.N. event—become responsible for monitoring the effective implementation of the call and be moved under the direct supervision of the U.N. Secretary General57.\nThe document has already drawn support from influential non-governmental groups. The World Leadership Alliance, Chatham House, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Internet Society have committed to its principles. Technical governance bodies, such as the Number Resource Organization and the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre—the region's internet registry—expressed interest too. Powerful business lobbies are another prominent group of signatories, including notably, Indian business guilds such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Internet and Mobile Association of India and the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum. In total, as many as 300 universities, NGOs and professional associations have committed to the call.\nIn the industrial landscape, France succeeded in attracting both major initiatives: The Tech Accord and the Charter of Trust represent a significant share of the private-sector signatories, as together they represent 85 powerful corporations such as Airbus, Cisco and Facebook. But the call is not a mere shell for existing groups. Notable newcomers include Google, Samsung Electronics, Intel Corporation, Kaspersky Lab, Thales and many other companies, ranging from the banking and insurance industries, to law, commerce and defence.\nInitiatives to create norms in cyberspace are multiplying. But more than anything else, these initiatives seem to have fragmented political will and have so far failed to gather support across the board. Emmanuel Macron hopes the Paris Call will bring fresh momentum to the issue by mounting support from influential parties, notably Silicon Valley's top companies and emerging powers. The Call is\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nrestrained in scope, avoiding the most sensitive activities such as espionage and offensive operations, but this restraint makes it more likely to receive support across a wider group of stakeholders. It is far from a silver bullet; rather it offers a fresh starting point and framework for further negotiations on values and norms of behaviour in cyberspace.\nFigure 1 - The pyramid of means (centre) and their respective objectives (right).\nOverall, the objectives of French cyber security and defence are three-fold: Actively discourage adversaries through a declaratory strategy that includes offensive operations, limit the escalation potential of crises by sanctuarising core infrastructures, and promote a third way model to cyberspace governance.\n## 2. Threat perception\nA state's perception of threats is based on a variety of factors: strategic goals, history and precedent, one's perception of its own weaknesses and dependencies$^{58}$. It is a key concept within rational models such as the one Allison and Zelikow describe. While France approached cybersecurity issues from a dominantly technical perspective at its beginnings, Desforges argues, it shifted towards a model that goes beyond security and defence issues$^{59}$. The Snowden leaks, the rise of jihadist propaganda and the increasingly geopolitical impact of major attacks pushed France to consider broader societal challenges and actors in defining its strategies and policies.\n$^{58}$ Raymond Cohen, “Threat Perception in International Crisis,” *Political Science Quarterly* 93, no. 1 (1978): 93, https://doi.org/10/d95kwg.\n$^{59}$ Alix Desforges, “Approche Géopolitique Du Cyberespace, Enjeux Pour La Défense et La Sécurité Nationale, l’exemple de La France” (Université Paris 8 - Vincennes / Saint-Denis, 2018).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Threat realisation centred around technology and intelligence (2008-2013)\nThe 2008 White Paper$^{(a)}$ mentions Internet in its first chapter, but first as an example of a positive trend, highlighting the rise in connectedness of people around the world. The other side of the coin, it later states, is the challenge of keeping up with the high-paced spread of information and ideas, in other words information control and propaganda. The Paper also dedicates a full-page box to serious cyberattacks detailing the full CIA spectrum. While it does not mention the attacks on Estonia, the Paper foresees such attacks will be multiplying in the following 15 years and considers the risk of a large-scale attack on its critical infrastructures a major threat. It mentions \"cyberwar\" as one of the scenarios which could involve the Atlantic Alliance. In consequence, the Paper mandates 1) a switch from a passive to active defence model, 2) the development of offensive cyber capabilities, strategy and doctrine all focusing on adversarial military systems.\nIt is the very first time France acknowledges cyber threats and decides to act on them in a national public policy document. The Paper also creates a new strategic role for the armed forces known as \"knowledge and anticipation\".\nFigure 2\nStrategic and prospective policy documents in context (yellow, red and green). They are part of complex financial and procurement cycles and reflect well French threat perceptions.\nSources: DGA, CICDE, NATO, EDA. Graph design and editing: by the author. TRL: Technology Readiness Level.\nFive years after the wake-up call of the 2008 White Paper, its successor recognises that the fast-paced evolution of threats and capabilities require to go one \"step further\" in cyberdefence$^{(c)}$. It ambitions to dedicate more human and financial resources to intelligence and operational capabilities, mandates the creation of a cyber reserve force and calls for a broad societal effort from international cooperation to training and public awareness.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nb) Broadening to societal challenges and capabilities build-up (2013-2015)\nThe 2013 White Paper mandated the creation of a national doctrine for major cyber threats response: a coordinated defensive posture mixed with a graduated response from diplomatic, judicial and law enforcement powers to military means when vital interests are at stake. The strategic mission “knowledge and anticipation”, created in 2008, now includes information control in its widest sense (maîtrise de l’information), from trends in cryptography to intelligence gathering and critical infrastructure security. A joint doctrine puts in place a strategic anticipation group which is tasked with mid-term (one to two years) prospective on operational preparedness, military intelligence and international relations[62]. Most critically, the Paper contains France’s official recognition of cyberspace as an operational domain by stating that “cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own”. This is two years after the United States[63] and three years before NATO[64].\n## “Cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own.”\nThe ensuing pluriannual defence finance law (LPM, 2014-2019) set-out an operational cyberdefence chain integrated to conventional military operations. It reiterated the need for both defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, granting overall 1 billion EUR to cyberdefence.\nIn 2015, the Digital Security Strategy stated that a serious threat (“atteinte significative”) to French citizens data could constitute a national security matter, notably in the context of espionage, propaganda or political destabilisation[65]. The complete shutdown of news channel TV5 Monde that year represented a moment of reckoning for the country’s security agencies, while the leaking of documents stolen from the Macron campaign on the eve of the 2017 election sounded alarm bells at the possibility of foreign meddling in domestic politics, echoing the Clinton campaign.\nc) Institutional and doctrinal military structuring (2017-2019)\nThe 2017 Review emphasises the increasing role of Internet and digital giants (GAFAM, Baidu) on geopolitics and sovereignty, as well as on “strategic intimidation” facilitated by the combination of economic, military and informational pressures such as territorial fait-accompli and mass social network trolling. It also mentions the risk of escalation in cyber and space conflicts, not the least because of first strike temptations. Currently, ANSSI states “destabilisation, espionage and sabotage” as the primary threats it faces[66].\nThe Cyberdefence Review dedicates a significant part (32 pages) to the evolution of the threat landscape. It relies on the “new normal” scenario to highlight the risks brought by quantum\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\ncomputers, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. It concludes that their level of security will be determining factors for societal safety.\nThe next LPM (2019-2025) reflects this evolution of French threat perception and the impetus granted to the “knowledge and anticipation” mission of the armed forces. The defence budget for 2019 amounts to 35,9 billion EUR, or 1.82% of GDP, pensions excluded. It is planned to increase over the next four years, reaching 44 billion EUR and 2% of GDP in 2023. In 2019, intelligence and cyberdefence constitute already 73% of the Ministry’s hiring effort (+450 personnel in total). By 2025, the armed forces are expected to count on 4000 so-called cyber-combatants, which represent an increase of 25% over six years. Cyberdefence will receive over this period a budget of 1.6 billion Euros, excluding payroll.\n***\nOver the past decade, France went through three main major evolution stages in its cyber security and defence structuring: threat realisation (2008-2011), capabilities build-up (2013-2015) and an institutional and doctrinal military structuring accompanied by a strong diplomatic impetus (2017-2019). The recently released offensive doctrine is the culmination of this deep transformation. It particularly represents a turning point for the armed forces, breaking offensive operations from their intelligence silo. The wording of the document and of the accompanying speech by Minister Parly also represents a less veiled signal to Russia, a message France had previously been reluctant to send publicly. The Paris Call, in parallel, is an unprecedented attempt at bringing states, major corporations and the civil society together around key values and principles.\n&gt; “France aims to promote international rules and stability [...] to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks [...] to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion.”\nOverall, France aims to promote international rules and stability in the cyber domain to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks room to manoeuvre to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion. Such balance is and will remain delicate, which only reinforces the need for a better understanding of actors’ rationales and policy coordination.\n# Chapter II – Relevant organisations, their goals and capabilities\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.” P.31.\n Ministère des Armées, “Communiqué - Budget 2019 : LPM année 1,” September 25, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/communaute-defense/communique-du-ministere-des-armees_-budget-2019-lpm-annee-1.\n Ministère des Armées.\n Ministère des Armées.\n Ministère des Armées, “Guide Explicitatif: Les Réserves Cyber,” November 15, 2016, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/491674/7859279/file/20161115_EMACYBER_Guide_explicitatif.pdf.\n Ministère des Armées, “Projet de Loi Relatif à La Programmation Militaire Pour Les Années 2019 à 2025 et Portant Diverses Dispositions Intéressant La Défense,” February 6, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/523150/8769279/file/LPM%202019-2025%20-%20Rapport%20annexe.pdf.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFollowing the organisational behaviour model of Allison and Zelikow, we now turn to the main institutional players in cyber security and defence. As we will see, the offence / defence separation principle impact deeply the institutions goals, capabilities and culture.\n1. ANSSI\na) Status, history and relationship with SGDSN\nIn response to the 2008 White Paper, the National Cyber Security Agency, abbreviated in French as ANSSI, was established a year later under the Prime Minister's General Secretary for Defence and National Security (SGDSN). It is a service that exercises national authority on the security of information systems.\nWhile SGDSN is in charge of security issues at large, ANSSI deals with digital affairs widely. It has a specific focus on cybersecurity, but in its widest sense: ANSSI supports the private sector, helps draft France foreign policy on digital issues and works on societal resilience. For instance, its Cyber Anticipation Cell is currently tasked with securing the Paris Olympics 2024. Acting as a strategy, policy and plans cell (J5, in military jargon), its main responsibilities is to advise decision-makers. This difference of scope between ANSSI and SGDSN explains why the Agency reports to the Secretary-General directly (the person), and not the Secretariat-General (as in, the institution).\nWhy is not ANSSI directly attached to the Prime Minister then? Because belonging to SGDSN provides the Agency with institutional protection against potentially hindering senior civil servants in higher spheres of the government. Indeed, SGDSN reports to the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General is a permanent member of the presidential Defence Councils.\nIts predecessor, the Central Directory for Information Systems Security (DCSSI) was created in 2001 also under the SGDSN, and was itself the successor to the Central Service for Information Systems Security, which existed since 1986. Despite its new name and national authority status, ANSSI has thus deep historical roots.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n “Décret N° 2009-834 Du 7 Juillet 2009 Portant Création d’un Service à Compétence Nationale Dénommé « Agence Nationale de La Sécurité Des Systèmes d’information »,” 2009-834 § (2009).\n Emmanuel Germain, ANSSI Deputy Director, Paris, June 27, 2019.\n Germain.\n Germain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFigure 3 - The missions and actors of French cyberdefence (Desforges 2018).\nb) Responsibilities\nANSSI has responsibility for coordination of the state's cyber security, hosts the national Computer Emergency Response Team and acts as a regulatory body for the public and private sector alike, primarily for critical infrastructure operators. It plays an unequal role in all six missions of French cyber defence as described in the 2018 Cyber Defence Strategy: cyber threat prevention, anticipation, protection, detection, attribution and reaction. The latter entails technical remediation as well as legal and military action. Alix Desforges78 clarified some of the responsibility sharing that the Cyber Defence Strategy sets-out. While prevention is a cross-government and multistakeholder assignment (ministries, local security representatives, chambers of commerce), anticipation is in essence a threat intelligence task fulfilled by ANSSI and intelligence agencies. Protection (defensive cyber operations and measures) and detection remain the responsibility of ANSSI and its subsidiaries, especially when it comes to private critical infrastructure operators. Attribution of attacks is a joint ANSSI and intelligence services task, while reaction (remediation) is another mission that benefits from subsidiarity.\nThe recognition of cyberspace as a domain of conflict in the 2013 White Paper comes with a new finance law. The 2014-2019 LPM contained two key measures to widen the capabilities of ANSSI. First, it created heavy regulatory obligations on critical infrastructure operators, public and private alike, in terms of their network and industrial control system security, threat detection capabilities and penetration testing, which ANSSI can now perform79. In light of such new powers, it also granted ANSSI with derogations80 with regards to the French Computer Misuse Act81. According to its Deputy Director, ANSSI deals with around 20 attacks from APTs every year82; and these are only those that are detected.\nc) People, identity and organisational culture\nANSSI brings together experts, practitioners and strategists in seven different laboratories and departments. Its two most prominent organisational traits are its exclusive defensive purpose, and its start-up spirit.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFirst, as we described earlier, ANSSI's identity relies mostly on its exclusive defensive purpose. This is the foundation of the French model. Its Director Guillaume Poupard regularly insists on this feature, which seems to infuse very deeply into its operations. Tools that could be dual-use (i.e. for both defensive and offensive purposes) are separately developed at both DGSE (for offense) and ANSSI (for defence), even if it duplicates the effort[83]. However, because of the high pressure on its human resources, DGSE and ANSSI are pooling and sharing their people and increasingly\n# Of a defensive culture by nature and legal status, [ANSSI] is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need.\nsharing intelligence[84]. The separation between offense and defence is thus institutional and not absolute. Second, the Agency enjoys describing itself as a start-up, at least in its spirit[85]. This tag however hides large disparities in its workforce: 80% are temporary staff, with a mean age of 30 years old[86]. The remaining 20% are the managers, mostly military or civilian engineers[87]. Overall, the mean age is of 34 years[88].\nOf a defensive culture by nature and legal status, it is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need. Although its nature and role is less ambiguous than its Anglo-Saxon peers (GCHQ, NSA) its responsibilities make its activities deeply intertwined with those of intelligence agencies, primarily DGSE.\n## 2. Armed Forces and the intelligence community\nThe armed forces play a role in all six cyber security and defence missions we highlighted just below. While they are in charge of defending only their own systems, they have heightened responsibilities with regards to anticipation, detection, attribution and reaction. But each organisation has specific tasks and roles.\n### a) Organisation of military cyber operations\nThe armed forces learned to perform cyber operations \"as they went\", developing capabilities and skills as they needed[89]. The 2008 White Paper however was a major doctrinal disruption[90], as well as a wake-up call in the aftermath of the Estonian attacks. In addition to the following White Paper and LPM, the then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian launched in 2014 the Cyber Defence Pact. This additional policy document set-out the overall structuring of military cyber defence through six pillars:\n- Hardening the security of its own information and weapon systems,\n- Anticipating technical disruptions by investing in research and development,\n- Reinforcing and structuring human resources dedicated to cyberdefence,\n- Developing a national centre of excellence in Brittany,\n- Reinforcing cooperation with allies in Europe and the Atlantic Alliance,\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n- Fostering a national cyberdefence community and network of trusted partners.\nAs a follow-up to the 2017 Review and as a further step to this military structuring, the Armed Forces ministry established a Cyber Defence Command to coordinate cyber operations within the armed forces. ComCyber, as it is colloquially known, sits directly under the Joint Chief of Staff. Defensively, it serves as an hypervision body, a concept that has a specific meaning in that context:91 it receives and correlates all relevant data related to its systems' security. However, in accordance with a recently released ministerial instruction92, each corps and service remains responsible for its own defensive cyber operations and has its own SOC (Security Operations Centre)93. CALID, the Ministry's SOC, assesses global cyber risk so that ComCyber is able to act and advise political authorities to the best of their knowledge. In other words, defensive cyber operations are modelled on subsidiarity.\nFigure 4 - Simplified graph of military cyber operations, broke-down by their offensive or defensive nature.\nComCyber performs defensive operations by delegation of ANSSI, and must notify the Agency of them94. Consequently, and because both institutions need to share data between each other, CALID is partly co-located with ANSSI. ANSSI typically shares non-military IoCs and ComCyber military ones that may impact civilian systems95. This cooperation and the wider relationship between ANSSI and ComCyber is defined in a specific protocol96.\nNew capabilities for the armed forces: Integrating the cyber domain in conventional and influence operations\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe defensive cyber doctrine entails the prevention, anticipation, detection of and protection against cyber attacks. The scope of the doctrine is limited to reacting to and attributing the attack — within defensive and non-military measures. To perform these tasks, the doctrine sets up an adaptive Permanent Cyber Security Posture, orienting France’s military cyber units to be prepared for what the summary describes as a “peace-crisis-war” continuum. The document thus seems to acknowledge what has been described as a state of unpeace, a state of hostility that falls short of full conflict. This defensive policy is the result of Ministerial Instruction 101000 (Joint Doctrine 3.20). Thus, it covers the whole Ministry and not merely the armed forces.\nFigure 5\nCovers of the offensive and defensive cyber operations documents.\nIn contrast, the offensive doctrine is only relevant to the armed forces.\nUntil the release of this document, the armed forces had focused on defending their own systems—although with an understood element of active defence—while DGSE was in charge of the most sensitive operations, namely, espionage and disruption of adverse systems.\nWhat is new in the offensive doctrine is the integration of cyber activity in conventional military operations. The offensive approach is described as stealthy actions aimed at denying the availability or\nconfidentiality of adverse systems. Implicitly, the doctrine seems to exclude operations with destructive kinetic effects. It mentions the neutralization of enemy systems, but the concept is ambiguous. Offensive operations can prepare or complement conventional operations—acting as a force multiplier—or substitute them entirely where appropriate. The offensive doctrine also includes counterinfluence operations, aimed at protecting conventional action in cyberspace. Such operations are already performed in the conventional domain through the CIAE, or Joint Centre for Environmental Action, the military influence and civil-military cooperation branch of the French armed forces that was created in 2012. This doctrinal shift reflects an increased perception by the armed forces of propaganda and disinformation threats that could hamper its conventional deployments.\nThe new offensive cyber doctrine expands and details the scope of offensive cyber operations. It assumes their preparation and conduct, not only in a clandestine context but also as an integral part of -or substitute for- conventional military operations. As we noted however, it also imposes constraints and rules of engagement on the basis of a strict risk management.\nb) DGSE\nDGSE is the foreign security service and additionally serves as France’s main signals intelligence agency. It sits directly under the Armed Forces Ministry. Until 2014, not much was known publicly by\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nDGSE's activities in the cyber domain. Offensive and espionage operations were deemed to be its responsibilities, but these has been absent from public sight, until forensic analysis and Snowden-leaks published by Le Monde unveiled a diverse panel of advanced malwares (Casper, Bunny, Babar, Dino) attributed to a French intelligence agency. The leaks seem to have broken an internal taboo. A former DGSE executive, Bernard Barbier, shed some light on such operations shortly after, admitting the agency \"started hacking in 1992\".\nc) DGA\nDGA, the Defence Procurement Agency, has long developed a cybersecurity department, which sits into its \"maîtrise de l'information\" branch. It is tasked with protecting the information and weapon systems of the armed forces, providing technical expertise in threat intelligence, upstream research (also known as discovery stage) and crisis support. As part of such responsibilities, it conducts vulnerability research on armed forces' systems and since 2015 organises cyber-wargames.\nThe offensive doctrine indicated DGA will adapt its procurement processes to take into account the tempo of operations and nature of these weapons. Current processes designed to procure vehicles or submarines, or even major software programs, would be ill-suited. This may hint at the creation of an ad hoc procurement process designed from the ground up to research vulnerabilities and develop exploits and payloads.\n3. Competition and opposition of views\nParochial priorities and perceptions of the respective institutions depend mostly on the structuring of the cyber security and defence apparatus, which core principle is offense-defence separation.\na) Opposition of views between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA\nThe opposition of views or the impact of parochial competition appears most clearly between ANSSI and the armed forces, on two different issues: vulnerability disclosure and end-to-end encryption.\nContrary to the U.S. or, more recently, the U.K., France has no public vulnerability equities process (VEP). Currently, disclosure and sharing between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA is not formalised and happens on a case-by-case basis. Guillaume Poupard, ANSSI director, communicated briefly about vulnerability research and disclosure at the agency's end-of-year report. In practice, Poupard said, in case of doubt as to the balance of risk, \"the vulnerability goes to the defence\".

This means ANSSI is not aware of all vulnerabilities discovered. Although there is no obvious conflict of views on that topic, the debate on the right risk balancing illustrates well how each agencies' responsibilities and culture influences their stance in critical debates such as this one.\nWe can witness a more obvious conflict of views on the encryption debate. Poupard, circulated within the government in March 2016 a note arguing strongly against \"exceptional access\" legislation, which would allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bypass encryption, either on device or in transit. The Parliament of Australia recently passed such a law, not without public outcry. In his note, Poupard states:\n“To impose a wide weakening of cryptographic means would affect both digital safety and the freedom of the large majority of law-abiding users, while remaining ineffective against the intended minority target.”\nIt appears that, at the time, DGSE was voicing its concerns against encryption. In 2018, the head of its technical services, Patrick Pailloux, promoted publicly the idea of in-transit exceptional access, while reaffirming the importance of strong (but not end-to-end by definition) encryption. It is thus likely that Poupard’s note was a direct rebuke to DGSE’s pressures. In such case, it may be a good example of two principles edited by Allison and Zelkow. First, that where you stand depends on where you sit. Less colloquially known as “the face of the issue differs from seat to seat”, it explains that, as the head of a defensive agency open to the wider public and private sector, it is expected that its director will oppose the weakening of end-to-end encryption. On the opposite, it is expected that DGSE will seek to extend its interception capabilities, as a signals intelligence agency dedicated to foreign security. Second, this “row” may also be the result of the “51-49 principle”. Even if one isn’t completely convinced by the side of the argument, they must “argue much more confidently than they would if they were detached judges” because of parochial competition.\nb) The role of Foreign Affairs and its relationship with other actors.\nThe International Digital Strategy (December 2017) was released only a few months before the Cyber Defence Review (February 2018). Presented as “France’s international strategy”, it could be potentially interpreted as a willingness of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to defend its prerogative in that area. In May 2017, Jean-Yves Le Drian had become Foreign Affairs Minister after almost five years at the Defence Ministry. Although it may have been perceived as such by some in the Armed Forces Ministry, the international strategy was actually two-years in the making, a long process due in part to its submission to public review. As for the Paris Call, the initiative came from the Cybersecurity and Strategic Affairs division, which then pushed it through to the Minister, who ensured political\nMacron dans les locaux de la DGA-MI à Bruz :pic.twitter.com/elKwQM0k9w,” #WarGames on Twitter (blog), April 15, 2019, https://twitter.com/amaelle_g/status/1117803882032304128.\n Guiton.\n Guiton.\n Catherine Chapman, “Australian Cybersecurity Industry Reels over Anti-Encryption Law,” The Daily Swig | Web security digest, January 25, 2019, https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/australian-cybersecurity-industry-reels-over-anti-encryption-law.\n A ComCyber official, April 18, 2019.\n Valéry Marchive, “Le renseignement aime le chiffrement, mais il veut bien des points de clair,” LeMagIT, July 4, 2018, https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252444227/Le-renseignement-aimé-le-chiffrement-mais-il-veut-bien-des-points-de-clair.\n Allison and Zelikow, Essence of Decision.

Regarding the offensive military doctrine, the Ministry was informed ahead of time and consulted on international law matters.\n***\nWhile ANSSI enjoys a particular status that makes it the prime cyber security and defence institution, SGDSN plays an important political role while ComCyber, DGSE and DGA have their specific sets of goals and capabilities.

It is a very tentative chapter, because of time and interview constraints. To complete the analysis, more interviews should be conducted at higher political levels.\n## 1) Key individuals in decision and action, and factors influencing their perceptions, preferences and stands\nDuring its annual press conference, ANSSI director stated, on the topic of vulnerabilities disclosure, that in a structure that separates offence and defence, \"the level of where both meet [in the policy-making tree] is very high. It means that sometimes, we must mobilise the highest authorities on these issues\".\nBastien Irondelle, in its seminal work on the decision-making process behind the end of French military conscription in 1996, highlighted the everlasting importance of the President. He detailed how the political impetus Jacques Chirac gave to this major policy decision, in particular during the Defence Councils, made the reform happen. We have demonstrated so far that in the case at hand, French cyber security and defence, the evolution has been gradual, taking place over a decade. However, the same key individuals and processes remain.\nIn practice, the range of meaningful decision-making in cyber security and defence starts at ministerial cabinets, up to the Prime Minister and the President. Major crisis and policy decisions are taken at the presidential level, during Defence Councils. ANSSI is represented by the SGDSN, ComCyber by the Joint Chief of Staff, who remains responsible for the military action chain.\nThe Cyber Club identified by Desforges still exists today and brings together the directors of ANSSI, DGA, ComCyber and the technical departments of both domestic and foreign intelligence agencies (DGSI, DGSE).\nAnother noteworthy trend is the overwhelming majority of military profiles among ANSSI executives. Out of the seven directors and deputy-directors, five have spent most of their careers in the armed forces. Such numbers however hide some atypical career paths: the deputy director is a military engineer with a doctorate in public law and an MBA.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n Guiton, \"[Thread] [Team #Wargames] Comment est gérée la question des vulnérabilités dites 'zero-day' en France, où on sépare les missions d'attaque et de défense ?

Because of the number of involved actors and their overlap in each mission, the Strategy established four “operational chains” to centralize and streamline public action in the field. They are referred to as the protection, intelligence, judicial investigations and military-action chains. While it is still unclear how these chains work in practice, we were able to collect more information on the committees and groups that coordinate cyber security and defence policy, in theory and in practice.\n### a) Recently formalised processes\nThe Cyber Strategy created two new committees: An Executive Committee, under the President’s Office, and a Steering Committee, under the SGDSN. Political decisions and policy orientations related to cyberdefence are taken during meetings of the National Security and Defence Council. The Executive Committee is tasked with high-level implementation of the Council’s decisions.\nThe Steering Committee’s responsibility is to report on the Strategy’s implementation to the Prime Minister and to prepare the meetings of the Executive Committee[132]. It meets every semester. SGDSN transmits the impetus of political leadership, sets the agenda and ensures the application of the previously decided measures[133]. Ministries and agencies are free to bring forward suggestions[134].\nAdditionally, a Cyber Crisis Coordination Centre “supervises cyberdefence”[135] and informs decision-makers. The Centre consists of different groups that act at various timelines, even though their names suggest a short-term crisis perimeter. While the Technical Group acts on short-term incidents, Strategy is a “sub-political”[136] group that acts on mid-term strategy to prepare steering committee meetings. It is open to other ministries,[137] of which most individuals present are administration directors (directeurs d’administration centrale)[138]. They offer regular situation reports to the Prime Minister and the President, and suggests policy options. They meet monthly[139]. The Technico-Operational Group (TechOps), on the other hand, is a restricted group with few institutions represented. Its main purpose is to share specific threat intelligence, and it thus open to only a handful of intelligence agencies[140].\n### b) Importance of informal coordination processes\nTechOps is only very briefly described in official documents[141]. However it reminds of the “Cyber Club” Alix Desforges described in her thesis[142]. This informal grouping of agency heads took another dimension with the writing process of the Cyber Strategy. According to an official[143], the writing\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nprocess itself greatly enhanced communication between relevant stakeholders. In other words, the process of creating processes, enhanced communication and coordination between actors. At its creation, TechOps the people and institutions involved warmly welcomed it, and it quickly became indispensable$^{144}$. Some degree of informality remains today. In addition to what we have already described, informal ad-hoc meetings keep happening to deal with specific issues.\n***\nWhen it comes to formal processes, the highest political authorities remain in charge of major policy-decisions. Informal meetings have lead to the formalisation of intelligence sharing and mid to low level policy coordination.\n*\n*\n# Conclusion\nFrom its sovereign principles to the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence institutions, France revendicates an atypical model. At the top, strategic autonomy infuses major political, financial and policy decisions. Domestically, although officials strongly reaffirm the separation of offence and defence activities, in practice such separation can be described as institutional at best, due to the fluidity of human resources between agencies. This separation has nonetheless a genuine impact on policy-making and public debates: differences in parochial priorities and organisational cultures between ANSSI and the armed forces create conflicting views on tough topics such as end-to-end encryption or vulnerability disclosure. Finally, while the executive remains key in decision-making, informal processes and meta-processes have been instrumental in the development of an efficient state cyber security and defence community. To complete and build-up on this exploratory paper, further research on how such processes work out in practice could be conducted.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# GLOSSARY (non-exhaustive)\n\nANSSI National Information Systems Security Agency.\nCALID Centre for Defensive Cyber Operations.\nCASSI Centre for Information Systems Auditing.\nCIAE Joint Centre for Environmental Action.\nComCyber Cyber Defence Command.\nDGA Directorate General for Armament.\nDGSE Directorate General for External Security.\nIoC Indicator of Compromise.\nLPM Pluriannual Military Finance Law\nSGDSN General Secretariat for Defence and National Security.\nSOC Security Operations Centre.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# CHRONOLOGY (non-exhaustive)\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# INTERVIEWS\nA ComCyber official.

France is no exception. We have seen in recent months a revival of its efforts to secure its citizens and interests in cyber space. French President Emmanuel Macron presented in late 2018 the \"Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace\", a package of norms of good behaviour bringing together states, private corporations and the civil society¹. All the while, in the past two years, the government designed its very first Cyber Defence Strategy² and the Armed Forces unveiled some elements of their offensive and defensive cyber operations³. How can we make sense of it all?\nWe frame the current picture by following Allison and Zelikow's three conceptual models of decision-making: Rational actor, organisational behaviour, and government politics⁴. In accordance with each model, we seek to answer the following questions, respectively:\nR1: What are the underlying principles, goals and objectives of French national defence and security, in general terms and in the cyber domain?\nR2: What are the institutions involved in cyber security and defence, their perimeters of action and organisational culture?\nR3: What are the processes and individuals involved in cyber security and defence policy-making at the politico-strategic level?\nTo do so we combine an extensive review of the literature with a series of interviews with senior French officials from ministries, as well as national agencies and other specialised institutions.\n# Objectives and limitations\nThe objective of this paper is three-fold: describing, explaining and, by extension, predicting. First, we hope to provide a better understanding of the current French cyber security and defence policy picture its founding political and doctrinal principles. Second, by applying Allison and Zelikow's models to this picture, we seek to explain how policy-making in this area happens in practice. This approach diverges slightly from the models' original purpose, which is to analyse a specific case-study and its cluster of decisions (\"Why did the Soviets smuggle nuclear missiles into Cuba?\" \"Why did the US respond by imposing a naval blockade?\"). This paper does not ambition to explain why France launched the Paris Call or why it published parts of the armed forces' offensive cyber operations doctrine. Scholars⁵ and journalists⁶ have already started answering them. Rather, it seeks to provide a toolkit so that scholars, practitioners or journalists can design more accurate hypotheses about why future decision X or Y was taken in that domain. There is no doubt this toolkit will be incomplete and\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nimperfect. Not all policy documents are public, some processes and institutions are still recent, and we lack the ability to stand back so that we can grasp how some processes work-out in practice. Another obstacle is that these principles, policies, doctrines, processes and institutions live through the minds and acts of leaders, policy-makers and practitioners, whom the author has not been able to all interview. In particular, the author was unable to meet officials from SGDSN itself, the Élysée Palace and Prime Minister's Office. This is where the work of Bastien Irondelle becomes key⁷. The third -indirect- objective of this paper, is prediction. As Allison and Zelikow highlight, it is “the logical flipside of explanations”⁸. If we understand more accurately the processes and factors that lead to decisions, we can extrapolate about future events. The predictive power of the model will however be highly dependent on the strength of its explanatory qualities.\n## Acknowledgement and appreciation\nThe author is grateful to IRSEM for hosting him and the warm welcome.

This is the rational actor model. In our case, France is the identified state. More often than not, political cycles lead to new policies and strategies. When relevant, the state thus becomes personified, in relation to a specific presidency. In this model we adopt a bounded rationality viewpoint, whereas we accept that “values, beliefs and stereotypes” play a role in the actors’ rationality⁹.\n## 1. Political concepts, principles and goals\nIn this first part we analyse France’s core political concepts of sovereignty and strategic autonomy, the rationale behind the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence apparatus, and the one behind its communication and attribution stance.\n### a. France’s sovereignty, national and European strategic autonomy\nFrance has a conceptualisation of sovereignty that makes it stand out of its peers. Baezner and Robin found in their comparative analysis that “France was unique among the states examined in that it used the word “sovereignty” more frequently and in different contexts”¹⁰. Sovereignty, in its French understanding, cannot be restrained to hard sovereignty, i.e. the protection of its citizens, borders and other existential interests¹¹. French sovereignty is a wide spectrum that implies strategic autonomy. The 2017 Strategic Review defines strategic autonomy as a two pillar concept entailing 1) a high level of industrial and technological autonomy, and 2) an operational autonomy¹². On technological autonomy, the Ministry of the Armed Forces has recently ramped up its strategy, with the creation of a dedicated investment fund, DefInvest¹³. Its first investments were made in microprocessors and high precision optics manufacturers. Operational autonomy means the ability to reach an informed decision and to take action, in particular in the context of political or military crises. The French military operation in Mali, for instance, is a good illustration of operational autonomy: the ability to engage in full scope – low to high intensity– operations, with allies or on its own if necessary.\nFrench strategic autonomy can be best described as neo-Gaullist. It is characterised by a strong sense of national independence but recognises the need for a powerful political Europe¹⁴. Its historical drivers and roots come indeed from a traditional Gaullist doctrine of national autonomy, which is more self-reliant. The perceived need for self-reliance played a major role in driving De Gaulle to transform France into a nuclear power and to leave NATO integrated command in 1966. Some key historical events such as the 1940 surrender, the intelligence frustrations of the 1992 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq war further fuelled perceptions that France needed both a credible nuclear arsenal, and autonomous intelligence capabilities¹⁵.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n---\n⁹ Allison and Zelikow.

See para. 159 of the 2017 Strategic Review.\n¹² See Para. 157. “Revue stratégique de défense et de sécurité nationale,” La Documentation Française (Paris: Présidence de la République, October 2017), http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/174000744/index.shtml.\n¹³ “Le Ministère Des Armées et Bpifrance Lancent Definvest,” BPI France, November 17, 2017, https://presse.bpifrance.fr/le-ministere-des-armees-et-bpifrance-lancent-definvest/.\n¹⁴ Serge Berstein, *Histoire Du Gaullisme* (Paris: Perrin, 2001).\n¹⁵ The Military Intelligence Agency was created in the aftermath of the Gulf War. Claude Faure, “Bref historique des services de renseignement et de sécurité français contemporains,” *Revue historique des armées*, no. 247 (June 15, 2007): 70–81.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThis spirit of autonomy remains today, but with a wider pragmatic recognition of the need for cooperation and integration. France re-joined NATO command in 2009 for mainly pragmatism and influence reasons¹⁶. However the French nuclear arsenal remains outside of NATO command and its intelligence apparatus outside of the 5-Eyes community. France' strategic autonomy is also reliant on a European strategic autonomy, which it seeks to develop. The Hubert Védrine report recommended that the country's return into NATO command is accompanied by a strengthening of European defence integration and cooperation, especially in the R&amp;D of technological and industrial capacities¹⁷. It encourages the development of mutual interdependence with entities who share critical interests, particularly within the EU. This policy shift initiated in 1992 with the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy was confirmed in the 2008 White Paper, placing the EU as \"a central tenet of [France's] security policy\"¹⁸. This central place was reaffirmed ever since, including in the last cyber strategy document¹⁹.\nb) Domestic apparatus: Offense / defence separation\nDomestically, the French approach contrasts with that embraced by the United States or the United Kingdom. Most notably, France assumes a clear separation between offensive and defensive cyber operations. This means that, contrary to the U.S.' National Security Agency (NSA) or the U.K.'s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), France's leading agency for cybersecurity is exclusively dedicated to defensive operations and not part of the intelligence community. This is a defining element of the Cyber Strategy Review and infuses the whole structure of French cyberdefence. The rationale is that having a distinct defensive agency separate from offense-oriented military intelligence agencies \"facilitates the acceptance of state intervention [...] whether in public administration or the economic sphere\"²⁰.\nc) A counter-threat model based on direct communication rather than public attribution\nPeculiarities of the French model are not limited to its conceptualisation of sovereignty. On the diplomatic stage, France has also adopted a different stance than most of its counterparts²¹. A number of NATO allies are increasingly inclined to \"name and shame\" states involved in cyber attacks. One telling example can be found in October 2018, when the U.S., U.K., Canada and the Netherlands denounced Russian attempts at disrupting the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons²². Paris expressed its solidarity but fell short of blaming Moscow²³. Already in 2015, when what then seemed to be ISIS took down TV5Monde in a major hack, no official attribution was made. ANSSI, the national cybersecurity agency, however briefed four dozen media outlets with details of its forensic investigation and indicators of compromise. These details were then analysed by private security firms which pointed the finger at persistent threat actor (APT) ²⁸²⁴. Additionally, TV5Monde director Yves Bigot reported in L'Express\n\"France favours red phones over the megaphone.\"\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nthat ANSSI personnel suggested it was a false-flag (\"un leurre\")²⁵. More recently, in the case of the #MacronLeaks, France did not issue any kind of attribution either. G. Poupard, head of ANSSI, refused to do so arguing \"the attack was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone\"²⁶. More recently, the Secretary General for Defence and National Security clarified France's official policy: attribution can only be performed on the basis of elements collected or verified by French services, typically ANSSI and DGSE²⁷.\nThis does not mean that it does not have attribution capabilities. As we will see in Chapter II, attributing cyber-attacks is one of the main missions of the French cyberdefence apparatus. But even when it knows, France prefers forthright bilateral dialogues with Russia and other cyber powers such as the U.S., China, India, Brazil and Japan²⁸. It appears it even opened a deconfliction cell with the Russian Security Council on cyber matters²⁹. Only in last resort will France take part in public name and shame³⁰. In other words, it favours red phones over the megaphone.\nThere is only one recorded instance of public attribution, and it is indirect. At the unveiling of the offensive cyber doctrine, Minister Parly revealed that an APT targeted email accounts of high-ranking officials between 2017 and 2018, with the objective of uncovering the navy's oil supply chain³¹. Though the Minister stopped short of explicitly recognizing the group's affiliation with the Russian Federation, she indirectly attributed the attacker's mode of operation to a specific group known as Turla.\nUnder Egloff's definition, France engages in two attribution processes³². First a process of sense-making attribution, for the benefit of its own factual understanding, that it rarely communicates publicly. Second, in a meaning-making process, with regards to its adversaries. But again, it does so rather privately than publicly. Overall, French strategy with attribution seem to fit a counter-threat model³³.\nIn this first part, we have detailed how France conceives its sovereignty and what it means by strategic autonomy. We have also sought to explain its rationale behind the offence / defence separation and to describe its policy of non-public attribution.\n## 2. The evolution and granularization of objectives of French cyber security and defence\nIn this second part we review the cyber security and defence objectives produced by political and military authorities, from 2011 to 2019. We identify three main themes: active discouragement, risk limitation and direct communication.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe Defence and National Security White Paper 2008 is the first of its kind to mention Internet-related threats³⁴ and leads to the creation of ANSSI. The Agency releases in 2011 the “National Strategy for the Defence and Security of Information Systems”. It’s four goals are:\n- For France to become a top-tier cyber power,\n- To guarantee freedom of decision through confidentiality of state secrets,\n- To reinforce the security of critical infrastructures,\n- To ensure cybersecurity to public and private actors alike.\nThe second version of the Strategy revolved around 1) state secrets and critical infrastructures, 2) digital privacy and cybercrime, 3) public sensitisation and training, 4) business and export strategies, and 5) Europe, digital sovereignty and norms³⁵.\nFollowing the election of Emmanuel Macron to the Presidency, the President requests officially tasks the Armed Forces Ministry to create a panel of experts with a view to write a new defence white paper. The Strategic Review for Defence and National Security, as it is then known, is released in 2017. It promotes digital sovereignty and cybersecurity to top priorities of national defence³⁶.\nIn February 2018, the country’s first National Strategy for Cyber Defence clarified both the organization and integration of cyber operations among all government entities³⁷ as well as the national and international legal framework surrounding their use³⁸. It sets-out goals and processes as part of a “robust national cyber security and defence apparatus”³⁹.\nThe seven principles underpinning the Strategy are:\n1. To make the security of French information and communication systems a priority,\n2. To embrace a policy of active discouragement⁴⁰ and coordinated response,\n3. To fully exercise its digital sovereignty,\n4. To bring an efficient judicial response to cybercriminality,\n5. To promote a shared cybersecurity culture,\n6. To contribute to a trusted and safe digital Europe,\n7. To act internationally for a collective governance of cyberspace.\nTo achieve said goals, the Strategy sets-out a number of policy-making and coordination processes (see Chapter III). In practice, three main themes appear: Active discouragement, risk limitation and multilateralism.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n³⁴ Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n³⁵ Services du Premier Ministre, “Stratégie Nationale Pour La Sécurité Du Numérique” (Paris, October 16, 2015), https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/la-strategie-nationale-pour-la-securite-du-numerique-une-reponse-aux-nouveaux-enjeux-des-usages-numeriques/.\n³⁶ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n³⁷ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n³⁸ Francois Delerue and Aude Gery, “France’s Cyberdefense Strategic Review and International Law,” Lawfare, March 23, 2018, https://www.lawfareblog.com/frances-cyberdefense-strategic-review-and-international-law.\n³⁹ In French as « Dispositif national de protection et de défense informatique robuste ». “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n⁴⁰ France reserves its concept of deterrence (dissuasion) to the nuclear domain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Active discouragement\nFrance has adopted a posture of active discouragement against advanced threats. It relies on direct communication with the adversary, as we have detailed earlier, and on an increasingly explicit declaratory strategy.\nIn January 2019 Minister Florence Parly unveiled the offensive and defensive cyber operations doctrines of the armed forces. The announcement is the latest and strongest step taken by the country as part of its declaratory strategy⁴¹. In response to cyber and other threats, France is “not afraid” of using cyber weapons⁴². The country did not wait until then to perform offensive operations or even to publicly admit doing so. Such operations were first mentioned in the 2008 White Paper⁴³ and then again with more details in 2013. The case for proportional reprisals in response to a major attack was also made clearly by then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian:\n“In times of war, cyber weapons may be the response, or part of our response, to an armed attack [aggression armée], being of a cyber nature or otherwise”⁴⁴.\nb) Risk limitation and infrastructure sanctuarisation\nRisks that are inherent to cyberspace and operations are a recurrent topic in policy documents.\nThe offensive doctrine places great emphasis on the consideration and mitigation of political, legal and military risks. It mandates a risk balancing exercise in the preparation and conduct of offensive operations: against the risk of escalation in an asymmetric environment, or against the risk of collateral or indirect damage on civilian infrastructures. This balancing exercise – and the need not to reveal too much details – may be the reason the doctrine does not clearly mention⁴⁵ physical destruction of information systems.\nInternationally, France aims to promote existing institutional mechanisms to “limit hacking and destabilising activities” in cyberspace, notably through an international initiative, the “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace”⁴⁶, unveiled in November 2018.\nIn terms of international law, the document encourages more extensive and better coordinated regulation of cyberspace in the spirit of founding principles of the U.N. Charter, notably the maintenance of international peace and security. It recognizes not only the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyberspace, but of international human rights and customary international law more broadly as well. It also advocates for the development of new ways to prevent intellectual property theft, i.e. industrial espionage.\nAnother key theme of the document is the importance of protecting individuals and critical infrastructures from harm. The document presses to safeguard the “public core of the Internet” from hostile actors. This is a clear demonstration of support for a package of norms unveiled by the Global\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n41 Taillat, “Signaling, Victory, and Strategy in France’s Military Cyber Doctrine.”\n42 Parly, “Stratégie Cyber Des Armées (Speech).”\n43 Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n44 Jean-Yves Le Drian, “Déclaration de M.

Reflecting the view of most states on the matter, the Call promotes the exclusive role of sovereign states in hostile acts in cyberspace. It condemns corporate hack-back and other offensive operations from non-state actors. It also appeals for measures preventing interference with elections, another contemporary hot topic.\nClearly absent in the text are issues of espionage and state-lead low-intensity offensive operations. The need to compromise and willingness to gather support across states with various political mindsets means offensive cyber operations was probably out of scope of the Call from its inception.\nc) Multilateralism and stakeholderism\nOn the international stage, one of France's goals relates to the diplomatic process itself. The country seeks to maintain a form of inclusive multilateralism⁴⁸, and in parallel to open-up debates on cyberspace governance to non-state actors.\nIts International Digital Strategy puts great emphasis into promoting an \"open, diverse and trusted\" cyberspace in which it envisions the European Union as a key player⁴⁹. The Strategy itself was subject to public consultations.\nThe Paris Call comes in the wake of the strategy. In addition to its normative nature we detailed earlier, to engage industries and civil society, the document also promotes everyday good practices (\"cyber hygiene\") and the implementation of \"security by design\" in products and services. It is not the first initiative of its kind. In April 2018, Microsoft launched its \"Digital Peace\" campaign⁵⁰ along with a \"Cybersecurity Tech Accord\"⁵¹ aimed at getting the internet and the technology industry to better protect their customers' privacy and security against cyberattacks. Similarly, Siemens unveiled in May 2018 a \"Charter of Trust\" that seeks to develop adherence to security principles and processes, with the aim of developing a \"global standard\" for cybersecurity⁵².\nUntil those recent developments, norm-building initiatives were the prerogative of states. In 2015, the U.N.'s Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recognized that international humanitarian law applied to cyberspace⁵³, though it then deadlocked when at the end of 2017. Although a new process was put in place for 2019 up to 2021, the two blocs—one group led by the United States and another by China and Russia—are unlikely to solve the stalemate.\nApproaching the issue from various stakeholders' perspectives, the Paris Call is an attempt to move away from this international deadlock. Macron, at its unveiling at UNESCO, made the case for rebuffing what he described as a binary choice between \"a Californian Internet and a Chinese\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nInternet\"54. So far, he argued, these two opposite narratives have monopolized the debate and imposed two radically different yet unsatisfactory alternatives: either a model of mere technical governance led by Silicon Valley, or an overwhelming regulation led by authoritarian regimes. While the former does not address issues of privacy and malicious actors, the latter cracks down on human rights and could lead to a \"balkanisation\" of internet and of wider cyberspace55.\nAccording to Le Monde, Microsoft first approached the French government to obtain its support for the Tech Accord56. However, the country found the Accord too narrow and industry-oriented. Recognizing a trend of norms fragmentation coupled with diplomatic deadlocks, France saw an opportunity to take the lead on governance. But this was only possible if the call achieved two things: First, it needed to widen the scope of existing sector-specific initiatives (Tech Accord, GGE, For The Web) into meaningful norms all actors could get behind. Second, it needed to gather and federate existing initiatives, otherwise it would just contribute to the further fragmentation of norms. So far the call seems to have mostly succeeded, with a notable caveat among state signatories.\nAmong the 64 state signatories, European countries are the most heavily present. However, almost every continent is represented: among them we find Qatar, South Korea, Mexico, Japan, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Senegal and New-Zealand. Critically, on release day, key potential signatories such as India or Brazil are not on the list. The absence of such countries may become problematic. While the U.S. (at least for now), China and Russia are unlikely to join, the Call will rely on support from States like India and Brazil in order to gain traction within international institutions, primarily the United Nations. Macron, aware of this challenge, suggested that the Internet Governance Forum—a U.N. event—become responsible for monitoring the effective implementation of the call and be moved under the direct supervision of the U.N. Secretary General57.\nThe document has already drawn support from influential non-governmental groups. The World Leadership Alliance, Chatham House, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Internet Society have committed to its principles. Technical governance bodies, such as the Number Resource Organization and the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre—the region's internet registry—expressed interest too. Powerful business lobbies are another prominent group of signatories, including notably, Indian business guilds such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Internet and Mobile Association of India and the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum. In total, as many as 300 universities, NGOs and professional associations have committed to the call.\nIn the industrial landscape, France succeeded in attracting both major initiatives: The Tech Accord and the Charter of Trust represent a significant share of the private-sector signatories, as together they represent 85 powerful corporations such as Airbus, Cisco and Facebook. But the call is not a mere shell for existing groups. Notable newcomers include Google, Samsung Electronics, Intel Corporation, Kaspersky Lab, Thales and many other companies, ranging from the banking and insurance industries, to law, commerce and defence.\nInitiatives to create norms in cyberspace are multiplying. But more than anything else, these initiatives seem to have fragmented political will and have so far failed to gather support across the board. Emmanuel Macron hopes the Paris Call will bring fresh momentum to the issue by mounting support from influential parties, notably Silicon Valley's top companies and emerging powers. The Call is\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n54 Anonymous, \"IGF 2018 Speech by French President Emmanuel Macron,\" Text, Internet Governance Forum, November 14, 2018, https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/igf-2018-speech-by-french-president-emmanuel-macron.\n55 Cattaruzza et al., \"Sovereignty in Cyberspace.\"\n56 \"La France veut relancer les négociations sur la paix dans le cyberespace.\"\n57 Anonymous, \"IGF 2018 Speech by French President Emmanuel Macron.\"\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nrestrained in scope, avoiding the most sensitive activities such as espionage and offensive operations, but this restraint makes it more likely to receive support across a wider group of stakeholders. It is far from a silver bullet; rather it offers a fresh starting point and framework for further negotiations on values and norms of behaviour in cyberspace.\nFigure 1 - The pyramid of means (centre) and their respective objectives (right).\nOverall, the objectives of French cyber security and defence are three-fold: Actively discourage adversaries through a declaratory strategy that includes offensive operations, limit the escalation potential of crises by sanctuarising core infrastructures, and promote a third way model to cyberspace governance.\n## 2. Threat perception\nA state's perception of threats is based on a variety of factors: strategic goals, history and precedent, one's perception of its own weaknesses and dependencies$^{58}$. It is a key concept within rational models such as the one Allison and Zelikow describe. While France approached cybersecurity issues from a dominantly technical perspective at its beginnings, Desforges argues, it shifted towards a model that goes beyond security and defence issues$^{59}$. The Snowden leaks, the rise of jihadist propaganda and the increasingly geopolitical impact of major attacks pushed France to consider broader societal challenges and actors in defining its strategies and policies.\n$^{58}$ Raymond Cohen, “Threat Perception in International Crisis,” *Political Science Quarterly* 93, no. 1 (1978): 93, https://doi.org/10/d95kwg.\n$^{59}$ Alix Desforges, “Approche Géopolitique Du Cyberespace, Enjeux Pour La Défense et La Sécurité Nationale, l’exemple de La France” (Université Paris 8 - Vincennes / Saint-Denis, 2018).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Threat realisation centred around technology and intelligence (2008-2013)\nThe 2008 White Paper$^{(a)}$ mentions Internet in its first chapter, but first as an example of a positive trend, highlighting the rise in connectedness of people around the world. The other side of the coin, it later states, is the challenge of keeping up with the high-paced spread of information and ideas, in other words information control and propaganda. The Paper also dedicates a full-page box to serious cyberattacks detailing the full CIA spectrum. While it does not mention the attacks on Estonia, the Paper foresees such attacks will be multiplying in the following 15 years and considers the risk of a large-scale attack on its critical infrastructures a major threat. It mentions \"cyberwar\" as one of the scenarios which could involve the Atlantic Alliance. In consequence, the Paper mandates 1) a switch from a passive to active defence model, 2) the development of offensive cyber capabilities, strategy and doctrine all focusing on adversarial military systems.\nIt is the very first time France acknowledges cyber threats and decides to act on them in a national public policy document. The Paper also creates a new strategic role for the armed forces known as \"knowledge and anticipation\".\nFigure 2\nStrategic and prospective policy documents in context (yellow, red and green). They are part of complex financial and procurement cycles and reflect well French threat perceptions.\nSources: DGA, CICDE, NATO, EDA. Graph design and editing: by the author. TRL: Technology Readiness Level.\nFive years after the wake-up call of the 2008 White Paper, its successor recognises that the fast-paced evolution of threats and capabilities require to go one \"step further\" in cyberdefence$^{(c)}$. It ambitions to dedicate more human and financial resources to intelligence and operational capabilities, mandates the creation of a cyber reserve force and calls for a broad societal effort from international cooperation to training and public awareness.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nb) Broadening to societal challenges and capabilities build-up (2013-2015)\nThe 2013 White Paper mandated the creation of a national doctrine for major cyber threats response: a coordinated defensive posture mixed with a graduated response from diplomatic, judicial and law enforcement powers to military means when vital interests are at stake. The strategic mission “knowledge and anticipation”, created in 2008, now includes information control in its widest sense (maîtrise de l’information), from trends in cryptography to intelligence gathering and critical infrastructure security. A joint doctrine puts in place a strategic anticipation group which is tasked with mid-term (one to two years) prospective on operational preparedness, military intelligence and international relations. Most critically, the Paper contains France’s official recognition of cyberspace as an operational domain by stating that “cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own”. This is two years after the United States and three years before NATO.\n## “Cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own.”\nThe ensuing pluriannual defence finance law (LPM, 2014-2019) set-out an operational cyberdefence chain integrated to conventional military operations. It reiterated the need for both defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, granting overall 1 billion EUR to cyberdefence.\nIn 2015, the Digital Security Strategy stated that a serious threat (“atteinte significative”) to French citizens data could constitute a national security matter, notably in the context of espionage, propaganda or political destabilisation. The complete shutdown of news channel TV5 Monde that year represented a moment of reckoning for the country’s security agencies, while the leaking of documents stolen from the Macron campaign on the eve of the 2017 election sounded alarm bells at the possibility of foreign meddling in domestic politics, echoing the Clinton campaign.\nc) Institutional and doctrinal military structuring (2017-2019)\nThe 2017 Review emphasises the increasing role of Internet and digital giants (GAFAM, Baidu) on geopolitics and sovereignty, as well as on “strategic intimidation” facilitated by the combination of economic, military and informational pressures such as territorial fait-accompli and mass social network trolling. It also mentions the risk of escalation in cyber and space conflicts, not the least because of first strike temptations. Currently, ANSSI states “destabilisation, espionage and sabotage” as the primary threats it faces.\nThe Cyberdefence Review dedicates a significant part (32 pages) to the evolution of the threat landscape. It relies on the “new normal” scenario to highlight the risks brought by quantum\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\ncomputers, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. It concludes that their level of security will be determining factors for societal safety⁶⁸.\nThe next LPM (2019-2025) reflects this evolution of French threat perception and the impetus granted to the “knowledge and anticipation” mission of the armed forces. The defence budget for 2019 amounts to 35,9 billion EUR, or 1.82% of GDP, pensions excluded⁶⁹. It is planned to increase over the next four years, reaching 44 billion EUR and 2% of GDP in 2023⁷⁰. In 2019, intelligence and cyberdefence constitute already 73% of the Ministry’s hiring effort (+450 personnel in total)⁷¹. By 2025, the armed forces are expected to count on 4000 so-called cyber-combatants, which represent an increase of 25% over six years⁷². Cyberdefence will receive over this period a budget of 1.6 billion Euros, excluding payroll⁷³.\n***\nOver the past decade, France went through three main major evolution stages in its cyber security and defence structuring: threat realisation (2008-2011), capabilities build-up (2013-2015) and an institutional and doctrinal military structuring accompanied by a strong diplomatic impetus (2017-2019). The recently released offensive doctrine is the culmination of this deep transformation. It particularly represents a turning point for the armed forces, breaking offensive operations from their intelligence silo. The wording of the document and of the accompanying speech by Minister Parly also represents a less veiled signal to Russia, a message France had previously been reluctant to send publicly. The Paris Call, in parallel, is an unprecedented attempt at bringing states, major corporations and the civil society together around key values and principles.\n&gt; “France aims to promote international rules and stability [...] to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks [...] to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion.”\nOverall, France aims to promote international rules and stability in the cyber domain to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks room to manoeuvre to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion. Such balance is and will remain delicate, which only reinforces the need for a better understanding of actors’ rationales and policy coordination.\n# Chapter II – Relevant organisations, their goals and capabilities\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n⁶⁸ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.” P.31.\n⁶⁹ Ministère des Armées, “Communiqué - Budget 2019 : LPM année 1,” September 25, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/communaute-defense/communique-du-ministere-des-armees_-budget-2019-lpm-annee-1.\n⁷⁰ Ministère des Armées.\n⁷¹ Ministère des Armées.\n⁷² Ministère des Armées, “Guide Explicitatif: Les Réserves Cyber,” November 15, 2016, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/491674/7859279/file/20161115_EMACYBER_Guide_explicitatif.pdf.\n⁷³ Ministère des Armées, “Projet de Loi Relatif à La Programmation Militaire Pour Les Années 2019 à 2025 et Portant Diverses Dispositions Intéressant La Défense,” February 6, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/523150/8769279/file/LPM%202019-2025%20-%20Rapport%20annexe.pdf.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFollowing the organisational behaviour model of Allison and Zelikow, we now turn to the main institutional players in cyber security and defence.

ANSSI\na) Status, history and relationship with SGDSN\nIn response to the 2008 White Paper, the National Cyber Security Agency, abbreviated in French as ANSSI, was established a year later under the Prime Minister's General Secretary for Defence and National Security (SGDSN). It is a service that exercises national authority on the security of information systems⁷⁴.\nWhile SGDSN is in charge of security issues at large, ANSSI deals with digital affairs widely. It has a specific focus on cybersecurity, but in its widest sense: ANSSI supports the private sector, helps draft France foreign policy on digital issues and works on societal resilience. For instance, its Cyber Anticipation Cell is currently tasked with securing the Paris Olympics 2024⁷⁵. Acting as a strategy, policy and plans cell (J5, in military jargon), its main responsibilities is to advise decision-makers. This difference of scope between ANSSI and SGDSN explains why the Agency reports to the Secretary-General directly (the person), and not the Secretariat-General (as in, the institution)⁷⁶.\nWhy is not ANSSI directly attached to the Prime Minister then? Because belonging to SGDSN provides the Agency with institutional protection against potentially hindering senior civil servants in higher spheres of the government⁷⁷. Indeed, SGDSN reports to the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General is a permanent member of the presidential Defence Councils.\nIts predecessor, the Central Directory for Information Systems Security (DCSSI) was created in 2001 also under the SGDSN, and was itself the successor to the Central Service for Information Systems Security, which existed since 1986. Despite its new name and national authority status, ANSSI has thus deep historical roots.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n⁷⁴ “Décret N° 2009-834 Du 7 Juillet 2009 Portant Création d’un Service à Compétence Nationale Dénommé « Agence Nationale de La Sécurité Des Systèmes d’information »,” 2009-834 § (2009).\n⁷⁵ Emmanuel Germain, ANSSI Deputy Director, Paris, June 27, 2019.\n⁷⁶ Germain.\n⁷⁷ Germain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFigure 3 - The missions and actors of French cyberdefence (Desforges 2018).\nb) Responsibilities\nANSSI has responsibility for coordination of the state's cyber security, hosts the national Computer Emergency Response Team and acts as a regulatory body for the public and private sector alike, primarily for critical infrastructure operators. It plays an unequal role in all six missions of French cyber defence as described in the 2018 Cyber Defence Strategy: cyber threat prevention, anticipation, protection, detection, attribution and reaction. The latter entails technical remediation as well as legal and military action. Alix Desforges78 clarified some of the responsibility sharing that the Cyber Defence Strategy sets-out. While prevention is a cross-government and multistakeholder assignment (ministries, local security representatives, chambers of commerce), anticipation is in essence a threat intelligence task fulfilled by ANSSI and intelligence agencies. Protection (defensive cyber operations and measures) and detection remain the responsibility of ANSSI and its subsidiaries, especially when it comes to private critical infrastructure operators. Attribution of attacks is a joint ANSSI and intelligence services task, while reaction (remediation) is another mission that benefits from subsidiarity.\nThe recognition of cyberspace as a domain of conflict in the 2013 White Paper comes with a new finance law. The 2014-2019 LPM contained two key measures to widen the capabilities of ANSSI. First, it created heavy regulatory obligations on critical infrastructure operators, public and private alike, in terms of their network and industrial control system security, threat detection capabilities and penetration testing, which ANSSI can now perform79. In light of such new powers, it also granted ANSSI with derogations80 with regards to the French Computer Misuse Act81. According to its Deputy Director, ANSSI deals with around 20 attacks from APTs every year82; and these are only those that are detected.\nc) People, identity and organisational culture\nANSSI brings together experts, practitioners and strategists in seven different laboratories and departments. Its two most prominent organisational traits are its exclusive defensive purpose, and its start-up spirit.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFirst, as we described earlier, ANSSI's identity relies mostly on its exclusive defensive purpose. This is the foundation of the French model. Its Director Guillaume Poupard regularly insists on this feature, which seems to infuse very deeply into its operations. Tools that could be dual-use (i.e. for both defensive and offensive purposes) are separately developed at both DGSE (for offense) and ANSSI (for defence), even if it duplicates the effort. However, because of the high pressure on its human resources, DGSE and ANSSI are pooling and sharing their people and increasingly\n# Of a defensive culture by nature and legal status, [ANSSI] is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need.\nsharing intelligence. The separation between offense and defence is thus institutional and not absolute. Second, the Agency enjoys describing itself as a start-up, at least in its spirit. This tag however hides large disparities in its workforce: 80% are temporary staff, with a mean age of 30 years old. The remaining 20% are the managers, mostly military or civilian engineers. Overall, the mean age is of 34 years.\nOf a defensive culture by nature and legal status, it is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need. Although its nature and role is less ambiguous than its Anglo-Saxon peers (GCHQ, NSA) its responsibilities make its activities deeply intertwined with those of intelligence agencies, primarily DGSE.\n## 2. Armed Forces and the intelligence community\nThe armed forces play a role in all six cyber security and defence missions we highlighted just below. While they are in charge of defending only their own systems, they have heightened responsibilities with regards to anticipation, detection, attribution and reaction. But each organisation has specific tasks and roles.\n### a) Organisation of military cyber operations\nThe armed forces learned to perform cyber operations \"as they went\", developing capabilities and skills as they needed. The 2008 White Paper however was a major doctrinal disruption, as well as a wake-up call in the aftermath of the Estonian attacks. In addition to the following White Paper and LPM, the then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian launched in 2014 the Cyber Defence Pact. This additional policy document set-out the overall structuring of military cyber defence through six pillars:\n- Hardening the security of its own information and weapon systems,\n- Anticipating technical disruptions by investing in research and development,\n- Reinforcing and structuring human resources dedicated to cyberdefence,\n- Developing a national centre of excellence in Brittany,\n- Reinforcing cooperation with allies in Europe and the Atlantic Alliance,\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n- Fostering a national cyberdefence community and network of trusted partners.\nAs a follow-up to the 2017 Review and as a further step to this military structuring, the Armed Forces ministry established a Cyber Defence Command to coordinate cyber operations within the armed forces. ComCyber, as it is colloquially known, sits directly under the Joint Chief of Staff. Defensively, it serves as an hypervision body, a concept that has a specific meaning in that context:91 it receives and correlates all relevant data related to its systems' security. However, in accordance with a recently released ministerial instruction92, each corps and service remains responsible for its own defensive cyber operations and has its own SOC (Security Operations Centre)93. CALID, the Ministry's SOC, assesses global cyber risk so that ComCyber is able to act and advise political authorities to the best of their knowledge. In other words, defensive cyber operations are modelled on subsidiarity.\nFigure 4 - Simplified graph of military cyber operations, broke-down by their offensive or defensive nature.\nComCyber performs defensive operations by delegation of ANSSI, and must notify the Agency of them94. Consequently, and because both institutions need to share data between each other, CALID is partly co-located with ANSSI. ANSSI typically shares non-military IoCs and ComCyber military ones that may impact civilian systems95. This cooperation and the wider relationship between ANSSI and ComCyber is defined in a specific protocol96.\nNew capabilities for the armed forces: Integrating the cyber domain in conventional and influence operations\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe defensive cyber doctrine entails the prevention, anticipation, detection of and protection against cyber attacks⁹⁷. The scope of the doctrine is limited to reacting to and attributing the attack — within defensive and non-military measures. To perform these tasks, the doctrine sets up an adaptive Permanent Cyber Security Posture, orienting France’s military cyber units to be prepared for what the summary describes as a “peace-crisis-war” continuum⁹⁸. The document thus seems to acknowledge what has been described as a state of unpeace, a state of hostility that falls short of full conflict⁹⁹. This defensive policy is the result of Ministerial Instruction 101000 (Joint Doctrine 3.20)¹⁰⁰. Thus, it covers the whole Ministry and not merely the armed forces.¹⁰¹\nFigure 5\nCovers of the offensive and defensive cyber operations documents.\nIn contrast, the offensive doctrine is only relevant to the armed forces.\nUntil the release of this document, the armed forces had focused on defending their own systems—although with an understood element of active defence—while DGSE was in charge of the most sensitive operations, namely, espionage and disruption of adverse systems.\nWhat is new in the offensive doctrine is the integration of cyber activity in conventional military operations. The offensive approach is described as stealthy actions aimed at denying the availability or\nconfidentiality of adverse systems. Implicitly, the doctrine seems to exclude operations with destructive kinetic effects. It mentions the neutralization of enemy systems, but the concept is ambiguous. Offensive operations can prepare or complement conventional operations—acting as a force multiplier—or substitute them entirely where appropriate. The offensive doctrine also includes counterinfluence operations, aimed at protecting conventional action in cyberspace. Such operations are already performed in the conventional domain through the CIAE, or Joint Centre for Environmental Action, the military influence and civil-military cooperation branch of the French armed forces that was created in 2012. This doctrinal shift reflects an increased perception by the armed forces of propaganda and disinformation threats that could hamper its conventional deployments.\nThe new offensive cyber doctrine expands and details the scope of offensive cyber operations. It assumes their preparation and conduct, not only in a clandestine context but also as an integral part of -or substitute for- conventional military operations¹⁰². As we noted however, it also imposes constraints and rules of engagement on the basis of a strict risk management.\nb) DGSE\nDGSE is the foreign security service and additionally serves as France’s main signals intelligence agency. It sits directly under the Armed Forces Ministry. Until 2014, not much was known publicly by\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nDGSE's activities in the cyber domain. Offensive and espionage operations were deemed to be its responsibilities, but these has been absent from public sight, until forensic analysis¹⁰³ and Snowden-leaks published by Le Monde¹⁰⁴ unveiled a diverse panel of advanced malwares (Casper, Bunny, Babar, Dino) attributed to a French intelligence agency. The leaks seem to have broken an internal taboo. A former DGSE executive, Bernard Barbier, shed some light on such operations shortly after, admitting the agency \"started hacking in 1992\"¹⁰⁵.\nc) DGA\nDGA, the Defence Procurement Agency, has long developed a cybersecurity department, which sits into its \"maîtrise de l'information\" branch. It is tasked with protecting the information and weapon systems of the armed forces, providing technical expertise in threat intelligence, upstream research (also known as discovery stage) and crisis support¹⁰⁶. As part of such responsibilities, it conducts vulnerability research on armed forces' systems¹⁰⁷ and since 2015 organises cyber-wargames¹⁰⁸.\nThe offensive doctrine indicated DGA will adapt its procurement processes to take into account the tempo of operations and nature of these weapons¹⁰⁹. Current processes designed to procure vehicles or submarines, or even major software programs, would be ill-suited. This may hint at the creation of an ad hoc procurement process designed from the ground up to research vulnerabilities and develop exploits and payloads.\n3. Competition and opposition of views\nParochial priorities and perceptions of the respective institutions depend mostly on the structuring of the cyber security and defence apparatus, which core principle is offense-defence separation.\na) Opposition of views between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA\nThe opposition of views or the impact of parochial competition appears most clearly between ANSSI and the armed forces, on two different issues: vulnerability disclosure and end-to-end encryption.\nContrary to the U.S. or, more recently, the U.K., France has no public vulnerability equities process (VEP). Currently, disclosure and sharing between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA is not formalised and happens on a case-by-case basis¹¹⁰. Guillaume Poupard, ANSSI director, communicated briefly about vulnerability research and disclosure at the agency's end-of-year report. In practice, Poupard said, in case of doubt as to the balance of risk, \"the vulnerability goes to the defence\"¹¹¹. However when the\n¹⁰³ Joan Calvet, \"Dino – the Latest Spying Malware from an Allegedly French Espionage Group Analyzed,\" *WeLiveSecurity by ESET* (blog), June 30, 2015, https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/06/30/dino-spying-malware-analyzed/.\n¹⁰⁴ Martin Untersinger and Jacques Follorou, \"La France suspectée de cyberespionnage,\" *Le Monde*, March 21, 2014, https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2014/03/21/la-france-suspectee-de-cyberattaque_4387232_3210.html.\n¹⁰⁵ \"France's Ex-Cyber Spy Chief Speaks Candidly about Hacking Operations,\" *IntelNews.Org* (blog), September 16, 2016, https://intelnews.org/2016/09/16/01-1978/.\n¹⁰⁶ *Défense et Sécurité Nationale* 2013.\n¹⁰⁷ Alexandra Valetta Ardisson and Bastien Lachaud, \"Rapport d'information de Mme Alexandra Valetta Ardisson et M.

Although there is no obvious conflict of views on that topic, the debate on the right risk balancing illustrates well how each agencies' responsibilities and culture influences their stance in critical debates such as this one.\nWe can witness a more obvious conflict of views on the encryption debate. Poupard, circulated within the government in March 2016 a note arguing strongly against \"exceptional access\" legislation, which would allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bypass encryption, either on device or in transit. The Parliament of Australia recently passed such a law, not without public outcry¹¹⁴. In his note, Poupard states:\n“To impose a wide weakening of cryptographic means would affect both digital safety and the freedom of the large majority of law-abiding users, while remaining ineffective against the intended minority target.”\nIt appears that, at the time, DGSE was voicing its concerns against encryption¹¹⁵. In 2018, the head of its technical services, Patrick Pailloux, promoted publicly the idea of in-transit exceptional access, while reaffirming the importance of strong (but not end-to-end by definition) encryption¹¹⁶. It is thus likely that Poupard’s note was a direct rebuke to DGSE’s pressures. In such case, it may be a good example of two principles edited by Allison and Zelkow. First, that where you stand depends on where you sit. Less colloquially known as “the face of the issue differs from seat to seat”¹¹⁷, it explains that, as the head of a defensive agency open to the wider public and private sector, it is expected that its director will oppose the weakening of end-to-end encryption. On the opposite, it is expected that DGSE will seek to extend its interception capabilities, as a signals intelligence agency dedicated to foreign security. Second, this “row” may also be the result of the “51-49 principle”. Even if one isn’t completely convinced by the side of the argument, they must “argue much more confidently than they would if they were detached judges”¹¹⁸ because of parochial competition.\nb) The role of Foreign Affairs and its relationship with other actors.\nThe International Digital Strategy (December 2017) was released only a few months before the Cyber Defence Review (February 2018). Presented as “France’s international strategy”, it could be potentially interpreted as a willingness of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to defend its prerogative in that area. In May 2017, Jean-Yves Le Drian had become Foreign Affairs Minister after almost five years at the Defence Ministry. Although it may have been perceived as such by some in the Armed Forces Ministry¹¹⁹, the international strategy was actually two-years in the making¹²⁰, a long process due in part to its submission to public review. As for the Paris Call, the initiative came from the Cybersecurity and Strategic Affairs division, which then pushed it through to the Minister, who ensured political\nMacron dans les locaux de la DGA-MI à Bruz :pic.twitter.com/elKwQM0k9w,” #WarGames on Twitter (blog), April 15, 2019, https://twitter.com/amaelle_g/status/1117803882032304128.\n¹¹² Guiton.\n¹¹³ Guiton.\n¹¹⁴ Catherine Chapman, “Australian Cybersecurity Industry Reels over Anti-Encryption Law,” The Daily Swig | Web security digest, January 25, 2019, https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/australian-cybersecurity-industry-reels-over-anti-encryption-law.\n¹¹⁵ A ComCyber official, April 18, 2019.\n¹¹⁶ Valéry Marchive, “Le renseignement aime le chiffrement, mais il veut bien des points de clair,” LeMagIT, July 4, 2018, https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252444227/Le-renseignement-aimé-le-chiffrement-mais-il-veut-bien-des-points-de-clair.\n¹¹⁷ Allison and Zelikow, Essence of Decision.

Regarding the offensive military doctrine, the Ministry was informed ahead of time and consulted on international law matters¹²².\n***\nWhile ANSSI enjoys a particular status that makes it the prime cyber security and defence institution, SGDSN plays an important political role while ComCyber, DGSE and DGA have their specific sets of goals and capabilities. Overall, their relations is characterised by subsidiarity and complementarity.\n¹²¹ A Foreign Affairs official involved in the Paris Call.\n¹²² A Foreign Affairs official involved in the Paris Call.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# Chapter III - Individuals and processes\nIn this short chapter, we attempt a review of key individuals and processes in decision-making. It is a very tentative chapter, because of time and interview constraints. To complete the analysis, more interviews should be conducted at higher political levels.\n## 1) Key individuals in decision and action, and factors influencing their perceptions, preferences and stands\nDuring its annual press conference, ANSSI director stated, on the topic of vulnerabilities disclosure, that in a structure that separates offence and defence, \"the level of where both meet [in the policy-making tree] is very high. It means that sometimes, we must mobilise the highest authorities on these issues\"¹²³.\nBastien Irondelle, in its seminal work on the decision-making process behind the end of French military conscription in 1996, highlighted the everlasting importance of the President.¹²⁴ He detailed how the political impetus Jacques Chirac gave to this major policy decision, in particular during the Defence Councils, made the reform happen¹²⁵. We have demonstrated so far that in the case at hand, French cyber security and defence, the evolution has been gradual, taking place over a decade. However, the same key individuals and processes remain.\nIn practice, the range of meaningful decision-making in cyber security and defence starts at ministerial cabinets, up to the Prime Minister and the President¹²⁶. Major crisis and policy decisions are taken at the presidential level, during Defence Councils.¹²⁷ ANSSI is represented by the SGDSN, ComCyber by the Joint Chief of Staff,¹²⁸ who remains responsible for the military action chain¹²⁹.\nThe Cyber Club identified by Desforges still exists today and brings together the directors of ANSSI, DGA, ComCyber and the technical departments of both domestic and foreign intelligence agencies (DGSI, DGSE)¹³⁰.\nAnother noteworthy trend is the overwhelming majority of military profiles among ANSSI executives. Out of the seven directors and deputy-directors, five have spent most of their careers in the armed forces¹³¹. Such numbers however hide some atypical career paths: the deputy director is a military engineer with a doctorate in public law and an MBA.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n¹²³ Guiton, \"[Thread] [Team #Wargames] Comment est gérée la question des vulnérabilités dites 'zero-day' en France, où on sépare les missions d'attaque et de défense ?

Because of the number of involved actors and their overlap in each mission, the Strategy established four “operational chains” to centralize and streamline public action in the field. They are referred to as the protection, intelligence, judicial investigations and military-action chains. While it is still unclear how these chains work in practice, we were able to collect more information on the committees and groups that coordinate cyber security and defence policy, in theory and in practice.\n### a) Recently formalised processes\nThe Cyber Strategy created two new committees: An Executive Committee, under the President’s Office, and a Steering Committee, under the SGDSN. Political decisions and policy orientations related to cyberdefence are taken during meetings of the National Security and Defence Council. The Executive Committee is tasked with high-level implementation of the Council’s decisions.\nThe Steering Committee’s responsibility is to report on the Strategy’s implementation to the Prime Minister and to prepare the meetings of the Executive Committee. It meets every semester. SGDSN transmits the impetus of political leadership, sets the agenda and ensures the application of the previously decided measures. Ministries and agencies are free to bring forward suggestions.\nAdditionally, a Cyber Crisis Coordination Centre “supervises cyberdefence” and informs decision-makers. The Centre consists of different groups that act at various timelines, even though their names suggest a short-term crisis perimeter. While the Technical Group acts on short-term incidents, Strategy is a “sub-political” group that acts on mid-term strategy to prepare steering committee meetings. It is open to other ministries, of which most individuals present are administration directors (directeurs d’administration centrale). They offer regular situation reports to the Prime Minister and the President, and suggests policy options. They meet monthly. The Technico-Operational Group (TechOps), on the other hand, is a restricted group with few institutions represented. Its main purpose is to share specific threat intelligence, and it thus open to only a handful of intelligence agencies.\n### b) Importance of informal coordination processes\nTechOps is only very briefly described in official documents. However it reminds of the “Cyber Club” Alix Desforges described in her thesis. This informal grouping of agency heads took another dimension with the writing process of the Cyber Strategy. According to an official, the writing\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nprocess itself greatly enhanced communication between relevant stakeholders. In other words, the process of creating processes, enhanced communication and coordination between actors. At its creation, TechOps the people and institutions involved warmly welcomed it, and it quickly became indispensable$^{144}$. Some degree of informality remains today. In addition to what we have already described, informal ad-hoc meetings keep happening to deal with specific issues.\n***\nWhen it comes to formal processes, the highest political authorities remain in charge of major policy-decisions. Informal meetings have lead to the formalisation of intelligence sharing and mid to low level policy coordination.\n*\n*\n# Conclusion\nFrom its sovereign principles to the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence institutions, France revendicates an atypical model. At the top, strategic autonomy infuses major political, financial and policy decisions. Domestically, although officials strongly reaffirm the separation of offence and defence activities, in practice such separation can be described as institutional at best, due to the fluidity of human resources between agencies. This separation has nonetheless a genuine impact on policy-making and public debates: differences in parochial priorities and organisational cultures between ANSSI and the armed forces create conflicting views on tough topics such as end-to-end encryption or vulnerability disclosure. Finally, while the executive remains key in decision-making, informal processes and meta-processes have been instrumental in the development of an efficient state cyber security and defence community. To complete and build-up on this exploratory paper, further research on how such processes work out in practice could be conducted.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n# GLOSSARY (non-exhaustive)\n807 CTRS: 807th Transmission Company.

France is no exception. We have seen in recent months a revival of its efforts to secure its citizens and interests in cyber space. French President Emmanuel Macron presented in late 2018 the\"Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace\", a package of norms of good behaviour bringing together states, private corporations and the civil society¹. All the while, in the past two years, the government designed its very first Cyber Defence Strategy² and the Armed Forces unveiled some elements of their offensive and defensive cyber operations³. How can we make sense of it all?\nWe frame the current picture by following Allison and Zelikow's three conceptual models of decision-making: Rational actor, organisational behaviour, and government politics⁴. In accordance with each model, we seek to answer the following questions, respectively: R1: What are the underlying principles, goals and objectives of French national defence and security, in general terms and in the cyber domain?\nR2: What are the institutions involved in cyber security and defence, their perimeters of action and organisational culture?\nR3: What are the processes and individuals involved in cyber security and defence policy-making at the politico-strategic level?\nTo do so we combine an extensive review of the literature with a series of interviews with senior French officials from ministries, as well as national agencies and other specialised institutions.\n# Objectives and limitations The objective of this paper is three-fold: describing, explaining and, by extension, predicting. First, we hope to provide a better understanding of the current French cyber security and defence policy picture its founding political and doctrinal principles. Second, by applying Allison and Zelikow's models to this picture, we seek to explain how policy-making in this area happens in practice. This approach diverges slightly from the models' original purpose, which is to analyse a specific case-study and its cluster of decisions (\"Why did the Soviets smuggle nuclear missiles into Cuba?\"\"Why did the US respond by imposing a naval blockade?\"). This paper does not ambition to explain why France launched the Paris Call or why it published parts of the armed forces' offensive cyber operations doctrine. Scholars⁵ and journalists⁶ have already started answering them. Rather, it seeks to provide a toolkit so that scholars, practitioners or journalists can design more accurate hypotheses about why future decision X or Y was taken in that domain. There is no doubt this toolkit will be incomplete and Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338 SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3) imperfect. Not all policy documents are public, some processes and institutions are still recent, and we lack the ability to stand back so that we can grasp how some processes work-out in practice. Another obstacle is that these principles, policies, doctrines, processes and institutions live through the minds and acts of leaders, policy-makers and practitioners, whom the author has not been able to all interview. In particular, the author was unable to meet officials from SGDSN itself, the Élysée Palace and Prime Minister's Office. This is where the work of Bastien Irondelle becomes key⁷. The third -indirect- objective of this paper, is prediction. As Allison and Zelikow highlight, it is “the logical flipside of explanations”⁸. If we understand more accurately the processes and factors that lead to decisions, we can extrapolate about future events. The predictive power of the model will however be highly dependent on the strength of its explanatory qualities.\n## Acknowledgement and appreciation The author is grateful to IRSEM for hosting him and the warm welcome.

This is the rational actor model. In our case, France is the identified state. More often than not, political cycles lead to new policies and strategies. When relevant, the state thus becomes personified, in relation to a specific presidency. In this model we adopt a bounded rationality viewpoint, whereas we accept that “values, beliefs and stereotypes” play a role in the actors’ rationality⁹.\n## 1. Political concepts, principles and goals In this first part we analyse France’s core political concepts of sovereignty and strategic autonomy, the rationale behind the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence apparatus, and the one behind its communication and attribution stance.\n### a. France’s sovereignty, national and European strategic autonomy France has a conceptualisation of sovereignty that makes it stand out of its peers. Baezner and Robin found in their comparative analysis that “France was unique among the states examined in that it used the word “sovereignty” more frequently and in different contexts”¹⁰. Sovereignty, in its French understanding, cannot be restrained to hard sovereignty, i.e. the protection of its citizens, borders and other existential interests¹¹. French sovereignty is a wide spectrum that implies strategic autonomy. The 2017 Strategic Review defines strategic autonomy as a two pillar concept entailing 1) a high level of industrial and technological autonomy, and 2) an operational autonomy¹². On technological autonomy, the Ministry of the Armed Forces has recently ramped up its strategy, with the creation of a dedicated investment fund, DefInvest¹³. Its first investments were made in microprocessors and high precision optics manufacturers. Operational autonomy means the ability to reach an informed decision and to take action, in particular in the context of political or military crises. The French military operation in Mali, for instance, is a good illustration of operational autonomy: the ability to engage in full scope – low to high intensity– operations, with allies or on its own if necessary.\nFrench strategic autonomy can be best described as neo-Gaullist. It is characterised by a strong sense of national independence but recognises the need for a powerful political Europe¹⁴. Its historical drivers and roots come indeed from a traditional Gaullist doctrine of national autonomy, which is more self-reliant. The perceived need for self-reliance played a major role in driving De Gaulle to transform France into a nuclear power and to leave NATO integrated command in 1966. Some key historical events such as the 1940 surrender, the intelligence frustrations of the 1992 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq war further fuelled perceptions that France needed both a credible nuclear arsenal, and autonomous intelligence capabilities¹⁵.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338 --- ⁹ Allison and Zelikow. P.20.\n¹⁰ Marie Baezner and Patrice Robin, “Trend Analysis: Cyber Sovereignty” (Zurich: Center for Security Studies (CSS), ETH Zürich, 2018).\n¹¹ Existential interests are not clearly defined so that there remains strategic uncertainty, in the context of France’s nuclear deterrence. See para. 159 of the 2017 Strategic Review.\n¹² See Para. 157. “Revue stratégique de défense et de sécurité nationale,” La Documentation Française (Paris: Présidence de la République, October 2017), http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/rapports-publics/174000744/index.shtml.\n¹³ “Le Ministère Des Armées et Bpifrance Lancent Definvest,” BPI France, November 17, 2017, https://presse.bpifrance.fr/le-ministere-des-armees-et-bpifrance-lancent-definvest/.\n¹⁴ Serge Berstein, *Histoire Du Gaullisme* (Paris: Perrin, 2001).\n¹⁵ The Military Intelligence Agency was created in the aftermath of the Gulf War. Claude Faure, “Bref historique des services de renseignement et de sécurité français contemporains,” *Revue historique des armées*, no. 247 (June 15, 2007): 70–81.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3) This spirit of autonomy remains today, but with a wider pragmatic recognition of the need for cooperation and integration. France re-joined NATO command in 2009 for mainly pragmatism and influence reasons¹⁶. However the French nuclear arsenal remains outside of NATO command and its intelligence apparatus outside of the 5-Eyes community. France' strategic autonomy is also reliant on a European strategic autonomy, which it seeks to develop. The Hubert Védrine report recommended that the country's return into NATO command is accompanied by a strengthening of European defence integration and cooperation, especially in the R&amp;D of technological and industrial capacities¹⁷. It encourages the development of mutual interdependence with entities who share critical interests, particularly within the EU. This policy shift initiated in 1992 with the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy was confirmed in the 2008 White Paper, placing the EU as\"a central tenet of [France's] security policy\"¹⁸. This central place was reaffirmed ever since, including in the last cyber strategy document¹⁹.\nb) Domestic apparatus: Offense / defence separation Domestically, the French approach contrasts with that embraced by the United States or the United Kingdom. Most notably, France assumes a clear separation between offensive and defensive cyber operations. This means that, contrary to the U.S.' National Security Agency (NSA) or the U.K.'s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), France's leading agency for cybersecurity is exclusively dedicated to defensive operations and not part of the intelligence community. This is a defining element of the Cyber Strategy Review and infuses the whole structure of French cyberdefence. The rationale is that having a distinct defensive agency separate from offense-oriented military intelligence agencies\"facilitates the acceptance of state intervention [...] whether in public administration or the economic sphere\"²⁰.\nc) A counter-threat model based on direct communication rather than public attribution Peculiarities of the French model are not limited to its conceptualisation of sovereignty. On the diplomatic stage, France has also adopted a different stance than most of its counterparts²¹. A number of NATO allies are increasingly inclined to\"name and shame\"states involved in cyber attacks. One telling example can be found in October 2018, when the U.S., U.K., Canada and the Netherlands denounced Russian attempts at disrupting the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons²². Paris expressed its solidarity but fell short of blaming Moscow²³. Already in 2015, when what then seemed to be ISIS took down TV5Monde in a major hack, no official attribution was made. ANSSI, the national cybersecurity agency, however briefed four dozen media outlets with details of its forensic investigation and indicators of compromise. These details were then analysed by private security firms which pointed the finger at persistent threat actor (APT) ²⁸²⁴. Additionally, TV5Monde director Yves Bigot reported in L'Express\"France favours red phones over the megaphone.\"Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338 SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3) that ANSSI personnel suggested it was a false-flag (\"un leurre\")²⁵. More recently, in the case of the #MacronLeaks, France did not issue any kind of attribution either. G. Poupard, head of ANSSI, refused to do so arguing\"the attack was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone\"²⁶. More recently, the Secretary General for Defence and National Security clarified France's official policy: attribution can only be performed on the basis of elements collected or verified by French services, typically ANSSI and DGSE²⁷.\nThis does not mean that it does not have attribution capabilities. As we will see in Chapter II, attributing cyber-attacks is one of the main missions of the French cyberdefence apparatus. But even when it knows, France prefers forthright bilateral dialogues with Russia and other cyber powers such as the U.S., China, India, Brazil and Japan²⁸. It appears it even opened a deconfliction cell with the Russian Security Council on cyber matters²⁹. Only in last resort will France take part in public name and shame³⁰. In other words, it favours red phones over the megaphone.\nThere is only one recorded instance of public attribution, and it is indirect. At the unveiling of the offensive cyber doctrine, Minister Parly revealed that an APT targeted email accounts of high-ranking officials between 2017 and 2018, with the objective of uncovering the navy's oil supply chain³¹. Though the Minister stopped short of explicitly recognizing the group's affiliation with the Russian Federation, she indirectly attributed the attacker's mode of operation to a specific group known as Turla.\nUnder Egloff's definition, France engages in two attribution processes³². First a process of sense-making attribution, for the benefit of its own factual understanding, that it rarely communicates publicly. Second, in a meaning-making process, with regards to its adversaries. But again, it does so rather privately than publicly. Overall, French strategy with attribution seem to fit a counter-threat model³³.\nIn this first part, we have detailed how France conceives its sovereignty and what it means by strategic autonomy. We have also sought to explain its rationale behind the offence / defence separation and to describe its policy of non-public attribution.\n## 2. The evolution and granularization of objectives of French cyber security and defence In this second part we review the cyber security and defence objectives produced by political and military authorities, from 2011 to 2019. We identify three main themes: active discouragement, risk limitation and direct communication.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338 SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3) The Defence and National Security White Paper 2008 is the first of its kind to mention Internet-related threats³⁴ and leads to the creation of ANSSI. The Agency releases in 2011 the “National Strategy for the Defence and Security of Information Systems”. It’s four goals are: - For France to become a top-tier cyber power, - To guarantee freedom of decision through confidentiality of state secrets, - To reinforce the security of critical infrastructures, - To ensure cybersecurity to public and private actors alike.\nThe second version of the Strategy revolved around 1) state secrets and critical infrastructures, 2) digital privacy and cybercrime, 3) public sensitisation and training, 4) business and export strategies, and 5) Europe, digital sovereignty and norms³⁵.\nFollowing the election of Emmanuel Macron to the Presidency, the President requests officially tasks the Armed Forces Ministry to create a panel of experts with a view to write a new defence white paper. The Strategic Review for Defence and National Security, as it is then known, is released in 2017. It promotes digital sovereignty and cybersecurity to top priorities of national defence³⁶.\nIn February 2018, the country’s first National Strategy for Cyber Defence clarified both the organization and integration of cyber operations among all government entities³⁷ as well as the national and international legal framework surrounding their use³⁸. It sets-out goals and processes as part of a “robust national cyber security and defence apparatus”³⁹.\nThe seven principles underpinning the Strategy are: To achieve said goals, the Strategy sets-out a number of policy-making and coordination processes (see Chapter III). In practice, three main themes appear: Active discouragement, risk limitation and multilateralism.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338 ³⁴ Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n³⁵ Services du Premier Ministre, “Stratégie Nationale Pour La Sécurité Du Numérique” (Paris, October 16, 2015), https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/la-strategie-nationale-pour-la-securite-du-numerique-une-reponse-aux-nouveaux-enjeux-des-usages-numeriques/.\n³⁶ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n³⁷ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n³⁸ Francois Delerue and Aude Gery, “France’s Cyberdefense Strategic Review and International Law,” Lawfare, March 23, 2018, https://www.lawfareblog.com/frances-cyberdefense-strategic-review-and-international-law.\n³⁹ In French as « Dispositif national de protection et de défense informatique robuste ». “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n⁴⁰ France reserves its concept of deterrence (dissuasion) to the nuclear domain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3) a) Active discouragement France has adopted a posture of active discouragement against advanced threats. It relies on direct communication with the adversary, as we have detailed earlier, and on an increasingly explicit declaratory strategy.\nIn January 2019 Minister Florence Parly unveiled the offensive and defensive cyber operations doctrines of the armed forces. The announcement is the latest and strongest step taken by the country as part of its declaratory strategy⁴¹. In response to cyber and other threats, France is “not afraid” of using cyber weapons⁴². The country did not wait until then to perform offensive operations or even to publicly admit doing so. Such operations were first mentioned in the 2008 White Paper⁴³ and then again with more details in 2013. The case for proportional reprisals in response to a major attack was also made clearly by then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian: “In times of war, cyber weapons may be the response, or part of our response, to an armed attack [aggression armée], being of a cyber nature or otherwise”⁴⁴.\nb) Risk limitation and infrastructure sanctuarisation Risks that are inherent to cyberspace and operations are a recurrent topic in policy documents.\nThe offensive doctrine places great emphasis on the consideration and mitigation of political, legal and military risks. It mandates a risk balancing exercise in the preparation and conduct of offensive operations: against the risk of escalation in an asymmetric environment, or against the risk of collateral or indirect damage on civilian infrastructures. This balancing exercise – and the need not to reveal too much details – may be the reason the doctrine does not clearly mention⁴⁵ physical destruction of information systems.\nInternationally, France aims to promote existing institutional mechanisms to “limit hacking and destabilising activities” in cyberspace, notably through an international initiative, the “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace”⁴⁶, unveiled in November 2018.\nIn terms of international law, the document encourages more extensive and better coordinated regulation of cyberspace in the spirit of founding principles of the U.N. Charter, notably the maintenance of international peace and security. It recognizes not only the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyberspace, but of international human rights and customary international law more broadly as well. It also advocates for the development of new ways to prevent intellectual property theft, i.e. industrial espionage.\nAnother key theme of the document is the importance of protecting individuals and critical infrastructures from harm. The document presses to safeguard the “public core of the Internet” from hostile actors. This is a clear demonstration of support for a package of norms unveiled by the Global Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338 SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3) Commission for the Stability of Cyberspace on Nov. 8 in Singapore⁴⁷. Reflecting the view of most states on the matter, the Call promotes the exclusive role of sovereign states in hostile acts in cyberspace. It condemns corporate hack-back and other offensive operations from non-state actors. It also appeals for measures preventing interference with elections, another contemporary hot topic.\nClearly absent in the text are issues of espionage and state-lead low-intensity offensive operations. The need to compromise and willingness to gather support across states with various political mindsets means offensive cyber operations was probably out of scope of the Call from its inception.\nc) Multilateralism and stakeholderism On the international stage, one of France's goals relates to the diplomatic process itself. The country seeks to maintain a form of inclusive multilateralism⁴⁸, and in parallel to open-up debates on cyberspace governance to non-state actors.\nIts International Digital Strategy puts great emphasis into promoting an\"open, diverse and trusted\"cyberspace in which it envisions the European Union as a key player⁴⁹. The Strategy itself was subject to public consultations.\nThe Paris Call comes in the wake of the strategy. In addition to its normative nature we detailed earlier, to engage industries and civil society, the document also promotes everyday good practices (\"cyber hygiene\") and the implementation of\"security by design\"in products and services. It is not the first initiative of its kind. In April 2018, Microsoft launched its\"Digital Peace\"campaign⁵⁰ along with a\"Cybersecurity Tech Accord\"⁵¹ aimed at getting the internet and the technology industry to better protect their customers' privacy and security against cyberattacks. Similarly, Siemens unveiled in May 2018 a\"Charter of Trust\"that seeks to develop adherence to security principles and processes, with the aim of developing a\"global standard\"for cybersecurity⁵².\nUntil those recent developments, norm-building initiatives were the prerogative of states. In 2015, the U.N.'s Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recognized that international humanitarian law applied to cyberspace⁵³, though it then deadlocked when at the end of 2017. Although a new process was put in place for 2019 up to 2021, the two blocs—one group led by the United States and another by China and Russia—are unlikely to solve the stalemate.\nApproaching the issue from various stakeholders' perspectives, the Paris Call is an attempt to move away from this international deadlock. Macron, at its unveiling at UNESCO, made the case for rebuffing what he described as a binary choice between\"a Californian Internet and a Chinese Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338 SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3) Internet\"54. So far, he argued, these two opposite narratives have monopolized the debate and imposed two radically different yet unsatisfactory alternatives: either a model of mere technical governance led by Silicon Valley, or an overwhelming regulation led by authoritarian regimes. While the former does not address issues of privacy and malicious actors, the latter cracks down on human rights and could lead to a\"balkanisation\"of internet and of wider cyberspace55.\nAccording to Le Monde, Microsoft first approached the French government to obtain its support for the Tech Accord56. However, the country found the Accord too narrow and industry-oriented. Recognizing a trend of norms fragmentation coupled with diplomatic deadlocks, France saw an opportunity to take the lead on governance. But this was only possible if the call achieved two things: First, it needed to widen the scope of existing sector-specific initiatives (Tech Accord, GGE, For The Web) into meaningful norms all actors could get behind. Second, it needed to gather and federate existing initiatives, otherwise it would just contribute to the further fragmentation of norms. So far the call seems to have mostly succeeded, with a notable caveat among state signatories.\nAmong the 64 state signatories, European countries are the most heavily present. However, almost every continent is represented: among them we find Qatar, South Korea, Mexico, Japan, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Senegal and New-Zealand. Critically, on release day, key potential signatories such as India or Brazil are not on the list. The absence of such countries may become problematic. While the U.S. (at least for now), China and Russia are unlikely to join, the Call will rely on support from States like India and Brazil in order to gain traction within international institutions, primarily the United Nations. Macron, aware of this challenge, suggested that the Internet Governance Forum—a U.N. event—become responsible for monitoring the effective implementation of the call and be moved under the direct supervision of the U.N. Secretary General57.\nThe document has already drawn support from influential non-governmental groups. The World Leadership Alliance, Chatham House, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Internet Society have committed to its principles. Technical governance bodies, such as the Number Resource Organization and the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre—the region's internet registry—expressed interest too. Powerful business lobbies are another prominent group of signatories, including notably, Indian business guilds such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Internet and Mobile Association of India and the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum. In total, as many as 300 universities, NGOs and professional associations have committed to the call.\nIn the industrial landscape, France succeeded in attracting both major initiatives: The Tech Accord and the Charter of Trust represent a significant share of the private-sector signatories, as together they represent 85 powerful corporations such as Airbus, Cisco and Facebook. But the call is not a mere shell for existing groups. Notable newcomers include Google, Samsung Electronics, Intel Corporation, Kaspersky Lab, Thales and many other companies, ranging from the banking and insurance industries, to law, commerce and defence.\nInitiatives to create norms in cyberspace are multiplying. But more than anything else, these initiatives seem to have fragmented political will and have so far failed to gather support across the board. Emmanuel Macron hopes the Paris Call will bring fresh momentum to the issue by mounting support from influential parties, notably Silicon Valley's top companies and emerging powers. The Call is Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nrestrained in scope, avoiding the most sensitive activities such as espionage and offensive operations, but this restraint makes it more likely to receive support across a wider group of stakeholders. It is far from a silver bullet; rather it offers a fresh starting point and framework for further negotiations on values and norms of behaviour in cyberspace.\nFigure 1 - The pyramid of means (centre) and their respective objectives (right).\nOverall, the objectives of French cyber security and defence are three-fold: Actively discourage adversaries through a declaratory strategy that includes offensive operations, limit the escalation potential of crises by sanctuarising core infrastructures, and promote a third way model to cyberspace governance.\n## 2. Threat perception\nA state's perception of threats is based on a variety of factors: strategic goals, history and precedent, one's perception of its own weaknesses and dependencies$^{58}$. It is a key concept within rational models such as the one Allison and Zelikow describe. While France approached cybersecurity issues from a dominantly technical perspective at its beginnings, Desforges argues, it shifted towards a model that goes beyond security and defence issues$^{59}$. The Snowden leaks, the rise of jihadist propaganda and the increasingly geopolitical impact of major attacks pushed France to consider broader societal challenges and actors in defining its strategies and policies.\n$^{58}$ Raymond Cohen, “Threat Perception in International Crisis,” *Political Science Quarterly* 93, no. 1 (1978): 93, https://doi.org/10/d95kwg.\n$^{59}$ Alix Desforges, “Approche Géopolitique Du Cyberespace, Enjeux Pour La Défense et La Sécurité Nationale, l’exemple de La France” (Université Paris 8 - Vincennes / Saint-Denis, 2018).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\na) Threat realisation centred around technology and intelligence (2008-2013)\nThe 2008 White Paper$^{(a)}$ mentions Internet in its first chapter, but first as an example of a positive trend, highlighting the rise in connectedness of people around the world. The other side of the coin, it later states, is the challenge of keeping up with the high-paced spread of information and ideas, in other words information control and propaganda. The Paper also dedicates a full-page box to serious cyberattacks detailing the full CIA spectrum. While it does not mention the attacks on Estonia, the Paper foresees such attacks will be multiplying in the following 15 years and considers the risk of a large-scale attack on its critical infrastructures a major threat. It mentions \"cyberwar\" as one of the scenarios which could involve the Atlantic Alliance. In consequence, the Paper mandates 1) a switch from a passive to active defence model, 2) the development of offensive cyber capabilities, strategy and doctrine all focusing on adversarial military systems.\nIt is the very first time France acknowledges cyber threats and decides to act on them in a national public policy document. The Paper also creates a new strategic role for the armed forces known as \"knowledge and anticipation\".\nFigure 2\nStrategic and prospective policy documents in context (yellow, red and green). They are part of complex financial and procurement cycles and reflect well French threat perceptions.\nSources: DGA, CICDE, NATO, EDA. Graph design and editing: by the author. TRL: Technology Readiness Level.\nFive years after the wake-up call of the 2008 White Paper, its successor recognises that the fast-paced evolution of threats and capabilities require to go one \"step further\" in cyberdefence$^{(c)}$. It ambitions to dedicate more human and financial resources to intelligence and operational capabilities, mandates the creation of a cyber reserve force and calls for a broad societal effort from international cooperation to training and public awareness.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nb) Broadening to societal challenges and capabilities build-up (2013-2015)\nThe 2013 White Paper mandated the creation of a national doctrine for major cyber threats response: a coordinated defensive posture mixed with a graduated response from diplomatic, judicial and law enforcement powers to military means when vital interests are at stake. The strategic mission “knowledge and anticipation”, created in 2008, now includes information control in its widest sense (maîtrise de l’information), from trends in cryptography to intelligence gathering and critical infrastructure security. A joint doctrine puts in place a strategic anticipation group which is tasked with mid-term (one to two years) prospective on operational preparedness, military intelligence and international relations[62]. Most critically, the Paper contains France’s official recognition of cyberspace as an operational domain by stating that “cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own”. This is two years after the United States[63] and three years before NATO[64].\n## “Cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own.”\nThe ensuing pluriannual defence finance law  set-out an operational cyberdefence chain integrated to conventional military operations. It reiterated the need for both defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, granting overall 1 billion EUR to cyberdefence.\nIn 2015, the Digital Security Strategy stated that a serious threat (“atteinte significative”) to French citizens data could constitute a national security matter, notably in the context of espionage, propaganda or political destabilisation[65]. The complete shutdown of news channel TV5 Monde that year represented a moment of reckoning for the country’s security agencies, while the leaking of documents stolen from the Macron campaign on the eve of the 2017 election sounded alarm bells at the possibility of foreign meddling in domestic politics, echoing the Clinton campaign.\nc) Institutional and doctrinal military structuring (2017-2019)\nThe 2017 Review emphasises the increasing role of Internet and digital giants (GAFAM, Baidu) on geopolitics and sovereignty, as well as on “strategic intimidation” facilitated by the combination of economic, military and informational pressures such as territorial fait-accompli and mass social network trolling. It also mentions the risk of escalation in cyber and space conflicts, not the least because of first strike temptations. Currently, ANSSI states “destabilisation, espionage and sabotage” as the primary threats it faces[66].\nThe Cyberdefence Review dedicates a significant part (32 pages) to the evolution of the threat landscape. It relies on the “new normal” scenario to highlight the risks brought by quantum\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\ncomputers, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. It concludes that their level of security will be determining factors for societal safety⁶⁸.\nThe next LPM (2019-2025) reflects this evolution of French threat perception and the impetus granted to the “knowledge and anticipation” mission of the armed forces. The defence budget for 2019 amounts to 35,9 billion EUR, or 1.82% of GDP, pensions excluded⁶⁹. It is planned to increase over the next four years, reaching 44 billion EUR and 2% of GDP in 2023⁷⁰. In 2019, intelligence and cyberdefence constitute already 73% of the Ministry’s hiring effort (+450 personnel in total)⁷¹. By 2025, the armed forces are expected to count on 4000 so-called cyber-combatants, which represent an increase of 25% over six years⁷². Cyberdefence will receive over this period a budget of 1.6 billion Euros, excluding payroll⁷³.\n***\nOver the past decade, France went through three main major evolution stages in its cyber security and defence structuring: threat realisation (2008-2011), capabilities build-up (2013-2015) and an institutional and doctrinal military structuring accompanied by a strong diplomatic impetus (2017-2019). The recently released offensive doctrine is the culmination of this deep transformation. It particularly represents a turning point for the armed forces, breaking offensive operations from their intelligence silo. The wording of the document and of the accompanying speech by Minister Parly also represents a less veiled signal to Russia, a message France had previously been reluctant to send publicly. The Paris Call, in parallel, is an unprecedented attempt at bringing states, major corporations and the civil society together around key values and principles.\n&gt; “France aims to promote international rules and stability [...] to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks [...] to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion.”\nOverall, France aims to promote international rules and stability in the cyber domain to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks room to manoeuvre to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion. Such balance is and will remain delicate, which only reinforces the need for a better understanding of actors’ rationales and policy coordination.\n# Chapter II – Relevant organisations, their goals and capabilities\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n⁶⁸ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.” P.31.\n⁶⁹ Ministère des Armées, “Communiqué - Budget 2019 : LPM année 1,” September 25, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/communaute-defense/communique-du-ministere-des-armees_-budget-2019-lpm-annee-1.\n⁷⁰ Ministère des Armées.\n⁷¹ Ministère des Armées.\n⁷² Ministère des Armées, “Guide Explicitatif: Les Réserves Cyber,” November 15, 2016, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/491674/7859279/file/20161115_EMACYBER_Guide_explicitatif.pdf.\n⁷³ Ministère des Armées, “Projet de Loi Relatif à La Programmation Militaire Pour Les Années 2019 à 2025 et Portant Diverses Dispositions Intéressant La Défense,” February 6, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/523150/8769279/file/LPM%202019-2025%20-%20Rapport%20annexe.pdf.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFollowing the organisational behaviour model of Allison and Zelikow, we now turn to the main institutional players in cyber security and defence. As we will see, the offence / defence separation principle impact deeply the institutions goals, capabilities and culture.\n\na) Status, history and relationship with SGDSN\nIn response to the 2008 White Paper, the National Cyber Security Agency, abbreviated in French as ANSSI, was established a year later under the Prime Minister's General Secretary for Defence and National Security (SGDSN). It is a service that exercises national authority on the security of information systems⁷⁴.\nWhile SGDSN is in charge of security issues at large, ANSSI deals with digital affairs widely. It has a specific focus on cybersecurity, but in its widest sense: ANSSI supports the private sector, helps draft France foreign policy on digital issues and works on societal resilience. For instance, its Cyber Anticipation Cell is currently tasked with securing the Paris Olympics 2024⁷⁵. Acting as a strategy, policy and plans cell (J5, in military jargon), its main responsibilities is to advise decision-makers. This difference of scope between ANSSI and SGDSN explains why the Agency reports to the Secretary-General directly (the person), and not the Secretariat-General (as in, the institution)⁷⁶.\nWhy is not ANSSI directly attached to the Prime Minister then? Because belonging to SGDSN provides the Agency with institutional protection against potentially hindering senior civil servants in higher spheres of the government⁷⁷. Indeed, SGDSN reports to the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General is a permanent member of the presidential Defence Councils.\nIts predecessor, the Central Directory for Information Systems Security (DCSSI) was created in 2001 also under the SGDSN, and was itself the successor to the Central Service for Information Systems Security, which existed since 1986. Despite its new name and national authority status, ANSSI has thus deep historical roots.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n⁷⁴ “Décret N° 2009-834 Du 7 Juillet 2009 Portant Création d’un Service à Compétence Nationale Dénommé « Agence Nationale de La Sécurité Des Systèmes d’information »,” 2009-834 § (2009).\n⁷⁵ Emmanuel Germain, ANSSI Deputy Director, Paris, June 27, 2019.\n⁷⁶ Germain.\n⁷⁷ Germain.\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFigure 3 - The missions and actors of French cyberdefence .\nb) Responsibilities\nANSSI has responsibility for coordination of the state's cyber security, hosts the national Computer Emergency Response Team and acts as a regulatory body for the public and private sector alike, primarily for critical infrastructure operators. It plays an unequal role in all six missions of French cyber defence as described in the 2018 Cyber Defence Strategy: cyber threat prevention, anticipation, protection, detection, attribution and reaction. The latter entails technical remediation as well as legal and military action. Alix Desforges78 clarified some of the responsibility sharing that the Cyber Defence Strategy sets-out. While prevention is a cross-government and multistakeholder assignment (ministries, local security representatives, chambers of commerce), anticipation is in essence a threat intelligence task fulfilled by ANSSI and intelligence agencies. Protection (defensive cyber operations and measures) and detection remain the responsibility of ANSSI and its subsidiaries, especially when it comes to private critical infrastructure operators. Attribution of attacks is a joint ANSSI and intelligence services task, while reaction (remediation) is another mission that benefits from subsidiarity.\nThe recognition of cyberspace as a domain of conflict in the 2013 White Paper comes with a new finance law. The 2014-2019 LPM contained two key measures to widen the capabilities of ANSSI. First, it created heavy regulatory obligations on critical infrastructure operators, public and private alike, in terms of their network and industrial control system security, threat detection capabilities and penetration testing, which ANSSI can now perform79. In light of such new powers, it also granted ANSSI with derogations80 with regards to the French Computer Misuse Act81. According to its Deputy Director, ANSSI deals with around 20 attacks from APTs every year82; and these are only those that are detected.\nc) People, identity and organisational culture\nANSSI brings together experts, practitioners and strategists in seven different laboratories and departments. Its two most prominent organisational traits are its exclusive defensive purpose, and its start-up spirit.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nFirst, as we described earlier, ANSSI's identity relies mostly on its exclusive defensive purpose. This is the foundation of the French model. Its Director Guillaume Poupard regularly insists on this feature, which seems to infuse very deeply into its operations. Tools that could be dual-use (i.e. for both defensive and offensive purposes) are separately developed at both DGSE (for offense) and ANSSI (for defence), even if it duplicates the effort[83]. However, because of the high pressure on its human resources, DGSE and ANSSI are pooling and sharing their people and increasingly\n# Of a defensive culture by nature and legal status, [ANSSI] is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need.\nsharing intelligence[84]. The separation between offense and defence is thus institutional and not absolute. Second, the Agency enjoys describing itself as a start-up, at least in its spirit[85]. This tag however hides large disparities in its workforce: 80% are temporary staff, with a mean age of 30 years old[86]. The remaining 20% are the managers, mostly military or civilian engineers[87]. Overall, the mean age is of 34 years[88].\nOf a defensive culture by nature and legal status, it is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need. Although its nature and role is less ambiguous than its Anglo-Saxon peers (GCHQ, NSA) its responsibilities make its activities deeply intertwined with those of intelligence agencies, primarily DGSE.\n## 2. Armed Forces and the intelligence community\nThe armed forces play a role in all six cyber security and defence missions we highlighted just below. While they are in charge of defending only their own systems, they have heightened responsibilities with regards to anticipation, detection, attribution and reaction. But each organisation has specific tasks and roles.\n### a) Organisation of military cyber operations\nThe armed forces learned to perform cyber operations \"as they went\", developing capabilities and skills as they needed[89]. The 2008 White Paper however was a major doctrinal disruption[90], as well as a wake-up call in the aftermath of the Estonian attacks. In addition to the following White Paper and LPM, the then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian launched in 2014 the Cyber Defence Pact. This additional policy document set-out the overall structuring of military cyber defence through six pillars:\n- Hardening the security of its own information and weapon systems,\n- Anticipating technical disruptions by investing in research and development,\n- Reinforcing and structuring human resources dedicated to cyberdefence,\n- Developing a national centre of excellence in Brittany,\n- Reinforcing cooperation with allies in Europe and the Atlantic Alliance,\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n- Fostering a national cyberdefence community and network of trusted partners.\nAs a follow-up to the 2017 Review and as a further step to this military structuring, the Armed Forces ministry established a Cyber Defence Command to coordinate cyber operations within the armed forces. ComCyber, as it is colloquially known, sits directly under the Joint Chief of Staff. Defensively, it serves as an hypervision body, a concept that has a specific meaning in that context:91 it receives and correlates all relevant data related to its systems' security. However, in accordance with a recently released ministerial instruction92, each corps and service remains responsible for its own defensive cyber operations and has its own SOC (Security Operations Centre)93. CALID, the Ministry's SOC, assesses global cyber risk so that ComCyber is able to act and advise political authorities to the best of their knowledge. In other words, defensive cyber operations are modelled on subsidiarity.\nFigure 4 - Simplified graph of military cyber operations, broke-down by their offensive or defensive nature.\nComCyber performs defensive operations by delegation of ANSSI, and must notify the Agency of them94. Consequently, and because both institutions need to share data between each other, CALID is partly co-located with ANSSI. ANSSI typically shares non-military IoCs and ComCyber military ones that may impact civilian systems95. This cooperation and the wider relationship between ANSSI and ComCyber is defined in a specific protocol96.\nNew capabilities for the armed forces: Integrating the cyber domain in conventional and influence operations\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nThe defensive cyber doctrine entails the prevention, anticipation, detection of and protection against cyber attacks⁹⁷. The scope of the doctrine is limited to reacting to and attributing the attack — within defensive and non-military measures. To perform these tasks, the doctrine sets up an adaptive Permanent Cyber Security Posture, orienting France’s military cyber units to be prepared for what the summary describes as a “peace-crisis-war” continuum⁹⁸. The document thus seems to acknowledge what has been described as a state of unpeace, a state of hostility that falls short of full conflict⁹⁹. This defensive policy is the result of Ministerial Instruction 101000 (Joint Doctrine 3.20)¹⁰⁰. Thus, it covers the whole Ministry and not merely the armed forces.¹⁰¹\nFigure 5\nCovers of the offensive and defensive cyber operations documents.\nIn contrast, the offensive doctrine is only relevant to the armed forces.\nUntil the release of this document, the armed forces had focused on defending their own systems—although with an understood element of active defence—while DGSE was in charge of the most sensitive operations, namely, espionage and disruption of adverse systems.\nWhat is new in the offensive doctrine is the integration of cyber activity in conventional military operations. The offensive approach is described as stealthy actions aimed at denying the availability or\nconfidentiality of adverse systems. Implicitly, the doctrine seems to exclude operations with destructive kinetic effects. It mentions the neutralization of enemy systems, but the concept is ambiguous. Offensive operations can prepare or complement conventional operations—acting as a force multiplier—or substitute them entirely where appropriate. The offensive doctrine also includes counterinfluence operations, aimed at protecting conventional action in cyberspace. Such operations are already performed in the conventional domain through the CIAE, or Joint Centre for Environmental Action, the military influence and civil-military cooperation branch of the French armed forces that was created in 2012. This doctrinal shift reflects an increased perception by the armed forces of propaganda and disinformation threats that could hamper its conventional deployments.\nThe new offensive cyber doctrine expands and details the scope of offensive cyber operations. It assumes their preparation and conduct, not only in a clandestine context but also as an integral part of -or substitute for- conventional military operations¹⁰². As we noted however, it also imposes constraints and rules of engagement on the basis of a strict risk management.\nb) DGSE\nDGSE is the foreign security service and additionally serves as France’s main signals intelligence agency. It sits directly under the Armed Forces Ministry. Until 2014, not much was known publicly by\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\nSSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\nDGSE's activities in the cyber domain. Offensive and espionage operations were deemed to be its responsibilities, but these has been absent from public sight, until forensic analysis¹⁰³ and Snowden-leaks published by Le Monde¹⁰⁴ unveiled a diverse panel of advanced malwares (Casper, Bunny, Babar, Dino) attributed to a French intelligence agency. The leaks seem to have broken an internal taboo. A former DGSE executive, Bernard Barbier, shed some light on such operations shortly after, admitting the agency \"started hacking in 1992\"¹⁰⁵.\nc) DGA\nDGA, the Defence Procurement Agency, has long developed a cybersecurity department, which sits into its \"maîtrise de l'information\" branch. It is tasked with protecting the information and weapon systems of the armed forces, providing technical expertise in threat intelligence, upstream research (also known as discovery stage) and crisis support¹⁰⁶. As part of such responsibilities, it conducts vulnerability research on armed forces' systems¹⁰⁷ and since 2015 organises cyber-wargames¹⁰⁸.\nThe offensive doctrine indicated DGA will adapt its procurement processes to take into account the tempo of operations and nature of these weapons¹⁰⁹. Current processes designed to procure vehicles or submarines, or even major software programs, would be ill-suited. This may hint at the creation of an ad hoc procurement process designed from the ground up to research vulnerabilities and develop exploits and payloads.\n\nParochial priorities and perceptions of the respective institutions depend mostly on the structuring of the cyber security and defence apparatus, which core principle is offense-defence separation.\na) Opposition of views between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA The opposition of views or the impact of parochial competition appears most clearly between ANSSI and the armed forces, on two different issues: vulnerability disclosure and end-to-end encryption.\nContrary to the U.S. or, more recently, the U.K., France has no public vulnerability equities process (VEP). Currently, disclosure and sharing between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA is not formalised and happens on a case-by-case basis¹¹⁰. Guillaume Poupard, ANSSI director, communicated briefly about vulnerability research and disclosure at the agency's end-of-year report. In practice, Poupard said, in case of doubt as to the balance of risk,\"the vulnerability goes to the defence\"¹¹¹.

Although there is no obvious conflict of views on that topic, the debate on the right risk balancing illustrates well how each agencies' responsibilities and culture influences their stance in critical debates such as this one.\nWe can witness a more obvious conflict of views on the encryption debate. Poupard, circulated within the government in March 2016 a note arguing strongly against\"exceptional access\"legislation, which would allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bypass encryption, either on device or in transit. The Parliament of Australia recently passed such a law, not without public outcry¹¹⁴. In his note, Poupard states: “To impose a wide weakening of cryptographic means would affect both digital safety and the freedom of the large majority of law-abiding users, while remaining ineffective against the intended minority target.”\nIt appears that, at the time, DGSE was voicing its concerns against encryption¹¹⁵. In 2018, the head of its technical services, Patrick Pailloux, promoted publicly the idea of in-transit exceptional access, while reaffirming the importance of strong (but not end-to-end by definition) encryption¹¹⁶. It is thus likely that Poupard’s note was a direct rebuke to DGSE’s pressures. In such case, it may be a good example of two principles edited by Allison and Zelkow. First, that where you stand depends on where you sit. Less colloquially known as “the face of the issue differs from seat to seat”¹¹⁷, it explains that, as the head of a defensive agency open to the wider public and private sector, it is expected that its director will oppose the weakening of end-to-end encryption. On the opposite, it is expected that DGSE will seek to extend its interception capabilities, as a signals intelligence agency dedicated to foreign security. Second, this “row” may also be the result of the “51-49 principle”. Even if one isn’t completely convinced by the side of the argument, they must “argue much more confidently than they would if they were detached judges”¹¹⁸ because of parochial competition.\nb) The role of Foreign Affairs and its relationship with other actors.\nThe International Digital Strategy was released only a few months before the Cyber Defence Review. Presented as “France’s international strategy”, it could be potentially interpreted as a willingness of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to defend its prerogative in that area. In May 2017, Jean-Yves Le Drian had become Foreign Affairs Minister after almost five years at the Defence Ministry. Although it may have been perceived as such by some in the Armed Forces Ministry¹¹⁹, the international strategy was actually two-years in the making¹²⁰, a long process due in part to its submission to public review. As for the Paris Call, the initiative came from the Cybersecurity and Strategic Affairs division, which then pushed it through to the Minister, who ensured political Macron dans les locaux de la DGA-MI à Bruz:pic.twitter.com/elKwQM0k9w,” #WarGames on Twitter (blog), April 15, 2019, https://twitter.com/amaelle_g/status/1117803882032304128.\n¹¹² Guiton.\n¹¹³ Guiton.\n¹¹⁴ Catherine Chapman, “Australian Cybersecurity Industry Reels over Anti-Encryption Law,” The Daily Swig | Web security digest, January 25, 2019, https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/australian-cybersecurity-industry-reels-over-anti-encryption-law.\n¹¹⁵ A ComCyber official, April 18, 2019.\n¹¹⁶ Valéry Marchive, “Le renseignement aime le chiffrement, mais il veut bien des points de clair,” LeMagIT, July 4, 2018, https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252444227/Le-renseignement-aimé-le-chiffrement-mais-il-veut-bien-des-points-de-clair.\n¹¹⁷ Allison and Zelikow, Essence of Decision.

It is a very tentative chapter, because of time and interview constraints. To complete the analysis, more interviews should be conducted at higher political levels.\n## 1) Key individuals in decision and action, and factors influencing their perceptions, preferences and stands During its annual press conference, ANSSI director stated, on the topic of vulnerabilities disclosure, that in a structure that separates offence and defence,\"the level of where both meet [in the policy-making tree] is very high. It means that sometimes, we must mobilise the highest authorities on these issues\"¹²³.\nBastien Irondelle, in its seminal work on the decision-making process behind the end of French military conscription in 1996, highlighted the everlasting importance of the President.¹²⁴ He detailed how the political impetus Jacques Chirac gave to this major policy decision, in particular during the Defence Councils, made the reform happen¹²⁵. We have demonstrated so far that in the case at hand, French cyber security and defence, the evolution has been gradual, taking place over a decade. However, the same key individuals and processes remain.\nIn practice, the range of meaningful decision-making in cyber security and defence starts at ministerial cabinets, up to the Prime Minister and the President¹²⁶. Major crisis and policy decisions are taken at the presidential level, during Defence Councils.¹²⁷ ANSSI is represented by the SGDSN, ComCyber by the Joint Chief of Staff,¹²⁸ who remains responsible for the military action chain¹²⁹.\nThe Cyber Club identified by Desforges still exists today and brings together the directors of ANSSI, DGA, ComCyber and the technical departments of both domestic and foreign intelligence agencies (DGSI, DGSE)¹³⁰.\nAnother noteworthy trend is the overwhelming majority of military profiles among ANSSI executives. Out of the seven directors and deputy-directors, five have spent most of their careers in the armed forces¹³¹. Such numbers however hide some atypical career paths: the deputy director is a military engineer with a doctorate in public law and an MBA.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338 ¹²³ Guiton,\"[Thread] [Team #Wargames] Comment est gérée la question des vulnérabilités dites 'zero-day' en France, où on sépare les missions d'attaque et de défense?

Because of the number of involved actors and their overlap in each mission, the Strategy established four “operational chains” to centralize and streamline public action in the field. They are referred to as the protection, intelligence, judicial investigations and military-action chains. While it is still unclear how these chains work in practice, we were able to collect more information on the committees and groups that coordinate cyber security and defence policy, in theory and in practice.\n### a) Recently formalised processes The Cyber Strategy created two new committees: An Executive Committee, under the President’s Office, and a Steering Committee, under the SGDSN. Political decisions and policy orientations related to cyberdefence are taken during meetings of the National Security and Defence Council. The Executive Committee is tasked with high-level implementation of the Council’s decisions.\nThe Steering Committee’s responsibility is to report on the Strategy’s implementation to the Prime Minister and to prepare the meetings of the Executive Committee[132]. It meets every semester. SGDSN transmits the impetus of political leadership, sets the agenda and ensures the application of the previously decided measures[133]. Ministries and agencies are free to bring forward suggestions[134].\nAdditionally, a Cyber Crisis Coordination Centre “supervises cyberdefence”[135] and informs decision-makers. The Centre consists of different groups that act at various timelines, even though their names suggest a short-term crisis perimeter. While the Technical Group acts on short-term incidents, Strategy is a “sub-political”[136] group that acts on mid-term strategy to prepare steering committee meetings. It is open to other ministries,[137] of which most individuals present are administration directors (directeurs d’administration centrale)[138]. They offer regular situation reports to the Prime Minister and the President, and suggests policy options. They meet monthly[139]. The Technico-Operational Group (TechOps), on the other hand, is a restricted group with few institutions represented. Its main purpose is to share specific threat intelligence, and it thus open to only a handful of intelligence agencies[140].\n### b) Importance of informal coordination processes TechOps is only very briefly described in official documents[141]. However it reminds of the “Cyber Club” Alix Desforges described in her thesis[142]. This informal grouping of agency heads took another dimension with the writing process of the Cyber Strategy. According to an official[143], the writing Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338 SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3) process itself greatly enhanced communication between relevant stakeholders. In other words, the process of creating processes, enhanced communication and coordination between actors. At its creation, TechOps the people and institutions involved warmly welcomed it, and it quickly became indispensable. Some degree of informality remains today. In addition to what we have already described, informal ad-hoc meetings keep happening to deal with specific issues.\n*** When it comes to formal processes, the highest political authorities remain in charge of major policy-decisions. Informal meetings have lead to the formalisation of intelligence sharing and mid to low level policy coordination.\n* * # Conclusion From its sovereign principles to the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence institutions, France revendicates an atypical model. At the top, strategic autonomy infuses major political, financial and policy decisions. Domestically, although officials strongly reaffirm the separation of offence and defence activities, in practice such separation can be described as institutional at best, due to the fluidity of human resources between agencies.

France is no exception. We have seen in recent months a revival of its efforts to secure its citizens and interests in cyber space. French President Emmanuel Macron presented in late 2018 the \"Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace\", a package of norms of good behaviour bringing together states, private corporations and the civil society¹. All the while, in the past two years, the government designed its very first Cyber Defence Strategy² and the Armed Forces unveiled some elements of their offensive and defensive cyber operations³. How can we make sense of it all?\n\nWe frame the current picture by following Allison and Zelikow's three conceptual models of decision-making: Rational actor, organisational behaviour, and government politics⁴. In accordance with each model, we seek to answer the following questions, respectively:\n\nR1: What are the underlying principles, goals and objectives of French national defence and security, in general terms and in the cyber domain?\n\nR2: What are the institutions involved in cyber security and defence, their perimeters of action and organisational culture?\n\nR3: What are the processes and individuals involved in cyber security and defence policy-making at the politico-strategic level?\n\nTo do so we combine an extensive review of the literature with a series of interviews with senior French officials from ministries, as well as national agencies and other specialised institutions.\n\n# Objectives and limitations\n\nThe objective of this paper is three-fold: describing, explaining and, by extension, predicting. First, we hope to provide a better understanding of the current French cyber security and defence policy picture its founding political and doctrinal principles. Second, by applying Allison and Zelikow's models to this picture, we seek to explain how policy-making in this area happens in practice. This approach diverges slightly from the models' original purpose, which is to analyse a specific case-study and its cluster of decisions (\"Why did the Soviets smuggle nuclear missiles into Cuba?\" \"Why did the US respond by imposing a naval blockade?\"). This paper does not ambition to explain why France launched the Paris Call or why it published parts of the armed forces' offensive cyber operations doctrine. Scholars⁵ and journalists⁶ have already started answering them. Rather, it seeks to provide a toolkit so that scholars, practitioners or journalists can design more accurate hypotheses about why future decision X or Y was taken in that domain. There is no doubt this toolkit will be incomplete and\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nimperfect. Not all policy documents are public, some processes and institutions are still recent, and we lack the ability to stand back so that we can grasp how some processes work-out in practice. Another obstacle is that these principles, policies, doctrines, processes and institutions live through the minds and acts of leaders, policy-makers and practitioners, whom the author has not been able to all interview. In particular, the author was unable to meet officials from SGDSN itself, the Élysée Palace and Prime Minister's Office. This is where the work of Bastien Irondelle becomes key⁷. The third -indirect- objective of this paper, is prediction. As Allison and Zelikow highlight, it is “the logical flipside of explanations”⁸. If we understand more accurately the processes and factors that lead to decisions, we can extrapolate about future events. The predictive power of the model will however be highly dependent on the strength of its explanatory qualities.\n\n## Acknowledgement and appreciation\n\nThe author is grateful to IRSEM for hosting him and the warm welcome.

    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\n# Chapter I - The state as a unitary rational entity\n\nThe first model set-out by Allison and Zelikow envisions the state as a black box; a rational unitary entity driven by its interests. This is the rational actor model. In our case, France is the identified state. More often than not, political cycles lead to new policies and strategies. When relevant, the state thus becomes personified, in relation to a specific presidency. In this model we adopt a bounded rationality viewpoint, whereas we accept that “values, beliefs and stereotypes” play a role in the actors’ rationality⁹.\n\n## 1. Political concepts, principles and goals\n\nIn this first part we analyse France’s core political concepts of sovereignty and strategic autonomy, the rationale behind the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence apparatus, and the one behind its communication and attribution stance.\n\n### a. France’s sovereignty, national and European strategic autonomy\n\nFrance has a conceptualisation of sovereignty that makes it stand out of its peers. Baezner and Robin found in their comparative analysis that “France was unique among the states examined in that it used the word “sovereignty” more frequently and in different contexts”¹⁰. Sovereignty, in its French understanding, cannot be restrained to hard sovereignty, i.e. the protection of its citizens, borders and other existential interests¹¹. French sovereignty is a wide spectrum that implies strategic autonomy. The 2017 Strategic Review defines strategic autonomy as a two pillar concept entailing 1) a high level of industrial and technological autonomy, and 2) an operational autonomy¹². On technological autonomy, the Ministry of the Armed Forces has recently ramped up its strategy, with the creation of a dedicated investment fund, DefInvest¹³. Its first investments were made in microprocessors and high precision optics manufacturers. Operational autonomy means the ability to reach an informed decision and to take action, in particular in the context of political or military crises. The French military operation in Mali, for instance, is a good illustration of operational autonomy: the ability to engage in full scope – low to high intensity– operations, with allies or on its own if necessary.\n\nFrench strategic autonomy can be best described as neo-Gaullist. It is characterised by a strong sense of national independence but recognises the need for a powerful political Europe¹⁴. Its historical drivers and roots come indeed from a traditional Gaullist doctrine of national autonomy, which is more self-reliant. The perceived need for self-reliance played a major role in driving De Gaulle to transform France into a nuclear power and to leave NATO integrated command in 1966. Some key historical events such as the 1940 surrender, the intelligence frustrations of the 1992 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq war further fuelled perceptions that France needed both a credible nuclear arsenal, and autonomous intelligence capabilities¹⁵.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\n---\n\n⁹ Allison and Zelikow.

    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nThis spirit of autonomy remains today, but with a wider pragmatic recognition of the need for cooperation and integration. France re-joined NATO command in 2009 for mainly pragmatism and influence reasons¹⁶. However the French nuclear arsenal remains outside of NATO command and its intelligence apparatus outside of the 5-Eyes community. France' strategic autonomy is also reliant on a European strategic autonomy, which it seeks to develop. The Hubert Védrine report recommended that the country's return into NATO command is accompanied by a strengthening of European defence integration and cooperation, especially in the R&amp;D of technological and industrial capacities¹⁷. It encourages the development of mutual interdependence with entities who share critical interests, particularly within the EU. This policy shift initiated in 1992 with the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy was confirmed in the 2008 White Paper, placing the EU as \"a central tenet of [France's] security policy\"¹⁸. This central place was reaffirmed ever since, including in the last cyber strategy document¹⁹.\n\nb) Domestic apparatus: Offense / defence separation\n\nDomestically, the French approach contrasts with that embraced by the United States or the United Kingdom. Most notably, France assumes a clear separation between offensive and defensive cyber operations. This means that, contrary to the U.S.' National Security Agency (NSA) or the U.K.'s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), France's leading agency for cybersecurity is exclusively dedicated to defensive operations and not part of the intelligence community. This is a defining element of the Cyber Strategy Review and infuses the whole structure of French cyberdefence. The rationale is that having a distinct defensive agency separate from offense-oriented military intelligence agencies \"facilitates the acceptance of state intervention [...] whether in public administration or the economic sphere\"²⁰.\n\nc) A counter-threat model based on direct communication rather than public attribution\n\nPeculiarities of the French model are not limited to its conceptualisation of sovereignty. On the diplomatic stage, France has also adopted a different stance than most of its counterparts²¹. A number of NATO allies are increasingly inclined to \"name and shame\" states involved in cyber attacks. One telling example can be found in October 2018, when the U.S., U.K., Canada and the Netherlands denounced Russian attempts at disrupting the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons²². Paris expressed its solidarity but fell short of blaming Moscow²³. Already in 2015, when what then seemed to be ISIS took down TV5Monde in a major hack, no official attribution was made. ANSSI, the national cybersecurity agency, however briefed four dozen media outlets with details of its forensic investigation and indicators of compromise. These details were then analysed by private security firms which pointed the finger at persistent threat actor (APT) ²⁸²⁴. Additionally, TV5Monde director Yves Bigot reported in L'Express\n\n\"France favours red phones over the megaphone.\"\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nthat ANSSI personnel suggested it was a false-flag (\"un leurre\")²⁵. More recently, in the case of the #MacronLeaks, France did not issue any kind of attribution either. G. Poupard, head of ANSSI, refused to do so arguing \"the attack was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone\"²⁶. More recently, the Secretary General for Defence and National Security clarified France's official policy: attribution can only be performed on the basis of elements collected or verified by French services, typically ANSSI and DGSE²⁷.\n\nThis does not mean that it does not have attribution capabilities. As we will see in Chapter II, attributing cyber-attacks is one of the main missions of the French cyberdefence apparatus. But even when it knows, France prefers forthright bilateral dialogues with Russia and other cyber powers such as the U.S., China, India, Brazil and Japan²⁸. It appears it even opened a deconfliction cell with the Russian Security Council on cyber matters²⁹. Only in last resort will France take part in public name and shame³⁰. In other words, it favours red phones over the megaphone.\n\nThere is only one recorded instance of public attribution, and it is indirect. At the unveiling of the offensive cyber doctrine, Minister Parly revealed that an APT targeted email accounts of high-ranking officials between 2017 and 2018, with the objective of uncovering the navy's oil supply chain³¹. Though the Minister stopped short of explicitly recognizing the group's affiliation with the Russian Federation, she indirectly attributed the attacker's mode of operation to a specific group known as Turla.\n\nUnder Egloff's definition, France engages in two attribution processes³². First a process of sense-making attribution, for the benefit of its own factual understanding, that it rarely communicates publicly. Second, in a meaning-making process, with regards to its adversaries. But again, it does so rather privately than publicly. Overall, French strategy with attribution seem to fit a counter-threat model³³.\n\nIn this first part, we have detailed how France conceives its sovereignty and what it means by strategic autonomy. We have also sought to explain its rationale behind the offence / defence separation and to describe its policy of non-public attribution.\n\n## 2. The evolution and granularization of objectives of French cyber security and defence\n\nIn this second part we review the cyber security and defence objectives produced by political and military authorities, from 2011 to 2019. We identify three main themes: active discouragement, risk limitation and direct communication.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nThe Defence and National Security White Paper 2008 is the first of its kind to mention Internet-related threats³⁴ and leads to the creation of ANSSI. The Agency releases in 2011 the “National Strategy for the Defence and Security of Information Systems”. It’s four goals are:\n\n- For France to become a top-tier cyber power,\n- To guarantee freedom of decision through confidentiality of state secrets,\n- To reinforce the security of critical infrastructures,\n- To ensure cybersecurity to public and private actors alike.\n\nThe second version of the Strategy revolved around 1) state secrets and critical infrastructures, 2) digital privacy and cybercrime, 3) public sensitisation and training, 4) business and export strategies, and 5) Europe, digital sovereignty and norms³⁵.\n\nFollowing the election of Emmanuel Macron to the Presidency, the President requests officially tasks the Armed Forces Ministry to create a panel of experts with a view to write a new defence white paper. The Strategic Review for Defence and National Security, as it is then known, is released in 2017. It promotes digital sovereignty and cybersecurity to top priorities of national defence³⁶.\n\nIn February 2018, the country’s first National Strategy for Cyber Defence clarified both the organization and integration of cyber operations among all government entities³⁷ as well as the national and international legal framework surrounding their use³⁸. It sets-out goals and processes as part of a “robust national cyber security and defence apparatus”³⁹.\n\nThe seven principles underpinning the Strategy are:\n\n1. To make the security of French information and communication systems a priority,\n2. To embrace a policy of active discouragement⁴⁰ and coordinated response,\n3. To fully exercise its digital sovereignty,\n4. To bring an efficient judicial response to cybercriminality,\n5. To promote a shared cybersecurity culture,\n6. To contribute to a trusted and safe digital Europe,\n7. To act internationally for a collective governance of cyberspace.\n\nTo achieve said goals, the Strategy sets-out a number of policy-making and coordination processes (see Chapter III). In practice, three main themes appear: Active discouragement, risk limitation and multilateralism.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\n³⁴ Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n³⁵ Services du Premier Ministre, “Stratégie Nationale Pour La Sécurité Du Numérique” (Paris, October 16, 2015), https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/actualite/la-strategie-nationale-pour-la-securite-du-numerique-une-reponse-aux-nouveaux-enjeux-des-usages-numeriques/.\n³⁶ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n³⁷ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n³⁸ Francois Delerue and Aude Gery, “France’s Cyberdefense Strategic Review and International Law,” Lawfare, March 23, 2018, https://www.lawfareblog.com/frances-cyberdefense-strategic-review-and-international-law.\n³⁹ In French as « Dispositif national de protection et de défense informatique robuste ». “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.”\n⁴⁰ France reserves its concept of deterrence (dissuasion) to the nuclear domain.",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\na) Active discouragement\n\nFrance has adopted a posture of active discouragement against advanced threats. It relies on direct communication with the adversary, as we have detailed earlier, and on an increasingly explicit declaratory strategy.\n\nIn January 2019 Minister Florence Parly unveiled the offensive and defensive cyber operations doctrines of the armed forces. The announcement is the latest and strongest step taken by the country as part of its declaratory strategy⁴¹. In response to cyber and other threats, France is “not afraid” of using cyber weapons⁴². The country did not wait until then to perform offensive operations or even to publicly admit doing so. Such operations were first mentioned in the 2008 White Paper⁴³ and then again with more details in 2013. The case for proportional reprisals in response to a major attack was also made clearly by then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian:\n\n“In times of war, cyber weapons may be the response, or part of our response, to an armed attack [aggression armée], being of a cyber nature or otherwise”⁴⁴.\n\nb) Risk limitation and infrastructure sanctuarisation\n\nRisks that are inherent to cyberspace and operations are a recurrent topic in policy documents.\n\nThe offensive doctrine places great emphasis on the consideration and mitigation of political, legal and military risks. It mandates a risk balancing exercise in the preparation and conduct of offensive operations: against the risk of escalation in an asymmetric environment, or against the risk of collateral or indirect damage on civilian infrastructures. This balancing exercise – and the need not to reveal too much details – may be the reason the doctrine does not clearly mention⁴⁵ physical destruction of information systems.\n\nInternationally, France aims to promote existing institutional mechanisms to “limit hacking and destabilising activities” in cyberspace, notably through an international initiative, the “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace”⁴⁶, unveiled in November 2018.\n\nIn terms of international law, the document encourages more extensive and better coordinated regulation of cyberspace in the spirit of founding principles of the U.N. Charter, notably the maintenance of international peace and security. It recognizes not only the applicability of international humanitarian law to cyberspace, but of international human rights and customary international law more broadly as well. It also advocates for the development of new ways to prevent intellectual property theft, i.e. industrial espionage.\n\nAnother key theme of the document is the importance of protecting individuals and critical infrastructures from harm. The document presses to safeguard the “public core of the Internet” from hostile actors. This is a clear demonstration of support for a package of norms unveiled by the Global\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\n41 Taillat, “Signaling, Victory, and Strategy in France’s Military Cyber Doctrine.”\n\n42 Parly, “Stratégie Cyber Des Armées (Speech).”\n\n43 Défense et Sécurité Nationale.\n\n44 Jean-Yves Le Drian, “Déclaration de M.

    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nCommission for the Stability of Cyberspace on Nov. 8 in Singapore⁴⁷. Reflecting the view of most states on the matter, the Call promotes the exclusive role of sovereign states in hostile acts in cyberspace. It condemns corporate hack-back and other offensive operations from non-state actors. It also appeals for measures preventing interference with elections, another contemporary hot topic.\n\nClearly absent in the text are issues of espionage and state-lead low-intensity offensive operations. The need to compromise and willingness to gather support across states with various political mindsets means offensive cyber operations was probably out of scope of the Call from its inception.\n\nc) Multilateralism and stakeholderism\n\nOn the international stage, one of France's goals relates to the diplomatic process itself. The country seeks to maintain a form of inclusive multilateralism⁴⁸, and in parallel to open-up debates on cyberspace governance to non-state actors.\n\nIts International Digital Strategy puts great emphasis into promoting an \"open, diverse and trusted\" cyberspace in which it envisions the European Union as a key player⁴⁹. The Strategy itself was subject to public consultations.\n\nThe Paris Call comes in the wake of the strategy. In addition to its normative nature we detailed earlier, to engage industries and civil society, the document also promotes everyday good practices (\"cyber hygiene\") and the implementation of \"security by design\" in products and services. It is not the first initiative of its kind. In April 2018, Microsoft launched its \"Digital Peace\" campaign⁵⁰ along with a \"Cybersecurity Tech Accord\"⁵¹ aimed at getting the internet and the technology industry to better protect their customers' privacy and security against cyberattacks. Similarly, Siemens unveiled in May 2018 a \"Charter of Trust\" that seeks to develop adherence to security principles and processes, with the aim of developing a \"global standard\" for cybersecurity⁵².\n\nUntil those recent developments, norm-building initiatives were the prerogative of states. In 2015, the U.N.'s Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) recognized that international humanitarian law applied to cyberspace⁵³, though it then deadlocked when at the end of 2017. Although a new process was put in place for 2019 up to 2021, the two blocs—one group led by the United States and another by China and Russia—are unlikely to solve the stalemate.\n\nApproaching the issue from various stakeholders' perspectives, the Paris Call is an attempt to move away from this international deadlock. Macron, at its unveiling at UNESCO, made the case for rebuffing what he described as a binary choice between \"a Californian Internet and a Chinese\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nInternet\"54. So far, he argued, these two opposite narratives have monopolized the debate and imposed two radically different yet unsatisfactory alternatives: either a model of mere technical governance led by Silicon Valley, or an overwhelming regulation led by authoritarian regimes. While the former does not address issues of privacy and malicious actors, the latter cracks down on human rights and could lead to a \"balkanisation\" of internet and of wider cyberspace55.\n\nAccording to Le Monde, Microsoft first approached the French government to obtain its support for the Tech Accord56. However, the country found the Accord too narrow and industry-oriented. Recognizing a trend of norms fragmentation coupled with diplomatic deadlocks, France saw an opportunity to take the lead on governance. But this was only possible if the call achieved two things: First, it needed to widen the scope of existing sector-specific initiatives (Tech Accord, GGE, For The Web) into meaningful norms all actors could get behind. Second, it needed to gather and federate existing initiatives, otherwise it would just contribute to the further fragmentation of norms. So far the call seems to have mostly succeeded, with a notable caveat among state signatories.\n\nAmong the 64 state signatories, European countries are the most heavily present. However, almost every continent is represented: among them we find Qatar, South Korea, Mexico, Japan, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Senegal and New-Zealand. Critically, on release day, key potential signatories such as India or Brazil are not on the list. The absence of such countries may become problematic. While the U.S. (at least for now), China and Russia are unlikely to join, the Call will rely on support from States like India and Brazil in order to gain traction within international institutions, primarily the United Nations. Macron, aware of this challenge, suggested that the Internet Governance Forum—a U.N. event—become responsible for monitoring the effective implementation of the call and be moved under the direct supervision of the U.N. Secretary General57.\n\nThe document has already drawn support from influential non-governmental groups. The World Leadership Alliance, Chatham House, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Internet Society have committed to its principles. Technical governance bodies, such as the Number Resource Organization and the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre—the region's internet registry—expressed interest too. Powerful business lobbies are another prominent group of signatories, including notably, Indian business guilds such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Internet and Mobile Association of India and the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum. In total, as many as 300 universities, NGOs and professional associations have committed to the call.\n\nIn the industrial landscape, France succeeded in attracting both major initiatives: The Tech Accord and the Charter of Trust represent a significant share of the private-sector signatories, as together they represent 85 powerful corporations such as Airbus, Cisco and Facebook. But the call is not a mere shell for existing groups. Notable newcomers include Google, Samsung Electronics, Intel Corporation, Kaspersky Lab, Thales and many other companies, ranging from the banking and insurance industries, to law, commerce and defence.\n\nInitiatives to create norms in cyberspace are multiplying. But more than anything else, these initiatives seem to have fragmented political will and have so far failed to gather support across the board. Emmanuel Macron hopes the Paris Call will bring fresh momentum to the issue by mounting support from influential parties, notably Silicon Valley's top companies and emerging powers.

Threat perception\n\nA state's perception of threats is based on a variety of factors: strategic goals, history and precedent, one's perception of its own weaknesses and dependencies$^{58}$. It is a key concept within rational models such as the one Allison and Zelikow describe. While France approached cybersecurity issues from a dominantly technical perspective at its beginnings, Desforges argues, it shifted towards a model that goes beyond security and defence issues$^{59}$. The Snowden leaks, the rise of jihadist propaganda and the increasingly geopolitical impact of major attacks pushed France to consider broader societal challenges and actors in defining its strategies and policies.\n\n$^{58}$ Raymond Cohen, “Threat Perception in International Crisis,” *Political Science Quarterly* 93, no. 1 (1978): 93, https://doi.org/10/d95kwg.\n$^{59}$ Alix Desforges, “Approche Géopolitique Du Cyberespace, Enjeux Pour La Défense et La Sécurité Nationale, l’exemple de La France” (Université Paris 8 - Vincennes / Saint-Denis, 2018).\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\na) Threat realisation centred around technology and intelligence (2008-2013)\n\nThe 2008 White Paper$^{(a)}$ mentions Internet in its first chapter, but first as an example of a positive trend, highlighting the rise in connectedness of people around the world. The other side of the coin, it later states, is the challenge of keeping up with the high-paced spread of information and ideas, in other words information control and propaganda. The Paper also dedicates a full-page box to serious cyberattacks detailing the full CIA spectrum. While it does not mention the attacks on Estonia, the Paper foresees such attacks will be multiplying in the following 15 years and considers the risk of a large-scale attack on its critical infrastructures a major threat. It mentions \"cyberwar\" as one of the scenarios which could involve the Atlantic Alliance. In consequence, the Paper mandates 1) a switch from a passive to active defence model, 2) the development of offensive cyber capabilities, strategy and doctrine all focusing on adversarial military systems.\n\nIt is the very first time France acknowledges cyber threats and decides to act on them in a national public policy document. The Paper also creates a new strategic role for the armed forces known as \"knowledge and anticipation\".\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2\n\nStrategic and prospective policy documents in context (yellow, red and green).

    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nb) Broadening to societal challenges and capabilities build-up (2013-2015)\n\nThe 2013 White Paper mandated the creation of a national doctrine for major cyber threats response: a coordinated defensive posture mixed with a graduated response from diplomatic, judicial and law enforcement powers to military means when vital interests are at stake. The strategic mission “knowledge and anticipation”, created in 2008, now includes information control in its widest sense (maîtrise de l’information), from trends in cryptography to intelligence gathering and critical infrastructure security. A joint doctrine puts in place a strategic anticipation group which is tasked with mid-term (one to two years) prospective on operational preparedness, military intelligence and international relations[62]. Most critically, the Paper contains France’s official recognition of cyberspace as an operational domain by stating that “cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own”. This is two years after the United States[63] and three years before NATO[64].\n\n## “Cyberspace is now a battlefield of its own.”\n\nThe ensuing pluriannual defence finance law (LPM, 2014-2019) set-out an operational cyberdefence chain integrated to conventional military operations. It reiterated the need for both defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, granting overall 1 billion EUR to cyberdefence.\n\nIn 2015, the Digital Security Strategy stated that a serious threat (“atteinte significative”) to French citizens data could constitute a national security matter, notably in the context of espionage, propaganda or political destabilisation[65]. The complete shutdown of news channel TV5 Monde that year represented a moment of reckoning for the country’s security agencies, while the leaking of documents stolen from the Macron campaign on the eve of the 2017 election sounded alarm bells at the possibility of foreign meddling in domestic politics, echoing the Clinton campaign.\n\nc) Institutional and doctrinal military structuring (2017-2019)\n\nThe 2017 Review emphasises the increasing role of Internet and digital giants (GAFAM, Baidu) on geopolitics and sovereignty, as well as on “strategic intimidation” facilitated by the combination of economic, military and informational pressures such as territorial fait-accompli and mass social network trolling. It also mentions the risk of escalation in cyber and space conflicts, not the least because of first strike temptations. Currently, ANSSI states “destabilisation, espionage and sabotage” as the primary threats it faces[66].\n\nThe Cyberdefence Review dedicates a significant part (32 pages) to the evolution of the threat landscape. It relies on the “new normal” scenario to highlight the risks brought by quantum\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\ncomputers, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. It concludes that their level of security will be determining factors for societal safety⁶⁸.\n\nThe next LPM (2019-2025) reflects this evolution of French threat perception and the impetus granted to the “knowledge and anticipation” mission of the armed forces. The defence budget for 2019 amounts to 35,9 billion EUR, or 1.82% of GDP, pensions excluded⁶⁹. It is planned to increase over the next four years, reaching 44 billion EUR and 2% of GDP in 2023⁷⁰. In 2019, intelligence and cyberdefence constitute already 73% of the Ministry’s hiring effort (+450 personnel in total)⁷¹. By 2025, the armed forces are expected to count on 4000 so-called cyber-combatants, which represent an increase of 25% over six years⁷². Cyberdefence will receive over this period a budget of 1.6 billion Euros, excluding payroll⁷³.\n\n***\n\nOver the past decade, France went through three main major evolution stages in its cyber security and defence structuring: threat realisation (2008-2011), capabilities build-up (2013-2015) and an institutional and doctrinal military structuring accompanied by a strong diplomatic impetus (2017-2019). The recently released offensive doctrine is the culmination of this deep transformation. It particularly represents a turning point for the armed forces, breaking offensive operations from their intelligence silo. The wording of the document and of the accompanying speech by Minister Parly also represents a less veiled signal to Russia, a message France had previously been reluctant to send publicly. The Paris Call, in parallel, is an unprecedented attempt at bringing states, major corporations and the civil society together around key values and principles.\n\n&gt; “France aims to promote international rules and stability [...] to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks [...] to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion.”\n\nOverall, France aims to promote international rules and stability in the cyber domain to prevent escalation of crises, yet seeks room to manoeuvre to support conventional operations, deterrence and retorsion. Such balance is and will remain delicate, which only reinforces the need for a better understanding of actors’ rationales and policy coordination.\n\n# Chapter II – Relevant organisations, their goals and capabilities\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\n⁶⁸ “Revue Stratégique de Cyberdéfense.” P.31.\n\n⁶⁹ Ministère des Armées, “Communiqué - Budget 2019 : LPM année 1,” September 25, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/communaute-defense/communique-du-ministere-des-armees_-budget-2019-lpm-annee-1.\n\n⁷⁰ Ministère des Armées.\n\n⁷¹ Ministère des Armées.\n\n⁷² Ministère des Armées, “Guide Explicitatif: Les Réserves Cyber,” November 15, 2016, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/491674/7859279/file/20161115_EMACYBER_Guide_explicitatif.pdf.\n\n⁷³ Ministère des Armées, “Projet de Loi Relatif à La Programmation Militaire Pour Les Années 2019 à 2025 et Portant Diverses Dispositions Intéressant La Défense,” February 6, 2018, https://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/523150/8769279/file/LPM%202019-2025%20-%20Rapport%20annexe.pdf.",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nFollowing the organisational behaviour model of Allison and Zelikow, we now turn to the main institutional players in cyber security and defence. As we will see, the offence / defence separation principle impact deeply the institutions goals, capabilities and culture.\n\n1. ANSSI\n\na) Status, history and relationship with SGDSN\n\nIn response to the 2008 White Paper, the National Cyber Security Agency, abbreviated in French as ANSSI, was established a year later under the Prime Minister's General Secretary for Defence and National Security (SGDSN). It is a service that exercises national authority on the security of information systems⁷⁴.\n\nWhile SGDSN is in charge of security issues at large, ANSSI deals with digital affairs widely. It has a specific focus on cybersecurity, but in its widest sense: ANSSI supports the private sector, helps draft France foreign policy on digital issues and works on societal resilience. For instance, its Cyber Anticipation Cell is currently tasked with securing the Paris Olympics 2024⁷⁵. Acting as a strategy, policy and plans cell (J5, in military jargon), its main responsibilities is to advise decision-makers. This difference of scope between ANSSI and SGDSN explains why the Agency reports to the Secretary-General directly (the person), and not the Secretariat-General (as in, the institution)⁷⁶.\n\nWhy is not ANSSI directly attached to the Prime Minister then? Because belonging to SGDSN provides the Agency with institutional protection against potentially hindering senior civil servants in higher spheres of the government⁷⁷. Indeed, SGDSN reports to the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General is a permanent member of the presidential Defence Councils.\n\nIts predecessor, the Central Directory for Information Systems Security (DCSSI) was created in 2001 also under the SGDSN, and was itself the successor to the Central Service for Information Systems Security, which existed since 1986. Despite its new name and national authority status, ANSSI has thus deep historical roots.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\n⁷⁴ “Décret N° 2009-834 Du 7 Juillet 2009 Portant Création d’un Service à Compétence Nationale Dénommé « Agence Nationale de La Sécurité Des Systèmes d’information »,” 2009-834 § (2009).\n\n⁷⁵ Emmanuel Germain, ANSSI Deputy Director, Paris, June 27, 2019.\n\n⁷⁶ Germain.\n\n⁷⁷ Germain.",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\nFigure 3 - The missions and actors of French cyberdefence (Desforges 2018).\n\nb) Responsibilities\n\nANSSI has responsibility for coordination of the state's cyber security, hosts the national Computer Emergency Response Team and acts as a regulatory body for the public and private sector alike, primarily for critical infrastructure operators. It plays an unequal role in all six missions of French cyber defence as described in the 2018 Cyber Defence Strategy: cyber threat prevention, anticipation, protection, detection, attribution and reaction. The latter entails technical remediation as well as legal and military action. Alix Desforges78 clarified some of the responsibility sharing that the Cyber Defence Strategy sets-out. While prevention is a cross-government and multistakeholder assignment (ministries, local security representatives, chambers of commerce), anticipation is in essence a threat intelligence task fulfilled by ANSSI and intelligence agencies. Protection (defensive cyber operations and measures) and detection remain the responsibility of ANSSI and its subsidiaries, especially when it comes to private critical infrastructure operators. Attribution of attacks is a joint ANSSI and intelligence services task, while reaction (remediation) is another mission that benefits from subsidiarity.\n\nThe recognition of cyberspace as a domain of conflict in the 2013 White Paper comes with a new finance law. The 2014-2019 LPM contained two key measures to widen the capabilities of ANSSI. First, it created heavy regulatory obligations on critical infrastructure operators, public and private alike, in terms of their network and industrial control system security, threat detection capabilities and penetration testing, which ANSSI can now perform79. In light of such new powers, it also granted ANSSI with derogations80 with regards to the French Computer Misuse Act81. According to its Deputy Director, ANSSI deals with around 20 attacks from APTs every year82; and these are only those that are detected.\n\nc) People, identity and organisational culture\n\nANSSI brings together experts, practitioners and strategists in seven different laboratories and departments. Its two most prominent organisational traits are its exclusive defensive purpose, and its start-up spirit.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nFirst, as we described earlier, ANSSI's identity relies mostly on its exclusive defensive purpose. This is the foundation of the French model. Its Director Guillaume Poupard regularly insists on this feature, which seems to infuse very deeply into its operations. Tools that could be dual-use (i.e. for both defensive and offensive purposes) are separately developed at both DGSE (for offense) and ANSSI (for defence), even if it duplicates the effort[83]. However, because of the high pressure on its human resources, DGSE and ANSSI are pooling and sharing their people and increasingly\n\n# Of a defensive culture by nature and legal status, [ANSSI] is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need.\n\nsharing intelligence[84]. The separation between offense and defence is thus institutional and not absolute. Second, the Agency enjoys describing itself as a start-up, at least in its spirit[85]. This tag however hides large disparities in its workforce: 80% are temporary staff, with a mean age of 30 years old[86]. The remaining 20% are the managers, mostly military or civilian engineers[87]. Overall, the mean age is of 34 years[88].\n\nOf a defensive culture by nature and legal status, it is nonetheless heavily intelligence-driven by need. Although its nature and role is less ambiguous than its Anglo-Saxon peers (GCHQ, NSA) its responsibilities make its activities deeply intertwined with those of intelligence agencies, primarily DGSE.\n\n## 2. Armed Forces and the intelligence community\n\nThe armed forces play a role in all six cyber security and defence missions we highlighted just below. While they are in charge of defending only their own systems, they have heightened responsibilities with regards to anticipation, detection, attribution and reaction. But each organisation has specific tasks and roles.\n\n### a) Organisation of military cyber operations\n\nThe armed forces learned to perform cyber operations \"as they went\", developing capabilities and skills as they needed[89]. The 2008 White Paper however was a major doctrinal disruption[90], as well as a wake-up call in the aftermath of the Estonian attacks. In addition to the following White Paper and LPM, the then-Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian launched in 2014 the Cyber Defence Pact. This additional policy document set-out the overall structuring of military cyber defence through six pillars:\n\n- Hardening the security of its own information and weapon systems,\n- Anticipating technical disruptions by investing in research and development,\n- Reinforcing and structuring human resources dedicated to cyberdefence,\n- Developing a national centre of excellence in Brittany,\n- Reinforcing cooperation with allies in Europe and the Atlantic Alliance,\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\n- Fostering a national cyberdefence community and network of trusted partners.\n\nAs a follow-up to the 2017 Review and as a further step to this military structuring, the Armed Forces ministry established a Cyber Defence Command to coordinate cyber operations within the armed forces. ComCyber, as it is colloquially known, sits directly under the Joint Chief of Staff. Defensively, it serves as an hypervision body, a concept that has a specific meaning in that context:91 it receives and correlates all relevant data related to its systems' security. However, in accordance with a recently released ministerial instruction92, each corps and service remains responsible for its own defensive cyber operations and has its own SOC (Security Operations Centre)93. CALID, the Ministry's SOC, assesses global cyber risk so that ComCyber is able to act and advise political authorities to the best of their knowledge. In other words, defensive cyber operations are modelled on subsidiarity.\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nFigure 4 - Simplified graph of military cyber operations, broke-down by their offensive or defensive nature.\n\nComCyber performs defensive operations by delegation of ANSSI, and must notify the Agency of them94. Consequently, and because both institutions need to share data between each other, CALID is partly co-located with ANSSI. ANSSI typically shares non-military IoCs and ComCyber military ones that may impact civilian systems95. This cooperation and the wider relationship between ANSSI and ComCyber is defined in a specific protocol96.\n\nNew capabilities for the armed forces: Integrating the cyber domain in conventional and influence operations\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nThe defensive cyber doctrine entails the prevention, anticipation, detection of and protection against cyber attacks⁹⁷. The scope of the doctrine is limited to reacting to and attributing the attack — within defensive and non-military measures. To perform these tasks, the doctrine sets up an adaptive Permanent Cyber Security Posture, orienting France’s military cyber units to be prepared for what the summary describes as a “peace-crisis-war” continuum⁹⁸. The document thus seems to acknowledge what has been described as a state of unpeace, a state of hostility that falls short of full conflict⁹⁹. This defensive policy is the result of Ministerial Instruction 101000 (Joint Doctrine 3.20)¹⁰⁰. Thus, it covers the whole Ministry and not merely the armed forces.¹⁰¹\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nFigure 5\nCovers of the offensive and defensive cyber operations documents.\n\nIn contrast, the offensive doctrine is only relevant to the armed forces.\n\nUntil the release of this document, the armed forces had focused on defending their own systems—although with an understood element of active defence—while DGSE was in charge of the most sensitive operations, namely, espionage and disruption of adverse systems.\n\nWhat is new in the offensive doctrine is the integration of cyber activity in conventional military operations. The offensive approach is described as stealthy actions aimed at denying the availability or\n\nconfidentiality of adverse systems. Implicitly, the doctrine seems to exclude operations with destructive kinetic effects. It mentions the neutralization of enemy systems, but the concept is ambiguous. Offensive operations can prepare or complement conventional operations—acting as a force multiplier—or substitute them entirely where appropriate. The offensive doctrine also includes counterinfluence operations, aimed at protecting conventional action in cyberspace. Such operations are already performed in the conventional domain through the CIAE, or Joint Centre for Environmental Action, the military influence and civil-military cooperation branch of the French armed forces that was created in 2012. This doctrinal shift reflects an increased perception by the armed forces of propaganda and disinformation threats that could hamper its conventional deployments.\n\nThe new offensive cyber doctrine expands and details the scope of offensive cyber operations. It assumes their preparation and conduct, not only in a clandestine context but also as an integral part of -or substitute for- conventional military operations¹⁰². As we noted however, it also imposes constraints and rules of engagement on the basis of a strict risk management.\n\nb) DGSE\n\nDGSE is the foreign security service and additionally serves as France’s main signals intelligence agency. It sits directly under the Armed Forces Ministry. Until 2014, not much was known publicly by\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nDGSE's activities in the cyber domain. Offensive and espionage operations were deemed to be its responsibilities, but these has been absent from public sight, until forensic analysis¹⁰³ and Snowden-leaks published by Le Monde¹⁰⁴ unveiled a diverse panel of advanced malwares (Casper, Bunny, Babar, Dino) attributed to a French intelligence agency. The leaks seem to have broken an internal taboo. A former DGSE executive, Bernard Barbier, shed some light on such operations shortly after, admitting the agency \"started hacking in 1992\"¹⁰⁵.\n\nc) DGA\n\nDGA, the Defence Procurement Agency, has long developed a cybersecurity department, which sits into its \"maîtrise de l'information\" branch. It is tasked with protecting the information and weapon systems of the armed forces, providing technical expertise in threat intelligence, upstream research (also known as discovery stage) and crisis support¹⁰⁶. As part of such responsibilities, it conducts vulnerability research on armed forces' systems¹⁰⁷ and since 2015 organises cyber-wargames¹⁰⁸.\n\nThe offensive doctrine indicated DGA will adapt its procurement processes to take into account the tempo of operations and nature of these weapons¹⁰⁹. Current processes designed to procure vehicles or submarines, or even major software programs, would be ill-suited. This may hint at the creation of an ad hoc procurement process designed from the ground up to research vulnerabilities and develop exploits and payloads.\n\n3. Competition and opposition of views\n\nParochial priorities and perceptions of the respective institutions depend mostly on the structuring of the cyber security and defence apparatus, which core principle is offense-defence separation.\n\na) Opposition of views between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA\n\nThe opposition of views or the impact of parochial competition appears most clearly between ANSSI and the armed forces, on two different issues: vulnerability disclosure and end-to-end encryption.\n\nContrary to the U.S. or, more recently, the U.K., France has no public vulnerability equities process (VEP). Currently, disclosure and sharing between ANSSI, DGSE and DGA is not formalised and happens on a case-by-case basis¹¹⁰. Guillaume Poupard, ANSSI director, communicated briefly about vulnerability research and disclosure at the agency's end-of-year report. In practice, Poupard said, in case of doubt as to the balance of risk, \"the vulnerability goes to the defence\"¹¹¹.

    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nvulnerability is complex or hard to fix, DGA or DGSE may keep it for themselves.¹¹² This means ANSSI is not aware of all vulnerabilities discovered¹¹³. Although there is no obvious conflict of views on that topic, the debate on the right risk balancing illustrates well how each agencies' responsibilities and culture influences their stance in critical debates such as this one.\n\nWe can witness a more obvious conflict of views on the encryption debate. Poupard, circulated within the government in March 2016 a note arguing strongly against \"exceptional access\" legislation, which would allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bypass encryption, either on device or in transit. The Parliament of Australia recently passed such a law, not without public outcry¹¹⁴. In his note, Poupard states:\n\n“To impose a wide weakening of cryptographic means would affect both digital safety and the freedom of the large majority of law-abiding users, while remaining ineffective against the intended minority target.”\n\nIt appears that, at the time, DGSE was voicing its concerns against encryption¹¹⁵. In 2018, the head of its technical services, Patrick Pailloux, promoted publicly the idea of in-transit exceptional access, while reaffirming the importance of strong (but not end-to-end by definition) encryption¹¹⁶. It is thus likely that Poupard’s note was a direct rebuke to DGSE’s pressures. In such case, it may be a good example of two principles edited by Allison and Zelkow. First, that where you stand depends on where you sit. Less colloquially known as “the face of the issue differs from seat to seat”¹¹⁷, it explains that, as the head of a defensive agency open to the wider public and private sector, it is expected that its director will oppose the weakening of end-to-end encryption. On the opposite, it is expected that DGSE will seek to extend its interception capabilities, as a signals intelligence agency dedicated to foreign security. Second, this “row” may also be the result of the “51-49 principle”. Even if one isn’t completely convinced by the side of the argument, they must “argue much more confidently than they would if they were detached judges”¹¹⁸ because of parochial competition.\n\nb) The role of Foreign Affairs and its relationship with other actors.\n\nThe International Digital Strategy (December 2017) was released only a few months before the Cyber Defence Review (February 2018). Presented as “France’s international strategy”, it could be potentially interpreted as a willingness of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to defend its prerogative in that area. In May 2017, Jean-Yves Le Drian had become Foreign Affairs Minister after almost five years at the Defence Ministry. Although it may have been perceived as such by some in the Armed Forces Ministry¹¹⁹, the international strategy was actually two-years in the making¹²⁰, a long process due in part to its submission to public review.

    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\n# Chapter III - Individuals and processes\n\nIn this short chapter, we attempt a review of key individuals and processes in decision-making. It is a very tentative chapter, because of time and interview constraints. To complete the analysis, more interviews should be conducted at higher political levels.\n\n## 1) Key individuals in decision and action, and factors influencing their perceptions, preferences and stands\n\nDuring its annual press conference, ANSSI director stated, on the topic of vulnerabilities disclosure, that in a structure that separates offence and defence, \"the level of where both meet [in the policy-making tree] is very high. It means that sometimes, we must mobilise the highest authorities on these issues\"¹²³.\n\nBastien Irondelle, in its seminal work on the decision-making process behind the end of French military conscription in 1996, highlighted the everlasting importance of the President.¹²⁴ He detailed how the political impetus Jacques Chirac gave to this major policy decision, in particular during the Defence Councils, made the reform happen¹²⁵. We have demonstrated so far that in the case at hand, French cyber security and defence, the evolution has been gradual, taking place over a decade. However, the same key individuals and processes remain.\n\nIn practice, the range of meaningful decision-making in cyber security and defence starts at ministerial cabinets, up to the Prime Minister and the President¹²⁶. Major crisis and policy decisions are taken at the presidential level, during Defence Councils.¹²⁷ ANSSI is represented by the SGDSN, ComCyber by the Joint Chief of Staff,¹²⁸ who remains responsible for the military action chain¹²⁹.\n\nThe Cyber Club identified by Desforges still exists today and brings together the directors of ANSSI, DGA, ComCyber and the technical departments of both domestic and foreign intelligence agencies (DGSI, DGSE)¹³⁰.\n\nAnother noteworthy trend is the overwhelming majority of military profiles among ANSSI executives. Out of the seven directors and deputy-directors, five have spent most of their careers in the armed forces¹³¹. Such numbers however hide some atypical career paths: the deputy director is a military engineer with a doctorate in public law and an MBA.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338\n\n¹²³ Guiton, \"[Thread] [Team #Wargames] Comment est gérée la question des vulnérabilités dites 'zero-day' en France, où on sépare les missions d'attaque et de défense ?

    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\n## 2) Established processes for aggregating competing perceptions, preferences and stands in decision and action\n\nThe Cyber Strategy sets-out six missions for French cyber defence: cyber threat prevention, anticipation, protection, detection, attribution and reaction. Because of the number of involved actors and their overlap in each mission, the Strategy established four “operational chains” to centralize and streamline public action in the field. They are referred to as the protection, intelligence, judicial investigations and military-action chains. While it is still unclear how these chains work in practice, we were able to collect more information on the committees and groups that coordinate cyber security and defence policy, in theory and in practice.\n\n### a) Recently formalised processes\n\nThe Cyber Strategy created two new committees: An Executive Committee, under the President’s Office, and a Steering Committee, under the SGDSN. Political decisions and policy orientations related to cyberdefence are taken during meetings of the National Security and Defence Council. The Executive Committee is tasked with high-level implementation of the Council’s decisions.\n\nThe Steering Committee’s responsibility is to report on the Strategy’s implementation to the Prime Minister and to prepare the meetings of the Executive Committee[132]. It meets every semester. SGDSN transmits the impetus of political leadership, sets the agenda and ensures the application of the previously decided measures[133]. Ministries and agencies are free to bring forward suggestions[134].\n\nAdditionally, a Cyber Crisis Coordination Centre “supervises cyberdefence”[135] and informs decision-makers. The Centre consists of different groups that act at various timelines, even though their names suggest a short-term crisis perimeter. While the Technical Group acts on short-term incidents, Strategy is a “sub-political”[136] group that acts on mid-term strategy to prepare steering committee meetings. It is open to other ministries,[137] of which most individuals present are administration directors (directeurs d’administration centrale)[138]. They offer regular situation reports to the Prime Minister and the President, and suggests policy options. They meet monthly[139]. The Technico-Operational Group (TechOps), on the other hand, is a restricted group with few institutions represented. Its main purpose is to share specific threat intelligence, and it thus open to only a handful of intelligence agencies[140].\n\n### b) Importance of informal coordination processes\n\nTechOps is only very briefly described in official documents[141]. However it reminds of the “Cyber Club” Alix Desforges described in her thesis[142]. This informal grouping of agency heads took another dimension with the writing process of the Cyber Strategy. According to an official[143], the writing\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",
    "SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)\n\nprocess itself greatly enhanced communication between relevant stakeholders. In other words, the process of creating processes, enhanced communication and coordination between actors. At its creation, TechOps the people and institutions involved warmly welcomed it, and it quickly became indispensable$^{144}$. Some degree of informality remains today. In addition to what we have already described, informal ad-hoc meetings keep happening to deal with specific issues.\n\n***\n\nWhen it comes to formal processes, the highest political authorities remain in charge of major policy-decisions. Informal meetings have lead to the formalisation of intelligence sharing and mid to low level policy coordination.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n# Conclusion\n\nFrom its sovereign principles to the domestic structuring of its cyber security and defence institutions, France revendicates an atypical model. At the top, strategic autonomy infuses major political, financial and policy decisions. Domestically, although officials strongly reaffirm the separation of offence and defence activities, in practice such separation can be described as institutional at best, due to the fluidity of human resources between agencies. This separation has nonetheless a genuine impact on policy-making and public debates: differences in parochial priorities and organisational cultures between ANSSI and the armed forces create conflicting views on tough topics such as end-to-end encryption or vulnerability disclosure. Finally, while the executive remains key in decision-making, informal processes and meta-processes have been instrumental in the development of an efficient state cyber security and defence community. To complete and build-up on this exploratory paper, further research on how such processes work out in practice could be conducted.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338",

    "abstract": "From Ministries to national agencies and cyber commands, the amount of public institutions involved in cyber security and defence matters is multiplying in most states, in a trend that reflects the pervasive nature of the domain. France is no exception, and it has in a few years conceptualized and adopted a comprehensive framework involving dozens of institutions and policy documents. Who does what? How are decisions made? How can we make sense of it all? The foundational work of Allison and Zelikow (1999) on decision-making adopts, for a specific set of events, three distinct models analysing respectively the state as a rational entity, its institutions, and their decision and policy processes. Applying these models to the current apparatus of the French government, the paper seeks to provide a preliminary toolkit for future case-studies. Although incomplete and imperfect, it would provide scholars, practitioners or journalists with a better understanding of 1) the current French cyber security and defence apparatus and its funding political principles, 2) how policy-making in this area happens in practice, and 3) why policy decisions in that domain were taken. To do so, we combine an extensive review of the literature with a series of interviews with senior officials. The views expressed are those of the author only Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3432338 SSRN WORKING PAPER SERIES (V2.3.3)",
