INTRODUCTION\nState-on-state conflict governed by generally clear rules of engagement was the predominant mode of warfare in the mid-twentieth century.³ Now, almost two decades into the post-9/11 world, state and non-state actors, transnational terrorists, and cyber operators thrive in twilight zones of domestic and international law.⁴ The past few years carry signs of troubles to come. Transnational terrorism, struck down in certain areas, but emboldened by twenty years of muddled U.S. and Allied counterterrorism policy, threatens again to break out of its Middle Eastern base.⁵ China is stealing U.S. trade secrets at a rate beyond alarming and forcing American companies to work inside China or forfeit profitable trade deals.⁶ Russia, a shadow of what it once was during the height of the Soviet Union,⁷ now seeks to project strength through information warfare against the West.⁸ North Korea too has learned how to fight in the cyber domain — its hackers rob banks worldwide and hold companies hostage through advanced cyber operations.⁹ As sanctions continue to strangle Iran’s economy, its cyber forces strike repeatedly at U.S. financial institutions in the hope of securing political and economic concessions.¹⁰ To triumph in this complex and increasingly cyber-reliant world, the U.S. must accomplish four goals: (1) stop terrorist financing; (2) attribute and punish state and non-state malicious actors; (3) protect the private sector; and (4) realize a systematic, predictive method for cyber defense.\n³ Sean D.

Changing Norms\nRules in warfare date to ancient Greece.¹¹ Almost two thousand years later, during the rise of the early modern world a “series of treaties that formed the Peace of Westphalia [and] ended the Thirty Years War . . . created a system of legally equal [sovereignties]” and marked the beginning of international law as applied to state-on-state conflict.¹² A leap forward in what is now termed the Law of Armed Conflict¹³ (“LOAC”) occurred in 1863.¹⁴ In the midst of the American Civil War, President Lincoln’s Administration empowered Francis Lieber to write General Order No. 100, Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field which provided “basic rules [regarding lawful and unlawful] combat, including [discussions] relating to the treatment of civilians” during hostilities.¹⁵ General Order No. 100 became the template for all subsequent LOAC codes.¹⁶ Most significantly, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which are comprised of four treaties, were adopted after World War II to mandate humane treatment of persons in wartime.¹⁷ The Geneva Conventions established rules that now appear straightforward when juxtaposed\n¹¹ Rosa Ehrenreich Brooks, *War Everywhere: Rights, National Security Law, and the Law of Armed Conflict in the Age of Terror*, 153 U.

Targeting Evolved\nDuring the twentieth century, when the model of state-on-state conflict prevailed, the LOAC targeting analysis for standard rules of engagement was more straightforward because determinations often involved status-based as opposed to conduct-based targets.⁴⁴ Status-based targets are lawful combatants who, per Geneva Convention III requirements, act “[u]nder responsible command; [w]ear a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; [c]arry arms openly; and [a]bide by the laws of war.”⁴⁵ In contrast, conduct-based targets consistently violate LOAC standards by, for example, attacking uniformed lawful combatants while wearing civilian clothes in order to blend and hide themselves within civilian populations.⁴⁶ Ahmad Fadhil Nazzal al-Khalaylah, who later renamed himself Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was a notorious practitioner of perfidy and treachery in Iraq and routinely violated the rules of LOAC.⁴⁷ Al-Zarqawi and his followers were difficult to target in Iraq because they did not wear uniforms⁴⁸ and choose to commit on-camera beheadings in safe houses and bombing civilians over direct combat with U.S.-led coalition forces.⁴⁹ On June 8, 2006, a U.S. precision airstrike targeting “a single dwelling in a wooded area\n⁴³ Id.

Might persons loosely affiliated with ISIS goals living in Manila, learning bomb-making tradecraft online, and counseling like-minded associates qualify as conduct-based targets?53 To make the analogy even more attenuated, how about Manila ISIS sympathizers who are effective online ideologues and later credited as sources of inspiration by lone-wolf actors who targeted civilians?\n## III.

According to the U.N. Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, estimates of the Taliban’s drug income range from $15 to $27 million per year. See Rep. of the Committee of Experts Appointed Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1333 (2000), ¶ 15(a), Regarding Monitoring of the Arms Embargo against the Taliban and the Closure of Terrorist Training Camps in the Taliban-held Areas of Afghanistan, ¶ 60, U.N.

In 1979, Iranian revolutionaries held more than fifty American diplomats and citizens hostage for 444 days. During the hostage crisis, the U.S. imposed the first of many sanctions regimes on Iran, freezing all Iranian assets until 1981, when the hostages were released. The Reagan administration reinstated trade restrictions in response to Iran's state sponsorship of terrorism . . . prohibiting nearly all imports from Iran to the United States.\nIran continued to sponsor terrorism in the region into the 1990s, including Hamas militants opposed to the Middle East peace process. When Iran then revived its efforts to enrich uranium, President Clinton . . . imposed a full trade and investment embargo, barring all U.S. trade with Iran. Congress went a step further and passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (now known as the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA) which . . . imposed U.S. trade penalties on foreign companies determined to have invested more than $20 million in Iranian petroleum development. . .\nHowever, the Clinton and then Bush administrations preferred to use diplomatic pressure to convince foreign companies to leave the Iranian market rather than impose sanctions using the ISA authorities. . .\nBy 2006, Iran's progress toward a nuclear weapon reached a crisis point [and] the global community responded from 2006 to 2010 with new United Nations (UN) sanctions . . . in a series of UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). Critically, UNSCR 1929 in 2010 recognized a \"potential connection between Iran's revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities.\"302 Claiming international legitimacy from the UNSCR language, the United States revived the ISA secondary sanctions regime and expanded it with new legislation aimed at cutting off all foreign support to Iran's energy sector.303\nIn 2015, the Obama Administration, alongside the P5+1 Group — comprised of the U.S., United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany — agreed to a long-term deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program.304 Per the accord, \"Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.\"305 The agreement was termed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (\"JCPOA\") and\n302 Id. at 247.\n303 S.

J. SCI. &amp; TECH. L.\n[Vol. 25:2]\nA fundamental tenet of modern financial institutions is “AML is a significant component of cybersecurity, such that AML measures cannot be effective without cybersecurity,” and cybersecurity at financial institutions cannot be accomplished without robust AML policies and procedures.³⁵⁶ According to one compliance expert:\nCybersecurity is intersecting in a new way with BSA/AML compliance, and it’s becoming increasingly important that BSA/AML officers are aware of the kinds of cyberthreats out there. . . . There used to be a lot of silos out there, where compliance, risk management, network security, [were] separate parts, but today’s cybersecurity environment means all those departments need to be interconnected in a new way.³⁵⁷\nTechnology is certainly part of the solution, but greater and better communication amongst BSA/AML/CFT and cybersecurity professionals within the government and private sector offers a long-term path to success. The past few years have seen progress toward this concept; for instance, on October 25, 2016, FinCEN issued a cyber threats advisory wherein it explained the proliferation of cyber events is a significant threat to the U.S. financial system.³⁵⁸ Accordingly, FinCEN prompted financial institutions to use the well-known SAR reporting mechanism to report anomalous cyber events (“cyber SARs”).³⁵⁹ The rationale behind the cyber SAR is that information sharing between the government and private sector can help “guard against and report money laundering, terrorism financing, and cyber-enabled crime.”³⁶⁰ Traditionally, the cyber domain was foreign to BSA/AML teams in the private sector, and most departments lacked expertise and cross-training in the disciplines, but the FinCEN cyber SAR may help upend the longstanding but unhelpful paradigm.³⁶¹\nRecall the 176 days Iranian hackers targeted U.S. companies.³⁶² Critically, “[t]he NSA knew in advance [about Iran’s] intent to penetrate the [financial\n³⁵⁶ Harry Dixon, *Maintaining Individual Liability in AML and Cybersecurity at New York’s Financial Institutions*, 5 PENN ST.

CONCLUSION\nThe U.S. stands at a crossroads. Will it forge a new world on its terms or succumb to a thousand cuts perpetrated by malicious actors across the globe? The current domestic and international AML and CFT regimes are insufficient. As America learned to its sorrow, devastating terrorist attacks can be inexpensive to action and terrorists are not easily targeted in this new world. The NYDFS Regulations offer hope by binding together American foreign policy and financial sector protections.

Specifically, the NSA must do more to protect private sector industries, especially the financial sector.

Education is certainly part of the answer; predictive analysis of threats is possible with sufficient knowledge of global events. In the mid-twentieth century, a famous maxim for a world at war was “loose lips sink ships” but in modern times a more appropriate slogan might be “communicate to protect.” Until America learns to communicate across federal and state governments, across CI sectors and disciplines, it leaves itself vulnerable to continued attack.\nAs befits a new battlefield, the U.S. is bringing novel arms to bear.

Now, almost two decades into the post-9/11 world, state and non-state actors, transnational terrorists, and cyber operators thrive in twilight zones of domestic and international law. The past few years carry signs of troubles to come. Transnational terrorism, struck down in certain areas, but emboldened by twenty years of muddled U.S. and Allied counterterrorism policy, threatens again to break out of its Middle Eastern base. China is stealing U.S. trade secrets at a rate beyond alarming and forcing American companies to work inside China or forfeit profitable trade deals. Russia, a shadow of what it once was during the height of the Soviet Union, now seeks to project strength through information warfare against the West. North Korea too has learned how to fight in the cyber domain — its hackers rob banks worldwide and hold companies hostage through advanced cyber operations. As sanctions continue to strangle Iran’s economy, its cyber forces strike repeatedly at U.S. financial institutions in the hope of securing political and economic concessions. To triumph in this complex and increasingly cyber-reliant world, the U.S. must accomplish four goals: (1) stop terrorist financing; (2) attribute and punish state and non-state malicious actors; (3) protect the private sector; and (4) realize a systematic, predictive method for cyber defense.\n Sean D.

NEW CONCEPTIONS OF WARFARE\n### A. Changing Norms\nRules in warfare date to ancient Greece. Almost two thousand years later, during the rise of the early modern world a “series of treaties that formed the Peace of Westphalia [and] ended the Thirty Years War . . . created a system of legally equal [sovereignties]” and marked the beginning of international law as applied to state-on-state conflict. A leap forward in what is now termed the Law of Armed Conflict (“LOAC”) occurred in 1863. In the midst of the American Civil War, President Lincoln’s Administration empowered Francis Lieber to write General Order No. 100, Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field which provided “basic rules [regarding lawful and unlawful] combat, including [discussions] relating to the treatment of civilians” during hostilities. General Order No. 100 became the template for all subsequent LOAC codes. Most significantly, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which are comprised of four treaties, were adopted after World War II to mandate humane treatment of persons in wartime. The Geneva Conventions established rules that now appear straightforward when juxtaposed\n Rosa Ehrenreich Brooks, *War Everywhere: Rights, National Security Law, and the Law of Armed Conflict in the Age of Terror*, 153 U.

As Sean Murphy has argued:\nMany of the controversies [arose] because the two [operative] paradigms... within the Geneva Conventions – . . . ‘international’ armed conflict (i.e., conflict between two or more states[, or “IAC”]) and . . . ‘noninternational’ armed conflict between [intra-]state and nonstate actors ([usually deemed a civil war, or “NIAC”]) do not fit the [typology] of global terrorism, [which is the province of] transnational conflict [amongst] state and nonstate actors.\nYet more difficult is the “unprivileged enemy belligerent” (UEB) category arising from NIACs and constituting persons, which encompasses one who:\n(A) has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners; (B) has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against\n See generally id.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, art. 51(3), opened for signature Dec. 12, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Protocol I].\n Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4(A)(2), Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135.\n Protocol I, supra note 19.

In the complex post-9/11 world, the U.S. maintains UEBs can be lawfully detained until the end of hostilities. Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court likewise endorse this position even though it continues to lack broad international support.\nThe normative understandings regarding the application of *jus ad bellum*, the portion of international law governing when states may resort to force, changed tremendously since 9/11.

Targeting Evolved\nDuring the twentieth century, when the model of state-on-state conflict prevailed, the LOAC targeting analysis for standard rules of engagement was more straightforward because determinations often involved status-based as opposed to conduct-based targets. Status-based targets are lawful combatants who, per Geneva Convention III requirements, act “[u]nder responsible command; [w]ear a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; [c]arry arms openly; and [a]bide by the laws of war.” In contrast, conduct-based targets consistently violate LOAC standards by, for example, attacking uniformed lawful combatants while wearing civilian clothes in order to blend and hide themselves within civilian populations. Ahmad Fadhil Nazzal al-Khalaylah, who later renamed himself Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was a notorious practitioner of perfidy and treachery in Iraq and routinely violated the rules of LOAC. Al-Zarqawi and his followers were difficult to target in Iraq because they did not wear uniforms and choose to commit on-camera beheadings in safe houses and bombing civilians over direct combat with U.S.-led coalition forces.

Might persons loosely affiliated with ISIS goals living in Manila, learning bomb-making tradecraft online, and counseling like-minded associates qualify as conduct-based targets?53 To make the analogy even more attenuated, how about Manila ISIS sympathizers who are effective online ideologues and later credited as sources of inspiration by lone-wolf actors who targeted civilians?\n## III. FINANCIAL WARFARE\n## A. Little Flash, Big Bang\nConventional armed conflicts tend to conform to predictable patterns whereby combatants are deployed against fixed units.54 Terrorism embraces unconventional tactics because it is a means to challenge stronger powers.55 No universal definition of terrorism exists, although it is understood to have four key components: \"(1) a violent act; (2) civilian victim(s); (3) the [terrorists] have a political, religious, or social motive; and (4) terrorists seek to provoke a political reaction and spread fear.\"56 A peculiar feature of terrorism amongst transnational violence is that \"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom\n\n[Vol. 25:2\nfighter,” i.e., terrorism is not inherently perceived as either criminal or illegitimate.57 Indeed, there are certain sets of circumstances such as struggles for political voice or self-determination about which there is no consensus whether terrorist-type tactics are unlawful but excusable or unlawful yet justifiable or perhaps even lawful according to international norms.58 These ambiguities and varying perspectives are why international law, in part, has not reached a universal definition of terrorism.59\nIn certain respects, terrorism is an ancient gambit and a modern manifestation of old wine in a new bottle.60 It was first associated with the excesses of the French Revolution’s “regime de la terreur” and evolved over a century to describe non-state actors applying their aptitude for subversion, disruption and anarchy to the controlling Russian and French governments of the late nineteenth century.61 Following World War II, terrorists made headlines around the world by hijacking civilian aircraft.62 In response, “[t]he international community enacted treaties” and increased airport security measures which, taken together, reduced the incidence of harm to passengers.63 It was at this moment, the late 1960s and early 1970s, that terrorists relearned the valuable lesson of grabbing headlines, which was critical for the emergence of a new type of transnational terrorism.64\nGenerally, twenty-first century terrorism arises from a mix of religious fervor reinforced with political ideology and geopolitical goals.65 The initial campaign against Al Qaeda following 9/11 “has morphed into transnational conflicts against various terrorist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and [Syria (ISIS)] that did not exist in 2001.”66 This metastasized to pose a greater threat to society because terrorists are harder to deter; the relationship between the means employed and the goals are more attenuated; attacks are increasing in scale; and the proliferation and greater availability of weapons of mass destruction coupled\n\n2019]\nCYBER REALPOLITIK\n\nIt is axiomatic that terrorist attacks do not require large amounts of money and their impact is disproportionate to their cost. 9/11 cost Al Qaeda approximately $500,000. The cost to the U.S. was upwards of $3.3 trillion. Put differently, al Qaeda received a $7 million return on investment for every dollar it spent planning and carrying out its attacks. The cost in human life was far greater. On 9/11, 19 men hijacked four fuel-laden commercial jets bound for West Coast destinations. 2,753 people lost their lives in Manhattan when American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the Twin Towers. 184 people died when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon and 40 more people were killed aboard United Airlines Flight 93 when the plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. For the U.S. military, Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn, Inherent Resolve, and Freedom’s Sentinel resulted in 6,978 U.S. casualties.\n## B. Funding Terror\nTerrorist groups like “ISIS, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Boko Haram rely upon vast networks of money moving around the world” to finance their ideologies. Without this extensive network of funding, most terrorist organizations would be unable to launch attacks or find the impact of their attacks blunted. Khalid Sheik Mohammed, “the principle architect of the 9/11 attacks,” used wire transfers and funds that were delivered to the U.S. or deposited abroad and then accessed from within the U.S. His nephew, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, aided the 9/11 terrorists by wiring $114,500 to the U.S. that was utilized by an associated cell\n See Young, supra note 61, at 28-29.\n 9/11 Panel: al Qaeda Planned to Hijack 10 Planes, CNN (June 17, 2004), http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/16/911.commission/ [https://perma.cc/DP3TGLP6].\n Kimberly Amadeo, How the 9/11 Attacks Affect the Economy Today, BALANCE (Nov. 6, 2018), https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-9-11-attacks-still-affect-the-economy-today-3305536 [https://perma.cc/C38M-G4NK].\n See id.\n September 11 Terror Attacks Fast Facts, CNN (Sept. 3, 2018), https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/27/us/september-11-anniversary-fast-facts/index.html [https://perma.cc/4ZKJ-GWYE].\n Id.\n Casualty Status, U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

Aziz sent multiple “bank-to-bank transfers –including transactions for $10,000, $20,000, and $70,000–to bank accounts at SunTrust Bank in Florida.” The transaction amounts to SunTrust are notable because, pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the bank was required to report Customer Transaction Reports (“CTRs”) above $10,000 to the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) and file a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) for any wire transfer they deemed suspicious. Tragically, SunTrust never filed a SAR in connection with the 9/11 attacks and indeed no financial institution filed a SAR in connection with any of the 19 hijackers’ transactions before 9/11.\nTerrorist organizations go about raising money in different ways; some rely on criminal activity whereas others acquire revenue from private donations from interested persons or groups. They do so because “[f]inancing is required not only to fund specific missions but to meet the broader organizational costs of developing and maintaining a terrorist organization and to create an enabling environment necessary to sustain their activities.” While the direct cost of mounting specific attacks is alarmingly low, it does cost money to maintain a terrorist network, enable recruitment, sustain terror cells, and fund planning and procurement between attacks. Further, terror groups require funds “to finance the ostensibly legitimate activities required to provide a veil of legitimacy for their organizations.” As a result, “[d]isrupting terrorist financing involves both systemic safeguards, which protect financial systems from abuse, and targeted economic sanctions informed by counterterrorism intelligence.”\n Id. at 224.

Disrupt to Protect\nPresident Bush declared the “War on Terror” on September 20, 2001.92 Four days later, he instigated the “Financial War on Terror” when he said the U.S. “will starve terrorists of funding, turn them against each other, rout them out of their safe hiding places, and bring them to justice.”93 President Bush made an explicit connection between stopping terrorist financing and preventing real-world attacks on Americans when he said “[m]oney is the lifeblood of terrorist organizations.”94 His announcement was followed by frequent declarations — notably from David D. Aufhauser, General Counsel to the U.S. Department of\n\n[Vol. 25:2\nthe Treasury — calling for more efforts aimed at freezing terrorist funding sources. In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Aufhauser explained that on 9/11 he was at an international money laundering conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in which there was a lot of self-congratulations on current efforts to curb money laundering. However, when the entire conference watched the World Trade Center buildings collapse, Aufhauser explained that:\nIt was . . . the realization that the gathering had been looking, for too long, at the world through the wrong end of a telescope. Money had been spirited around the globe by means and measures and in denominations that mocked detection. The most serious threat to our well-being was now clean money intended to kill, not dirty money seeking a place of hiding.\n“Terrorist groups and criminal networks share many of the same characteristics, including methods and sources of finance.” In 2011, Yury Fedotov, the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, remarked “criminal profits from drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, and money laundering represent an increasing share of terrorist finance.” Prior to 9/11, the U.S. government lacked the know-how to stop terrorist financing. When the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) was admonished for its lack of information on al-Qaeda’s finances pre-9/11, its lackluster response was “terrorist financing [is] an extraordinarily hard target.” Indeed, the U.S. had “considered it futile to monitor al Qaeda’s money\n David Aufhauser, *Testimony of David D.

In a certain sense, financial warfare is not a new concept for the U.S. government; the U.S. first codified presidential authority to employ economic sanctions against foreign countries in 1917 in the Trading with the Enemy Act (“TWEA”). Some decades later the U.S. created the Treasury Department’s “Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to target Chinese assets during the Korean Conflict.” 9/11 was a watershed moment, however, and exigencies necessitated creative measures to halt terrorist financing. Two weeks after the attacks, President Bush issued Executive Order 13224 (“E.O. 13224”) which froze the assets of twenty-seven individuals and organizations. E.O. 13224 “centered on two goals: stopping the flow of money to al Qaeda and convincing the public that something was being done.” E.O. 13224 declared a national emergency and allowed President Bush to use the powers of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”). Using this power under IEEPA, President Bush authorized the Treasury Department “to freeze the assets of foreign and domestic organizations within [U.S. jurisdiction], including assets of financial\nhttp://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Monograph.pdf [https://perma.cc/BQ38-GPRL].\n Justin Santolli, Note, The Terrorist Finance Tracking Program: Illuminating the Shortcomings of the European Union’s Antiquated Data Privacy Directive, 40 GEO.

Title III of the PATRIOT Act sets forth the regulations concerning countering terrorist financing (“CFT”). The Act strengthened the executive branch’s ability to freeze and seize assets, broadened the President’s power under the IEEPA, and expanded U.S. extraterritorial jurisdiction.\nThe PATRIOT Act was so revolutionary in certain respects that David Aufhauser described Title III as “‘the smart bomb of terrorist financing.’” Amongst the Act’s most significant measures was its requirement that “banks, savings associations, credit unions, securities broker-dealers, mutual funds, futures commission merchants, and introducing brokers enhance their customer identification measures.” All U.S. financial institutions were required to maintain anti-money laundering (“AML”) programs. Additionally, the Act expanded the number of entities required to file SARs: “[w]here before the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 required banks and credit unions to report $10,000 or more in cash transfers, now ‘any person who is engaged in a trade or business’ that received more than $10,000 in cash must file an SAR.”\nDespite the PATRIOT Act’s broad scope, some critics maintained that it was a “hastily assembled” version of existing AML legislation from the 1980s and 1990s originally intended to combat drug cartels and enterprise crime.

International Efforts\nThe U.S. “spends more on its defense budget than the next eight states combined but it [does not] go after terrorist finance on its own,” since it requires assistance from the international community. From a global perspective, the creation of a comprehensive AML/CFT strategy was “drawn from the idea that cutting off terrorist funds could slow down, disturb, and dismantle terrorist networks.” To implement this strategy, “two international organizations—namely, the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) created and perpetuate[d] a system of measures to prohibit acts of financing, freeze terrorist funds, and track down terrorists.” After 9/11, “substantial efforts [were] made to assure that countries [had] adopted and implemented laws consistent with these measures.” Nonetheless, these programs receive scant attention relative to their importance and there continues\nlaundering “is typically a three-step process: (i) placement—the launderer puts criminally-derived money into a legitimate enterprise; (ii) layering—the launderer places the money in . . . pretextual transactions to obfuscate the original source; and (iii) integration—the launderer [changes] the funds into non-cash instruments” like bank notes and letters of credit to finance criminal activities.

A primary mechanism by which the FATF seeks to accomplish its goals is by having its members implement “Recommendations” which do not have the force of law although “failure to implement them is grounds for expulsion from the organization.” Despite their soft-law nature, Recommendations hold significant sway because countries do not want to be excluded from the FATF. On the contrary, nations blacklisted by the FATF for non-compliance understand there can be significant consequences. In February 2018, the U.S. urged the FATF to place Pakistan, which was on the non-compliant list from 2012 to 2015, on notice it was again violating CFT standards. Pakistan was apprehensive that the move would further isolate the country from the global community, damage its weak economy, cripple its banking sector and hinder its access to international markets. Consequently, Pakistan scrambled in recent months to get back into compliance.

Pursuant to CTITF guidelines, “[t]errorism financing incorporates the distinct activities of fund-raising, storing and concealing funds, using funds to sustain terrorist organizations and infrastructure, and transferring funds to support or carry out specific terrorist attacks.” “Money laundering and terrorist financing are characterized by somewhat opposing dynamics and objectives.” Money laundering’s goal is to eradicate the illicit origin of funds to prevent actors from enjoying the profits of their predicate crimes. Terrorist financing implies “money dirtying,” which is the reverse of money laundering. In other words, terrorist financing aims to divert “clean money” into terrorist activities while money launderers want to conceal the origin of “dirty money.” Notwithstanding differences, domestic and international law tend to construe these activities in a similar light and the policy decision is often girded by arguments of rationality and efficiency. Effective strategies against both terrorist financing and money laundering necessitate a “horizontal strategy” embracing a wide variety of fields, including criminal law, administrative law, and … international law.” Moreover, terrorist financing and money laundering presuppose the deployment of financial institutions for illicit\n Id.\n Id.\n U.N.

Finally, money laundering can be of singular importance in concealing the illegal origin and destination of funds directed to finance terrorist activities. For these reasons, combining AML/CFT strategies is usually good policy. For example, the Money Laundering Control Act makes it a crime to knowingly “conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or . . . to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law.” Further, many “federal agencies investigate cases of suspected money laundering and terrorist financing, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”\n## IV.

Public-Private Information Sharing\nAs John Chung has argued:\nA basic challenge in cybersecurity is the fact almost eighty-five percent of America’s CI is owned by the private sector. . . . CI systems are [therefore] owned and operated by [a myriad of] businesses, which in turn may have thousands more private entities who . . . supply, service, or access the CI systems. The national cybersecurity framework [published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”)] relies on private actors to invest in a sufficient amount of cybersecurity measures to [mitigate or] avoid catastrophic damage to CI. However . . . [t]he government does not impose [a security regime on the private sector], leaving it to the private-sector entities to set their own practices and policies for protecting their computer systems.\nFurther, “[o]n February 18, 2013 the private cybersecurity firm Mandiant [released] a report on a group it [dubbed] Advanced Persistent Threat 1 (APT1) that had purportedly breached almost 150 organizations since 2007.” Mandiant asserted APT1 is most likely a Chinese Army cyber unit.; although China denounced the accusations, the U.S. government shifted from oblique allusions to openly calling China out as a significant source of cyber events.

On the other hand, it\n *Id.* The goal of the NIST Framework is to guide the development of a voluntary risk-based approach to cybersecurity. *NAT’L INST.

For instance, “private companies investigate networks of malware-infected systems used by transnational criminal groups for financial fraud,” while the government has become a true market participant by buying software vulnerabilities on the gray market and purposefully not disclosing them to software makers that could remedy the flaws. Yet, “[t]he private sector is struggling to contend with the growing scope, scale, and complexity of cyber” operations.\nAs it stands, the U.S. government and the private sector are stuck at an impasse concerning cybersecurity information sharing. U.S. companies argue that the federal government should take an active role in its cyber defense while the intelligence community is loath to part with its classification methods lest technical sources and methods be placed at risk. A solution with increasing support is a national classified cyber information-sharing network between the federal government and the private sector. In this schema, an already-existing classified network for defense contractors would be expanded to private CI companies. This is not entirely far-fetched since David Sanger, the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, remarked that the U.S. should come to grips with certain realities to remain a decisive actor in the cyber domain to include ending the reflexive attitude federal cyber defenses must extend to government networks and no further. It is worth noting that public-private information sharing only works when the private sector acts on the information it receives.\n“On September 7, 2017, Equifax, one of the [biggest] consumer-credit reporting agencies in the world,” announced that its consumer information had\n Kristen E.

However, instead of the tariffs acting as a deterrent and punishing China for its actions, reports indicate China stepped up hacking operations against the U.S. As a result, the Trump Administration is beginning to move beyond a tariff-only approach and is broadening its trade battle with China using a plan to use export controls and indictments to deter China’s cyber aggression.\nChina is unquestionably a first-rate cyber power. In February 2014, the Chinese Communist Party created the “Cybersecurity and Informatization Leading Group,” chaired by President Xi Jinping, to address cybersecurity concerns. The establishment of the group showcases how senior leaders in China view cyber as a critical national priority. In June 2017, China ushered in a hardline cyber law requiring domestic and foreign firms to submit to security checks and store user data within the country.

When Iran then revived its efforts to enrich uranium, President Clinton . . . imposed a full trade and investment embargo, barring all U.S. trade with Iran. Congress went a step further and passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (now known as the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA) which . . . imposed U.S. trade penalties on foreign companies determined to have invested more than $20 million in Iranian petroleum development. . .\nHowever, the Clinton and then Bush administrations preferred to use diplomatic pressure to convince foreign companies to leave the Iranian market rather than impose sanctions using the ISA authorities. . .\nBy 2006, Iran's progress toward a nuclear weapon reached a crisis point [and] the global community responded from 2006 to 2010 with new United Nations (UN) sanctions . . . in a series of UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). Critically, UNSCR 1929 in 2010 recognized a \"potential connection between Iran's revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities.\"302 Claiming international legitimacy from the UNSCR language, the United States revived the ISA secondary sanctions regime and expanded it with new legislation aimed at cutting off all foreign support to Iran's energy sector.303\nIn 2015, the Obama Administration, alongside the P5+1 Group — comprised of the U.S., United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany — agreed to a long-term deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program.304 Per the accord, \"Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.\"305 The agreement was termed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (\"JCPOA\") and\n\n[Vol. 25:2 -\nwas a signature foreign policy achievement for President Obama. At the time, the Republican-controlled Congress was skeptical about JCPOA because it perceived Iran as untrustworthy and was sympathetic to Israel’s security concerns over the deal. On May 8, 2018, the Trump Administration ended U.S. participation in JCPOA. President Trump declared JCPOA was “so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.”\nAn analysis of Iran’s behavior post-Stuxnet through the end of the JCPOA is highly valuable because it offers a blueprint for how cyber defenders can and should view the world. From this analysis, it is clear that reliable predictive analysis that informs defensive postures and protocols is the single most valuable commodity for cyber defenders and ultimately sovereign nations:\nStarting in 2009, Iran’s uranium centrifuges began failing, and nobody understood why. Nearly one thousand of Iran’s six thousand centrifuges were destroyed over the course of a year. In the summer of 2010, a computer security firm in Belarus was hired to troubleshoot Iranian computers that mysteriously kept crashing—and in this investigation, the firm stumbled upon a series of files that would later become known as the Stuxnet virus. The Stuxnet virus was recognized as the “world’s first digital weapon.” It was a complex malware designed to infiltrate secure Iranian nuclear facilities, infect the industrial controllers that operated the nuclear centrifuges, and destroy those centrifuges by manipulating the pressure levels and rotor speeds inside them . . . [d]espite the significant attempt to cover its origins, experts concluded that Stuxnet was a joint United States and Israeli production.\nOn the eleventh anniversary of 9/11, an Iranian group calling itself the “Cyber Fighters of IZZ ad-Din al-Qassam” claimed credit for a series of targeted operations against specific U.S. financial institutions.

In a Twitter post, the group claimed responsibility and argued, “the attacks [were] launched in retaliation for the continued presence on YouTube of the American-made film The Innocence of Muslims” that portrayed Muslims in general, and the prophet Mohammed in particular, “in an unflattering light.” The group “vowed to continue [its] attacks until the U.S. President ordered the film removed from the Internet.” Yet contrary to their claims, the “Cyber Fighters of IZZ ad-Din al-Qassam” did not indiscriminately attack financial institutions. Rather, the targets were carefully vetted and were primarily institutions that, “complied with the terms of the ongoing U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, part of the . . . effort to halt Iran’s nuclear arms program.” Further, the anonymous Twitter account from which the group issued its demand to remove the film was the same that posted messages following an earlier cyberattack on the internal computer network of Aramco, the Saudi Arabian oil conglomerate.

The cyber intrusions occurred against the backdrop of the U.S. and Iran negotiating a deal curbing Iran’s nuclear-power ambitions. Overall, the Obama Administration was cautious and largely defensive regarding the Ababil operation:\nEven a proposal by then National Security Agency (NSA) Director, Keith Alexander, to shut down the computer [systems] in Iran responsible for the DDoS attacks by a covert cyber operation [was seemingly rejected by officials] because [they] “were unsure that the action could be so precise and expressed concern that affecting a server in Iran—even if in self-defense—would represent a violation of its sovereignty” and [provoke] escalation.\nAnd the possibility “of using diplomatic back-channels was [likewise shelved because] it was [argued] that doing so might prompt the Iranians to intensify their attacks.” In turn, the Obama Administration’s decision to refrain from an immediate, vocal, and firm response to stop the Ababil operation frustrated and undermined the helpless victim-institutions and led them to seriously consider self-help options like hack-backs against the attackers’ servers.\n Id.\n Id.\n U.S. Dep’t of Justice Press Release, supra note 315.\n See supra text accompanying notes 304-306.

In the wake of President Trump’s ending U.S participation in JCPOA and reinstituting severe economic sanctions, Iran became the number one “trending threat” at major U.S. banks. John Hultquist, director of research at the leading cybersecurity firm FireEye, recently asserted, “Banks are taking a hard look at Iranian threat actors right now. We’ve advised all of our clients in the critical infrastructure space to consider the historic hostile actions of Iranian actors given [the return of sanctions].” An appreciation of political realities and how cyber defenses might be adjusted accordingly is a critical step in the right direction. To this end, New York recently passed legislation aimed at narrowing the delta between AML/CFT regulatory schemes and OFAC foreign policy considerations while promoting enhanced cybersecurity measures\n## C. NYDFS Regulations: A Model for America\nThe New York Department of Financial Services recently adopted a regulation that provides a greater level of structure to existing federal BSA and AML laws that pertain to New York state regulated institutions. The regulation was created due to “identified shortcomings in the transactions monitoring and filtering programs’ of certain financial institutions” and to “a lack of [sufficient] governance, oversight, and accountability at senior levels.” Critically, Financial Services Regulation 504 (“Regulation 504”) aims to fill a gap “in the current regulatory scheme promulgated by . . . current BSA/AML laws and regulations and [OFAC] requirements.” OFAC, an agency within the Department of Treasury, “administers and enforces economic and trade\n *Id.*\n Jose Pagliery, *US Banks Prepare for Iranian Cyberattacks as Retaliation for Sanctions*, CNN (Nov. 9, 2018), https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/09/tech/iran-sanctions-us-banks-cyber-hack-invs/index.html [https://perma.cc/MJ59-7AFF].\n *Id.* Economists posit the internet generates for the global economy between $2 - $3 trillion a year which means that perhaps as much as one-fifth of the internet’s total value is disappearing due to illicit cyber events every 365 days.

According to one compliance expert:\nCybersecurity is intersecting in a new way with BSA/AML compliance, and it’s becoming increasingly important that BSA/AML officers are aware of the kinds of cyberthreats out there. . . . There used to be a lot of silos out there, where compliance, risk management, network security, [were] separate parts, but today’s cybersecurity environment means all those departments need to be interconnected in a new way.\nTechnology is certainly part of the solution, but greater and better communication amongst BSA/AML/CFT and cybersecurity professionals within the government and private sector offers a long-term path to success. The past few years have seen progress toward this concept; for instance, on October 25, 2016, FinCEN issued a cyber threats advisory wherein it explained the proliferation of cyber events is a significant threat to the U.S. financial system. Accordingly, FinCEN prompted financial institutions to use the well-known SAR reporting mechanism to report anomalous cyber events (“cyber SARs”). The rationale behind the cyber SAR is that information sharing between the government and private sector can help “guard against and report money laundering, terrorism financing, and cyber-enabled crime.” Traditionally, the cyber domain was foreign to BSA/AML teams in the private sector, and most departments lacked expertise and cross-training in the disciplines, but the FinCEN cyber SAR may help upend the longstanding but unhelpful paradigm.\nRecall the 176 days Iranian hackers targeted U.S. companies.

CONCLUSION\nThe U.S. stands at a crossroads. Will it forge a new world on its terms or succumb to a thousand cuts perpetrated by malicious actors across the globe? The current domestic and international AML and CFT regimes are insufficient. As America learned to its sorrow, devastating terrorist attacks can be inexpensive to action and terrorists are not easily targeted in this new world. The NYDFS Regulations offer hope by binding together American foreign policy and financial sector protections. Yet the government cannot foist a majority of responsibility on the private sector and proceed to abandon it in the face of\n Schmidle, supra note 330 (reporting that at least one of the targeted banks resorted to hacking back).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act, H.R. 4036, 115th Cong.

The avarice of China, the misdirection promulgated by Russia, and the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran will not soon disappear. Education is certainly part of the answer; predictive analysis of threats is possible with sufficient knowledge of global events. In the mid-twentieth century, a famous maxim for a world at war was “loose lips sink ships” but in modern times a more appropriate slogan might be “communicate to protect.” Until America learns to communicate across federal and state governments, across CI sectors and disciplines, it leaves itself vulnerable to continued attack.\nAs befits a new battlefield, the U.S. is bringing novel arms to bear. Financial institutions are in certain meaningful ways extensions of federal policies and agencies. Yet more needs to be done; an appreciation for the world as it is, a kind of twenty-first century realpolitik, is necessary to close the delta between existing regulation and what must be done to protect America in years to come.",

      "## III. FINANCIAL WARFARE ## A. Little Flash, Big Bang Conventional armed conflicts tend to conform to predictable patterns whereby combatants are deployed against fixed units.54 Terrorism embraces unconventional tactics because it is a means to challenge stronger powers.55 No universal definition of terrorism exists, although it is understood to have four key components:\"(1) a violent act; (2) civilian victim(s); (3) the [terrorists] have a political, religious, or social motive; and (4) terrorists seek to provoke a political reaction and spread fear.\"56 A peculiar feature of terrorism amongst transnational violence is that\"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom [Vol. 25:2 fighter,” i.e., terrorism is not inherently perceived as either criminal or illegitimate.57 Indeed, there are certain sets of circumstances such as struggles for political voice or self-determination about which there is no consensus whether terrorist-type tactics are unlawful but excusable or unlawful yet justifiable or perhaps even lawful according to international norms.58 These ambiguities and varying perspectives are why international law, in part, has not reached a universal definition of terrorism.59 In certain respects, terrorism is an ancient gambit and a modern manifestation of old wine in a new bottle.60 It was first associated with the excesses of the French Revolution’s “regime de la terreur” and evolved over a century to describe non-state actors applying their aptitude for subversion, disruption and anarchy to the controlling Russian and French governments of the late nineteenth century.61 Following World War II, terrorists made headlines around the world by hijacking civilian aircraft.62 In response, “[t]he international community enacted treaties” and increased airport security measures which, taken together, reduced the incidence of harm to passengers.63 It was at this moment, the late 1960s and early 1970s, that terrorists relearned the valuable lesson of grabbing headlines, which was critical for the emergence of a new type of transnational terrorism.64 Generally, twenty-first century terrorism arises from a mix of religious fervor reinforced with political ideology and geopolitical goals.65 The initial campaign against Al Qaeda following 9/11 “has morphed into transnational conflicts against various terrorist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and [Syria (ISIS)] that did not exist in 2001.”66 This metastasized to pose a greater threat to society because terrorists are harder to deter; the relationship between the means employed and the goals are more attenuated; attacks are increasing in scale; and the proliferation and greater availability of weapons of mass destruction coupled 2019] CYBER REALPOLITIK It is axiomatic that terrorist attacks do not require large amounts of money and their impact is disproportionate to their cost. 9/11 cost Al Qaeda approximately $500,000.⁶⁸ The cost to the U.S. was upwards of $3.3 trillion.⁶⁹ Put differently, al Qaeda received a $7 million return on investment for every dollar it spent planning and carrying out its attacks.⁷⁰ The cost in human life was far greater. On 9/11, 19 men hijacked four fuel-laden commercial jets bound for West Coast destinations. 2,753 people lost their lives in Manhattan when American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the Twin Towers.⁷¹ 184 people died when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon and 40 more people were killed aboard United Airlines Flight 93 when the plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.⁷² For the U.S. military, Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn, Inherent Resolve, and Freedom’s Sentinel resulted in 6,978 U.S. casualties.⁷³ ## B. Funding Terror Terrorist groups like “ISIS, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Boko Haram rely upon vast networks of money moving around the world” to finance their ideologies.⁷⁴ Without this extensive network of funding, most terrorist organizations would be unable to launch attacks or find the impact of their attacks blunted.⁷⁵ Khalid Sheik Mohammed, “the principle architect of the 9/11 attacks,” used wire transfers and funds that were delivered to the U.S. or deposited abroad and then accessed from within the U.S.⁷⁶ His nephew, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, aided the 9/11 terrorists by wiring $114,500 to the U.S. that was utilized by an associated cell ⁶⁷ See Young, supra note 61, at 28-29."

Transnational terrorism, struck down in certain areas, but emboldened by twenty years of muddled U.S. and Allied counterterrorism policy, threatens again to break out of its Middle Eastern base.⁵ China is stealing U.S. trade secrets at a rate beyond alarming and forcing American companies to work inside China or forfeit profitable trade deals.⁶ Russia, a shadow of what it once was during the height of the Soviet Union,⁷ now seeks to project strength through information warfare against the West.⁸ North Korea too has learned how to fight in the cyber domain — its hackers rob banks worldwide and hold companies hostage through advanced cyber operations.⁹ As sanctions continue to strangle Iran’s economy, its cyber forces strike repeatedly at U.S. financial institutions in the hope of securing political and economic concessions.¹⁰ To triumph in this complex and increasingly cyber-reliant world, the U.S. must accomplish four goals: (1) stop terrorist financing; (2) attribute and punish state and non-state malicious actors; (3) protect the private sector; and (4) realize a systematic, predictive method for cyber defense.\n³ Sean D.

NEW CONCEPTIONS OF WARFARE ### A. Changing Norms Rules in warfare date to ancient Greece.¹¹ Almost two thousand years later, during the rise of the early modern world a “series of treaties that formed the Peace of Westphalia [and] ended the Thirty Years War... created a system of legally equal [sovereignties]” and marked the beginning of international law as applied to state-on-state conflict.¹² A leap forward in what is now termed the Law of Armed Conflict¹³ (“LOAC”) occurred in 1863.¹⁴ In the midst of the American Civil War, President Lincoln’s Administration empowered Francis Lieber to write General Order No. 100, Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field which provided “basic rules [regarding lawful and unlawful] combat, including [discussions] relating to the treatment of civilians” during hostilities.¹⁵ General Order No. 100 became the template for all subsequent LOAC codes.¹⁶ Most significantly, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which are comprised of four treaties, were adopted after World War II to mandate humane treatment of persons in wartime.¹⁷ The Geneva Conventions established rules that now appear straightforward when juxtaposed ¹¹ Rosa Ehrenreich Brooks, *War Everywhere: Rights, National Security Law, and the Law of Armed Conflict in the Age of Terror*, 153 U.

Targeting Evolved During the twentieth century, when the model of state-on-state conflict prevailed, the LOAC targeting analysis for standard rules of engagement was more straightforward because determinations often involved status-based as opposed to conduct-based targets.⁴⁴ Status-based targets are lawful combatants who, per Geneva Convention III requirements, act “[u]nder responsible command; [w]ear a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; [c]arry arms openly; and [a]bide by the laws of war.”⁴⁵ In contrast, conduct-based targets consistently violate LOAC standards by, for example, attacking uniformed lawful combatants while wearing civilian clothes in order to blend and hide themselves within civilian populations.⁴⁶ Ahmad Fadhil Nazzal al-Khalaylah, who later renamed himself Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was a notorious practitioner of perfidy and treachery in Iraq and routinely violated the rules of LOAC.⁴⁷ Al-Zarqawi and his followers were difficult to target in Iraq because they did not wear uniforms⁴⁸ and choose to commit on-camera beheadings in safe houses and bombing civilians over direct combat with U.S.-led coalition forces.⁴⁹ On June 8, 2006, a U.S. precision airstrike targeting “a single dwelling in a wooded area ⁴³ Id.

Id.\n2019] CYBER REALPOLITIK Drone strike programs offer a prominent example of the conceptual challenges posed by applying traditional LOAC targeting standards to nonstate and terrorist actors.51 Former State Department Legal Adviser Harold Hongju Koh remarked about the Predator drone program that the U.S. maintains lawful recourse to\"lethal force... to defend itself... including by targeting persons such as high-level al Qaeda leaders who are planning attacks.\"52 The remark appears innocuous yet it presupposes nonstate actors and terrorist organizations maintain tightly-affiliated top-down relationships when they often consciously do not. Might persons loosely affiliated with ISIS goals living in Manila, learning bomb-making tradecraft online, and counseling like-minded associates qualify as conduct-based targets?53 To make the analogy even more attenuated, how about Manila ISIS sympathizers who are effective online ideologues and later credited as sources of inspiration by lone-wolf actors who targeted civilians?",
    "## III. FINANCIAL WARFARE ## A. Little Flash, Big Bang Conventional armed conflicts tend to conform to predictable patterns whereby combatants are deployed against fixed units.54 Terrorism embraces unconventional tactics because it is a means to challenge stronger powers.55 No universal definition of terrorism exists, although it is understood to have four key components:\"(1) a violent act; (2) civilian victim(s); (3) the [terrorists] have a political, religious, or social motive; and (4) terrorists seek to provoke a political reaction and spread fear.\"56 A peculiar feature of terrorism amongst transnational violence is that\"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom [Vol. 25:2 fighter,” i.e., terrorism is not inherently perceived as either criminal or illegitimate.57 Indeed, there are certain sets of circumstances such as struggles for political voice or self-determination about which there is no consensus whether terrorist-type tactics are unlawful but excusable or unlawful yet justifiable or perhaps even lawful according to international norms.58 These ambiguities and varying perspectives are why international law, in part, has not reached a universal definition of terrorism.59 In certain respects, terrorism is an ancient gambit and a modern manifestation of old wine in a new bottle.60 It was first associated with the excesses of the French Revolution’s “regime de la terreur” and evolved over a century to describe non-state actors applying their aptitude for subversion, disruption and anarchy to the controlling Russian and French governments of the late nineteenth century.61 Following World War II, terrorists made headlines around the world by hijacking civilian aircraft.62 In response, “[t]he international community enacted treaties” and increased airport security measures which, taken together, reduced the incidence of harm to passengers.63 It was at this moment, the late 1960s and early 1970s, that terrorists relearned the valuable lesson of grabbing headlines, which was critical for the emergence of a new type of transnational terrorism.64 Generally, twenty-first century terrorism arises from a mix of religious fervor reinforced with political ideology and geopolitical goals.65 The initial campaign against Al Qaeda following 9/11 “has morphed into transnational conflicts against various terrorist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and [Syria (ISIS)] that did not exist in 2001.”66 This metastasized to pose a greater threat to society because terrorists are harder to deter; the relationship between the means employed and the goals are more attenuated; attacks are increasing in scale; and the proliferation and greater availability of weapons of mass destruction coupled 2019] CYBER REALPOLITIK It is axiomatic that terrorist attacks do not require large amounts of money and their impact is disproportionate to their cost. 9/11 cost Al Qaeda approximately $500,000.⁶⁸ The cost to the U.S. was upwards of $3.3 trillion.⁶⁹ Put differently, al Qaeda received a $7 million return on investment for every dollar it spent planning and carrying out its attacks.⁷⁰ The cost in human life was far greater. On 9/11, 19 men hijacked four fuel-laden commercial jets bound for West Coast destinations. 2,753 people lost their lives in Manhattan when American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the Twin Towers.⁷¹ 184 people died when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon and 40 more people were killed aboard United Airlines Flight 93 when the plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.⁷² For the U.S. military, Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn, Inherent Resolve, and Freedom’s Sentinel resulted in 6,978 U.S. casualties.⁷³ ## B. Funding Terror Terrorist groups like “ISIS, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Boko Haram rely upon vast networks of money moving around the world” to finance their ideologies.⁷⁴ Without this extensive network of funding, most terrorist organizations would be unable to launch attacks or find the impact of their attacks blunted.⁷⁵ Khalid Sheik Mohammed, “the principle architect of the 9/11 attacks,” used wire transfers and funds that were delivered to the U.S. or deposited abroad and then accessed from within the U.S.⁷⁶ His nephew, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, aided the 9/11 terrorists by wiring $114,500 to the U.S. that was utilized by an associated cell ⁶⁷ See Young, supra note 61, at 28-29.": "⁶⁸ 9/11 Panel: al Qaeda Planned to Hijack 10 Planes, CNN (June 17, 2004), http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/16/911.commission/ [https://perma.cc/DP3TGLP6].\n⁶⁹ Kimberly Amadeo, How the 9/11 Attacks Affect the Economy Today, BALANCE (Nov. 6, 2018), https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-9-11-attacks-still-affect-the-economy-today-3305536 [https://perma.cc/C38M-G4NK].\n⁷⁰ See id.\n⁷¹ September 11 Terror Attacks Fast Facts, CNN (Sept. 3, 2018), https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/27/us/september-11-anniversary-fast-facts/index.html [https://perma.cc/4ZKJ-GWYE].\n⁷² Id.\n⁷³ Casualty Status, U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

    "## C. Disrupt to Protect": "President Bush declared the “War on Terror” on September 20, 2001.92 Four days later, he instigated the “Financial War on Terror” when he said the U.S. “will starve terrorists of funding, turn them against each other, rout them out of their safe hiding places, and bring them to justice.”93 President Bush made an explicit connection between stopping terrorist financing and preventing real-world attacks on Americans when he said “[m]oney is the lifeblood of terrorist organizations.”94 His announcement was followed by frequent declarations — notably from David D. Aufhauser, General Counsel to the U.S. Department of\n[Vol. 25:2 the Treasury — calling for more efforts aimed at freezing terrorist funding sources.⁹⁵ In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Aufhauser explained that on 9/11 he was at an international money laundering conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in which there was a lot of self-congratulations on current efforts to curb money laundering.⁹⁶ However, when the entire conference watched the World Trade Center buildings collapse, Aufhauser explained that: It was... the realization that the gathering had been looking, for too long, at the world through the wrong end of a telescope. Money had been spirited around the globe by means and measures and in denominations that mocked detection.

Two weeks after the attacks, President Bush issued Executive Order 13224 (“E.O. 13224”) which froze the assets of twenty-seven individuals and organizations.¹⁰⁸ E.O. 13224 “centered on two goals: stopping the flow of money to al Qaeda and convincing the public that something was being done.”¹⁰⁹ E.O. 13224 declared a national emergency and allowed President Bush to use the powers of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”).¹¹⁰ Using this power under IEEPA, President Bush authorized the Treasury Department “to freeze the assets of foreign and domestic organizations within [U.S. jurisdiction], including assets of financial http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Monograph.pdf [https://perma.cc/BQ38-GPRL].\n¹⁰² Justin Santolli, Note, The Terrorist Finance Tracking Program: Illuminating the Shortcomings of the European Union’s Antiquated Data Privacy Directive, 40 GEO.

For example, the Money Laundering Control Act makes it a crime to knowingly “conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or... to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law.”¹⁵¹ Further, many “federal agencies investigate cases of suspected money laundering and terrorist financing, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”¹⁵² ## IV.

CI systems are [therefore] owned and operated by [a myriad of] businesses, which in turn may have thousands more private entities who... supply, service, or access the CI systems. The national cybersecurity framework [published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”)] relies on private actors to invest in a sufficient amount of cybersecurity measures to [mitigate or] avoid catastrophic damage to CI.¹⁷⁵ However... [t]he government does not impose [a security regime on the private sector], leaving it to the private-sector entities to set their own practices and policies for protecting their computer systems.¹⁷⁶ Further, “[o]n February 18, 2013 the private cybersecurity firm Mandiant [released] a report on a group it [dubbed] Advanced Persistent Threat 1 (APT1) that had purportedly breached almost 150 organizations since 2007.”¹⁷⁷ Mandiant asserted APT1 is most likely a Chinese Army cyber unit.¹⁷⁸; although China denounced the accusations, the U.S. government shifted from oblique allusions to openly calling China out as a significant source of cyber events.¹⁷⁹ On one hand, Mandiant’s vocal attribution of cyber meddling to China facilitated the ability of the U.S. to attribute bad acts to China.¹⁸⁰ On the other hand, it ¹⁷⁵ *Id.* The goal of the NIST Framework is to guide the development of a voluntary risk-based approach to cybersecurity. *NAT’L INST.

When Iran then revived its efforts to enrich uranium, President Clinton... imposed a full trade and investment embargo, barring all U.S. trade with Iran. Congress went a step further and passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (now known as the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA) which... imposed U.S. trade penalties on foreign companies determined to have invested more than $20 million in Iranian petroleum development...\nHowever, the Clinton and then Bush administrations preferred to use diplomatic pressure to convince foreign companies to leave the Iranian market rather than impose sanctions using the ISA authorities...\nBy 2006, Iran's progress toward a nuclear weapon reached a crisis point [and] the global community responded from 2006 to 2010 with new United Nations (UN) sanctions... in a series of UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). Critically, UNSCR 1929 in 2010 recognized a\"potential connection between Iran's revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities.\"302 Claiming international legitimacy from the UNSCR language, the United States revived the ISA secondary sanctions regime and expanded it with new legislation aimed at cutting off all foreign support to Iran's energy sector.303 In 2015, the Obama Administration, alongside the P5+1 Group — comprised of the U.S., United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany — agreed to a long-term deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program.304 Per the accord,\"Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.\"305 The agreement was termed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (\"JCPOA\") and [Vol. 25:2 was a signature foreign policy achievement for President Obama.³⁰⁶ At the time, the Republican-controlled Congress was skeptical about JCPOA because it perceived Iran as untrustworthy and was sympathetic to Israel’s security concerns over the deal.³⁰⁷ On May 8, 2018, the Trump Administration ended U.S. participation in JCPOA.³⁰⁸ President Trump declared JCPOA was “so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.”³⁰⁹ An analysis of Iran’s behavior post-Stuxnet through the end of the JCPOA is highly valuable because it offers a blueprint for how cyber defenders can and should view the world.³¹⁰ From this analysis, it is clear that reliable predictive analysis that informs defensive postures and protocols is the single most valuable commodity for cyber defenders and ultimately sovereign nations: Starting in 2009, Iran’s uranium centrifuges began failing, and nobody understood why. Nearly one thousand of Iran’s six thousand centrifuges were destroyed over the course of a year. In the summer of 2010, a computer security firm in Belarus was hired to troubleshoot Iranian computers that mysteriously kept crashing—and in this investigation, the firm stumbled upon a series of files that would later become known as the Stuxnet virus. The Stuxnet virus was recognized as the “world’s first digital weapon.” It was a complex malware designed to infiltrate secure Iranian nuclear facilities, infect the industrial controllers that operated the nuclear centrifuges, and destroy those centrifuges by manipulating the pressure levels and rotor speeds inside them... [d]espite the significant attempt to cover its origins, experts concluded that Stuxnet was a joint United States and Israeli production.³¹¹ On the eleventh anniversary of 9/11, an Iranian group calling itself the “Cyber Fighters of IZZ ad-Din al-Qassam” claimed credit for a series of targeted operations against specific U.S. financial institutions.³¹² The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the New York financial sector were conducted ³⁰⁶ David E.

There used to be a lot of silos out there, where compliance, risk management, network security, [were] separate parts, but today’s cybersecurity environment means all those departments need to be interconnected in a new way.³⁵⁷ Technology is certainly part of the solution, but greater and better communication amongst BSA/AML/CFT and cybersecurity professionals within the government and private sector offers a long-term path to success. The past few years have seen progress toward this concept; for instance, on October 25, 2016, FinCEN issued a cyber threats advisory wherein it explained the proliferation of cyber events is a significant threat to the U.S. financial system.³⁵⁸ Accordingly, FinCEN prompted financial institutions to use the well-known SAR reporting mechanism to report anomalous cyber events (“cyber SARs”).³⁵⁹ The rationale behind the cyber SAR is that information sharing between the government and private sector can help “guard against and report money laundering, terrorism financing, and cyber-enabled crime.”³⁶⁰ Traditionally, the cyber domain was foreign to BSA/AML teams in the private sector, and most departments lacked expertise and cross-training in the disciplines, but the FinCEN cyber SAR may help upend the longstanding but unhelpful paradigm.³⁶¹ Recall the 176 days Iranian hackers targeted U.S. companies.³⁶² Critically, “[t]he NSA knew in advance [about Iran’s] intent to penetrate the [financial ³⁵⁶ Harry Dixon, *Maintaining Individual Liability in AML and Cybersecurity at New York’s Financial Institutions*, 5 PENN ST.

The current domestic and international AML and CFT regimes are insufficient. As America learned to its sorrow, devastating terrorist attacks can be inexpensive to action and terrorists are not easily targeted in this new world.

The avarice of China, the misdirection promulgated by Russia, and the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran will not soon disappear. Education is certainly part of the answer; predictive analysis of threats is possible with sufficient knowledge of global events. In the mid-twentieth century, a famous maxim for a world at war was “loose lips sink ships” but in modern times a more appropriate slogan might be “communicate to protect.” Until America learns to communicate across federal and state governments, across CI sectors and disciplines, it leaves itself vulnerable to continued attack.\nAs befits a new battlefield, the U.S. is bringing novel arms to bear. Financial institutions are in certain meaningful ways extensions of federal policies and agencies. Yet more needs to be done; an appreciation for the world as it is, a kind of twenty-first century realpolitik, is necessary to close the delta between existing regulation and what must be done to protect America in years to come."

Now, almost two decades into the post-9/11 world, state and non-state actors, transnational terrorists, and cyber operators thrive in twilight zones of domestic and international law. The past few years carry signs of troubles to come. Transnational terrorism, struck down in certain areas, but emboldened by twenty years of muddled U.S. and Allied counterterrorism policy, threatens again to break out of its Middle Eastern base. China is stealing U.S. trade secrets at a rate beyond alarming and forcing American companies to work inside China or forfeit profitable trade deals. Russia, a shadow of what it once was during the height of the Soviet Union, now seeks to project strength through information warfare against the West. North Korea too has learned how to fight in the cyber domain — its hackers rob banks worldwide and hold companies hostage through advanced cyber operations. As sanctions continue to strangle Iran’s economy, its cyber forces strike repeatedly at U.S. financial institutions in the hope of securing political and economic concessions. To triumph in this complex and increasingly cyber-reliant world, the U.S. must accomplish four goals: (1) stop terrorist financing; (2) attribute and punish state and non-state malicious actors; (3) protect the private sector; and (4) realize a systematic, predictive method for cyber defense.\n Sean D.

NEW CONCEPTIONS OF WARFARE\n### A. Changing Norms\nRules in warfare date to ancient Greece. Almost two thousand years later, during the rise of the early modern world a “series of treaties that formed the Peace of Westphalia [and] ended the Thirty Years War . . . created a system of legally equal [sovereignties]” and marked the beginning of international law as applied to state-on-state conflict. A leap forward in what is now termed the Law of Armed Conflict (“LOAC”) occurred in 1863. In the midst of the American Civil War, President Lincoln’s Administration empowered Francis Lieber to write General Order No. 100, Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field which provided “basic rules [regarding lawful and unlawful] combat, including [discussions] relating to the treatment of civilians” during hostilities. General Order No. 100 became the template for all subsequent LOAC codes. Most significantly, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which are comprised of four treaties, were adopted after World War II to mandate humane treatment of persons in wartime. The Geneva Conventions established rules that now appear straightforward when juxtaposed\n Rosa Ehrenreich Brooks, *War Everywhere: Rights, National Security Law, and the Law of Armed Conflict in the Age of Terror*, 153 U.

As Sean Murphy has argued:\nMany of the controversies [arose] because the two [operative] paradigms... within the Geneva Conventions – . . . ‘international’ armed conflict (i.e., conflict between two or more states[, or “IAC”]) and . . . ‘noninternational’ armed conflict between [intra-]state and nonstate actors ([usually deemed a civil war, or “NIAC”]) do not fit the [typology] of global terrorism, [which is the province of] transnational conflict [amongst] state and nonstate actors.\nYet more difficult is the “unprivileged enemy belligerent” (UEB) category arising from NIACs and constituting persons, which encompasses one who:\n(A) has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners; (B) has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against\n See generally id.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, art. 51(3), opened for signature Dec. 12, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Protocol I].\n Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4(A)(2), Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135.\n Protocol I, supra note 19.

In the complex post-9/11 world, the U.S. maintains UEBs can be lawfully detained until the end of hostilities. Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court likewise endorse this position even though it continues to lack broad international support.\nThe normative understandings regarding the application of *jus ad bellum*, the portion of international law governing when states may resort to force, changed tremendously since 9/11.

Targeting Evolved\nDuring the twentieth century, when the model of state-on-state conflict prevailed, the LOAC targeting analysis for standard rules of engagement was more straightforward because determinations often involved status-based as opposed to conduct-based targets. Status-based targets are lawful combatants who, per Geneva Convention III requirements, act “[u]nder responsible command; [w]ear a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; [c]arry arms openly; and [a]bide by the laws of war.” In contrast, conduct-based targets consistently violate LOAC standards by, for example, attacking uniformed lawful combatants while wearing civilian clothes in order to blend and hide themselves within civilian populations. Ahmad Fadhil Nazzal al-Khalaylah, who later renamed himself Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was a notorious practitioner of perfidy and treachery in Iraq and routinely violated the rules of LOAC. Al-Zarqawi and his followers were difficult to target in Iraq because they did not wear uniforms and choose to commit on-camera beheadings in safe houses and bombing civilians over direct combat with U.S.-led coalition forces.

Might persons loosely affiliated with ISIS goals living in Manila, learning bomb-making tradecraft online, and counseling like-minded associates qualify as conduct-based targets?53 To make the analogy even more attenuated, how about Manila ISIS sympathizers who are effective online ideologues and later credited as sources of inspiration by lone-wolf actors who targeted civilians?\n## III. FINANCIAL WARFARE\n## A. Little Flash, Big Bang\nConventional armed conflicts tend to conform to predictable patterns whereby combatants are deployed against fixed units.54 Terrorism embraces unconventional tactics because it is a means to challenge stronger powers.55 No universal definition of terrorism exists, although it is understood to have four key components: \"(1) a violent act; (2) civilian victim(s); (3) the [terrorists] have a political, religious, or social motive; and (4) terrorists seek to provoke a political reaction and spread fear.\"56 A peculiar feature of terrorism amongst transnational violence is that \"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom\n\n[Vol. 25:2\nfighter,” i.e., terrorism is not inherently perceived as either criminal or illegitimate.57 Indeed, there are certain sets of circumstances such as struggles for political voice or self-determination about which there is no consensus whether terrorist-type tactics are unlawful but excusable or unlawful yet justifiable or perhaps even lawful according to international norms.58 These ambiguities and varying perspectives are why international law, in part, has not reached a universal definition of terrorism.59\nIn certain respects, terrorism is an ancient gambit and a modern manifestation of old wine in a new bottle.60 It was first associated with the excesses of the French Revolution’s “regime de la terreur” and evolved over a century to describe non-state actors applying their aptitude for subversion, disruption and anarchy to the controlling Russian and French governments of the late nineteenth century.61 Following World War II, terrorists made headlines around the world by hijacking civilian aircraft.62 In response, “[t]he international community enacted treaties” and increased airport security measures which, taken together, reduced the incidence of harm to passengers.63 It was at this moment, the late 1960s and early 1970s, that terrorists relearned the valuable lesson of grabbing headlines, which was critical for the emergence of a new type of transnational terrorism.64\nGenerally, twenty-first century terrorism arises from a mix of religious fervor reinforced with political ideology and geopolitical goals.65 The initial campaign against Al Qaeda following 9/11 “has morphed into transnational conflicts against various terrorist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and [Syria (ISIS)] that did not exist in 2001.”66 This metastasized to pose a greater threat to society because terrorists are harder to deter; the relationship between the means employed and the goals are more attenuated; attacks are increasing in scale; and the proliferation and greater availability of weapons of mass destruction coupled\n\n2019]\nCYBER REALPOLITIK\n\nIt is axiomatic that terrorist attacks do not require large amounts of money and their impact is disproportionate to their cost. 9/11 cost Al Qaeda approximately $500,000. The cost to the U.S. was upwards of $3.3 trillion. Put differently, al Qaeda received a $7 million return on investment for every dollar it spent planning and carrying out its attacks. The cost in human life was far greater. On 9/11, 19 men hijacked four fuel-laden commercial jets bound for West Coast destinations. 2,753 people lost their lives in Manhattan when American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the Twin Towers. 184 people died when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon and 40 more people were killed aboard United Airlines Flight 93 when the plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. For the U.S. military, Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn, Inherent Resolve, and Freedom’s Sentinel resulted in 6,978 U.S. casualties.\n## B. Funding Terror\nTerrorist groups like “ISIS, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Boko Haram rely upon vast networks of money moving around the world” to finance their ideologies. Without this extensive network of funding, most terrorist organizations would be unable to launch attacks or find the impact of their attacks blunted. Khalid Sheik Mohammed, “the principle architect of the 9/11 attacks,” used wire transfers and funds that were delivered to the U.S. or deposited abroad and then accessed from within the U.S. His nephew, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, aided the 9/11 terrorists by wiring $114,500 to the U.S. that was utilized by an associated cell\n See Young, supra note 61, at 28-29.\n 9/11 Panel: al Qaeda Planned to Hijack 10 Planes, CNN (June 17, 2004), http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/16/911.commission/ [https://perma.cc/DP3TGLP6].\n Kimberly Amadeo, How the 9/11 Attacks Affect the Economy Today, BALANCE (Nov. 6, 2018), https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-9-11-attacks-still-affect-the-economy-today-3305536 [https://perma.cc/C38M-G4NK].\n See id.\n September 11 Terror Attacks Fast Facts, CNN (Sept. 3, 2018), https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/27/us/september-11-anniversary-fast-facts/index.html [https://perma.cc/4ZKJ-GWYE].\n Id.\n Casualty Status, U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

Aziz sent multiple “bank-to-bank transfers –including transactions for $10,000, $20,000, and $70,000–to bank accounts at SunTrust Bank in Florida.” The transaction amounts to SunTrust are notable because, pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the bank was required to report Customer Transaction Reports (“CTRs”) above $10,000 to the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) and file a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) for any wire transfer they deemed suspicious. Tragically, SunTrust never filed a SAR in connection with the 9/11 attacks and indeed no financial institution filed a SAR in connection with any of the 19 hijackers’ transactions before 9/11.\nTerrorist organizations go about raising money in different ways; some rely on criminal activity whereas others acquire revenue from private donations from interested persons or groups. They do so because “[f]inancing is required not only to fund specific missions but to meet the broader organizational costs of developing and maintaining a terrorist organization and to create an enabling environment necessary to sustain their activities.” While the direct cost of mounting specific attacks is alarmingly low, it does cost money to maintain a terrorist network, enable recruitment, sustain terror cells, and fund planning and procurement between attacks. Further, terror groups require funds “to finance the ostensibly legitimate activities required to provide a veil of legitimacy for their organizations.” As a result, “[d]isrupting terrorist financing involves both systemic safeguards, which protect financial systems from abuse, and targeted economic sanctions informed by counterterrorism intelligence.”\n Id. at 224.

Disrupt to Protect\nPresident Bush declared the “War on Terror” on September 20, 2001.92 Four days later, he instigated the “Financial War on Terror” when he said the U.S. “will starve terrorists of funding, turn them against each other, rout them out of their safe hiding places, and bring them to justice.”93 President Bush made an explicit connection between stopping terrorist financing and preventing real-world attacks on Americans when he said “[m]oney is the lifeblood of terrorist organizations.”94 His announcement was followed by frequent declarations — notably from David D. Aufhauser, General Counsel to the U.S. Department of\n\n[Vol. 25:2\nthe Treasury — calling for more efforts aimed at freezing terrorist funding sources. In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Aufhauser explained that on 9/11 he was at an international money laundering conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in which there was a lot of self-congratulations on current efforts to curb money laundering. However, when the entire conference watched the World Trade Center buildings collapse, Aufhauser explained that:\nIt was . . . the realization that the gathering had been looking, for too long, at the world through the wrong end of a telescope. Money had been spirited around the globe by means and measures and in denominations that mocked detection. The most serious threat to our well-being was now clean money intended to kill, not dirty money seeking a place of hiding.\n“Terrorist groups and criminal networks share many of the same characteristics, including methods and sources of finance.” In 2011, Yury Fedotov, the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, remarked “criminal profits from drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, and money laundering represent an increasing share of terrorist finance.” Prior to 9/11, the U.S. government lacked the know-how to stop terrorist financing. When the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) was admonished for its lack of information on al-Qaeda’s finances pre-9/11, its lackluster response was “terrorist financing [is] an extraordinarily hard target.” Indeed, the U.S. had “considered it futile to monitor al Qaeda’s money\n David Aufhauser, *Testimony of David D.

In a certain sense, financial warfare is not a new concept for the U.S. government; the U.S. first codified presidential authority to employ economic sanctions against foreign countries in 1917 in the Trading with the Enemy Act (“TWEA”). Some decades later the U.S. created the Treasury Department’s “Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to target Chinese assets during the Korean Conflict.” 9/11 was a watershed moment, however, and exigencies necessitated creative measures to halt terrorist financing. Two weeks after the attacks, President Bush issued Executive Order 13224 (“E.O. 13224”) which froze the assets of twenty-seven individuals and organizations. E.O. 13224 “centered on two goals: stopping the flow of money to al Qaeda and convincing the public that something was being done.” E.O. 13224 declared a national emergency and allowed President Bush to use the powers of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”). Using this power under IEEPA, President Bush authorized the Treasury Department “to freeze the assets of foreign and domestic organizations within [U.S. jurisdiction], including assets of financial\nhttp://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Monograph.pdf [https://perma.cc/BQ38-GPRL].\n Justin Santolli, Note, The Terrorist Finance Tracking Program: Illuminating the Shortcomings of the European Union’s Antiquated Data Privacy Directive, 40 GEO.

Title III of the PATRIOT Act sets forth the regulations concerning countering terrorist financing (“CFT”). The Act strengthened the executive branch’s ability to freeze and seize assets, broadened the President’s power under the IEEPA, and expanded U.S. extraterritorial jurisdiction.\nThe PATRIOT Act was so revolutionary in certain respects that David Aufhauser described Title III as “‘the smart bomb of terrorist financing.’” Amongst the Act’s most significant measures was its requirement that “banks, savings associations, credit unions, securities broker-dealers, mutual funds, futures commission merchants, and introducing brokers enhance their customer identification measures.” All U.S. financial institutions were required to maintain anti-money laundering (“AML”) programs. Additionally, the Act expanded the number of entities required to file SARs: “[w]here before the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 required banks and credit unions to report $10,000 or more in cash transfers, now ‘any person who is engaged in a trade or business’ that received more than $10,000 in cash must file an SAR.”\nDespite the PATRIOT Act’s broad scope, some critics maintained that it was a “hastily assembled” version of existing AML legislation from the 1980s and 1990s originally intended to combat drug cartels and enterprise crime.

International Efforts\nThe U.S. “spends more on its defense budget than the next eight states combined but it [does not] go after terrorist finance on its own,” since it requires assistance from the international community. From a global perspective, the creation of a comprehensive AML/CFT strategy was “drawn from the idea that cutting off terrorist funds could slow down, disturb, and dismantle terrorist networks.” To implement this strategy, “two international organizations—namely, the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) created and perpetuate[d] a system of measures to prohibit acts of financing, freeze terrorist funds, and track down terrorists.” After 9/11, “substantial efforts [were] made to assure that countries [had] adopted and implemented laws consistent with these measures.” Nonetheless, these programs receive scant attention relative to their importance and there continues\nlaundering “is typically a three-step process: (i) placement—the launderer puts criminally-derived money into a legitimate enterprise; (ii) layering—the launderer places the money in . . . pretextual transactions to obfuscate the original source; and (iii) integration—the launderer [changes] the funds into non-cash instruments” like bank notes and letters of credit to finance criminal activities.

A primary mechanism by which the FATF seeks to accomplish its goals is by having its members implement “Recommendations” which do not have the force of law although “failure to implement them is grounds for expulsion from the organization.” Despite their soft-law nature, Recommendations hold significant sway because countries do not want to be excluded from the FATF. On the contrary, nations blacklisted by the FATF for non-compliance understand there can be significant consequences. In February 2018, the U.S. urged the FATF to place Pakistan, which was on the non-compliant list from 2012 to 2015, on notice it was again violating CFT standards. Pakistan was apprehensive that the move would further isolate the country from the global community, damage its weak economy, cripple its banking sector and hinder its access to international markets. Consequently, Pakistan scrambled in recent months to get back into compliance.

Pursuant to CTITF guidelines, “[t]errorism financing incorporates the distinct activities of fund-raising, storing and concealing funds, using funds to sustain terrorist organizations and infrastructure, and transferring funds to support or carry out specific terrorist attacks.” “Money laundering and terrorist financing are characterized by somewhat opposing dynamics and objectives.” Money laundering’s goal is to eradicate the illicit origin of funds to prevent actors from enjoying the profits of their predicate crimes. Terrorist financing implies “money dirtying,” which is the reverse of money laundering. In other words, terrorist financing aims to divert “clean money” into terrorist activities while money launderers want to conceal the origin of “dirty money.” Notwithstanding differences, domestic and international law tend to construe these activities in a similar light and the policy decision is often girded by arguments of rationality and efficiency. Effective strategies against both terrorist financing and money laundering necessitate a “horizontal strategy” embracing a wide variety of fields, including criminal law, administrative law, and … international law.” Moreover, terrorist financing and money laundering presuppose the deployment of financial institutions for illicit\n Id.\n Id.\n U.N.

Finally, money laundering can be of singular importance in concealing the illegal origin and destination of funds directed to finance terrorist activities. For these reasons, combining AML/CFT strategies is usually good policy. For example, the Money Laundering Control Act makes it a crime to knowingly “conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or . . . to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law.” Further, many “federal agencies investigate cases of suspected money laundering and terrorist financing, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”\n## IV.

The Council was especially concerned with attacks on Critical Infrastructure (“CI”), which is necessary to the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy and in particular the financial sector.

Public-Private Information Sharing\nAs John Chung has argued:\nA basic challenge in cybersecurity is the fact almost eighty-five percent of America’s CI is owned by the private sector. . . . CI systems are [therefore] owned and operated by [a myriad of] businesses, which in turn may have thousands more private entities who . . . supply, service, or access the CI systems. The national cybersecurity framework [published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”)] relies on private actors to invest in a sufficient amount of cybersecurity measures to [mitigate or] avoid catastrophic damage to CI. However . . . [t]he government does not impose [a security regime on the private sector], leaving it to the private-sector entities to set their own practices and policies for protecting their computer systems.\nFurther, “[o]n February 18, 2013 the private cybersecurity firm Mandiant [released] a report on a group it [dubbed] Advanced Persistent Threat 1 (APT1) that had purportedly breached almost 150 organizations since 2007.” Mandiant asserted APT1 is most likely a Chinese Army cyber unit.; although China denounced the accusations, the U.S. government shifted from oblique allusions to openly calling China out as a significant source of cyber events. On one hand, Mandiant’s vocal attribution of cyber meddling to China facilitated the ability of the U.S. to attribute bad acts to China. On the other hand, it\n *Id.* The goal of the NIST Framework is to guide the development of a voluntary risk-based approach to cybersecurity. *NAT’L INST.

For instance, “private companies investigate networks of malware-infected systems used by transnational criminal groups for financial fraud,” while the government has become a true market participant by buying software vulnerabilities on the gray market and purposefully not disclosing them to software makers that could remedy the flaws. Yet, “[t]he private sector is struggling to contend with the growing scope, scale, and complexity of cyber” operations.\nAs it stands, the U.S. government and the private sector are stuck at an impasse concerning cybersecurity information sharing. U.S. companies argue that the federal government should take an active role in its cyber defense while the intelligence community is loath to part with its classification methods lest technical sources and methods be placed at risk. A solution with increasing support is a national classified cyber information-sharing network between the federal government and the private sector. In this schema, an already-existing classified network for defense contractors would be expanded to private CI companies. This is not entirely far-fetched since David Sanger, the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, remarked that the U.S. should come to grips with certain realities to remain a decisive actor in the cyber domain to include ending the reflexive attitude federal cyber defenses must extend to government networks and no further. It is worth noting that public-private information sharing only works when the private sector acts on the information it receives.\n“On September 7, 2017, Equifax, one of the [biggest] consumer-credit reporting agencies in the world,” announced that its consumer information had\n Kristen E.

The hackers, likely DPRK proxies, threatened to release more confidential documents unless Sony refused to show the movie. Unfortunately, many theatres across the U.S. acquiesced to the hackers’ demands and pulled the movie from their lineups. In the wake of the ensuing controversy, the U.S. government took an unusual step and publicly blamed North Korea for the Sony hack.

Critically, UNSCR 1929 in 2010 recognized a \"potential connection between Iran's revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities.\"302 Claiming international legitimacy from the UNSCR language, the United States revived the ISA secondary sanctions regime and expanded it with new legislation aimed at cutting off all foreign support to Iran's energy sector.303\nIn 2015, the Obama Administration, alongside the P5+1 Group — comprised of the U.S., United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany — agreed to a long-term deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program.304 Per the accord, \"Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.\"305 The agreement was termed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (\"JCPOA\") and\n\n[Vol. 25:2 -\nwas a signature foreign policy achievement for President Obama. At the time, the Republican-controlled Congress was skeptical about JCPOA because it perceived Iran as untrustworthy and was sympathetic to Israel’s security concerns over the deal. On May 8, 2018, the Trump Administration ended U.S. participation in JCPOA. President Trump declared JCPOA was “so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.”\nAn analysis of Iran’s behavior post-Stuxnet through the end of the JCPOA is highly valuable because it offers a blueprint for how cyber defenders can and should view the world. From this analysis, it is clear that reliable predictive analysis that informs defensive postures and protocols is the single most valuable commodity for cyber defenders and ultimately sovereign nations:\nStarting in 2009, Iran’s uranium centrifuges began failing, and nobody understood why. Nearly one thousand of Iran’s six thousand centrifuges were destroyed over the course of a year. In the summer of 2010, a computer security firm in Belarus was hired to troubleshoot Iranian computers that mysteriously kept crashing—and in this investigation, the firm stumbled upon a series of files that would later become known as the Stuxnet virus. The Stuxnet virus was recognized as the “world’s first digital weapon.” It was a complex malware designed to infiltrate secure Iranian nuclear facilities, infect the industrial controllers that operated the nuclear centrifuges, and destroy those centrifuges by manipulating the pressure levels and rotor speeds inside them . . . [d]espite the significant attempt to cover its origins, experts concluded that Stuxnet was a joint United States and Israeli production.\nOn the eleventh anniversary of 9/11, an Iranian group calling itself the “Cyber Fighters of IZZ ad-Din al-Qassam” claimed credit for a series of targeted operations against specific U.S. financial institutions.

In a Twitter post, the group claimed responsibility and argued, “the attacks [were] launched in retaliation for the continued presence on YouTube of the American-made film The Innocence of Muslims” that portrayed Muslims in general, and the prophet Mohammed in particular, “in an unflattering light.” The group “vowed to continue [its] attacks until the U.S. President ordered the film removed from the Internet.” Yet contrary to their claims, the “Cyber Fighters of IZZ ad-Din al-Qassam” did not indiscriminately attack financial institutions. Rather, the targets were carefully vetted and were primarily institutions that, “complied with the terms of the ongoing U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, part of the . . . effort to halt Iran’s nuclear arms program.” Further, the anonymous Twitter account from which the group issued its demand to remove the film was the same that posted messages following an earlier cyberattack on the internal computer network of Aramco, the Saudi Arabian oil conglomerate.

The cyber intrusions occurred against the backdrop of the U.S. and Iran negotiating a deal curbing Iran’s nuclear-power ambitions. Overall, the Obama Administration was cautious and largely defensive regarding the Ababil operation:\nEven a proposal by then National Security Agency (NSA) Director, Keith Alexander, to shut down the computer [systems] in Iran responsible for the DDoS attacks by a covert cyber operation [was seemingly rejected by officials] because [they] “were unsure that the action could be so precise and expressed concern that affecting a server in Iran—even if in self-defense—would represent a violation of its sovereignty” and [provoke] escalation.\nAnd the possibility “of using diplomatic back-channels was [likewise shelved because] it was [argued] that doing so might prompt the Iranians to intensify their attacks.” In turn, the Obama Administration’s decision to refrain from an immediate, vocal, and firm response to stop the Ababil operation frustrated and undermined the helpless victim-institutions and led them to seriously consider self-help options like hack-backs against the attackers’ servers.\n Id.\n Id.\n U.S. Dep’t of Justice Press Release, supra note 315.\n See supra text accompanying notes 304-306.

We’ve advised all of our clients in the critical infrastructure space to consider the historic hostile actions of Iranian actors given [the return of sanctions].” An appreciation of political realities and how cyber defenses might be adjusted accordingly is a critical step in the right direction.

According to one compliance expert:\nCybersecurity is intersecting in a new way with BSA/AML compliance, and it’s becoming increasingly important that BSA/AML officers are aware of the kinds of cyberthreats out there. . . . There used to be a lot of silos out there, where compliance, risk management, network security, [were] separate parts, but today’s cybersecurity environment means all those departments need to be interconnected in a new way.\nTechnology is certainly part of the solution, but greater and better communication amongst BSA/AML/CFT and cybersecurity professionals within the government and private sector offers a long-term path to success. The past few years have seen progress toward this concept; for instance, on October 25, 2016, FinCEN issued a cyber threats advisory wherein it explained the proliferation of cyber events is a significant threat to the U.S. financial system. Accordingly, FinCEN prompted financial institutions to use the well-known SAR reporting mechanism to report anomalous cyber events (“cyber SARs”). The rationale behind the cyber SAR is that information sharing between the government and private sector can help “guard against and report money laundering, terrorism financing, and cyber-enabled crime.” Traditionally, the cyber domain was foreign to BSA/AML teams in the private sector, and most departments lacked expertise and cross-training in the disciplines, but the FinCEN cyber SAR may help upend the longstanding but unhelpful paradigm.\nRecall the 176 days Iranian hackers targeted U.S. companies.

CONCLUSION\nThe U.S. stands at a crossroads. Will it forge a new world on its terms or succumb to a thousand cuts perpetrated by malicious actors across the globe? The current domestic and international AML and CFT regimes are insufficient. As America learned to its sorrow, devastating terrorist attacks can be inexpensive to action and terrorists are not easily targeted in this new world. The NYDFS Regulations offer hope by binding together American foreign policy and financial sector protections. Yet the government cannot foist a majority of responsibility on the private sector and proceed to abandon it in the face of\n Schmidle, supra note 330 (reporting that at least one of the targeted banks resorted to hacking back).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act, H.R. 4036, 115th Cong.

The avarice of China, the misdirection promulgated by Russia, and the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran will not soon disappear. Education is certainly part of the answer; predictive analysis of threats is possible with sufficient knowledge of global events. In the mid-twentieth century, a famous maxim for a world at war was “loose lips sink ships” but in modern times a more appropriate slogan might be “communicate to protect.” Until America learns to communicate across federal and state governments, across CI sectors and disciplines, it leaves itself vulnerable to continued attack.\nAs befits a new battlefield, the U.S. is bringing novel arms to bear. Financial institutions are in certain meaningful ways extensions of federal policies and agencies. Yet more needs to be done; an appreciation for the world as it is, a kind of twenty-first century realpolitik, is necessary to close the delta between existing regulation and what must be done to protect America in years to come.",

Now, almost two decades into the post-9/11 world, state and non-state actors, transnational terrorists, and cyber operators thrive in twilight zones of domestic and international law. The past few years carry signs of troubles to come. Transnational terrorism, struck down in certain areas, but emboldened by twenty years of muddled U.S. and Allied counterterrorism policy, threatens again to break out of its Middle Eastern base. China is stealing U.S. trade secrets at a rate beyond alarming and forcing American companies to work inside China or forfeit profitable trade deals. Russia, a shadow of what it once was during the height of the Soviet Union, now seeks to project strength through information warfare against the West. North Korea too has learned how to fight in the cyber domain — its hackers rob banks worldwide and hold companies hostage through advanced cyber operations. As sanctions continue to strangle Iran’s economy, its cyber forces strike repeatedly at U.S. financial institutions in the hope of securing political and economic concessions. To triumph in this complex and increasingly cyber-reliant world, the U.S. must accomplish four goals: (1) stop terrorist financing; (2) attribute and punish state and non-state malicious actors; (3) protect the private sector; and (4) realize a systematic, predictive method for cyber defense.\n Sean D.

NEW CONCEPTIONS OF WARFARE\n### A. Changing Norms\nRules in warfare date to ancient Greece. Almost two thousand years later, during the rise of the early modern world a “series of treaties that formed the Peace of Westphalia [and] ended the Thirty Years War . . . created a system of legally equal [sovereignties]” and marked the beginning of international law as applied to state-on-state conflict. A leap forward in what is now termed the Law of Armed Conflict (“LOAC”) occurred in 1863. In the midst of the American Civil War, President Lincoln’s Administration empowered Francis Lieber to write General Order No. 100, Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field which provided “basic rules [regarding lawful and unlawful] combat, including [discussions] relating to the treatment of civilians” during hostilities. General Order No. 100 became the template for all subsequent LOAC codes. Most significantly, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which are comprised of four treaties, were adopted after World War II to mandate humane treatment of persons in wartime. The Geneva Conventions established rules that now appear straightforward when juxtaposed\n Rosa Ehrenreich Brooks, *War Everywhere: Rights, National Security Law, and the Law of Armed Conflict in the Age of Terror*, 153 U.

As Sean Murphy has argued:\nMany of the controversies [arose] because the two [operative] paradigms... within the Geneva Conventions – . . . ‘international’ armed conflict (i.e., conflict between two or more states[, or “IAC”]) and . . . ‘noninternational’ armed conflict between [intra-]state and nonstate actors ([usually deemed a civil war, or “NIAC”]) do not fit the [typology] of global terrorism, [which is the province of] transnational conflict [amongst] state and nonstate actors.\nYet more difficult is the “unprivileged enemy belligerent” (UEB) category arising from NIACs and constituting persons, which encompasses one who:\n(A) has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners; (B) has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against\n See generally id.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, art. 51(3), opened for signature Dec. 12, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Protocol I].\n Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4(A)(2), Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135.\n Protocol I, supra note 19.

In the complex post-9/11 world, the U.S. maintains UEBs can be lawfully detained until the end of hostilities. Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court likewise endorse this position even though it continues to lack broad international support.\nThe normative understandings regarding the application of *jus ad bellum*, the portion of international law governing when states may resort to force, changed tremendously since 9/11.

The Council “[u]nequivocally condemn[ed] in the strongest terms the horrifying terrorist attacks which took place on 11 September 2001 in New York, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania and regard[ed] such acts, like any act of international terrorism, as a threat to international peace and security.” Additionally, recognizing that terrorists obtaining money to recruit for, plan, and execute their missions is a condition precedent to most attacks, the Council in Resolution 1373 obliged states to cooperate against terrorist financing and freeze the financial assets of all persons who participate in, or facilitate, acts of terror.

Targeting Evolved\nDuring the twentieth century, when the model of state-on-state conflict prevailed, the LOAC targeting analysis for standard rules of engagement was more straightforward because determinations often involved status-based as opposed to conduct-based targets. Status-based targets are lawful combatants who, per Geneva Convention III requirements, act “[u]nder responsible command; [w]ear a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; [c]arry arms openly; and [a]bide by the laws of war.” In contrast, conduct-based targets consistently violate LOAC standards by, for example, attacking uniformed lawful combatants while wearing civilian clothes in order to blend and hide themselves within civilian populations. Ahmad Fadhil Nazzal al-Khalaylah, who later renamed himself Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was a notorious practitioner of perfidy and treachery in Iraq and routinely violated the rules of LOAC. Al-Zarqawi and his followers were difficult to target in Iraq because they did not wear uniforms and choose to commit on-camera beheadings in safe houses and bombing civilians over direct combat with U.S.-led coalition forces.

Might persons loosely affiliated with ISIS goals living in Manila, learning bomb-making tradecraft online, and counseling like-minded associates qualify as conduct-based targets?53 To make the analogy even more attenuated, how about Manila ISIS sympathizers who are effective online ideologues and later credited as sources of inspiration by lone-wolf actors who targeted civilians?\n## III. FINANCIAL WARFARE\n## A. Little Flash, Big Bang\nConventional armed conflicts tend to conform to predictable patterns whereby combatants are deployed against fixed units.54 Terrorism embraces unconventional tactics because it is a means to challenge stronger powers.55 No universal definition of terrorism exists, although it is understood to have four key components: \"(1) a violent act; (2) civilian victim(s); (3) the [terrorists] have a political, religious, or social motive; and (4) terrorists seek to provoke a political reaction and spread fear.\"56 A peculiar feature of terrorism amongst transnational violence is that \"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom\n\n[Vol. 25:2\nfighter,” i.e., terrorism is not inherently perceived as either criminal or illegitimate.57 Indeed, there are certain sets of circumstances such as struggles for political voice or self-determination about which there is no consensus whether terrorist-type tactics are unlawful but excusable or unlawful yet justifiable or perhaps even lawful according to international norms.58 These ambiguities and varying perspectives are why international law, in part, has not reached a universal definition of terrorism.59\nIn certain respects, terrorism is an ancient gambit and a modern manifestation of old wine in a new bottle.60 It was first associated with the excesses of the French Revolution’s “regime de la terreur” and evolved over a century to describe non-state actors applying their aptitude for subversion, disruption and anarchy to the controlling Russian and French governments of the late nineteenth century.61 Following World War II, terrorists made headlines around the world by hijacking civilian aircraft.62 In response, “[t]he international community enacted treaties” and increased airport security measures which, taken together, reduced the incidence of harm to passengers.63 It was at this moment, the late 1960s and early 1970s, that terrorists relearned the valuable lesson of grabbing headlines, which was critical for the emergence of a new type of transnational terrorism.64\nGenerally, twenty-first century terrorism arises from a mix of religious fervor reinforced with political ideology and geopolitical goals.65 The initial campaign against Al Qaeda following 9/11 “has morphed into transnational conflicts against various terrorist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and [Syria (ISIS)] that did not exist in 2001.”66 This metastasized to pose a greater threat to society because terrorists are harder to deter; the relationship between the means employed and the goals are more attenuated; attacks are increasing in scale; and the proliferation and greater availability of weapons of mass destruction coupled\n\n2019]\nCYBER REALPOLITIK\n\nIt is axiomatic that terrorist attacks do not require large amounts of money and their impact is disproportionate to their cost. 9/11 cost Al Qaeda approximately $500,000. The cost to the U.S. was upwards of $3.3 trillion. Put differently, al Qaeda received a $7 million return on investment for every dollar it spent planning and carrying out its attacks. The cost in human life was far greater. On 9/11, 19 men hijacked four fuel-laden commercial jets bound for West Coast destinations. 2,753 people lost their lives in Manhattan when American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the Twin Towers. 184 people died when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon and 40 more people were killed aboard United Airlines Flight 93 when the plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. For the U.S. military, Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn, Inherent Resolve, and Freedom’s Sentinel resulted in 6,978 U.S. casualties.\n## B. Funding Terror\nTerrorist groups like “ISIS, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Boko Haram rely upon vast networks of money moving around the world” to finance their ideologies. Without this extensive network of funding, most terrorist organizations would be unable to launch attacks or find the impact of their attacks blunted. Khalid Sheik Mohammed, “the principle architect of the 9/11 attacks,” used wire transfers and funds that were delivered to the U.S. or deposited abroad and then accessed from within the U.S. His nephew, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, aided the 9/11 terrorists by wiring $114,500 to the U.S. that was utilized by an associated cell\n See Young, supra note 61, at 28-29.\n 9/11 Panel: al Qaeda Planned to Hijack 10 Planes, CNN (June 17, 2004), http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/16/911.commission/ [https://perma.cc/DP3TGLP6].\n Kimberly Amadeo, How the 9/11 Attacks Affect the Economy Today, BALANCE (Nov. 6, 2018), https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-9-11-attacks-still-affect-the-economy-today-3305536 [https://perma.cc/C38M-G4NK].\n See id.\n September 11 Terror Attacks Fast Facts, CNN (Sept. 3, 2018), https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/27/us/september-11-anniversary-fast-facts/index.html [https://perma.cc/4ZKJ-GWYE].\n Id.\n Casualty Status, U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

Aziz sent multiple “bank-to-bank transfers –including transactions for $10,000, $20,000, and $70,000–to bank accounts at SunTrust Bank in Florida.” The transaction amounts to SunTrust are notable because, pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the bank was required to report Customer Transaction Reports (“CTRs”) above $10,000 to the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) and file a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) for any wire transfer they deemed suspicious. Tragically, SunTrust never filed a SAR in connection with the 9/11 attacks and indeed no financial institution filed a SAR in connection with any of the 19 hijackers’ transactions before 9/11.\nTerrorist organizations go about raising money in different ways; some rely on criminal activity whereas others acquire revenue from private donations from interested persons or groups. They do so because “[f]inancing is required not only to fund specific missions but to meet the broader organizational costs of developing and maintaining a terrorist organization and to create an enabling environment necessary to sustain their activities.” While the direct cost of mounting specific attacks is alarmingly low, it does cost money to maintain a terrorist network, enable recruitment, sustain terror cells, and fund planning and procurement between attacks. Further, terror groups require funds “to finance the ostensibly legitimate activities required to provide a veil of legitimacy for their organizations.” As a result, “[d]isrupting terrorist financing involves both systemic safeguards, which protect financial systems from abuse, and targeted economic sanctions informed by counterterrorism intelligence.”\n Id. at 224.

Disrupt to Protect\nPresident Bush declared the “War on Terror” on September 20, 2001.92 Four days later, he instigated the “Financial War on Terror” when he said the U.S. “will starve terrorists of funding, turn them against each other, rout them out of their safe hiding places, and bring them to justice.”93 President Bush made an explicit connection between stopping terrorist financing and preventing real-world attacks on Americans when he said “[m]oney is the lifeblood of terrorist organizations.”94 His announcement was followed by frequent declarations — notably from David D. Aufhauser, General Counsel to the U.S. Department of\n\n[Vol. 25:2\nthe Treasury — calling for more efforts aimed at freezing terrorist funding sources. In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Aufhauser explained that on 9/11 he was at an international money laundering conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in which there was a lot of self-congratulations on current efforts to curb money laundering. However, when the entire conference watched the World Trade Center buildings collapse, Aufhauser explained that:\nIt was . . . the realization that the gathering had been looking, for too long, at the world through the wrong end of a telescope. Money had been spirited around the globe by means and measures and in denominations that mocked detection. The most serious threat to our well-being was now clean money intended to kill, not dirty money seeking a place of hiding.\n“Terrorist groups and criminal networks share many of the same characteristics, including methods and sources of finance.” In 2011, Yury Fedotov, the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, remarked “criminal profits from drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, and money laundering represent an increasing share of terrorist finance.” Prior to 9/11, the U.S. government lacked the know-how to stop terrorist financing. When the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) was admonished for its lack of information on al-Qaeda’s finances pre-9/11, its lackluster response was “terrorist financing [is] an extraordinarily hard target.” Indeed, the U.S. had “considered it futile to monitor al Qaeda’s money\n David Aufhauser, *Testimony of David D.

In a certain sense, financial warfare is not a new concept for the U.S. government; the U.S. first codified presidential authority to employ economic sanctions against foreign countries in 1917 in the Trading with the Enemy Act (“TWEA”). Some decades later the U.S. created the Treasury Department’s “Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to target Chinese assets during the Korean Conflict.” 9/11 was a watershed moment, however, and exigencies necessitated creative measures to halt terrorist financing. Two weeks after the attacks, President Bush issued Executive Order 13224 (“E.O. 13224”) which froze the assets of twenty-seven individuals and organizations. E.O. 13224 “centered on two goals: stopping the flow of money to al Qaeda and convincing the public that something was being done.” E.O. 13224 declared a national emergency and allowed President Bush to use the powers of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”). Using this power under IEEPA, President Bush authorized the Treasury Department “to freeze the assets of foreign and domestic organizations within [U.S. jurisdiction], including assets of financial\nhttp://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Monograph.pdf [https://perma.cc/BQ38-GPRL].\n Justin Santolli, Note, The Terrorist Finance Tracking Program: Illuminating the Shortcomings of the European Union’s Antiquated Data Privacy Directive, 40 GEO.

Title III of the PATRIOT Act sets forth the regulations concerning countering terrorist financing (“CFT”). The Act strengthened the executive branch’s ability to freeze and seize assets, broadened the President’s power under the IEEPA, and expanded U.S. extraterritorial jurisdiction.\nThe PATRIOT Act was so revolutionary in certain respects that David Aufhauser described Title III as “‘the smart bomb of terrorist financing.’” Amongst the Act’s most significant measures was its requirement that “banks, savings associations, credit unions, securities broker-dealers, mutual funds, futures commission merchants, and introducing brokers enhance their customer identification measures.” All U.S. financial institutions were required to maintain anti-money laundering (“AML”) programs. Additionally, the Act expanded the number of entities required to file SARs: “[w]here before the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 required banks and credit unions to report $10,000 or more in cash transfers, now ‘any person who is engaged in a trade or business’ that received more than $10,000 in cash must file an SAR.”\nDespite the PATRIOT Act’s broad scope, some critics maintained that it was a “hastily assembled” version of existing AML legislation from the 1980s and 1990s originally intended to combat drug cartels and enterprise crime.

International Efforts\nThe U.S. “spends more on its defense budget than the next eight states combined but it [does not] go after terrorist finance on its own,” since it requires assistance from the international community. From a global perspective, the creation of a comprehensive AML/CFT strategy was “drawn from the idea that cutting off terrorist funds could slow down, disturb, and dismantle terrorist networks.” To implement this strategy, “two international organizations—namely, the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) created and perpetuate[d] a system of measures to prohibit acts of financing, freeze terrorist funds, and track down terrorists.” After 9/11, “substantial efforts [were] made to assure that countries [had] adopted and implemented laws consistent with these measures.” Nonetheless, these programs receive scant attention relative to their importance and there continues\nlaundering “is typically a three-step process: (i) placement—the launderer puts criminally-derived money into a legitimate enterprise; (ii) layering—the launderer places the money in . . . pretextual transactions to obfuscate the original source; and (iii) integration—the launderer [changes] the funds into non-cash instruments” like bank notes and letters of credit to finance criminal activities.

A primary mechanism by which the FATF seeks to accomplish its goals is by having its members implement “Recommendations” which do not have the force of law although “failure to implement them is grounds for expulsion from the organization.” Despite their soft-law nature, Recommendations hold significant sway because countries do not want to be excluded from the FATF. On the contrary, nations blacklisted by the FATF for non-compliance understand there can be significant consequences. In February 2018, the U.S. urged the FATF to place Pakistan, which was on the non-compliant list from 2012 to 2015, on notice it was again violating CFT standards. Pakistan was apprehensive that the move would further isolate the country from the global community, damage its weak economy, cripple its banking sector and hinder its access to international markets. Consequently, Pakistan scrambled in recent months to get back into compliance.

Pursuant to CTITF guidelines, “[t]errorism financing incorporates the distinct activities of fund-raising, storing and concealing funds, using funds to sustain terrorist organizations and infrastructure, and transferring funds to support or carry out specific terrorist attacks.” “Money laundering and terrorist financing are characterized by somewhat opposing dynamics and objectives.” Money laundering’s goal is to eradicate the illicit origin of funds to prevent actors from enjoying the profits of their predicate crimes. Terrorist financing implies “money dirtying,” which is the reverse of money laundering. In other words, terrorist financing aims to divert “clean money” into terrorist activities while money launderers want to conceal the origin of “dirty money.” Notwithstanding differences, domestic and international law tend to construe these activities in a similar light and the policy decision is often girded by arguments of rationality and efficiency. Effective strategies against both terrorist financing and money laundering necessitate a “horizontal strategy” embracing a wide variety of fields, including criminal law, administrative law, and … international law.” Moreover, terrorist financing and money laundering presuppose the deployment of financial institutions for illicit\n Id.\n Id.\n U.N.

Finally, money laundering can be of singular importance in concealing the illegal origin and destination of funds directed to finance terrorist activities. For these reasons, combining AML/CFT strategies is usually good policy. For example, the Money Laundering Control Act makes it a crime to knowingly “conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or . . . to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law.” Further, many “federal agencies investigate cases of suspected money laundering and terrorist financing, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”\n## IV.

The Council was especially concerned with attacks on Critical Infrastructure (“CI”), which is necessary to the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy and in particular the financial sector.

Public-Private Information Sharing\nAs John Chung has argued:\nA basic challenge in cybersecurity is the fact almost eighty-five percent of America’s CI is owned by the private sector. . . . CI systems are [therefore] owned and operated by [a myriad of] businesses, which in turn may have thousands more private entities who . . . supply, service, or access the CI systems. The national cybersecurity framework [published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”)] relies on private actors to invest in a sufficient amount of cybersecurity measures to [mitigate or] avoid catastrophic damage to CI. However . . . [t]he government does not impose [a security regime on the private sector], leaving it to the private-sector entities to set their own practices and policies for protecting their computer systems.\nFurther, “[o]n February 18, 2013 the private cybersecurity firm Mandiant [released] a report on a group it [dubbed] Advanced Persistent Threat 1 (APT1) that had purportedly breached almost 150 organizations since 2007.” Mandiant asserted APT1 is most likely a Chinese Army cyber unit.; although China denounced the accusations, the U.S. government shifted from oblique allusions to openly calling China out as a significant source of cyber events. On one hand, Mandiant’s vocal attribution of cyber meddling to China facilitated the ability of the U.S. to attribute bad acts to China. On the other hand, it\n *Id.* The goal of the NIST Framework is to guide the development of a voluntary risk-based approach to cybersecurity. *NAT’L INST.

For instance, “private companies investigate networks of malware-infected systems used by transnational criminal groups for financial fraud,” while the government has become a true market participant by buying software vulnerabilities on the gray market and purposefully not disclosing them to software makers that could remedy the flaws. Yet, “[t]he private sector is struggling to contend with the growing scope, scale, and complexity of cyber” operations.\nAs it stands, the U.S. government and the private sector are stuck at an impasse concerning cybersecurity information sharing. U.S. companies argue that the federal government should take an active role in its cyber defense while the intelligence community is loath to part with its classification methods lest technical sources and methods be placed at risk. A solution with increasing support is a national classified cyber information-sharing network between the federal government and the private sector. In this schema, an already-existing classified network for defense contractors would be expanded to private CI companies. This is not entirely far-fetched since David Sanger, the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, remarked that the U.S. should come to grips with certain realities to remain a decisive actor in the cyber domain to include ending the reflexive attitude federal cyber defenses must extend to government networks and no further. It is worth noting that public-private information sharing only works when the private sector acts on the information it receives.\n“On September 7, 2017, Equifax, one of the [biggest] consumer-credit reporting agencies in the world,” announced that its consumer information had\n Kristen E.

The hackers, likely DPRK proxies, threatened to release more confidential documents unless Sony refused to show the movie. Unfortunately, many theatres across the U.S. acquiesced to the hackers’ demands and pulled the movie from their lineups. In the wake of the ensuing controversy, the U.S. government took an unusual step and publicly blamed North Korea for the Sony hack.

Critically, UNSCR 1929 in 2010 recognized a \"potential connection between Iran's revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities.\"302 Claiming international legitimacy from the UNSCR language, the United States revived the ISA secondary sanctions regime and expanded it with new legislation aimed at cutting off all foreign support to Iran's energy sector.303\nIn 2015, the Obama Administration, alongside the P5+1 Group — comprised of the U.S., United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany — agreed to a long-term deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program.304 Per the accord, \"Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.\"305 The agreement was termed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (\"JCPOA\") and\n\n[Vol. 25:2 -\nwas a signature foreign policy achievement for President Obama. At the time, the Republican-controlled Congress was skeptical about JCPOA because it perceived Iran as untrustworthy and was sympathetic to Israel’s security concerns over the deal. On May 8, 2018, the Trump Administration ended U.S. participation in JCPOA. President Trump declared JCPOA was “so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.”\nAn analysis of Iran’s behavior post-Stuxnet through the end of the JCPOA is highly valuable because it offers a blueprint for how cyber defenders can and should view the world. From this analysis, it is clear that reliable predictive analysis that informs defensive postures and protocols is the single most valuable commodity for cyber defenders and ultimately sovereign nations:\nStarting in 2009, Iran’s uranium centrifuges began failing, and nobody understood why. Nearly one thousand of Iran’s six thousand centrifuges were destroyed over the course of a year. In the summer of 2010, a computer security firm in Belarus was hired to troubleshoot Iranian computers that mysteriously kept crashing—and in this investigation, the firm stumbled upon a series of files that would later become known as the Stuxnet virus. The Stuxnet virus was recognized as the “world’s first digital weapon.” It was a complex malware designed to infiltrate secure Iranian nuclear facilities, infect the industrial controllers that operated the nuclear centrifuges, and destroy those centrifuges by manipulating the pressure levels and rotor speeds inside them . . . [d]espite the significant attempt to cover its origins, experts concluded that Stuxnet was a joint United States and Israeli production.\nOn the eleventh anniversary of 9/11, an Iranian group calling itself the “Cyber Fighters of IZZ ad-Din al-Qassam” claimed credit for a series of targeted operations against specific U.S. financial institutions.

In a Twitter post, the group claimed responsibility and argued, “the attacks [were] launched in retaliation for the continued presence on YouTube of the American-made film The Innocence of Muslims” that portrayed Muslims in general, and the prophet Mohammed in particular, “in an unflattering light.” The group “vowed to continue [its] attacks until the U.S. President ordered the film removed from the Internet.” Yet contrary to their claims, the “Cyber Fighters of IZZ ad-Din al-Qassam” did not indiscriminately attack financial institutions. Rather, the targets were carefully vetted and were primarily institutions that, “complied with the terms of the ongoing U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, part of the . . . effort to halt Iran’s nuclear arms program.” Further, the anonymous Twitter account from which the group issued its demand to remove the film was the same that posted messages following an earlier cyberattack on the internal computer network of Aramco, the Saudi Arabian oil conglomerate.

The cyber intrusions occurred against the backdrop of the U.S. and Iran negotiating a deal curbing Iran’s nuclear-power ambitions. Overall, the Obama Administration was cautious and largely defensive regarding the Ababil operation:\nEven a proposal by then National Security Agency (NSA) Director, Keith Alexander, to shut down the computer [systems] in Iran responsible for the DDoS attacks by a covert cyber operation [was seemingly rejected by officials] because [they] “were unsure that the action could be so precise and expressed concern that affecting a server in Iran—even if in self-defense—would represent a violation of its sovereignty” and [provoke] escalation.\nAnd the possibility “of using diplomatic back-channels was [likewise shelved because] it was [argued] that doing so might prompt the Iranians to intensify their attacks.” In turn, the Obama Administration’s decision to refrain from an immediate, vocal, and firm response to stop the Ababil operation frustrated and undermined the helpless victim-institutions and led them to seriously consider self-help options like hack-backs against the attackers’ servers.\n Id.\n Id.\n U.S. Dep’t of Justice Press Release, supra note 315.\n See supra text accompanying notes 304-306.

John Hultquist, director of research at the leading cybersecurity firm FireEye, recently asserted, “Banks are taking a hard look at Iranian threat actors right now. We’ve advised all of our clients in the critical infrastructure space to consider the historic hostile actions of Iranian actors given [the return of sanctions].” An appreciation of political realities and how cyber defenses might be adjusted accordingly is a critical step in the right direction.

According to one compliance expert:\nCybersecurity is intersecting in a new way with BSA/AML compliance, and it’s becoming increasingly important that BSA/AML officers are aware of the kinds of cyberthreats out there. . . . There used to be a lot of silos out there, where compliance, risk management, network security, [were] separate parts, but today’s cybersecurity environment means all those departments need to be interconnected in a new way.\nTechnology is certainly part of the solution, but greater and better communication amongst BSA/AML/CFT and cybersecurity professionals within the government and private sector offers a long-term path to success. The past few years have seen progress toward this concept; for instance, on October 25, 2016, FinCEN issued a cyber threats advisory wherein it explained the proliferation of cyber events is a significant threat to the U.S. financial system. Accordingly, FinCEN prompted financial institutions to use the well-known SAR reporting mechanism to report anomalous cyber events (“cyber SARs”). The rationale behind the cyber SAR is that information sharing between the government and private sector can help “guard against and report money laundering, terrorism financing, and cyber-enabled crime.” Traditionally, the cyber domain was foreign to BSA/AML teams in the private sector, and most departments lacked expertise and cross-training in the disciplines, but the FinCEN cyber SAR may help upend the longstanding but unhelpful paradigm.\nRecall the 176 days Iranian hackers targeted U.S. companies.

CONCLUSION\nThe U.S. stands at a crossroads. Will it forge a new world on its terms or succumb to a thousand cuts perpetrated by malicious actors across the globe? The current domestic and international AML and CFT regimes are insufficient. As America learned to its sorrow, devastating terrorist attacks can be inexpensive to action and terrorists are not easily targeted in this new world. The NYDFS Regulations offer hope by binding together American foreign policy and financial sector protections. Yet the government cannot foist a majority of responsibility on the private sector and proceed to abandon it in the face of\n Schmidle, supra note 330 (reporting that at least one of the targeted banks resorted to hacking back).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act, H.R. 4036, 115th Cong.

The avarice of China, the misdirection promulgated by Russia, and the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran will not soon disappear. Education is certainly part of the answer; predictive analysis of threats is possible with sufficient knowledge of global events. In the mid-twentieth century, a famous maxim for a world at war was “loose lips sink ships” but in modern times a more appropriate slogan might be “communicate to protect.” Until America learns to communicate across federal and state governments, across CI sectors and disciplines, it leaves itself vulnerable to continued attack.\nAs befits a new battlefield, the U.S. is bringing novel arms to bear. Financial institutions are in certain meaningful ways extensions of federal policies and agencies. Yet more needs to be done; an appreciation for the world as it is, a kind of twenty-first century realpolitik, is necessary to close the delta between existing regulation and what must be done to protect America in years to come."

Transnational terrorism, struck down in certain areas, but emboldened by twenty years of muddled U.S. and Allied counterterrorism policy, threatens again to break out of its Middle Eastern base.⁵ China is stealing U.S. trade secrets at a rate beyond alarming and forcing American companies to work inside China or forfeit profitable trade deals.⁶ Russia, a shadow of what it once was during the height of the Soviet Union,⁷ now seeks to project strength through information warfare against the West.⁸ North Korea too has learned how to fight in the cyber domain — its hackers rob banks worldwide and hold companies hostage through advanced cyber operations.⁹ As sanctions continue to strangle Iran’s economy, its cyber forces strike repeatedly at U.S. financial institutions in the hope of securing political and economic concessions.¹⁰ To triumph in this complex and increasingly cyber-reliant world, the U.S. must accomplish four goals: (1) stop terrorist financing; (2) attribute and punish state and non-state malicious actors; (3) protect the private sector; and (4) realize a systematic, predictive method for cyber defense.\n³ Sean D.

Changing Norms\nRules in warfare date to ancient Greece.¹¹ Almost two thousand years later, during the rise of the early modern world a “series of treaties that formed the Peace of Westphalia [and] ended the Thirty Years War . . . created a system of legally equal [sovereignties]” and marked the beginning of international law as applied to state-on-state conflict.¹² A leap forward in what is now termed the Law of Armed Conflict¹³ (“LOAC”) occurred in 1863.¹⁴ In the midst of the American Civil War, President Lincoln’s Administration empowered Francis Lieber to write General Order No. 100, Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field which provided “basic rules [regarding lawful and unlawful] combat, including [discussions] relating to the treatment of civilians” during hostilities.¹⁵ General Order No. 100 became the template for all subsequent LOAC codes.¹⁶ Most significantly, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which are comprised of four treaties, were adopted after World War II to mandate humane treatment of persons in wartime.¹⁷ The Geneva Conventions established rules that now appear straightforward when juxtaposed\n¹¹ Rosa Ehrenreich Brooks, *War Everywhere: Rights, National Security Law, and the Law of Armed Conflict in the Age of Terror*, 153 U.

Money had been spirited around the globe by means and measures and in denominations that mocked detection. The most serious threat to our well-being was now clean money intended to kill, not dirty money seeking a place of hiding.⁹⁷\n“Terrorist groups and criminal networks share many of the same characteristics, including methods and sources of finance.”⁹⁸ In 2011, Yury Fedotov, the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, remarked “criminal profits from drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, and money laundering represent an increasing share of terrorist finance.”⁹⁹ Prior to 9/11, the U.S. government lacked the know-how to stop terrorist financing.¹⁰⁰ When the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) was admonished for its lack of information on al-Qaeda’s finances pre-9/11, its lackluster response was “terrorist financing [is] an extraordinarily hard target.”¹⁰¹ Indeed, the U.S. had “considered it futile to monitor al Qaeda’s money\n⁹⁵ David Aufhauser, *Testimony of David D.

Two weeks after the attacks, President Bush issued Executive Order 13224 (“E.O. 13224”) which froze the assets of twenty-seven individuals and organizations.¹⁰⁸ E.O. 13224 “centered on two goals: stopping the flow of money to al Qaeda and convincing the public that something was being done.”¹⁰⁹ E.O. 13224 declared a national emergency and allowed President Bush to use the powers of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”).¹¹⁰ Using this power under IEEPA, President Bush authorized the Treasury Department “to freeze the assets of foreign and domestic organizations within [U.S. jurisdiction], including assets of financial\nhttp://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Monograph.pdf [https://perma.cc/BQ38-GPRL].\n¹⁰² Justin Santolli, Note, The Terrorist Finance Tracking Program: Illuminating the Shortcomings of the European Union’s Antiquated Data Privacy Directive, 40 GEO.

International Efforts\nThe U.S. “spends more on its defense budget than the next eight states combined but it [does not] go after terrorist finance on its own,”¹²⁵ since it requires assistance from the international community.¹²⁶ From a global perspective, the creation of a comprehensive AML/CFT strategy was “drawn from the idea that cutting off terrorist funds could slow down, disturb, and dismantle terrorist networks.”¹²⁷ To implement this strategy, “two international organizations—namely, the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) created and perpetuate[d] a system of measures to prohibit acts of financing, freeze terrorist funds, and track down terrorists.”¹²⁸ After 9/11, “substantial efforts [were] made to assure that countries [had] adopted and implemented laws consistent with these measures.”¹²⁹ Nonetheless, these programs receive scant attention relative to their importance and there continues\nlaundering “is typically a three-step process: (i) placement—the launderer puts criminally-derived money into a legitimate enterprise; (ii) layering—the launderer places the money in . . . pretextual transactions to obfuscate the original source; and (iii) integration—the launderer [changes] the funds into non-cash instruments” like bank notes and letters of credit to finance criminal activities.

In 1979, Iranian revolutionaries held more than fifty American diplomats and citizens hostage for 444 days. During the hostage crisis, the U.S. imposed the first of many sanctions regimes on Iran, freezing all Iranian assets until 1981, when the hostages were released. The Reagan administration reinstated trade restrictions in response to Iran's state sponsorship of terrorism . . . prohibiting nearly all imports from Iran to the United States.\nIran continued to sponsor terrorism in the region into the 1990s, including Hamas militants opposed to the Middle East peace process. When Iran then revived its efforts to enrich uranium, President Clinton . . . imposed a full trade and investment embargo, barring all U.S. trade with Iran. Congress went a step further and passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (now known as the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA) which . . . imposed U.S. trade penalties on foreign companies determined to have invested more than $20 million in Iranian petroleum development. . .\nHowever, the Clinton and then Bush administrations preferred to use diplomatic pressure to convince foreign companies to leave the Iranian market rather than impose sanctions using the ISA authorities. . .\nBy 2006, Iran's progress toward a nuclear weapon reached a crisis point [and] the global community responded from 2006 to 2010 with new United Nations (UN) sanctions . . . in a series of UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). Critically, UNSCR 1929 in 2010 recognized a \"potential connection between Iran's revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities.\"302 Claiming international legitimacy from the UNSCR language, the United States revived the ISA secondary sanctions regime and expanded it with new legislation aimed at cutting off all foreign support to Iran's energy sector.303\nIn 2015, the Obama Administration, alongside the P5+1 Group — comprised of the U.S., United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany — agreed to a long-term deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program.304 Per the accord, \"Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.\"305 The agreement was termed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (\"JCPOA\") and\n302 Id. at 247.\n303 S.

Nearly one thousand of Iran’s six thousand centrifuges were destroyed over the course of a year. In the summer of 2010, a computer security firm in Belarus was hired to troubleshoot Iranian computers that mysteriously kept crashing—and in this investigation, the firm stumbled upon a series of files that would later become known as the Stuxnet virus. The Stuxnet virus was recognized as the “world’s first digital weapon.” It was a complex malware designed to infiltrate secure Iranian nuclear facilities, infect the industrial controllers that operated the nuclear centrifuges, and destroy those centrifuges by manipulating the pressure levels and rotor speeds inside them . . .

J. SCI. &amp; TECH. L.\n[Vol. 25:2]\nA fundamental tenet of modern financial institutions is “AML is a significant component of cybersecurity, such that AML measures cannot be effective without cybersecurity,” and cybersecurity at financial institutions cannot be accomplished without robust AML policies and procedures.³⁵⁶ According to one compliance expert:\nCybersecurity is intersecting in a new way with BSA/AML compliance, and it’s becoming increasingly important that BSA/AML officers are aware of the kinds of cyberthreats out there. . . . There used to be a lot of silos out there, where compliance, risk management, network security, [were] separate parts, but today’s cybersecurity environment means all those departments need to be interconnected in a new way.³⁵⁷\nTechnology is certainly part of the solution, but greater and better communication amongst BSA/AML/CFT and cybersecurity professionals within the government and private sector offers a long-term path to success. The past few years have seen progress toward this concept; for instance, on October 25, 2016, FinCEN issued a cyber threats advisory wherein it explained the proliferation of cyber events is a significant threat to the U.S. financial system.³⁵⁸ Accordingly, FinCEN prompted financial institutions to use the well-known SAR reporting mechanism to report anomalous cyber events (“cyber SARs”).³⁵⁹ The rationale behind the cyber SAR is that information sharing between the government and private sector can help “guard against and report money laundering, terrorism financing, and cyber-enabled crime.”³⁶⁰ Traditionally, the cyber domain was foreign to BSA/AML teams in the private sector, and most departments lacked expertise and cross-training in the disciplines, but the FinCEN cyber SAR may help upend the longstanding but unhelpful paradigm.³⁶¹\nRecall the 176 days Iranian hackers targeted U.S. companies.³⁶² Critically, “[t]he NSA knew in advance [about Iran’s] intent to penetrate the [financial\n³⁵⁶ Harry Dixon, *Maintaining Individual Liability in AML and Cybersecurity at New York’s Financial Institutions*, 5 PENN ST.

CONCLUSION\nThe U.S. stands at a crossroads. Will it forge a new world on its terms or succumb to a thousand cuts perpetrated by malicious actors across the globe? The current domestic and international AML and CFT regimes are insufficient. As America learned to its sorrow, devastating terrorist attacks can be inexpensive to action and terrorists are not easily targeted in this new world.

Transnational terrorism, struck down in certain areas, but emboldened by twenty years of muddled U.S. and Allied counterterrorism policy, threatens again to break out of its Middle Eastern base.⁵ China is stealing U.S. trade secrets at a rate beyond alarming and forcing American companies to work inside China or forfeit profitable trade deals.⁶ Russia, a shadow of what it once was during the height of the Soviet Union,⁷ now seeks to project strength through information warfare against the West.⁸ North Korea too has learned how to fight in the cyber domain — its hackers rob banks worldwide and hold companies hostage through advanced cyber operations.⁹ As sanctions continue to strangle Iran’s economy, its cyber forces strike repeatedly at U.S. financial institutions in the hope of securing political and economic concessions.¹⁰ To triumph in this complex and increasingly cyber-reliant world, the U.S. must accomplish four goals: (1) stop terrorist financing; (2) attribute and punish state and non-state malicious actors; (3) protect the private sector; and (4) realize a systematic, predictive method for cyber defense.\n³ Sean D.

NEW CONCEPTIONS OF WARFARE ### A. Changing Norms Rules in warfare date to ancient Greece.¹¹ Almost two thousand years later, during the rise of the early modern world a “series of treaties that formed the Peace of Westphalia [and] ended the Thirty Years War... created a system of legally equal [sovereignties]” and marked the beginning of international law as applied to state-on-state conflict.¹² A leap forward in what is now termed the Law of Armed Conflict¹³ (“LOAC”) occurred in 1863.¹⁴ In the midst of the American Civil War, President Lincoln’s Administration empowered Francis Lieber to write General Order No. 100, Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field which provided “basic rules [regarding lawful and unlawful] combat, including [discussions] relating to the treatment of civilians” during hostilities.¹⁵ General Order No. 100 became the template for all subsequent LOAC codes.¹⁶ Most significantly, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which are comprised of four treaties, were adopted after World War II to mandate humane treatment of persons in wartime.¹⁷ The Geneva Conventions established rules that now appear straightforward when juxtaposed ¹¹ Rosa Ehrenreich Brooks, *War Everywhere: Rights, National Security Law, and the Law of Armed Conflict in the Age of Terror*, 153 U.

Targeting Evolved During the twentieth century, when the model of state-on-state conflict prevailed, the LOAC targeting analysis for standard rules of engagement was more straightforward because determinations often involved status-based as opposed to conduct-based targets.⁴⁴ Status-based targets are lawful combatants who, per Geneva Convention III requirements, act “[u]nder responsible command; [w]ear a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; [c]arry arms openly; and [a]bide by the laws of war.”⁴⁵ In contrast, conduct-based targets consistently violate LOAC standards by, for example, attacking uniformed lawful combatants while wearing civilian clothes in order to blend and hide themselves within civilian populations.⁴⁶ Ahmad Fadhil Nazzal al-Khalaylah, who later renamed himself Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was a notorious practitioner of perfidy and treachery in Iraq and routinely violated the rules of LOAC.⁴⁷ Al-Zarqawi and his followers were difficult to target in Iraq because they did not wear uniforms⁴⁸ and choose to commit on-camera beheadings in safe houses and bombing civilians over direct combat with U.S.-led coalition forces.⁴⁹ On June 8, 2006, a U.S. precision airstrike targeting “a single dwelling in a wooded area ⁴³ Id.

Id.\n2019] CYBER REALPOLITIK Drone strike programs offer a prominent example of the conceptual challenges posed by applying traditional LOAC targeting standards to nonstate and terrorist actors.51 Former State Department Legal Adviser Harold Hongju Koh remarked about the Predator drone program that the U.S. maintains lawful recourse to\"lethal force... to defend itself... including by targeting persons such as high-level al Qaeda leaders who are planning attacks.\"52 The remark appears innocuous yet it presupposes nonstate actors and terrorist organizations maintain tightly-affiliated top-down relationships when they often consciously do not. Might persons loosely affiliated with ISIS goals living in Manila, learning bomb-making tradecraft online, and counseling like-minded associates qualify as conduct-based targets?53 To make the analogy even more attenuated, how about Manila ISIS sympathizers who are effective online ideologues and later credited as sources of inspiration by lone-wolf actors who targeted civilians?\n## III. FINANCIAL WARFARE ## A. Little Flash, Big Bang Conventional armed conflicts tend to conform to predictable patterns whereby combatants are deployed against fixed units.54 Terrorism embraces unconventional tactics because it is a means to challenge stronger powers.55 No universal definition of terrorism exists, although it is understood to have four key components:\"(1) a violent act; (2) civilian victim(s); (3) the [terrorists] have a political, religious, or social motive; and (4) terrorists seek to provoke a political reaction and spread fear.\"56 A peculiar feature of terrorism amongst transnational violence is that\"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom [Vol. 25:2 fighter,” i.e., terrorism is not inherently perceived as either criminal or illegitimate.57 Indeed, there are certain sets of circumstances such as struggles for political voice or self-determination about which there is no consensus whether terrorist-type tactics are unlawful but excusable or unlawful yet justifiable or perhaps even lawful according to international norms.58 These ambiguities and varying perspectives are why international law, in part, has not reached a universal definition of terrorism.59 In certain respects, terrorism is an ancient gambit and a modern manifestation of old wine in a new bottle.60 It was first associated with the excesses of the French Revolution’s “regime de la terreur” and evolved over a century to describe non-state actors applying their aptitude for subversion, disruption and anarchy to the controlling Russian and French governments of the late nineteenth century.61 Following World War II, terrorists made headlines around the world by hijacking civilian aircraft.62 In response, “[t]he international community enacted treaties” and increased airport security measures which, taken together, reduced the incidence of harm to passengers.63 It was at this moment, the late 1960s and early 1970s, that terrorists relearned the valuable lesson of grabbing headlines, which was critical for the emergence of a new type of transnational terrorism.64 Generally, twenty-first century terrorism arises from a mix of religious fervor reinforced with political ideology and geopolitical goals.65 The initial campaign against Al Qaeda following 9/11 “has morphed into transnational conflicts against various terrorist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and [Syria (ISIS)] that did not exist in 2001.”66 This metastasized to pose a greater threat to society because terrorists are harder to deter; the relationship between the means employed and the goals are more attenuated; attacks are increasing in scale; and the proliferation and greater availability of weapons of mass destruction coupled 2019] CYBER REALPOLITIK It is axiomatic that terrorist attacks do not require large amounts of money and their impact is disproportionate to their cost. 9/11 cost Al Qaeda approximately $500,000.⁶⁸ The cost to the U.S. was upwards of $3.3 trillion.⁶⁹ Put differently, al Qaeda received a $7 million return on investment for every dollar it spent planning and carrying out its attacks.⁷⁰ The cost in human life was far greater. On 9/11, 19 men hijacked four fuel-laden commercial jets bound for West Coast destinations. 2,753 people lost their lives in Manhattan when American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the Twin Towers.⁷¹ 184 people died when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon and 40 more people were killed aboard United Airlines Flight 93 when the plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.⁷² For the U.S. military, Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn, Inherent Resolve, and Freedom’s Sentinel resulted in 6,978 U.S. casualties.⁷³ ## B. Funding Terror Terrorist groups like “ISIS, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Boko Haram rely upon vast networks of money moving around the world” to finance their ideologies.⁷⁴ Without this extensive network of funding, most terrorist organizations would be unable to launch attacks or find the impact of their attacks blunted.⁷⁵ Khalid Sheik Mohammed, “the principle architect of the 9/11 attacks,” used wire transfers and funds that were delivered to the U.S. or deposited abroad and then accessed from within the U.S.⁷⁶ His nephew, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, aided the 9/11 terrorists by wiring $114,500 to the U.S. that was utilized by an associated cell ⁶⁷ See Young, supra note 61, at 28-29.\n⁶⁸ 9/11 Panel: al Qaeda Planned to Hijack 10 Planes, CNN (June 17, 2004), http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/16/911.commission/ [https://perma.cc/DP3TGLP6].\n⁶⁹ Kimberly Amadeo, How the 9/11 Attacks Affect the Economy Today, BALANCE (Nov. 6, 2018), https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-9-11-attacks-still-affect-the-economy-today-3305536 [https://perma.cc/C38M-G4NK].\n⁷⁰ See id.\n⁷¹ September 11 Terror Attacks Fast Facts, CNN (Sept. 3, 2018), https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/27/us/september-11-anniversary-fast-facts/index.html [https://perma.cc/4ZKJ-GWYE].\n⁷² Id.\n⁷³ Casualty Status, U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

Disrupt to Protect\nPresident Bush declared the “War on Terror” on September 20, 2001.92 Four days later, he instigated the “Financial War on Terror” when he said the U.S. “will starve terrorists of funding, turn them against each other, rout them out of their safe hiding places, and bring them to justice.”93 President Bush made an explicit connection between stopping terrorist financing and preventing real-world attacks on Americans when he said “[m]oney is the lifeblood of terrorist organizations.”94 His announcement was followed by frequent declarations — notably from David D. Aufhauser, General Counsel to the U.S. Department of\n\n[Vol. 25:2 the Treasury — calling for more efforts aimed at freezing terrorist funding sources.⁹⁵ In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Aufhauser explained that on 9/11 he was at an international money laundering conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in which there was a lot of self-congratulations on current efforts to curb money laundering.⁹⁶ However, when the entire conference watched the World Trade Center buildings collapse, Aufhauser explained that: It was... the realization that the gathering had been looking, for too long, at the world through the wrong end of a telescope. Money had been spirited around the globe by means and measures and in denominations that mocked detection. The most serious threat to our well-being was now clean money intended to kill, not dirty money seeking a place of hiding.⁹⁷ “Terrorist groups and criminal networks share many of the same characteristics, including methods and sources of finance.”⁹⁸ In 2011, Yury Fedotov, the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, remarked “criminal profits from drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, and money laundering represent an increasing share of terrorist finance.”⁹⁹ Prior to 9/11, the U.S. government lacked the know-how to stop terrorist financing.¹⁰⁰ When the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) was admonished for its lack of information on al-Qaeda’s finances pre-9/11, its lackluster response was “terrorist financing [is] an extraordinarily hard target.”¹⁰¹ Indeed, the U.S. had “considered it futile to monitor al Qaeda’s money ⁹⁵ David Aufhauser, *Testimony of David D.

Two weeks after the attacks, President Bush issued Executive Order 13224 (“E.O. 13224”) which froze the assets of twenty-seven individuals and organizations.¹⁰⁸ E.O. 13224 “centered on two goals: stopping the flow of money to al Qaeda and convincing the public that something was being done.”¹⁰⁹ E.O. 13224 declared a national emergency and allowed President Bush to use the powers of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”).¹¹⁰ Using this power under IEEPA, President Bush authorized the Treasury Department “to freeze the assets of foreign and domestic organizations within [U.S. jurisdiction], including assets of financial http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Monograph.pdf [https://perma.cc/BQ38-GPRL].\n¹⁰² Justin Santolli, Note, The Terrorist Finance Tracking Program: Illuminating the Shortcomings of the European Union’s Antiquated Data Privacy Directive, 40 GEO.

International Efforts\nThe U.S. “spends more on its defense budget than the next eight states combined but it [does not] go after terrorist finance on its own,”¹²⁵ since it requires assistance from the international community.¹²⁶ From a global perspective, the creation of a comprehensive AML/CFT strategy was “drawn from the idea that cutting off terrorist funds could slow down, disturb, and dismantle terrorist networks.”¹²⁷ To implement this strategy, “two international organizations—namely, the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) created and perpetuate[d] a system of measures to prohibit acts of financing, freeze terrorist funds, and track down terrorists.”¹²⁸ After 9/11, “substantial efforts [were] made to assure that countries [had] adopted and implemented laws consistent with these measures.”¹²⁹ Nonetheless, these programs receive scant attention relative to their importance and there continues\nlaundering “is typically a three-step process: (i) placement—the launderer puts criminally-derived money into a legitimate enterprise; (ii) layering—the launderer places the money in . . . pretextual transactions to obfuscate the original source; and (iii) integration—the launderer [changes] the funds into non-cash instruments” like bank notes and letters of credit to finance criminal activities.

For example, the Money Laundering Control Act makes it a crime to knowingly “conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or... to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law.”¹⁵¹ Further, many “federal agencies investigate cases of suspected money laundering and terrorist financing, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”¹⁵² ## IV.

It was part of the Kremlin’s ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia’s involvement in the ongoing conflict. This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber-attack that will be met with international consequences.²⁷⁰ The media covering NotPetya asserted the U.S. was finally taking a stand against Russian cyber aggression; a typical headline from CNN read “White House Blasts Russia for NotPetya Cyberattack.”²⁷¹ Speaking of Russia’s involvement, Tonya Ugoretz, director of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Russian “aggression is widespread. It’s against multiple sectors. It’s against multiple types of networks.... It wasn’t just aimed at the government.

When Iran then revived its efforts to enrich uranium, President Clinton... imposed a full trade and investment embargo, barring all U.S. trade with Iran. Congress went a step further and passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (now known as the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA) which... imposed U.S. trade penalties on foreign companies determined to have invested more than $20 million in Iranian petroleum development...\nHowever, the Clinton and then Bush administrations preferred to use diplomatic pressure to convince foreign companies to leave the Iranian market rather than impose sanctions using the ISA authorities...\nBy 2006, Iran's progress toward a nuclear weapon reached a crisis point [and] the global community responded from 2006 to 2010 with new United Nations (UN) sanctions... in a series of UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). Critically, UNSCR 1929 in 2010 recognized a\"potential connection between Iran's revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities.\"302 Claiming international legitimacy from the UNSCR language, the United States revived the ISA secondary sanctions regime and expanded it with new legislation aimed at cutting off all foreign support to Iran's energy sector.303 In 2015, the Obama Administration, alongside the P5+1 Group — comprised of the U.S., United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany — agreed to a long-term deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program.304 Per the accord,\"Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.\"305 The agreement was termed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (\"JCPOA\") and [Vol. 25:2 was a signature foreign policy achievement for President Obama.³⁰⁶ At the time, the Republican-controlled Congress was skeptical about JCPOA because it perceived Iran as untrustworthy and was sympathetic to Israel’s security concerns over the deal.³⁰⁷ On May 8, 2018, the Trump Administration ended U.S. participation in JCPOA.³⁰⁸ President Trump declared JCPOA was “so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.”³⁰⁹ An analysis of Iran’s behavior post-Stuxnet through the end of the JCPOA is highly valuable because it offers a blueprint for how cyber defenders can and should view the world.³¹⁰ From this analysis, it is clear that reliable predictive analysis that informs defensive postures and protocols is the single most valuable commodity for cyber defenders and ultimately sovereign nations: Starting in 2009, Iran’s uranium centrifuges began failing, and nobody understood why. Nearly one thousand of Iran’s six thousand centrifuges were destroyed over the course of a year. In the summer of 2010, a computer security firm in Belarus was hired to troubleshoot Iranian computers that mysteriously kept crashing—and in this investigation, the firm stumbled upon a series of files that would later become known as the Stuxnet virus. The Stuxnet virus was recognized as the “world’s first digital weapon.” It was a complex malware designed to infiltrate secure Iranian nuclear facilities, infect the industrial controllers that operated the nuclear centrifuges, and destroy those centrifuges by manipulating the pressure levels and rotor speeds inside them... [d]espite the significant attempt to cover its origins, experts concluded that Stuxnet was a joint United States and Israeli production.³¹¹ On the eleventh anniversary of 9/11, an Iranian group calling itself the “Cyber Fighters of IZZ ad-Din al-Qassam” claimed credit for a series of targeted operations against specific U.S. financial institutions.³¹² The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the New York financial sector were conducted ³⁰⁶ David E.

There used to be a lot of silos out there, where compliance, risk management, network security, [were] separate parts, but today’s cybersecurity environment means all those departments need to be interconnected in a new way.³⁵⁷ Technology is certainly part of the solution, but greater and better communication amongst BSA/AML/CFT and cybersecurity professionals within the government and private sector offers a long-term path to success. The past few years have seen progress toward this concept; for instance, on October 25, 2016, FinCEN issued a cyber threats advisory wherein it explained the proliferation of cyber events is a significant threat to the U.S. financial system.³⁵⁸ Accordingly, FinCEN prompted financial institutions to use the well-known SAR reporting mechanism to report anomalous cyber events (“cyber SARs”).³⁵⁹ The rationale behind the cyber SAR is that information sharing between the government and private sector can help “guard against and report money laundering, terrorism financing, and cyber-enabled crime.”³⁶⁰ Traditionally, the cyber domain was foreign to BSA/AML teams in the private sector, and most departments lacked expertise and cross-training in the disciplines, but the FinCEN cyber SAR may help upend the longstanding but unhelpful paradigm.³⁶¹ Recall the 176 days Iranian hackers targeted U.S. companies.³⁶² Critically, “[t]he NSA knew in advance [about Iran’s] intent to penetrate the [financial ³⁵⁶ Harry Dixon, *Maintaining Individual Liability in AML and Cybersecurity at New York’s Financial Institutions*, 5 PENN ST.

CONCLUSION\nThe U.S. stands at a crossroads. Will it forge a new world on its terms or succumb to a thousand cuts perpetrated by malicious actors across the globe? The current domestic and international AML and CFT regimes are insufficient. As America learned to its sorrow, devastating terrorist attacks can be inexpensive to action and terrorists are not easily targeted in this new world. The NYDFS Regulations offer hope by binding together American foreign policy and financial sector protections.

The avarice of China, the misdirection promulgated by Russia, and the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran will not soon disappear. Education is certainly part of the answer; predictive analysis of threats is possible with sufficient knowledge of global events. In the mid-twentieth century, a famous maxim for a world at war was “loose lips sink ships” but in modern times a more appropriate slogan might be “communicate to protect.” Until America learns to communicate across federal and state governments, across CI sectors and disciplines, it leaves itself vulnerable to continued attack.\nAs befits a new battlefield, the U.S. is bringing novel arms to bear. Financial institutions are in certain meaningful ways extensions of federal policies and agencies. Yet more needs to be done; an appreciation for the world as it is, a kind of twenty-first century realpolitik, is necessary to close the delta between existing regulation and what must be done to protect America in years to come."

Transnational terrorism, struck down in certain areas, but emboldened by twenty years of muddled U.S. and Allied counterterrorism policy, threatens again to break out of its Middle Eastern base.⁵ China is stealing U.S. trade secrets at a rate beyond alarming and forcing American companies to work inside China or forfeit profitable trade deals.⁶ Russia, a shadow of what it once was during the height of the Soviet Union,⁷ now seeks to project strength through information warfare against the West.⁸ North Korea too has learned how to fight in the cyber domain — its hackers rob banks worldwide and hold companies hostage through advanced cyber operations.⁹ As sanctions continue to strangle Iran’s economy, its cyber forces strike repeatedly at U.S. financial institutions in the hope of securing political and economic concessions.¹⁰ To triumph in this complex and increasingly cyber-reliant world, the U.S. must accomplish four goals: (1) stop terrorist financing; (2) attribute and punish state and non-state malicious actors; (3) protect the private sector; and (4) realize a systematic, predictive method for cyber defense.\n³ Sean D.

Changing Norms Rules in warfare date to ancient Greece.¹¹ Almost two thousand years later, during the rise of the early modern world a “series of treaties that formed the Peace of Westphalia [and] ended the Thirty Years War... created a system of legally equal [sovereignties]” and marked the beginning of international law as applied to state-on-state conflict.¹² A leap forward in what is now termed the Law of Armed Conflict¹³ (“LOAC”) occurred in 1863.¹⁴ In the midst of the American Civil War, President Lincoln’s Administration empowered Francis Lieber to write General Order No. 100, Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field which provided “basic rules [regarding lawful and unlawful] combat, including [discussions] relating to the treatment of civilians” during hostilities.¹⁵ General Order No. 100 became the template for all subsequent LOAC codes.¹⁶ Most significantly, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which are comprised of four treaties, were adopted after World War II to mandate humane treatment of persons in wartime.¹⁷ The Geneva Conventions established rules that now appear straightforward when juxtaposed ¹¹ Rosa Ehrenreich Brooks, *War Everywhere: Rights, National Security Law, and the Law of Armed Conflict in the Age of Terror*, 153 U.

Targeting Evolved During the twentieth century, when the model of state-on-state conflict prevailed, the LOAC targeting analysis for standard rules of engagement was more straightforward because determinations often involved status-based as opposed to conduct-based targets.⁴⁴ Status-based targets are lawful combatants who, per Geneva Convention III requirements, act “[u]nder responsible command; [w]ear a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; [c]arry arms openly; and [a]bide by the laws of war.”⁴⁵ In contrast, conduct-based targets consistently violate LOAC standards by, for example, attacking uniformed lawful combatants while wearing civilian clothes in order to blend and hide themselves within civilian populations.⁴⁶ Ahmad Fadhil Nazzal al-Khalaylah, who later renamed himself Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was a notorious practitioner of perfidy and treachery in Iraq and routinely violated the rules of LOAC.⁴⁷ Al-Zarqawi and his followers were difficult to target in Iraq because they did not wear uniforms⁴⁸ and choose to commit on-camera beheadings in safe houses and bombing civilians over direct combat with U.S.-led coalition forces.⁴⁹ On June 8, 2006, a U.S. precision airstrike targeting “a single dwelling in a wooded area ⁴³ Id.

Might persons loosely affiliated with ISIS goals living in Manila, learning bomb-making tradecraft online, and counseling like-minded associates qualify as conduct-based targets?53 To make the analogy even more attenuated, how about Manila ISIS sympathizers who are effective online ideologues and later credited as sources of inspiration by lone-wolf actors who targeted civilians?\n\n---\n\n## ## VI. CONCLUSION\n\nThe U.S. stands at a crossroads. Will it forge a new world on its terms or succumb to a thousand cuts perpetrated by malicious actors across the globe? The current domestic and international AML and CFT regimes are insufficient. As America learned to its sorrow, devastating terrorist attacks can be inexpensive to action and terrorists are not easily targeted in this new world. The NYDFS Regulations offer hope by binding together American foreign policy and financial sector protections.

The avarice of China, the misdirection promulgated by Russia, and the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran will not soon disappear. Education is certainly part of the answer; predictive analysis of threats is possible with sufficient knowledge of global events. In the mid-twentieth century, a famous maxim for a world at war was “loose lips sink ships” but in modern times a more appropriate slogan might be “communicate to protect.” Until America learns to communicate across federal and state governments, across CI sectors and disciplines, it leaves itself vulnerable to continued attack.\nAs befits a new battlefield, the U.S. is bringing novel arms to bear. Financial institutions are in certain meaningful ways extensions of federal policies and agencies. Yet more needs to be done; an appreciation for the world as it is, a kind of twenty-first century realpolitik, is necessary to close the delta between existing regulation and what must be done to protect America in years to come.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nState-on-state conflict governed by generally clear rules of engagement was the predominant mode of warfare in the mid-twentieth century.³ Now, almost two decades into the post-9/11 world, state and non-state actors, transnational terrorists, and cyber operators thrive in twilight zones of domestic and international law.⁴ The past few years carry signs of troubles to come. Transnational terrorism, struck down in certain areas, but emboldened by twenty years of muddled U.S. and Allied counterterrorism policy, threatens again to break out of its Middle Eastern base.⁵ China is stealing U.S. trade secrets at a rate beyond alarming and forcing American companies to work inside China or forfeit profitable trade deals.⁶ Russia, a shadow of what it once was during the height of the Soviet Union,⁷ now seeks to project strength through information warfare against the West.⁸ North Korea too has learned how to fight in the cyber domain — its hackers rob banks worldwide and hold companies hostage through advanced cyber operations.⁹ As sanctions continue to strangle Iran’s economy, its cyber forces strike repeatedly at U.S. financial institutions in the hope of securing political and economic concessions.¹⁰ To triumph in this complex and increasingly cyber-reliant world, the U.S. must accomplish four goals: (1) stop terrorist financing; (2) attribute and punish state and non-state malicious actors; (3) protect the private sector; and (4) realize a systematic, predictive method for cyber defense.\n\n³ Sean D.

Changing Norms\n\nRules in warfare date to ancient Greece.¹¹ Almost two thousand years later, during the rise of the early modern world a “series of treaties that formed the Peace of Westphalia [and] ended the Thirty Years War . . . created a system of legally equal [sovereignties]” and marked the beginning of international law as applied to state-on-state conflict.¹² A leap forward in what is now termed the Law of Armed Conflict¹³ (“LOAC”) occurred in 1863.¹⁴ In the midst of the American Civil War, President Lincoln’s Administration empowered Francis Lieber to write General Order No. 100, Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field which provided “basic rules [regarding lawful and unlawful] combat, including [discussions] relating to the treatment of civilians” during hostilities.¹⁵ General Order No. 100 became the template for all subsequent LOAC codes.¹⁶ Most significantly, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which are comprised of four treaties, were adopted after World War II to mandate humane treatment of persons in wartime.¹⁷ The Geneva Conventions established rules that now appear straightforward when juxtaposed\n\n¹¹ Rosa Ehrenreich Brooks, *War Everywhere: Rights, National Security Law, and the Law of Armed Conflict in the Age of Terror*, 153 U.

Nearly one thousand of Iran’s six thousand centrifuges were destroyed over the course of a year. In the summer of 2010, a computer security firm in Belarus was hired to troubleshoot Iranian computers that mysteriously kept crashing—and in this investigation, the firm stumbled upon a series of files that would later become known as the Stuxnet virus. The Stuxnet virus was recognized as the “world’s first digital weapon.” It was a complex malware designed to infiltrate secure Iranian nuclear facilities, infect the industrial controllers that operated the nuclear centrifuges, and destroy those centrifuges by manipulating the pressure levels and rotor speeds inside them . . .

L.\n[Vol. 25:2]\n\nA fundamental tenet of modern financial institutions is “AML is a significant component of cybersecurity, such that AML measures cannot be effective without cybersecurity,” and cybersecurity at financial institutions cannot be accomplished without robust AML policies and procedures.³⁵⁶ According to one compliance expert:\n\nCybersecurity is intersecting in a new way with BSA/AML compliance, and it’s becoming increasingly important that BSA/AML officers are aware of the kinds of cyberthreats out there. . . . There used to be a lot of silos out there, where compliance, risk management, network security, [were] separate parts, but today’s cybersecurity environment means all those departments need to be interconnected in a new way.³⁵⁷\n\nTechnology is certainly part of the solution, but greater and better communication amongst BSA/AML/CFT and cybersecurity professionals within the government and private sector offers a long-term path to success. The past few years have seen progress toward this concept; for instance, on October 25, 2016, FinCEN issued a cyber threats advisory wherein it explained the proliferation of cyber events is a significant threat to the U.S. financial system.³⁵⁸ Accordingly, FinCEN prompted financial institutions to use the well-known SAR reporting mechanism to report anomalous cyber events (“cyber SARs”).³⁵⁹ The rationale behind the cyber SAR is that information sharing between the government and private sector can help “guard against and report money laundering, terrorism financing, and cyber-enabled crime.”³⁶⁰ Traditionally, the cyber domain was foreign to BSA/AML teams in the private sector, and most departments lacked expertise and cross-training in the disciplines, but the FinCEN cyber SAR may help upend the longstanding but unhelpful paradigm.³⁶¹\n\nRecall the 176 days Iranian hackers targeted U.S. companies.³⁶² Critically, “[t]he NSA knew in advance [about Iran’s] intent to penetrate the [financial\n\n³⁵⁶ Harry Dixon, *Maintaining Individual Liability in AML and Cybersecurity at New York’s Financial Institutions*, 5 PENN ST.

CONCLUSION\n\nThe U.S. stands at a crossroads. Will it forge a new world on its terms or succumb to a thousand cuts perpetrated by malicious actors across the globe? The current domestic and international AML and CFT regimes are insufficient. As America learned to its sorrow, devastating terrorist attacks can be inexpensive to action and terrorists are not easily targeted in this new world.

The avarice of China, the misdirection promulgated by Russia, and the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran will not soon disappear. Education is certainly part of the answer; predictive analysis of threats is possible with sufficient knowledge of global events. In the mid-twentieth century, a famous maxim for a world at war was “loose lips sink ships” but in modern times a more appropriate slogan might be “communicate to protect.” Until America learns to communicate across federal and state governments, across CI sectors and disciplines, it leaves itself vulnerable to continued attack.\n\nAs befits a new battlefield, the U.S. is bringing novel arms to bear.
