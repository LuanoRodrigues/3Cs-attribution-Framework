Cunningham\n\nIn the context of an increasingly competitive Sino-American relationship, US analysts are increasingly concerned about crisis instability, defined as the temptation for either country to use force rather than continue to bargain diplomatically during a crisis. Scholars and analysts focused on the US-China relationship have warned that cyber capabilities could add incentives for either the United States or China to use force in a crisis. Despite these concerns, there is no consensus among cyber scholars that offensive cyber capabilities contribute to the risk of great-power political crises escalating into conflicts.\n\nAs the previous chapter by Jason Healey and Robert Jervis has shown, certain features of cyber capabilities could create new pathways through which a great-power crisis could escalate into a conventional conflict.\n\nThis chapter examines one of these novel escalation pathways in the context of the Sino-American relationship: the difficulty of distinguishing between hacking for espionage and operational preparation of the environment (OPE), an essential precursor to most high-end cyber attacks. This OPE-espionage distinction problem creates pathways for inadvertent escalation, which occurs \"when a combatant deliberately takes actions that it does not perceive to be escalatory but are interpreted that way by the enemy,\" during a crisis or conflict. A state could correctly detect an adversary's OPE and, fearing an imminent cyber attack with severe consequences, choose to use force first, escalating the conflict with a cyber or even kinetic attack. But a state could also misperceive an adversary's efforts to collect intelligence via cyber means as OPE and pre-empt that attack with conventional or cyber attacks of its own. A state discovering that its adversary has intruded into its nuclear command, control, and communications networks during a crisis presents a particularly concerning scenario.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

            "markdown": "Despite these concerns, academic studies based on observational data, surveys, and simulations find little correlation between cyber attacks and escalation, either in peacetime or during conflicts.6 Scholars have reasoned that most cyber attacks are simply not destructive enough to worsen crisis or conflict outcomes.7 These limited effects, coupled with the bloodless, secret nature of cyber attacks, might instead open up new pathways for de-escalation and enhance crisis stability.8 However, the external validity of existing empirical findings to military crises among great powers is limited because no such crisis has occurred in the past two decades and they are difficult to replicate in surveys, simulations, and wargames.9\n\nTo evaluate the diverging concerns of the US policy community and the ongoing scholarly debates on cyber escalation and crisis instability among great powers, this chapter examines the escalation risks created by OPE in a future crisis scenario involving the United States and China. Scholars have already identified several sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship, including a systematic lack of attention among Chinese experts to inadvertent escalation risks in the nuclear, conventional, and space domains.10 A Sino-American crisis scenario is a most likely case for theoretical claims that cyber capabilities create novel escalation risks. Both countries would be most likely to react to any independent effect of cyber technology on their incentives to use force, if such incentives exist, in a crisis. Indeed, scholars have already raised concerns that cyber capabilities could fuel Sino-American crisis instability, although they have not examined the OPE-espionage distinction problem in much detail.11 To assess the escalation risks posed by this problem, we follow the methodological approach of scholars who have examined other sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship. Specifically, we examine the two countries' leadership statements, threat perceptions, procedures for authorizing cyber operations, organizational structures, capabilities, and policies for evidence that they create, recognize, and seek to manage escalatory risks.\n\nOur analysis suggests that inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE would be present in a future Sino-American crisis scenario. Official US policy for offensive cyber operations recognizes the escalation risks associated with cyber espionage being mistaken for OPE, but recent changes to US cyber strategy may increase these risks. Meanwhile, Chinese writings recognize the difficulty of distinguishing between cyber attacks and OPE but appear to ignore the consequences for crisis instability. We also find that a lack of mutual understanding in the Sino-American cyber relationship adds to the likelihood of the two countries misperceiving each other's behavior.\n\nOur empirical findings have two key limitations. First, our sources are scarce, imperfect, and some years old, especially on the Chinese side. We",

Nevertheless, these sources still make a valuable contribution to existing policy debates and scholarly research about cyber conflict, which rarely draws on Chinese perspectives. Second, our empirical findings could support the claim that cyber technology either does – or does not – add to crisis instability. Leaders from both countries might choose to ignore the escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem even if they are present. But neither country's relaxed approach to these risks is justified by a careful assessment of the independent effect of cyber technology on an adversary's incentives to use force in a crisis, which makes us hesitant to dismiss them.\n\nThis chapter begins with a brief explanation of OPE as a distinctive feature of cyber attacks. The second section outlines the competing hypotheses about cyber escalation in existing scholarly literature and the mechanisms that could link detection of an intrusion in a crisis with the decision to use force. The third, fourth, and fifth sections examine the evidence for these hypotheses in US documents and statements, Chinese writings and organizational practices, and the bilateral cyber relationship, respectively. The sixth section evaluates the escalation risks.\n\n## Operational Preparation of the Environment\n\nPerforming OPE is essential to enabling significant cyber operations that could have strategic effects on the target.[12] To develop a cyber capability with a potent or customized effect on a target network, substantial reconnaissance and preparation are required from within that targeted network. In 2010, the Department of Defense defined \"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment\" as:\n\nNon-intelligence enabling functions within cyberspace conducted to plan and prepare for potential follow-up military operations. [Cyber-OPE] includes but is not limited to identifying data, system/network configurations, or physical structures . . . for the purpose of determining system vulnerabilities; and actions taken to assure future access and/or control of the system, network, or data during anticipated hostilities.[13]\n\nWhile cyber OPE has analogues in other forms of military operations – especially in the world of special operations and covert action – it differs from operations that are more familiar to policymakers, such as conventional and nuclear operations. Preparations to use cyber capabilities have different recon\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Moreover, the accesses and payloads that make offensive cyber operations possible are often specific to a particular network.¹⁵\n\nGaining and maintaining access to a target network is also generally difficult, resource intensive, and specific to the target network.¹⁶ Overall, the effects of an attack, the ability to sustain those effects over time, and the ability of an attack to limit unintended consequences all depend on how well the attacker has prepared and understood the target network and the likely actions of the network's defenders once the attack commences.¹⁷\n\nA few examples illustrate the importance of OPE to sophisticated offensive cyber operations. Stuxnet was enabled by months if not years of reconnaissance, while Iranian hackers spent months inside the computer networks of Sands Casino and Saudi Aramco before they attacked in 2012.¹⁸ North Korean hackers did the same with their attacks on the computer networks of Sony Pictures.¹⁹ Russian hackers prepared in a similar way for their NotPetya operation, which reportedly inflicted over $10 billion in damage.²⁰ Some attacks, most notably denial-of-service efforts, do not fit into this trend, but lack potency as a result.²¹\n\nOPE is also difficult to distinguish from espionage once it is discovered by a target. In theory, there might be ways for a target to tell whether an intrusion is espionage or whether it facilitates an attack. But there are no foolproof solutions to this OPE-espionage distinction problem. For example, an uptick in communication between the attacker and malicious code implanted in the target system could signal its purpose, but an attack could occur without any of those signals. Those signals could also accompany routine intelligence collection.²² Even if an attacker tries to use those signals to distinguish OPE from espionage, the target may not receive those signals or treat them as credible.²³ The nature of the target network may provide some hints – for example, critical infrastructure industrial control systems are more likely to be exploited for OPE than intelligence gathering – but this is not always the case.²⁴ Moreover, the exploitation of an adversary's networks for intelligence gathering could be repurposed for OPE without any tell-tale signs that the target might detect. For example, there is some evidence to suggest that the first blackout in Ukraine began with an espionage objective but later morphed into an attack operation.²⁵\n\n## The Novel Escalation Risks of OPE\n\nHow and why could an intrusion discovered in the midst of a crisis between two great powers create incentives for the use of force?

Answers to these questions are key to understanding the potential for cyber operations to contribute to crisis instability -- or stability.\n\nWe define a crisis as “a confrontation between two states involving a serious threat to vital national interests for both sides in which there is the expectation of a short time for resolution, and in which there is understood to be a sharply increased risk of war.” We define escalation as “an increase in the intensity or scope of conflict that crosses threshold(s) considered significant by one or more of the participants.” In a great-power crisis, escalation would involve the use of force, with either cyber or kinetic attacks. We use the term “cyber escalation risks” to refer to an increased temptation to use force in a crisis due to the nature of cyber technology.\n\nIf decision-makers discover an intrusion into their key military or civilian networks during a crisis, most scholars agree that those decision-makers could not rule out the possibility that the intrusion enables OPE. The decision-makers' response to that discovery will depend on how they assess the seriousness of the threat posed by the intrusion and whether the state also has strategic or political incentives to use force. The interaction of these two factors suggests four possibilities: the inadvertent escalation and deliberate escalation hypotheses that expect the use of force, and the bluster and countervailing hypotheses that do not expect the use of force. We focus on the logic underpinning the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it best represents the concerns in current US policy debates about the destabilizing effect of cyber technology in a future Sino-American crisis.\n\n### Intrusion Detection in a Crisis\n\nThe scenario in which OPE could trigger the use of force in a crisis would likely begin months if not years before the crisis. An adversary that wants the option to carry out offensive cyber operations in a future conflict against a state's important military or civilian networks would conduct OPE during peacetime. Once a crisis has begun it is almost certainly too late to complete this complex, time-consuming task.\n\nOnce a political crisis began -- for example, over an accidental collision between two rivals' military aircraft, the scenario that triggered the last Sino-American crisis in 2001 -- decision-makers in both states would have to decide whether to back down, bargain diplomatically, or bargain with the use of force. During their deliberations, the target state's decision-makers might discover their adversary's intrusions into important computer networks, including those that might be OPE. Such discoveries are more likely in a crisis",

Motivations for the intrusion include OPE, monitoring the target’s military operations, or gathering intelligence about its offensive cyber operations.³¹ The specifics of the intrusion may provide some hints of intent but are unlikely to be definitive.³² Testing of small-scale attacks or an uptick in communication between the intruder and code it has implanted in the target system could also signal that it is OPE.³³ The intruder would also have difficulty reassuring the target state of its intent if the intrusion is for intelligence purposes.³⁴ To preserve its operational security, the intruder would have incentives not to acknowledge which adversary networks it has exploited and for what purpose, lest the target use that information to remove the intruder.³⁵ Even if the intruder sought to reassure the target of its intent not to use the intrusion to enable an attack, it would have trouble credibly committing not to use the intrusion for OPE in the future.\n\n## The Inadvertent Escalation Pathway\n\nThe claim that cyber operations create incentives to use force in a crisis is a specific instance of a general claim that military operations and technology can cause misperceptions among adversaries with serious consequences for crisis stability and intra-war escalation.³⁶ One potential consequence of those misperceptions is inadvertent escalation. The canonical scenario of inadvertent escalation is a conventional war among nuclear powers in which one party conducts “large-scale conventional operations that produce patterns of damage or threat to the major elements of a state’s nuclear force.”³⁷ The target state interprets the attack as a deliberate attempt to degrade its nuclear force and responds by using nuclear weapons or accelerating preparations for their use.³⁸ Similarly, escalation to the use of cyber or kinetic force could occur in a crisis as an unintended consequence of the normal conduct of cyber espionage.\n\nMisperceptions commonly associated with the security dilemma are one reason that inadvertent escalation could occur.³⁹ Specifically, the difficulty of distinguishing between an adversary’s offensive and defensive military operations is sufficient to produce misperceptions about the intent of the attacking state within the target state.⁴⁰ The attacking state’s conventional military\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

There are four mechanisms by which a state could make a worst-case-scenario assessment of the seriousness of the threat posed by an intrusion and decide to use force, whether a cyber or kinetic attack. First, a state that detects an adversary’s OPE might use force to pre-empt a cyber attack that could put the state at a military disadvantage in a future conflict.⁴⁴ Second, the combination of the crisis environment and the OPE-espionage distinction problem could lead the state to attribute aggressive intentions to the adversary with regards to both the network intrusion and the overall crisis, incentivizing the use of force.⁴⁵ Third, the discovery of an intrusion that might be OPE could affect decision-makers’ emotions in ways that make the use of force more likely.⁴⁶ Fourth, the uneven distribution of information about the nature of cyber operations in national security bureaucracies might make the use of force more likely when those bureaucracies discover intrusions in a crisis. Intrusions that some cyber specialists see as a routine part of cyber operations may alarm more senior generalists, especially in a crisis. Top decision-makers may not have sufficient knowledge or information to assess the risks posed by a cyber intrusion to their military capabilities.⁴⁷\n\n## The Deliberate Escalation Pathway\n\nStates might assess that a cyber intrusion poses a serious but tolerable threat yet choose to use force in response because they have strategic and political incentives to escalate. Those strategic and political incentives usually involve gaining a military advantage, signaling resolve, or pre-empting an adversary’s attempt to signal resolve by using force.⁴⁸ Scholars have questioned whether states make decisions to escalate because of the independent effects of technology alone. Based on historical case studies, Caitlin Talmadge argues that new technologies might not force decision-makers to take escalatory actions, but rather “seem likely to be an intervening variable.” States seek out new technologies to enable them to increase the risk of escalation, or turn to them opportunistically in a conflict, rather than their hands being forced to escalate in a crisis because they did not anticipate the escalatory pressures created\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

This “bluster” hypothesis suggests that cyber technology does not contribute to crisis instability and might even help to stabilize crises. It draws on existing empirical research which indicates that cyber attacks are perceived to be more bluster than bite. States and individuals tend not to retaliate in response to cyber attacks.⁵¹ One explanation for this empirical finding is that decision-makers do not view cyber attacks as sufficiently damaging or destructive to warrant the use of force in response.⁵² Applying these arguments to a crisis scenario in which an intrusion is discovered, decision-makers might calculate that the cost of the cyber attack is likely to be low and can be absorbed. This explanation suggests that states would not anticipate a military disadvantage from a cyber attack, contrary to the military disadvantage mechanism outlined above.\n\nDecision-makers might even view cyber attacks as a signal that an adversary wants to avoid a conventional conflict. When the effects of cyber and kinetic attacks are held constant, Jacquelyn Schneider and Sarah Kreps found that US survey respondents were less likely to support retaliation for cyber attacks than kinetic attacks.⁵³ Decision-makers might therefore interpret the discovery of an intrusion as a signal of an adversary’s intent to avoid crossing the threshold of conventional armed conflict,⁵⁴ rather than its hostile intent, contrary to the misperception mechanism outlined above.\n\n## The Countervailing De-escalation Hypothesis\n\nFinally, decision-makers might view the intrusion as posing a serious threat but have countervailing political or strategic incentives not to respond with the use of force. Decision-makers could react to an intrusion in this de-escalatory manner if they want to defuse the crisis because, for example, the stakes of the crisis do not merit fighting a war, or if they lacked the conventional military power to achieve their political objectives if a conflict broke out. Decision-makers with multiple adversaries might also be wary of mis-attributing an intrusion carried out by one adversary to another if they cannot attribute the intrusion to its perpetrator with sufficient confidence in the time frame of the\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

The ambiguity of intent behind cyber intrusions could help more moderate decision-makers build a coalition for restraint in the crisis and counter pressure from decision-makers with more hawkish preferences.⁵⁶\n\n## Evaluating Cyber Escalation Hypotheses\n\nHow might scholars determine which of these four hypotheses is most likely in a great-power crisis, when no crisis has occurred since China and the United States were both armed with military cyber capabilities? There is no perfect solution to this problem. To complement existing empirical studies, most of which capture US popular or elite views of cyber escalation, our approach focuses on capturing both US and Chinese elite views by examining their approach to cyber OPE, escalation, and military operations.\n\nOur empirical analysis is guided by observable implications derived from the four hypotheses. The inadvertent escalation hypothesis would expect states to express concern about any intrusions into their networks and to recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. States might also recognize inadvertent escalation risks and take steps to manage cyber escalation risks in their procedures, authorities, and organizational structures for cyber operations. Inadvertent escalation is also more likely to occur when two states have a poor understanding of each other's cyber activities and lack crisis communications mechanisms to verify the nature of an intrusion. The bluster de-escalation hypothesis would expect states that possess good attribution capabilities, defend their networks against intrusions, and effectively repel intruders who do breach defenses to be more relaxed about discovering intrusions into their networks. Not only might they be less likely to experience worrying intrusions, but they might also be able to better assess the intent and the severity of the threat posed by an intrusion.\n\nWhile it is difficult to describe the strategic and political incentives that could provide evidence to support the deliberate escalation or countervailing hypotheses in a future crisis, some ex ante features of a great-power relationship would shape those incentives. Deliberate escalation is more likely to occur when the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally stronger than its adversary, does not confront multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has high political stakes in the crisis. The countervailing hypothesis is more likely to find support if the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally weaker than its adversary, faces multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has low political stakes in the crisis. A scenario in which the conventional military balance is roughly equal and both states see the conflict as high stakes\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

A US-China crisis scenario is more evenly matched than most cyber dyads, although it would still involve some asymmetries in stakes and the conventional military balance that could obfuscate the independent effect of cyber technology on the temptation to use force in a crisis.^[57]^\n\n## Escalation Risks in US Cyber Operations\n\nUS decision-makers recognize the inadvertent escalation risks posed by cyber operations, and OPE in particular, but they have taken steps to mitigate those risks. The Obama administration implemented organizational practices that carefully managed cyber operations that could produce escalation. The Trump administration relaxed those organizational practices after gaining confidence in operational practices. These practices provide evidence in favor of either the inadvertent escalation hypothesis or the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. As part of its more muscular approach, US Cyber Command has also concluded that most cyber intrusions could not produce serious enough effects to result in escalation. At first glance this judgment supports the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. But it could also support the countervailing de-escalation hypothesis. US adversaries might view its intrusions as very threatening but face disincentives to use force because of US conventional military preponderance.\n\n## Leadership Views of OPE\n\nThe public statements of leaders and government reactions to discoveries of intrusions into military networks indicate that the United States views intrusions as threatening, in part because they could be used either for OPE or intelligence gathering. After a Russian hack of Pentagon systems in 2015 that the United States was able to repel, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter summarized the American position aptly when he said, \"[It] can't be good for anybody to be inside of our networks - whatever their motivation.\"^[58]^ Similarly, Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency (NSA) and US Cyber Command, and his adviser Michael Sulmeyer explained that the United States turned to a more aggressive policy \"to prevent toeholds from turning into beachheads so that a single compromise will not threaten the military's ability to accomplish its mission.\"^[59]^\n\nWhile the details of most US responses to foreign hacking efforts are not public, two historical cases demonstrate that policymakers worried about the\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

In a 1998 hack known as Solar Sunrise, intruders penetrated the US military's logistics and communications networks. The Joint Staff general in charge of information operations, John Campbell, worried that the breach would permit significant attacks, especially at a time of heightened tensions with Iraq. \"If you take one part of that machine, and disable it,\" he said, \"you've got a real problem trying to make a deployment take place.\"60 Campbell's comments reflect an assessment that the intrusion could have placed the United States at a military disadvantage in a conflict. The discovery did not take place during a major crisis and therefore lacked the time pressure element that would create incentives to use force. Nevertheless, an investigation concluded the breach was the work of three teenagers and their 20-year-old mentor after various parts of the US government had already spun up to prepare for a response.\n\nA second incident, Moonlight Maze, occurred in 1998 and 1999 and involved Russian penetration of unclassified American networks. The US government hacked back into Russian computers to gain more intelligence.[61] One of the White House's top national security officials, Richard Clarke, labeled the activities \"cyberwar reconnaissance.\"[62] Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre indicated that the United States was \"in the middle of a cyber war\" to the Intelligence Committees of Congress during a classified briefing.[63]\n\n## OPE in Cyber Operations\n\nUS operators and decision-makers have recognized the need for OPE to conduct sophisticated cyber operations since at least 2010. The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a memo in 2010 mandating the use of the term \"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment,\" which referred to those cyber operations that serve \"as an enabling function for another military operation.\"[64] From the earliest days of the US Cyber Command, secret documents – now declassified – indicated that conducting OPE was one of its core tasks.[65]\n\nPlanners at the highest levels of the US government eventually recognized the importance of OPE. During the Obama administration, the most significant high-level document governing America's offensive cyber capability was Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20). The president signed the classified document in secret in the fall of 2012. The White House released a fact sheet that made no mention of offensive cyber capabilities,[66] but the full classified document, leaked in 2013 by Edward Snowden, reveals a strategy that directly considers offensive action and contrasts it with other forms of cyber operations. The strategy lays out a clear typology of cyber activity. This includes \"cyber\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

It also includes “non-intrusive defensive countermeasures,” meaning steps taken within one’s own network, such as deploying antivirus and other basic security measures. The document also introduces the concept of “Defensive Cyber Effects Operations,” defined as efforts that have an effect on an adversary’s computer systems – presumably, hacking or other interference – but only for the purposes of defense. PPD-20 provides high-level procedures for managing this kind of aggressive defensive action.⁶⁷\n\nMost significantly, though, the classified version of PPD-20 defines offensive action in some detail. It introduces the concept of “Offensive Cyber Effects Operations” (OCEO), which are distinct from cyber collection, non-intrusive defensive countermeasures, or defensive cyber effects operations. Instead, these efforts are designed to cause effects in adversary networks.⁶⁸ The document extols the unique virtues of these kinds of offensive cyber operations, which “can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance U.S. national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging.”⁶⁹\n\nPPD-20 acknowledges the need for OPE to realize these offensive options. It indicates that “the development and sustainment of [offensive cyber] capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist.”⁷⁰ PPD-20 directs the US government to begin this operational preparation. The relevant agencies “shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, [and] establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities.”⁷¹ With his signature, President Barack Obama authorized the preparatory activity.\n\n## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risks\n\nPPD-20 reveals US policymakers’ cognisance of the risks that arise from actually using offensive cyber capabilities. As a result, the document highlights a process to carefully manage offensive actions that might do serious harm or invite escalation. It emphasizes inter-agency coordination, balancing defense and national security interests with diplomatic and economic ones. Most notably, the process requires the highest level of executive branch oversight – presidential approval – for any cyber operation that is “reasonably likely to result in significant consequences.”⁷² This term is broadly defined: “Loss of life, significant responsive actions against the United States, significant damage to property, serious adverse U.S. foreign policy consequences, or serious\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

In short, President Obama wanted direct oversight of any operation that might meet the threshold of significant consequences – regardless of whether that operation involved collecting intelligence, defending American computers, preparing an offensive capability, or launching an attack. The directive suggests that the Obama administration was concerned, at least in theory, about the risks of cyber escalation even as it appreciated the operational necessity to prepare offensive capabilities in advance.\n\nThe Trump administration adopted a more relaxed set of organizational procedures for managing cyber escalation risks. Upon unveiling its new national cyber strategy in 2018, the Trump White House criticized the preceding administration for what it saw as its overly cautious posture and promised to be more aggressive in its engagements with adversaries. Then-National Security Adviser John Bolton said, “Our hands are not tied as they were in the Obama administration.” Nor was the need for more aggressive action just a partisan view. In his confirmation hearing, the incoming NSA director and commander of US Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone warned that the United States had to do more because American adversaries “don’t fear us.”74\n\nThese views were translated into policy by President Donald Trump’s signature on “National Security Presidential Memorandum 13.” The goal of the memorandum, which remains classified, is to provide military commanders with greater flexibility to integrate cyber operations into their overall approach to warfighting and deterrence.75 By delegating this authority to the Pentagon, the Trump administration attempted to foster a faster and more aggressive process, one that would generate more operational effects more quickly. But this approach also rebalanced the trade-off between operational agility and whole-of-government coordination to manage cyber escalation risks in favor of the former. According to the general on the Joint Staff responsible for cyber operations, this change sharply contrasted with the Obama administration’s approach, which was “an interagency process that went through the National Security Council . . . to deputies’ committee to principals’ committee and [where], in effect, anyone could stop the process along the way.” Nor, he argued, was the distinction just semantics or bureaucratic minutia, but one that “makes all the difference in the world in terms of the speed at which you can move.”76\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

But there are hints that the memo and complementary legislative changes implemented by Congress provide a freer hand in developing the malicious code and gaining access to target networks required to provide commanders with offensive options. For example, in a media interview, the former deputy commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, indicated that changes to congressional legislation “freed us up to do some of the things, the operational preparation of the environment, that we were limited from doing outside of the counterterrorism mission and now can do much more broadly against all of our peers and competitors.” In addition, a New York Times story from June 2019 describes more aggressive American preparatory measures against the Russian power grid.\n\nOverall, the Trump administration was much less worried about the escalation risk associated with cyber operations than the Obama administration. The Biden administration appears to have largely continued this approach since taking office in 2021. Michael Daniel, the former coordinator for cyber security in the Obama White House, observed that the Trump administration was “willing to take more risks than previous administrations.” While the Trump administration's approach was untested in a crisis with a near‐peer competitor, it was informed by the US experience with cyber conflict over the past decade as well as the increasing risk tolerance of US decision‐makers. To justify its new posture, US Cyber Command has argued that “adversaries continuously operate against us below the threshold of armed conflict,” in what it described as a “new normal.” Moreover, the command argued that US efforts to counter this adversarial activity will not lead to retaliation in or outside of cyberspace that would cross that threshold.\n\nThese claims have been fiercely debated in the academic literature, with critics of the so‐called persistent engagement approach arguing that the new strategy could produce escalation. For example, some contend that the thresholds for armed conflict are not as clear as US Cyber Command has suggested. Others argue that persistent engagement creates too many red lines for adversaries and is therefore not a realistic means for shaping behavior. Nakasone and Sulmeyer responded to these concerns with reassurance that:“Cyber Command takes these concerns seriously, and reducing this risk is a critical part of the planning process. We are confident that this more proactive approach enables Cyber Command to conduct operations that impose costs while responsibly managing escalation.",

CUNNINGHAM\n\n# Capabilities for Managing Escalation Risks\n\nIn the past decade, the United States has developed some of the world's most sophisticated cyber capabilities to better defend its networks, attribute intrusions, and expel intruders in peacetime. To better defend networks, the United States has invested in major systems, such as EINSTEIN 3, that aim to thwart intrusions. To improve rapid attribution of intrusions and increase situational awareness, the United States established various cross-agency working groups and bulked up teams within the NSA and US Cyber Command. To the extent that these capabilities are effective, they might mitigate cyber escalation risks by reducing the likelihood that intruders will successfully break into US networks and alarm policymakers who have to decide on how to respond within the compressed time period of a crisis. However, the compromise of SolarWinds network management system in 2021, which enabled Russian government operators to intrude into numerous US government systems for months without detection, suggests that defense and attribution capabilities are imperfect and do not eliminate the possibility of the United States discovering an intrusion during a crisis.\n\n# Escalation Risks in Chinese Cyber Operations\n\nThere is little evidence to indicate that China has scrutinized the inadvertent escalation risks posed by OPE as carefully as the United States, although Chinese sources bearing on this question are older, scarcer, and less authoritative than those for the United States.83 This lack of attention could be evidence of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis, as it might reflect a judgment that cyber intrusions pose a manageable threat to China's leaders. But this lack of concern should be interpreted in the context of a relative lack of concern about inadvertent escalation risks posed by nuclear, space, and conventional military operations among Chinese experts. As such, we favor the interpretation of China's inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks as support for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis. Inattention to the inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE could help to realize such risks in a crisis for three reasons. First, China is more likely to misperceive US cyber intrusions. Second, it is more likely to overlook the ways that its own cyber intrusions could be misperceived. Third, China is much less likely to take steps to mitigate these risks. Available sources provide little insight into whether the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has put in place organizational or operational practices to manage inadvertent cyber escalation.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

In a major speech on national cyber security policy in 2016, Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping stated that, “Cyber security has a strong covert character; a technological vulnerability or security risk can stay hidden for a number of years without being discovered.” As a result, “we do not know who came in, whether it was an enemy or a friend, or what they did.” Xi implied that while this enemy or friend's intrusion could remain “latent” inside a network for a long time, it could be “activated whenever (yidan jiu fazuo le).”84\n\nThe Chinese government has not publicly acknowledged any specific incidents in which it discovered that foreign state actors had exploited its government or military networks. China's closest analogue to the Solar Sunrise and Moonlight Maze incidents was Edward Snowden's revelations regarding US government surveillance of Chinese computer networks. Snowden's revelations are often cited by the country's cyber security scholars as evidence of China's vulnerability and the inadequacy of its network defenses, which failed to prevent or detect US government intrusions. Chinese experts claim that the NSA also targeted the country's military networks.85 A Chinese cyber security firm reported that the CIA had spied on Chinese state‐owned enterprises but did not identify any government networks penetrated.86 There is no detailed evidence about how the Chinese government responded to any of these incidents, nor did they occur in the context of a major crisis.\n\nChinese writings examining US cyber operations can provide insights into how Chinese experts view these operations in the absence of open discussions about these topics in China. Chinese experts affiliated with the PLA note that OPE is one of the cyber missions outlined in US doctrinal publications but do not mention the crisis escalation risks that could result from the OPE‐espionage distinction problem.87 While the Trump administration's more muscular approach to cyber operations raised concerns among Chinese authors for its emphasis on pre‐emption and potential to spark arms race instability, those experts are less focused on crisis instability than US scholars.88 There are some recent exceptions. For example, former PLA officer Lyu Jinghua writes that“it is worthwhile to explore whether the tension in cyberspace can be de‐escalated or whether the chances of the breakout of crisis can be lowered if there could be a basic consensus among countries that cyber activities",

PLA texts do not use the term “operational preparation of the environment” when describing PLA operations, but they do recognize that effective offensive cyber operations require extensive advance preparation. A 2015 book authored by experts from the PLA Army Engineering University, 54th Institute, and other PLA organizations acknowledges that significant advance preparations are needed to ensure that cyber operations can be used to diminish an adversary's combat power. While many methods of attack are available, “a cyber attack capable of producing significant effects is a cyber attack for which ample preparations have already been made at an earlier time . . . it is not a decision that one makes as the situation requires.”\n\nPLA writings indicate that China places a similar degree of emphasis on OPE as the United States. The 2015 book characterizes OPE as more demanding than network exploitation for espionage:“It is necessary to carry out careful and meticulous reconnaissance and scanning of the target, in order to obtain even more detailed, specific information about it. As such, we must carry out deeper reconnaissance and scanning of the target, [and] the extent of secrecy and concealment [of those tasks] far exceeds the extent of carrying out [those] tasks for computer network exploitation.”\n\nBut reconnaissance and scanning are only the first steps in preparations for an attack. The authors emphasize the importance of obfuscation throughout the various procedures required to prepare for offensive cyber operations: selecting and employing a method of gaining access to the target network, moving laterally through it, gaining privileges, and maintaining access. An intrusion can serve multiple purposes: “attack actions occur after the intrusion of computer networks, escalating privileges and exfiltrating all required data.”",

An article outlining principles of cyber deterrence authored by an unnamed Academy of Military Science expert in 2016 indicated that successful cyber deterrence, which included carrying out coercive and retaliatory attacks, required “complete and meticulous preparation in peacetime.” Those preparations included “long-term, sustained network reconnaissance” to become familiar with an adversary’s network situation, map the structure of its networks, and discover hardware and software vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be used to leave backdoors, set up “springboards,” and install logic bombs and Trojan horses “to retain points of penetration to launch future cyber attacks.”95\n\nPLA texts recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. The 2013 Science of Military Strategy published by the Academy of Military Science acknowledges that, “from a technological perspective, the principles of the task (gongzuo yuanli) of cyber surveillance and cyber attacks are essentially identical.” The book explains: “cyber surveillance means and methods are often also the means and methods of cyber attacks.” Furthermore, it highlights that cyber espionage can easily be turned into an attack: “According to the aspirations and intentions of the actor, it is possible to just press a key or initiate a sequence of commands, and the conversion between cyber surveillance and cyber attack is immediately completed.” The authors conclude that the relationship between cyber espionage and combat cannot be severed.96\n\nIn addition, OPE can erode the distinction between peacetime and conflict in cyberspace. The 2017 Science of Military Strategy published by the National Defense University indicates that, “compared to traditional domains, the boundary between war and peace in the cyber domain is fuzzier.” The book describes the lack of clear boundaries as follows: “cyber and electronic domain warfare already exists in peacetime; when war is imminent (linzhan) it becomes more intense; [and] often sustained confrontation directly merges into actual war.”97 These views are repeated in a revised edition of the book published in 2020.98 Two PLA authors affiliated with the former General Staff Research Institute argue that one reason for the blurred boundary between war and peace in cyberspace is that “‘backdoors’ and ‘exploits’ are pre-placed in an enemy’s network systems early; it is very difficult to determine from which moment war begins.”99 This view contrasts with US Cyber Command’s views of a clearer threshold of armed conflict in cyberspace.\n\nAs in the United States, PLA texts indicate that China intends to conduct offensive cyber operations.

The book indicates that the PLA would need to “completely analyze the structure and relationship of interconnections and restrictions among the adversary’s systems for command and control, intelligence and warning, and firepower attack (huoli daji), and their support and sustainment,” to select the appropriate means for offensive cyber attacks. Those means include offensive cyber operations that would require OPE: “systems intrusion, computer virus attacks, attacks to cut off servers, and network deception attacks.” The book indicates that PLA attacks would not be limited to military networks, but could also “infiltrate, attack, and paralyze the adversary’s important civilian networks (minyong wangluo xitong).”¹⁰⁰ The PLA has moderated its expectations of the ease and effectiveness of such attacks as it has learned more about offensive cyber operations over time.¹⁰¹ But has by no means taken them off the table, as demonstrated by its ongoing exploitation of Taiwanese critical infrastructure, and Indian critical infrastructure networks during the conflict along the Sino-Indian border in 2020.¹⁰²\n\n## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risk\n\nPLA texts do not discuss the danger of the OPE-espionage distinction problem and the risk of escalation if an intrusion is discovered in a crisis. It is unclear whether Chinese decision-makers have implemented procedures for managing inadvertent escalation risks posed by its cyber operations. Past PLA writings do not indicate that managing those risks was a priority in organizational procedures for cyber operations. This inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks specifically is surprising given that China has paid increasing attention to three other types of escalation risks: deliberate cyber attacks that could result in an adversary overreaction, unauthorized and accidental cyber attacks perpetrated by the PLA, and the potential for North Korean cyber attacks to be mis-attributed to China and draw it into a conflict with one of Pyongyang’s enemies.\n\nThe 2013 Science of Military Strategy indicates that “every country in the world is conducting cyber reconnaissance activities of differing degrees, but the possibility of this triggering a bilateral crisis, or a war starting because of this reason, is not high.”¹⁰³ The authors do not reconcile this observation with their observation that cyber surveillance and attack are indistinguishable.

The expert called for unified control over all aspects of cyber operations but did not recognize the possibility that espionage could be misperceived as OPE and prompt an adversary to use force.¹⁰⁴\n\nChinese researchers writing for academic and policy audiences vary in their assessments of whether cyber operations in general contribute to crisis instability, but they also do not pay specific attention to the OPE inadvertent escalation pathway. Associate Professor Liu Yangyue at the National University of Defense Technology is generally sanguine about the effects of cyber operations on strategic stability. He dismisses the argument in Western literature that a state could escalate in response to an initial cyber attack to stop an adversary from conducting further attacks.¹⁰⁵ Drawing on the same observational data used in Western cyber security scholarship, he argues that “when they face cyber attacks (believed to come from their enemies), states do not inevitably make worst-case calculations in their style of behavior, or let this guide their policies for responding.”¹⁰⁶ Similarly, Li Bin and Zhao Tong report that:\n\nSome Chinese experts have challenged the popular view that cyber technology will negatively affect crisis stability, because they believe this conclusion is based completely on logical deduction, instead of empirical evidence. These experts have noted that states are usually very cautious about launching military retaliations to cyber attacks, and it is very rare for cyber attacks to lead to escalation.¹⁰⁷\n\nNevertheless, Liu does express concern about the escalation risks posed by the difficulty of attribution. Citing the example of the Solar Sunrise intrusion discovered prior to US airstrikes against Iraq in 1998, he argues that if third-party espionage or OPE “is coincidentally discovered during a military mission, or the attacker uses more sophisticated means to conceal their identity, then this kind of attack could become a fuse for an unintended crisis.”¹⁰⁸\n\nOther Chinese scholars are less sanguine about the escalation risks in cyberspace. But they tend to focus on the use-or-lose incentives to carry out cyber attacks early in a crisis or conflict, rather than inadvertent escalation due to the discovery of an intrusion.¹⁰⁹ PRC experts have also expressed concern about the US concept of “cross-domain deterrence,” which they interpret as threats to use conventional military operations (or even nuclear threats) to retaliate for cyber attacks.¹¹⁰ The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Ariel Levite and former PLA Col. Lyu Jinghua wrote in China Military Science that in a Sino-American conflict scenario, “one of the earliest and most destabilising venues for conflict would be cyberspace, thanks to the potential military utility of early employment of cyber assets.” Levite and Lyu acknowledge that “cyber\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

The PLA promulgated a new generation of doctrine in November 2020, the first update to its official doctrine since 1999.¹¹² Unfortunately, no information about their content was available at the time of writing. Up until at least 2015, official PLA doctrine for offensive cyber operations was likely covered by doctrine for information operations, which combined electronic, cyber, and kinetic attacks.¹¹³ PLA texts published before 2015 hinted that, in the future, the PLA might have operational doctrine for stand-alone cyber operations as well as joint information operations involving cyber attacks.¹¹⁴\n\nThe PLA established the Strategic Support Force (SSF) in 2015–2016, during one of the most significant set of reforms in its history. The SSF consolidated most existing PLA cyber offense, defense, and espionage units from separate parts of its former General Staff Department and services into a Network Systems Department within the Strategic Support Force. Before the reforms, the PLA General Staff Department’s Third Department was believed to be the primary organization for cyber espionage within the PLA, while the Fourth Department was believed to have primary responsibility for offensive cyber operations.¹¹⁵ The consolidation of the former Third and Fourth departments into one organization is likely to enable the PLA to better integrate cyber operations for espionage and attack.¹¹⁶\n\nThese new organizational arrangements for military cyber operations should in theory improve the ability of top leaders to recognize and manage the crisis escalation risks associated with OPE. One of the key effects, if not drivers, of the consolidation of Chinese military cyber forces into the SSF is to enable top military leaders to exercise stricter oversight over PLA cyber operations to prevent accidental and unauthorized cyber attacks.¹¹⁷ Indeed, PLA writings published around the time the SSF was created emphasize the principle of “unified command” (tongyi zhihui) of cyber offense, defense, espionage, and control, and both PLA and non-PLA cyber capabilities.¹¹⁸ Details of how this principle of unified command is implemented in practice are scarce. Moreover, the ability of the new command structure to manage escalation risks in practice might have taken a back seat to other force building priorities. For example, the PLA’s efforts to guard against unauthorized and accidental use of cyber operations is in tension with its efforts to recruit the best cyber talent from outside\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

The SSF's use of contractors may revive many of the problems with oversight of cyber operations that China's leaders encountered prior to the 2015–2016 reforms.^[119]^\n\nThe nature and extent of leadership oversight of PLA cyber operations are difficult to determine. It is possible that China has established a formal institutional structure for inter-agency vetting of military plans and operations that crosses civilian and military lines. Drawing on a PLA publication about cyber operations published in 2017, John Chen, Joe McReynolds, and Kieran Green observe that “peacetime planning and guidance of cyberspace operations . . . at the strategic level rest in the hands of such national network security leadership organizations as the [Communist Party] Cybersecurity and Informatization Commission, while planning and guidance during wartime are the responsibility of the [PLA] CMC Joint Operations Command Center.”^[120]^ In other words, a civilian Party body takes the lead in peacetime and the PLA’s Central Military Commission takes the lead in wartime. It remains unclear how this dual command structure functions in practice. Most importantly, it remains unclear whether and, if so, to what degree managing inadvertent escalation risks resulting from OPE is a priority for the military and civilian leaders with oversight over PLA cyber operations.\n\n## Capabilities for Managing Cyber Risk\n\nChina is developing cyber situational awareness capabilities, including attribution capabilities. But they likely lag behind the United States in its development of capabilities that could disambiguate between attackers and mitigate inadvertent escalation risks. An official white paper outlining China’s international cyberspace strategy published in 2017 indicated that:\n\n[China] will expedite the development of a [military] cyber force and enhance capabilities in terms of situational awareness, cyber defense, supporting state activities and participating in international cooperation, to prevent major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security, and maintain national security and social stability.^[121]^\n\nIt is difficult to assess the extent of improvement in China’s attribution and defense capabilities since adopting these priorities in 2015. The Chinese government’s procedures for defending its networks are unclear and it has not publicly attributed cyber attacks to another state. Nevertheless, in 2018 Xi Jinping acknowledged the deterrent effect of China’s improved capability to detect intruders.^[122]^ Some Chinese cyber security firms have begun to publicly\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

For example, the Chinese company Antiy argued that China needed to “make progress in weakening the ability of an adversary to ‘prepare the battlefield’ in our industrial control [systems] and infrastructure to achieve [serious] consequences.”¹²⁴\n\n## Misperception in the Sino-American Cyber Relationship\n\nDo the United States and China have a shared understanding of the nature of cyber conflict, the role of OPE, and the potential for crisis instability because of the OPE-espionage distinction problem? Comparing US and Chinese approaches to cyber conflict reveals some similarities, as well as differences that could hamper future bilateral efforts to manage cyber escalation risks. Both countries recognize that OPE is necessary for sophisticated offensive cyber operations yet is indistinguishable from intrusions for the purpose of espionage, defense, or data theft. Both countries view the presence of nation-state hackers in their networks as threatening. But the two countries do not appear to share an understanding of the inadvertent escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem or the clarity of the threshold of an armed attack in cyberspace.\n\nThe comparison also reveals asymmetries in the relative maturity of cyber doctrine and capabilities in both countries. These asymmetries might explain the lack of attention to inadvertent escalation risks in China’s approach to cyber conflict. China’s doctrine, procedures, and authorities for conducting cyber operations appear to have been overhauled by the 2015–2016 PLA reforms and took some years afterwards to crystallize into their current form. As a result, the PLA has less experience integrating espionage, offensive, and defensive cyber operations and incorporating civilian oversight into its cyber operations than the United States. The PLA operational regulations promulgated in late 2020 might have included more guidance on OPE and managing its escalation risks that is not reflected in the sources examined here. Meanwhile, US cyber capabilities and strategy are relatively more mature. US organizations demonstrate growing confidence in attribution capabilities, the clarity of escalation thresholds, and US ability to control escalation from OPE or low-level cyber attacks. These factors have led to a doctrine for cyber operations that gives the military a freer hand.\n\nNeither China nor the United States appears to be overly concerned about its espionage activities being misperceived as OPE during a crisis, albeit for different reasons. On the one hand, China appears to be inattentive to the specific\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

On the other hand, the United States appears to be aware of the specific escalation risks associated with OPE but is confident that they can be mitigated. This suggests that both states might approach a crisis confident that their intrusions will not be discovered, misperceived, or lead to the use of force. The PLA's attention to the escalation risks associated with OPE might increase as Chinese cyber doctrine and capabilities further develop. But increased awareness is by no means a given. Chinese experts and writings on crisis management and nuclear strategy – areas where PLA doctrine and capabilities are more mature – have also tended to downplay drivers of inadvertent escalation.\n\nOf course, the lack of concern about the escalation risks associated with OPE could reflect a shared lack of concern that cyber attacks could cause much harm in a crisis, supporting the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. OPE may simply be accepted practice between these two countries.[125] They might expect that some of their key networks will be disabled by their adversaries' offensive cyber operations during future conflicts. They might prepare to fight without those networks instead of pre-empting cyber attacks that could disable them. We are cautious, however, about interpreting the evidence as confirmation of the bluster hypothesis. Evidence that China both acknowledges and shares US confidence that inadvertent cyber escalation risks can be managed – which we did not find – would have reduced the need for caution in interpreting the evidence in favor of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis.\n\n## Initiatives to Mitigate Misperceptions\n\nIn the absence of a shared understanding of cyber conflict, two initiatives could reduce the risk of inadvertent cyber escalation via the misperception pathway in a future Sino-American crisis: dialogue to ensure that both parties understand each other's approach to cyber operations, and a crisis communication mechanism specific to cyber operations. Dialogue and crisis communication could reduce the likelihood of either side misperceiving the other's cyber intrusion as OPE, or as confirmation of the other's hostile intentions, because of differences in their understandings of cyber conflict and operations.[126] Unfortunately, China and the United States do not currently have an official military cyber dialogue that could bridge some of the gaps in their understandings of military cyber operations before a crisis emerges, despite establishing official dialogues to enable cooperation in non-military areas of the cyber relationship in 2015. Nor do China and the United States currently have a mechanism in place for crisis communications dedicated to cyber matters. By contrast, the United States has a three-tier cyber communications protocol in\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Although our empirical analysis is unable to provide a definitive answer to this question, it provides enough evidence to suggest that inadvertent escalation could occur if one state discovered the other's cyber intrusions in a crisis. Over the past decade or so, the United States has made unilateral attempts to limit the risks of inadvertent escalation occurring, first with strict organizational procedures governing all cyber operations and later with more robust operational procedures to defend its networks. There is little evidence that China has taken similar steps to unilaterally mitigate inadvertent escalation risks from cyber operations. The bilateral cyber relationship also lacks the shared understandings of these risks, and mechanisms for dialogue in peacetime or communications in crises, that could improve crisis stability.\n\nEven a small probability of inadvertent escalation could have extremely serious consequences, given how destructive a Sino-American conflict could be and the variety of other escalation risks present in the relationship. Our empirical analysis could also support the claim that cyber capabilities do not pose a serious enough threat for decision-makers to use force – whether cyber or kinetic – to pre-empt or retaliate. However, in the absence of stronger evidence to support this bluster hypothesis, we do not dismiss the risk that the OPE-espionage distinction problem could add to crisis instability given the stakes at hand.\n\nThis chapter suggests that further research is needed to establish whether US confidence that cyber operations do not add to crisis stability is well founded. US adversaries' reluctance to escalate in response to cyber attacks or intrusions might reflect their countervailing strategic and political disincentives to escalate, rather than the stabilizing nature of cyber operations.¹²⁸ Brandon Valeriano, Benjamin M. Jensen, and Ryan C. Maness find that the United States has been successful in using cyberspace to coerce adversaries.¹²⁹ Scholars have pointed out that cyber operations are likely to have their greatest effects on international relations when combined with superior conventional military power.¹³⁰ The possibility that US conventional military power might mask the destabilizing effects of cyber operations suggests that the United States should be cautious as Chinese conventional military capabilities improve. If a Sino-American crisis had occurred during the past decade, Beijing would have\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Going forward, even if the PRC views an intrusion as a serious but manageable threat, its growing conventional capabilities and tense relationship with Washington could create an excuse for deliberate PRC escalation. And if the intrusion were intolerable, political and strategic disincentives could not be counted on to restrain China's leaders from using force.\n\n# Notes\n\n1. Kurt M.

For example, the target could use forensics to determine whether the intrusion took place during or just before the crisis, which could signal that an intruder intends to use it to influence the crisis. The ease with which the intrusion is discovered could also signal that the intruder intended to use it immediately and chose not to take the time to develop a stealthier presence.\n\n33.

Jervis, “Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma,” 186–187. The offense-defense balance does not need to favor the offense for inadvertent escalation to occur, although it can intensify the victim state’s incentives to use force.\n\n41. Posen, *Inadvertent Escalation*, 1–3.\n\n42. This calculation is distinct from, but could be enhanced by, a first-mover advantage. Offense-defense theorists disagree on whether first-mover advantages should be included in the offense-defense balance. See Jervis, “Cooperation Under the Security Dilemma,” 189; Charles L. Glaser and Chaim Kaufmann, “What Is the Offense-Defense Balance and How Can We Measure It?,” *International Security* 22, no. 4 (1998): 71–72, https://doi.org/10.1162/isec.22.4.44; Rebecca Slayton, “What is the Cyber Offense-Defense Balance?

This could involve a state facing pressure to either “use or lose” its weapons or signal resolve in case its adversary’s conflict objectives expand in future.

Cunningham\nIn the context of an increasingly competitive Sino-American relationship, US analysts are increasingly concerned about crisis instability, defined as the temptation for either country to use force rather than continue to bargain diplomatically during a crisis. Scholars and analysts focused on the US-China relationship have warned that cyber capabilities could add incentives for either the United States or China to use force in a crisis. Despite these concerns, there is no consensus among cyber scholars that offensive cyber capabilities contribute to the risk of great-power political crises escalating into conflicts.\nAs the previous chapter by Jason Healey and Robert Jervis has shown, certain features of cyber capabilities could create new pathways through which a great-power crisis could escalate into a conventional conflict.\nThis chapter examines one of these novel escalation pathways in the context of the Sino-American relationship: the difficulty of distinguishing between hacking for espionage and operational preparation of the environment (OPE), an essential precursor to most high-end cyber attacks. This OPE-espionage distinction problem creates pathways for inadvertent escalation, which occurs \"when a combatant deliberately takes actions that it does not perceive to be escalatory but are interpreted that way by the enemy,\" during a crisis or conflict. A state could correctly detect an adversary's OPE and, fearing an imminent cyber attack with severe consequences, choose to use force first, escalating the conflict with a cyber or even kinetic attack. But a state could also misperceive an adversary's efforts to collect intelligence via cyber means as OPE and pre-empt that attack with conventional or cyber attacks of its own. A state discovering that its adversary has intruded into its nuclear command, control, and communications networks during a crisis presents a particularly concerning scenario.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nDespite these concerns, academic studies based on observational data, surveys, and simulations find little correlation between cyber attacks and escalation, either in peacetime or during conflicts.6 Scholars have reasoned that most cyber attacks are simply not destructive enough to worsen crisis or conflict outcomes.7 These limited effects, coupled with the bloodless, secret nature of cyber attacks, might instead open up new pathways for de-escalation and enhance crisis stability.8 However, the external validity of existing empirical findings to military crises among great powers is limited because no such crisis has occurred in the past two decades and they are difficult to replicate in surveys, simulations, and wargames.9\nTo evaluate the diverging concerns of the US policy community and the ongoing scholarly debates on cyber escalation and crisis instability among great powers, this chapter examines the escalation risks created by OPE in a future crisis scenario involving the United States and China. Scholars have already identified several sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship, including a systematic lack of attention among Chinese experts to inadvertent escalation risks in the nuclear, conventional, and space domains.10 A Sino-American crisis scenario is a most likely case for theoretical claims that cyber capabilities create novel escalation risks. Both countries would be most likely to react to any independent effect of cyber technology on their incentives to use force, if such incentives exist, in a crisis. Indeed, scholars have already raised concerns that cyber capabilities could fuel Sino-American crisis instability, although they have not examined the OPE-espionage distinction problem in much detail.11 To assess the escalation risks posed by this problem, we follow the methodological approach of scholars who have examined other sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship. Specifically, we examine the two countries' leadership statements, threat perceptions, procedures for authorizing cyber operations, organizational structures, capabilities, and policies for evidence that they create, recognize, and seek to manage escalatory risks.\nOur analysis suggests that inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE would be present in a future Sino-American crisis scenario. Official US policy for offensive cyber operations recognizes the escalation risks associated with cyber espionage being mistaken for OPE, but recent changes to US cyber strategy may increase these risks. Meanwhile, Chinese writings recognize the difficulty of distinguishing between cyber attacks and OPE but appear to ignore the consequences for crisis instability. We also find that a lack of mutual understanding in the Sino-American cyber relationship adds to the likelihood of the two countries misperceiving each other's behavior.\nOur empirical findings have two key limitations. First, our sources are scarce, imperfect, and some years old, especially on the Chinese side. We\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\nfollow best practices for using open sources to analyze Chinese military strategy, but caution is still needed when drawing conclusions from such sources. Nevertheless, these sources still make a valuable contribution to existing policy debates and scholarly research about cyber conflict, which rarely draws on Chinese perspectives. Second, our empirical findings could support the claim that cyber technology either does – or does not – add to crisis instability. Leaders from both countries might choose to ignore the escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem even if they are present. But neither country's relaxed approach to these risks is justified by a careful assessment of the independent effect of cyber technology on an adversary's incentives to use force in a crisis, which makes us hesitant to dismiss them.\nThis chapter begins with a brief explanation of OPE as a distinctive feature of cyber attacks. The second section outlines the competing hypotheses about cyber escalation in existing scholarly literature and the mechanisms that could link detection of an intrusion in a crisis with the decision to use force. The third, fourth, and fifth sections examine the evidence for these hypotheses in US documents and statements, Chinese writings and organizational practices, and the bilateral cyber relationship, respectively. The sixth section evaluates the escalation risks.\n## Operational Preparation of the Environment\nPerforming OPE is essential to enabling significant cyber operations that could have strategic effects on the target.[12] To develop a cyber capability with a potent or customized effect on a target network, substantial reconnaissance and preparation are required from within that targeted network. In 2010, the Department of Defense defined \"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment\" as:\nNon-intelligence enabling functions within cyberspace conducted to plan and prepare for potential follow-up military operations. [Cyber-OPE] includes but is not limited to identifying data, system/network configurations, or physical structures . . . for the purpose of determining system vulnerabilities; and actions taken to assure future access and/or control of the system, network, or data during anticipated hostilities.[13]\nWhile cyber OPE has analogues in other forms of military operations – especially in the world of special operations and covert action – it differs from operations that are more familiar to policymakers, such as conventional and nuclear operations. Preparations to use cyber capabilities have different recon\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nnaissance requirements than most other operations.¹⁴ Much of the development and preparation for a cyber operation requires access to or occurs within adversary networks. Moreover, the accesses and payloads that make offensive cyber operations possible are often specific to a particular network.¹⁵\nGaining and maintaining access to a target network is also generally difficult, resource intensive, and specific to the target network.¹⁶ Overall, the effects of an attack, the ability to sustain those effects over time, and the ability of an attack to limit unintended consequences all depend on how well the attacker has prepared and understood the target network and the likely actions of the network's defenders once the attack commences.¹⁷\nA few examples illustrate the importance of OPE to sophisticated offensive cyber operations. Stuxnet was enabled by months if not years of reconnaissance, while Iranian hackers spent months inside the computer networks of Sands Casino and Saudi Aramco before they attacked in 2012.¹⁸ North Korean hackers did the same with their attacks on the computer networks of Sony Pictures.¹⁹ Russian hackers prepared in a similar way for their NotPetya operation, which reportedly inflicted over $10 billion in damage.²⁰ Some attacks, most notably denial-of-service efforts, do not fit into this trend, but lack potency as a result.²¹\nOPE is also difficult to distinguish from espionage once it is discovered by a target. In theory, there might be ways for a target to tell whether an intrusion is espionage or whether it facilitates an attack. But there are no foolproof solutions to this OPE-espionage distinction problem. For example, an uptick in communication between the attacker and malicious code implanted in the target system could signal its purpose, but an attack could occur without any of those signals. Those signals could also accompany routine intelligence collection.²² Even if an attacker tries to use those signals to distinguish OPE from espionage, the target may not receive those signals or treat them as credible.²³ The nature of the target network may provide some hints – for example, critical infrastructure industrial control systems are more likely to be exploited for OPE than intelligence gathering – but this is not always the case.²⁴ Moreover, the exploitation of an adversary's networks for intelligence gathering could be repurposed for OPE without any tell-tale signs that the target might detect. For example, there is some evidence to suggest that the first blackout in Ukraine began with an espionage objective but later morphed into an attack operation.²⁵\n## The Novel Escalation Risks of OPE\nHow and why could an intrusion discovered in the midst of a crisis between two great powers create incentives for the use of force? How and why might\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\ndecision-makers choose to use force when faced with those incentives? Answers to these questions are key to understanding the potential for cyber operations to contribute to crisis instability -- or stability.\nWe define a crisis as “a confrontation between two states involving a serious threat to vital national interests for both sides in which there is the expectation of a short time for resolution, and in which there is understood to be a sharply increased risk of war.” We define escalation as “an increase in the intensity or scope of conflict that crosses threshold(s) considered significant by one or more of the participants.” In a great-power crisis, escalation would involve the use of force, with either cyber or kinetic attacks. We use the term “cyber escalation risks” to refer to an increased temptation to use force in a crisis due to the nature of cyber technology.\nIf decision-makers discover an intrusion into their key military or civilian networks during a crisis, most scholars agree that those decision-makers could not rule out the possibility that the intrusion enables OPE. The decision-makers' response to that discovery will depend on how they assess the seriousness of the threat posed by the intrusion and whether the state also has strategic or political incentives to use force. The interaction of these two factors suggests four possibilities: the inadvertent escalation and deliberate escalation hypotheses that expect the use of force, and the bluster and countervailing hypotheses that do not expect the use of force. We focus on the logic underpinning the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it best represents the concerns in current US policy debates about the destabilizing effect of cyber technology in a future Sino-American crisis.\n### Intrusion Detection in a Crisis\nThe scenario in which OPE could trigger the use of force in a crisis would likely begin months if not years before the crisis. An adversary that wants the option to carry out offensive cyber operations in a future conflict against a state's important military or civilian networks would conduct OPE during peacetime. Once a crisis has begun it is almost certainly too late to complete this complex, time-consuming task.\nOnce a political crisis began -- for example, over an accidental collision between two rivals' military aircraft, the scenario that triggered the last Sino-American crisis in 2001 -- decision-makers in both states would have to decide whether to back down, bargain diplomatically, or bargain with the use of force. During their deliberations, the target state's decision-makers might discover their adversary's intrusions into important computer networks, including those that might be OPE. Such discoveries are more likely in a crisis\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nbecause states anticipate espionage and attacks in that context and will step up network defenses accordingly.³⁰ If target’s decision-makers decide it is most prudent to treat the intrusion as OPE, and they believe that the intrusion poses a serious threat, the OPE-espionage distinction problem creates an incentive to use force rather than bargain diplomatically.\nMore generally, the OPE-espionage distinction problem complicates the task of the target’s decision-makers charged with assessing the intent behind the intrusion. Motivations for the intrusion include OPE, monitoring the target’s military operations, or gathering intelligence about its offensive cyber operations.³¹ The specifics of the intrusion may provide some hints of intent but are unlikely to be definitive.³² Testing of small-scale attacks or an uptick in communication between the intruder and code it has implanted in the target system could also signal that it is OPE.³³ The intruder would also have difficulty reassuring the target state of its intent if the intrusion is for intelligence purposes.³⁴ To preserve its operational security, the intruder would have incentives not to acknowledge which adversary networks it has exploited and for what purpose, lest the target use that information to remove the intruder.³⁵ Even if the intruder sought to reassure the target of its intent not to use the intrusion to enable an attack, it would have trouble credibly committing not to use the intrusion for OPE in the future.\n## The Inadvertent Escalation Pathway\nThe claim that cyber operations create incentives to use force in a crisis is a specific instance of a general claim that military operations and technology can cause misperceptions among adversaries with serious consequences for crisis stability and intra-war escalation.³⁶ One potential consequence of those misperceptions is inadvertent escalation. The canonical scenario of inadvertent escalation is a conventional war among nuclear powers in which one party conducts “large-scale conventional operations that produce patterns of damage or threat to the major elements of a state’s nuclear force.”³⁷ The target state interprets the attack as a deliberate attempt to degrade its nuclear force and responds by using nuclear weapons or accelerating preparations for their use.³⁸ Similarly, escalation to the use of cyber or kinetic force could occur in a crisis as an unintended consequence of the normal conduct of cyber espionage.\nMisperceptions commonly associated with the security dilemma are one reason that inadvertent escalation could occur.³⁹ Specifically, the difficulty of distinguishing between an adversary’s offensive and defensive military operations is sufficient to produce misperceptions about the intent of the attacking state within the target state.⁴⁰ The attacking state’s conventional military\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\noperations could therefore make its adversary less secure in unintended ways,⁴¹ which creates an incentive for the target state to use force sooner rather than later.⁴² The target state need only calculate that its ability to achieve its conflict objectives will diminish in the future if it ignores the attacker’s actions in the present.⁴³\nThe OPE-espionage distinction problem could trigger the use of force if the target state’s leaders make worst-case-scenario assessments of the attacker’s intent and capability to damage an important information network. There are four mechanisms by which a state could make a worst-case-scenario assessment of the seriousness of the threat posed by an intrusion and decide to use force, whether a cyber or kinetic attack. First, a state that detects an adversary’s OPE might use force to pre-empt a cyber attack that could put the state at a military disadvantage in a future conflict.⁴⁴ Second, the combination of the crisis environment and the OPE-espionage distinction problem could lead the state to attribute aggressive intentions to the adversary with regards to both the network intrusion and the overall crisis, incentivizing the use of force.⁴⁵ Third, the discovery of an intrusion that might be OPE could affect decision-makers’ emotions in ways that make the use of force more likely.⁴⁶ Fourth, the uneven distribution of information about the nature of cyber operations in national security bureaucracies might make the use of force more likely when those bureaucracies discover intrusions in a crisis. Intrusions that some cyber specialists see as a routine part of cyber operations may alarm more senior generalists, especially in a crisis. Top decision-makers may not have sufficient knowledge or information to assess the risks posed by a cyber intrusion to their military capabilities.⁴⁷\n## The Deliberate Escalation Pathway\nStates might assess that a cyber intrusion poses a serious but tolerable threat yet choose to use force in response because they have strategic and political incentives to escalate. Those strategic and political incentives usually involve gaining a military advantage, signaling resolve, or pre-empting an adversary’s attempt to signal resolve by using force.⁴⁸ Scholars have questioned whether states make decisions to escalate because of the independent effects of technology alone. Based on historical case studies, Caitlin Talmadge argues that new technologies might not force decision-makers to take escalatory actions, but rather “seem likely to be an intervening variable.” States seek out new technologies to enable them to increase the risk of escalation, or turn to them opportunistically in a conflict, rather than their hands being forced to escalate in a crisis because they did not anticipate the escalatory pressures created\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nby their prior decisions to deploy certain military capabilities.⁴⁹ These actions involve deliberate escalation: “[when] a combatant deliberately increases the intensity or scope of an operation to gain an advantage or avoid defeat.”⁵⁰\n## The Bluster De-escalation Pathway\nDecision-makers may decide not to use force if they discover an intrusion in a crisis – even if they are confident that the intruder has performed OPE – because they do not think the intrusion poses a serious threat. This “bluster” hypothesis suggests that cyber technology does not contribute to crisis instability and might even help to stabilize crises. It draws on existing empirical research which indicates that cyber attacks are perceived to be more bluster than bite. States and individuals tend not to retaliate in response to cyber attacks.⁵¹ One explanation for this empirical finding is that decision-makers do not view cyber attacks as sufficiently damaging or destructive to warrant the use of force in response.⁵² Applying these arguments to a crisis scenario in which an intrusion is discovered, decision-makers might calculate that the cost of the cyber attack is likely to be low and can be absorbed. This explanation suggests that states would not anticipate a military disadvantage from a cyber attack, contrary to the military disadvantage mechanism outlined above.\nDecision-makers might even view cyber attacks as a signal that an adversary wants to avoid a conventional conflict. When the effects of cyber and kinetic attacks are held constant, Jacquelyn Schneider and Sarah Kreps found that US survey respondents were less likely to support retaliation for cyber attacks than kinetic attacks.⁵³ Decision-makers might therefore interpret the discovery of an intrusion as a signal of an adversary’s intent to avoid crossing the threshold of conventional armed conflict,⁵⁴ rather than its hostile intent, contrary to the misperception mechanism outlined above.\n## The Countervailing De-escalation Hypothesis\nFinally, decision-makers might view the intrusion as posing a serious threat but have countervailing political or strategic incentives not to respond with the use of force. Decision-makers could react to an intrusion in this de-escalatory manner if they want to defuse the crisis because, for example, the stakes of the crisis do not merit fighting a war, or if they lacked the conventional military power to achieve their political objectives if a conflict broke out. Decision-makers with multiple adversaries might also be wary of mis-attributing an intrusion carried out by one adversary to another if they cannot attribute the intrusion to its perpetrator with sufficient confidence in the time frame of the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\ncrisis.⁵⁵ Other countervailing incentives may also originate in domestic politics. The ambiguity of intent behind cyber intrusions could help more moderate decision-makers build a coalition for restraint in the crisis and counter pressure from decision-makers with more hawkish preferences.⁵⁶\n## Evaluating Cyber Escalation Hypotheses\nHow might scholars determine which of these four hypotheses is most likely in a great-power crisis, when no crisis has occurred since China and the United States were both armed with military cyber capabilities? There is no perfect solution to this problem. To complement existing empirical studies, most of which capture US popular or elite views of cyber escalation, our approach focuses on capturing both US and Chinese elite views by examining their approach to cyber OPE, escalation, and military operations.\nOur empirical analysis is guided by observable implications derived from the four hypotheses. The inadvertent escalation hypothesis would expect states to express concern about any intrusions into their networks and to recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. States might also recognize inadvertent escalation risks and take steps to manage cyber escalation risks in their procedures, authorities, and organizational structures for cyber operations. Inadvertent escalation is also more likely to occur when two states have a poor understanding of each other's cyber activities and lack crisis communications mechanisms to verify the nature of an intrusion. The bluster de-escalation hypothesis would expect states that possess good attribution capabilities, defend their networks against intrusions, and effectively repel intruders who do breach defenses to be more relaxed about discovering intrusions into their networks. Not only might they be less likely to experience worrying intrusions, but they might also be able to better assess the intent and the severity of the threat posed by an intrusion.\nWhile it is difficult to describe the strategic and political incentives that could provide evidence to support the deliberate escalation or countervailing hypotheses in a future crisis, some ex ante features of a great-power relationship would shape those incentives. Deliberate escalation is more likely to occur when the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally stronger than its adversary, does not confront multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has high political stakes in the crisis. The countervailing hypothesis is more likely to find support if the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally weaker than its adversary, faces multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has low political stakes in the crisis. A scenario in which the conventional military balance is roughly equal and both states see the conflict as high stakes\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nwould be the most likely case for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it minimizes countervailing political and strategic incentives to de-escalate if a threatening cyber intrusion is discovered in a crisis. A US-China crisis scenario is more evenly matched than most cyber dyads, although it would still involve some asymmetries in stakes and the conventional military balance that could obfuscate the independent effect of cyber technology on the temptation to use force in a crisis.^[57]^\n## Escalation Risks in US Cyber Operations\nUS decision-makers recognize the inadvertent escalation risks posed by cyber operations, and OPE in particular, but they have taken steps to mitigate those risks. The Obama administration implemented organizational practices that carefully managed cyber operations that could produce escalation. The Trump administration relaxed those organizational practices after gaining confidence in operational practices. These practices provide evidence in favor of either the inadvertent escalation hypothesis or the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. As part of its more muscular approach, US Cyber Command has also concluded that most cyber intrusions could not produce serious enough effects to result in escalation. At first glance this judgment supports the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. But it could also support the countervailing de-escalation hypothesis. US adversaries might view its intrusions as very threatening but face disincentives to use force because of US conventional military preponderance.\n## Leadership Views of OPE\nThe public statements of leaders and government reactions to discoveries of intrusions into military networks indicate that the United States views intrusions as threatening, in part because they could be used either for OPE or intelligence gathering. After a Russian hack of Pentagon systems in 2015 that the United States was able to repel, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter summarized the American position aptly when he said, \"[It] can't be good for anybody to be inside of our networks - whatever their motivation.\"^[58]^ Similarly, Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency (NSA) and US Cyber Command, and his adviser Michael Sulmeyer explained that the United States turned to a more aggressive policy \"to prevent toeholds from turning into beachheads so that a single compromise will not threaten the military's ability to accomplish its mission.\"^[59]^\nWhile the details of most US responses to foreign hacking efforts are not public, two historical cases demonstrate that policymakers worried about the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\nimplications of minor intrusions. In a 1998 hack known as Solar Sunrise, intruders penetrated the US military's logistics and communications networks. The Joint Staff general in charge of information operations, John Campbell, worried that the breach would permit significant attacks, especially at a time of heightened tensions with Iraq. \"If you take one part of that machine, and disable it,\" he said, \"you've got a real problem trying to make a deployment take place.\"60 Campbell's comments reflect an assessment that the intrusion could have placed the United States at a military disadvantage in a conflict. The discovery did not take place during a major crisis and therefore lacked the time pressure element that would create incentives to use force. Nevertheless, an investigation concluded the breach was the work of three teenagers and their 20-year-old mentor after various parts of the US government had already spun up to prepare for a response.\nA second incident, Moonlight Maze, occurred in 1998 and 1999 and involved Russian penetration of unclassified American networks. The US government hacked back into Russian computers to gain more intelligence.[61] One of the White House's top national security officials, Richard Clarke, labeled the activities \"cyberwar reconnaissance.\"[62] Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre indicated that the United States was \"in the middle of a cyber war\" to the Intelligence Committees of Congress during a classified briefing.[63]\n## OPE in Cyber Operations\nUS operators and decision-makers have recognized the need for OPE to conduct sophisticated cyber operations since at least 2010. The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a memo in 2010 mandating the use of the term \"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment,\" which referred to those cyber operations that serve \"as an enabling function for another military operation.\"[64] From the earliest days of the US Cyber Command, secret documents – now declassified – indicated that conducting OPE was one of its core tasks.[65]\nPlanners at the highest levels of the US government eventually recognized the importance of OPE. During the Obama administration, the most significant high-level document governing America's offensive cyber capability was Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20). The president signed the classified document in secret in the fall of 2012. The White House released a fact sheet that made no mention of offensive cyber capabilities,[66] but the full classified document, leaked in 2013 by Edward Snowden, reveals a strategy that directly considers offensive action and contrasts it with other forms of cyber operations. The strategy lays out a clear typology of cyber activity. This includes \"cyber\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\ncollection,” which refers to intelligence-gathering activities for purposes other than offensive preparation. It also includes “non-intrusive defensive countermeasures,” meaning steps taken within one’s own network, such as deploying antivirus and other basic security measures. The document also introduces the concept of “Defensive Cyber Effects Operations,” defined as efforts that have an effect on an adversary’s computer systems – presumably, hacking or other interference – but only for the purposes of defense. PPD-20 provides high-level procedures for managing this kind of aggressive defensive action.⁶⁷\nMost significantly, though, the classified version of PPD-20 defines offensive action in some detail. It introduces the concept of “Offensive Cyber Effects Operations” (OCEO), which are distinct from cyber collection, non-intrusive defensive countermeasures, or defensive cyber effects operations. Instead, these efforts are designed to cause effects in adversary networks.⁶⁸ The document extols the unique virtues of these kinds of offensive cyber operations, which “can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance U.S. national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging.”⁶⁹\nPPD-20 acknowledges the need for OPE to realize these offensive options. It indicates that “the development and sustainment of [offensive cyber] capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist.”⁷⁰ PPD-20 directs the US government to begin this operational preparation. The relevant agencies “shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, [and] establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities.”⁷¹ With his signature, President Barack Obama authorized the preparatory activity.\n## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risks\nPPD-20 reveals US policymakers’ cognisance of the risks that arise from actually using offensive cyber capabilities. As a result, the document highlights a process to carefully manage offensive actions that might do serious harm or invite escalation. It emphasizes inter-agency coordination, balancing defense and national security interests with diplomatic and economic ones. Most notably, the process requires the highest level of executive branch oversight – presidential approval – for any cyber operation that is “reasonably likely to result in significant consequences.”⁷² This term is broadly defined: “Loss of life, significant responsive actions against the United States, significant damage to property, serious adverse U.S. foreign policy consequences, or serious\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\neconomic impact on the United States.”73 It is likely that cyber operations that do not meet that threshold could otherwise be approved by the agency carrying out the operation without such high-level inter-agency vetting.\nCrucially, PPD-20 does not limit these restrictions to cyber attacks but emphasizes that they apply to all cyber operations. In short, President Obama wanted direct oversight of any operation that might meet the threshold of significant consequences – regardless of whether that operation involved collecting intelligence, defending American computers, preparing an offensive capability, or launching an attack. The directive suggests that the Obama administration was concerned, at least in theory, about the risks of cyber escalation even as it appreciated the operational necessity to prepare offensive capabilities in advance.\nThe Trump administration adopted a more relaxed set of organizational procedures for managing cyber escalation risks. Upon unveiling its new national cyber strategy in 2018, the Trump White House criticized the preceding administration for what it saw as its overly cautious posture and promised to be more aggressive in its engagements with adversaries. Then-National Security Adviser John Bolton said, “Our hands are not tied as they were in the Obama administration.” Nor was the need for more aggressive action just a partisan view. In his confirmation hearing, the incoming NSA director and commander of US Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone warned that the United States had to do more because American adversaries “don’t fear us.”74\nThese views were translated into policy by President Donald Trump’s signature on “National Security Presidential Memorandum 13.” The goal of the memorandum, which remains classified, is to provide military commanders with greater flexibility to integrate cyber operations into their overall approach to warfighting and deterrence.75 By delegating this authority to the Pentagon, the Trump administration attempted to foster a faster and more aggressive process, one that would generate more operational effects more quickly. But this approach also rebalanced the trade-off between operational agility and whole-of-government coordination to manage cyber escalation risks in favor of the former. According to the general on the Joint Staff responsible for cyber operations, this change sharply contrasted with the Obama administration’s approach, which was “an interagency process that went through the National Security Council . . . to deputies’ committee to principals’ committee and [where], in effect, anyone could stop the process along the way.” Nor, he argued, was the distinction just semantics or bureaucratic minutia, but one that “makes all the difference in the world in terms of the speed at which you can move.”76\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nIt is unclear whether current US policy, set by the Trump memorandum, frees commanders to both prepare for and launch cyber capabilities. But there are hints that the memo and complementary legislative changes implemented by Congress provide a freer hand in developing the malicious code and gaining access to target networks required to provide commanders with offensive options. For example, in a media interview, the former deputy commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, indicated that changes to congressional legislation “freed us up to do some of the things, the operational preparation of the environment, that we were limited from doing outside of the counterterrorism mission and now can do much more broadly against all of our peers and competitors.” In addition, a New York Times story from June 2019 describes more aggressive American preparatory measures against the Russian power grid.\nOverall, the Trump administration was much less worried about the escalation risk associated with cyber operations than the Obama administration. The Biden administration appears to have largely continued this approach since taking office in 2021. Michael Daniel, the former coordinator for cyber security in the Obama White House, observed that the Trump administration was “willing to take more risks than previous administrations.” While the Trump administration's approach was untested in a crisis with a near‐peer competitor, it was informed by the US experience with cyber conflict over the past decade as well as the increasing risk tolerance of US decision‐makers. To justify its new posture, US Cyber Command has argued that “adversaries continuously operate against us below the threshold of armed conflict,” in what it described as a “new normal.” Moreover, the command argued that US efforts to counter this adversarial activity will not lead to retaliation in or outside of cyberspace that would cross that threshold.\nThese claims have been fiercely debated in the academic literature, with critics of the so‐called persistent engagement approach arguing that the new strategy could produce escalation. For example, some contend that the thresholds for armed conflict are not as clear as US Cyber Command has suggested. Others argue that persistent engagement creates too many red lines for adversaries and is therefore not a realistic means for shaping behavior. Nakasone and Sulmeyer responded to these concerns with reassurance that:“Cyber Command takes these concerns seriously, and reducing this risk is a critical part of the planning process. We are confident that this more proactive approach enables Cyber Command to conduct operations that impose costs while responsibly managing escalation.\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\n# Capabilities for Managing Escalation Risks\nIn the past decade, the United States has developed some of the world's most sophisticated cyber capabilities to better defend its networks, attribute intrusions, and expel intruders in peacetime. To better defend networks, the United States has invested in major systems, such as EINSTEIN 3, that aim to thwart intrusions. To improve rapid attribution of intrusions and increase situational awareness, the United States established various cross-agency working groups and bulked up teams within the NSA and US Cyber Command. To the extent that these capabilities are effective, they might mitigate cyber escalation risks by reducing the likelihood that intruders will successfully break into US networks and alarm policymakers who have to decide on how to respond within the compressed time period of a crisis. However, the compromise of SolarWinds network management system in 2021, which enabled Russian government operators to intrude into numerous US government systems for months without detection, suggests that defense and attribution capabilities are imperfect and do not eliminate the possibility of the United States discovering an intrusion during a crisis.\n# Escalation Risks in Chinese Cyber Operations\nThere is little evidence to indicate that China has scrutinized the inadvertent escalation risks posed by OPE as carefully as the United States, although Chinese sources bearing on this question are older, scarcer, and less authoritative than those for the United States.83 This lack of attention could be evidence of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis, as it might reflect a judgment that cyber intrusions pose a manageable threat to China's leaders. But this lack of concern should be interpreted in the context of a relative lack of concern about inadvertent escalation risks posed by nuclear, space, and conventional military operations among Chinese experts. As such, we favor the interpretation of China's inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks as support for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis. Inattention to the inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE could help to realize such risks in a crisis for three reasons. First, China is more likely to misperceive US cyber intrusions. Second, it is more likely to overlook the ways that its own cyber intrusions could be misperceived. Third, China is much less likely to take steps to mitigate these risks. Available sources provide little insight into whether the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has put in place organizational or operational practices to manage inadvertent cyber escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nLeadership Views of OPE\nChinese policymakers' fears about foreign hackers have grown in tandem with the expansion of the Chinese government's and military's dependence on computer networks. In a major speech on national cyber security policy in 2016, Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping stated that, “Cyber security has a strong covert character; a technological vulnerability or security risk can stay hidden for a number of years without being discovered.” As a result, “we do not know who came in, whether it was an enemy or a friend, or what they did.” Xi implied that while this enemy or friend's intrusion could remain “latent” inside a network for a long time, it could be “activated whenever (yidan jiu fazuo le).”84\nThe Chinese government has not publicly acknowledged any specific incidents in which it discovered that foreign state actors had exploited its government or military networks. China's closest analogue to the Solar Sunrise and Moonlight Maze incidents was Edward Snowden's revelations regarding US government surveillance of Chinese computer networks. Snowden's revelations are often cited by the country's cyber security scholars as evidence of China's vulnerability and the inadequacy of its network defenses, which failed to prevent or detect US government intrusions. Chinese experts claim that the NSA also targeted the country's military networks.85 A Chinese cyber security firm reported that the CIA had spied on Chinese state‐owned enterprises but did not identify any government networks penetrated.86 There is no detailed evidence about how the Chinese government responded to any of these incidents, nor did they occur in the context of a major crisis.\nChinese writings examining US cyber operations can provide insights into how Chinese experts view these operations in the absence of open discussions about these topics in China. Chinese experts affiliated with the PLA note that OPE is one of the cyber missions outlined in US doctrinal publications but do not mention the crisis escalation risks that could result from the OPE‐espionage distinction problem.87 While the Trump administration's more muscular approach to cyber operations raised concerns among Chinese authors for its emphasis on pre‐emption and potential to spark arms race instability, those experts are less focused on crisis instability than US scholars.88 There are some recent exceptions. For example, former PLA officer Lyu Jinghua writes that“it is worthwhile to explore whether the tension in cyberspace can be de‐escalated or whether the chances of the breakout of crisis can be lowered if there could be a basic consensus among countries that cyber activities\nconducted or supported by countries during peacetime are a contest of intelligence rather than conflicts or preparation of conflicts.\nIt remains unclear whether Chinese decision-makers share the views of experts who worry about the escalation risks of OPE and whether those concerns have led to practices to mitigate those risks.\n### OPE in Cyber Operations\nLike US officials, PLA strategists also distinguish between cyber surveillance, offense and defense, and deterrence as the main styles of cyber struggle. PLA texts do not use the term “operational preparation of the environment” when describing PLA operations, but they do recognize that effective offensive cyber operations require extensive advance preparation. A 2015 book authored by experts from the PLA Army Engineering University, 54th Institute, and other PLA organizations acknowledges that significant advance preparations are needed to ensure that cyber operations can be used to diminish an adversary's combat power. While many methods of attack are available, “a cyber attack capable of producing significant effects is a cyber attack for which ample preparations have already been made at an earlier time . . . it is not a decision that one makes as the situation requires.”\nPLA writings indicate that China places a similar degree of emphasis on OPE as the United States. The 2015 book characterizes OPE as more demanding than network exploitation for espionage:“It is necessary to carry out careful and meticulous reconnaissance and scanning of the target, in order to obtain even more detailed, specific information about it. As such, we must carry out deeper reconnaissance and scanning of the target, [and] the extent of secrecy and concealment [of those tasks] far exceeds the extent of carrying out [those] tasks for computer network exploitation.”\nBut reconnaissance and scanning are only the first steps in preparations for an attack. The authors emphasize the importance of obfuscation throughout the various procedures required to prepare for offensive cyber operations: selecting and employing a method of gaining access to the target network, moving laterally through it, gaining privileges, and maintaining access. An intrusion can serve multiple purposes: “attack actions occur after the intrusion of computer networks, escalating privileges and exfiltrating all required data.”\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nPLA writings recognize that holding targets at risk for the purpose of deterrence also requires OPE. An article outlining principles of cyber deterrence authored by an unnamed Academy of Military Science expert in 2016 indicated that successful cyber deterrence, which included carrying out coercive and retaliatory attacks, required “complete and meticulous preparation in peacetime.” Those preparations included “long-term, sustained network reconnaissance” to become familiar with an adversary’s network situation, map the structure of its networks, and discover hardware and software vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be used to leave backdoors, set up “springboards,” and install logic bombs and Trojan horses “to retain points of penetration to launch future cyber attacks.”95\nPLA texts recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. The 2013 Science of Military Strategy published by the Academy of Military Science acknowledges that, “from a technological perspective, the principles of the task (gongzuo yuanli) of cyber surveillance and cyber attacks are essentially identical.” The book explains: “cyber surveillance means and methods are often also the means and methods of cyber attacks.” Furthermore, it highlights that cyber espionage can easily be turned into an attack: “According to the aspirations and intentions of the actor, it is possible to just press a key or initiate a sequence of commands, and the conversion between cyber surveillance and cyber attack is immediately completed.” The authors conclude that the relationship between cyber espionage and combat cannot be severed.96\nIn addition, OPE can erode the distinction between peacetime and conflict in cyberspace. The 2017 Science of Military Strategy published by the National Defense University indicates that, “compared to traditional domains, the boundary between war and peace in the cyber domain is fuzzier.” The book describes the lack of clear boundaries as follows: “cyber and electronic domain warfare already exists in peacetime; when war is imminent (linzhan) it becomes more intense; [and] often sustained confrontation directly merges into actual war.”97 These views are repeated in a revised edition of the book published in 2020.98 Two PLA authors affiliated with the former General Staff Research Institute argue that one reason for the blurred boundary between war and peace in cyberspace is that “‘backdoors’ and ‘exploits’ are pre-placed in an enemy’s network systems early; it is very difficult to determine from which moment war begins.”99 This view contrasts with US Cyber Command’s views of a clearer threshold of armed conflict in cyberspace.\nAs in the United States, PLA texts indicate that China intends to conduct offensive cyber operations. OPE will therefore likely be necessary to target the high-value military and civilian critical infrastructure networks that could contribute to crisis instability. A 2013 Academy of Military Science textbook\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\ndescribes “‘soft’ paralysis of the information network nodes of adversary warfare systems” that the PLA could implement alongside kinetic attacks and psychological operations in a future joint information operations campaign. The book indicates that the PLA would need to “completely analyze the structure and relationship of interconnections and restrictions among the adversary’s systems for command and control, intelligence and warning, and firepower attack (huoli daji), and their support and sustainment,” to select the appropriate means for offensive cyber attacks. Those means include offensive cyber operations that would require OPE: “systems intrusion, computer virus attacks, attacks to cut off servers, and network deception attacks.” The book indicates that PLA attacks would not be limited to military networks, but could also “infiltrate, attack, and paralyze the adversary’s important civilian networks (minyong wangluo xitong).”¹⁰⁰ The PLA has moderated its expectations of the ease and effectiveness of such attacks as it has learned more about offensive cyber operations over time.¹⁰¹ But has by no means taken them off the table, as demonstrated by its ongoing exploitation of Taiwanese critical infrastructure, and Indian critical infrastructure networks during the conflict along the Sino-Indian border in 2020.¹⁰²\n## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risk\nPLA texts do not discuss the danger of the OPE-espionage distinction problem and the risk of escalation if an intrusion is discovered in a crisis. It is unclear whether Chinese decision-makers have implemented procedures for managing inadvertent escalation risks posed by its cyber operations. Past PLA writings do not indicate that managing those risks was a priority in organizational procedures for cyber operations. This inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks specifically is surprising given that China has paid increasing attention to three other types of escalation risks: deliberate cyber attacks that could result in an adversary overreaction, unauthorized and accidental cyber attacks perpetrated by the PLA, and the potential for North Korean cyber attacks to be mis-attributed to China and draw it into a conflict with one of Pyongyang’s enemies.\nThe 2013 Science of Military Strategy indicates that “every country in the world is conducting cyber reconnaissance activities of differing degrees, but the possibility of this triggering a bilateral crisis, or a war starting because of this reason, is not high.”¹⁰³ The authors do not reconcile this observation with their observation that cyber surveillance and attack are indistinguishable. Similarly, the Academy of Military Science expert writing in 2016 warned of escalation risks from cyber operations that are too weak or too strong in their\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\neffects on an adversary. The expert called for unified control over all aspects of cyber operations but did not recognize the possibility that espionage could be misperceived as OPE and prompt an adversary to use force.¹⁰⁴\nChinese researchers writing for academic and policy audiences vary in their assessments of whether cyber operations in general contribute to crisis instability, but they also do not pay specific attention to the OPE inadvertent escalation pathway. Associate Professor Liu Yangyue at the National University of Defense Technology is generally sanguine about the effects of cyber operations on strategic stability. He dismisses the argument in Western literature that a state could escalate in response to an initial cyber attack to stop an adversary from conducting further attacks.¹⁰⁵ Drawing on the same observational data used in Western cyber security scholarship, he argues that “when they face cyber attacks (believed to come from their enemies), states do not inevitably make worst-case calculations in their style of behavior, or let this guide their policies for responding.”¹⁰⁶ Similarly, Li Bin and Zhao Tong report that:\nSome Chinese experts have challenged the popular view that cyber technology will negatively affect crisis stability, because they believe this conclusion is based completely on logical deduction, instead of empirical evidence. These experts have noted that states are usually very cautious about launching military retaliations to cyber attacks, and it is very rare for cyber attacks to lead to escalation.¹⁰⁷\nNevertheless, Liu does express concern about the escalation risks posed by the difficulty of attribution. Citing the example of the Solar Sunrise intrusion discovered prior to US airstrikes against Iraq in 1998, he argues that if third-party espionage or OPE “is coincidentally discovered during a military mission, or the attacker uses more sophisticated means to conceal their identity, then this kind of attack could become a fuse for an unintended crisis.”¹⁰⁸\nOther Chinese scholars are less sanguine about the escalation risks in cyberspace. But they tend to focus on the use-or-lose incentives to carry out cyber attacks early in a crisis or conflict, rather than inadvertent escalation due to the discovery of an intrusion.¹⁰⁹ PRC experts have also expressed concern about the US concept of “cross-domain deterrence,” which they interpret as threats to use conventional military operations (or even nuclear threats) to retaliate for cyber attacks.¹¹⁰ The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Ariel Levite and former PLA Col. Lyu Jinghua wrote in China Military Science that in a Sino-American conflict scenario, “one of the earliest and most destabilising venues for conflict would be cyberspace, thanks to the potential military utility of early employment of cyber assets.” Levite and Lyu acknowledge that “cyber\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\nactions in these scenarios also hold serious escalatory potential, complicating the challenges of keeping conflicts below the level of outright military confrontation.” They acknowledge the OPE inadvertent escalation risk, but only briefly: “intelligence operations to monitor these networks might be misinterpreted as attacks on them, or at least attack preparations.”¹¹¹\nIt is unclear whether PLA planning for offensive cyber operations accounts for the escalation risks associated with OPE and, if so, how those risks are managed. The PLA promulgated a new generation of doctrine in November 2020, the first update to its official doctrine since 1999.¹¹² Unfortunately, no information about their content was available at the time of writing. Up until at least 2015, official PLA doctrine for offensive cyber operations was likely covered by doctrine for information operations, which combined electronic, cyber, and kinetic attacks.¹¹³ PLA texts published before 2015 hinted that, in the future, the PLA might have operational doctrine for stand-alone cyber operations as well as joint information operations involving cyber attacks.¹¹⁴\nThe PLA established the Strategic Support Force (SSF) in 2015–2016, during one of the most significant set of reforms in its history. The SSF consolidated most existing PLA cyber offense, defense, and espionage units from separate parts of its former General Staff Department and services into a Network Systems Department within the Strategic Support Force. Before the reforms, the PLA General Staff Department’s Third Department was believed to be the primary organization for cyber espionage within the PLA, while the Fourth Department was believed to have primary responsibility for offensive cyber operations.¹¹⁵ The consolidation of the former Third and Fourth departments into one organization is likely to enable the PLA to better integrate cyber operations for espionage and attack.¹¹⁶\nThese new organizational arrangements for military cyber operations should in theory improve the ability of top leaders to recognize and manage the crisis escalation risks associated with OPE. One of the key effects, if not drivers, of the consolidation of Chinese military cyber forces into the SSF is to enable top military leaders to exercise stricter oversight over PLA cyber operations to prevent accidental and unauthorized cyber attacks.¹¹⁷ Indeed, PLA writings published around the time the SSF was created emphasize the principle of “unified command” (tongyi zhihui) of cyber offense, defense, espionage, and control, and both PLA and non-PLA cyber capabilities.¹¹⁸ Details of how this principle of unified command is implemented in practice are scarce. Moreover, the ability of the new command structure to manage escalation risks in practice might have taken a back seat to other force building priorities. For example, the PLA’s efforts to guard against unauthorized and accidental use of cyber operations is in tension with its efforts to recruit the best cyber talent from outside\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nof the PLA. The SSF's use of contractors may revive many of the problems with oversight of cyber operations that China's leaders encountered prior to the 2015–2016 reforms.^[119]^\nThe nature and extent of leadership oversight of PLA cyber operations are difficult to determine. It is possible that China has established a formal institutional structure for inter-agency vetting of military plans and operations that crosses civilian and military lines. Drawing on a PLA publication about cyber operations published in 2017, John Chen, Joe McReynolds, and Kieran Green observe that “peacetime planning and guidance of cyberspace operations . . . at the strategic level rest in the hands of such national network security leadership organizations as the [Communist Party] Cybersecurity and Informatization Commission, while planning and guidance during wartime are the responsibility of the [PLA] CMC Joint Operations Command Center.”^[120]^ In other words, a civilian Party body takes the lead in peacetime and the PLA’s Central Military Commission takes the lead in wartime. It remains unclear how this dual command structure functions in practice. Most importantly, it remains unclear whether and, if so, to what degree managing inadvertent escalation risks resulting from OPE is a priority for the military and civilian leaders with oversight over PLA cyber operations.\n## Capabilities for Managing Cyber Risk\nChina is developing cyber situational awareness capabilities, including attribution capabilities. But they likely lag behind the United States in its development of capabilities that could disambiguate between attackers and mitigate inadvertent escalation risks. An official white paper outlining China’s international cyberspace strategy published in 2017 indicated that:\n[China] will expedite the development of a [military] cyber force and enhance capabilities in terms of situational awareness, cyber defense, supporting state activities and participating in international cooperation, to prevent major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security, and maintain national security and social stability.^[121]^\nIt is difficult to assess the extent of improvement in China’s attribution and defense capabilities since adopting these priorities in 2015. The Chinese government’s procedures for defending its networks are unclear and it has not publicly attributed cyber attacks to another state. Nevertheless, in 2018 Xi Jinping acknowledged the deterrent effect of China’s improved capability to detect intruders.^[122]^ Some Chinese cyber security firms have begun to publicly\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\nattribute intrusions to known groups of hackers using industry identifiers.¹²³ They have also called for greater efforts to prevent OPE within critical infrastructure networks. For example, the Chinese company Antiy argued that China needed to “make progress in weakening the ability of an adversary to ‘prepare the battlefield’ in our industrial control [systems] and infrastructure to achieve [serious] consequences.”¹²⁴\n## Misperception in the Sino-American Cyber Relationship\nDo the United States and China have a shared understanding of the nature of cyber conflict, the role of OPE, and the potential for crisis instability because of the OPE-espionage distinction problem? Comparing US and Chinese approaches to cyber conflict reveals some similarities, as well as differences that could hamper future bilateral efforts to manage cyber escalation risks. Both countries recognize that OPE is necessary for sophisticated offensive cyber operations yet is indistinguishable from intrusions for the purpose of espionage, defense, or data theft. Both countries view the presence of nation-state hackers in their networks as threatening. But the two countries do not appear to share an understanding of the inadvertent escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem or the clarity of the threshold of an armed attack in cyberspace.\nThe comparison also reveals asymmetries in the relative maturity of cyber doctrine and capabilities in both countries. These asymmetries might explain the lack of attention to inadvertent escalation risks in China’s approach to cyber conflict. China’s doctrine, procedures, and authorities for conducting cyber operations appear to have been overhauled by the 2015–2016 PLA reforms and took some years afterwards to crystallize into their current form. As a result, the PLA has less experience integrating espionage, offensive, and defensive cyber operations and incorporating civilian oversight into its cyber operations than the United States. The PLA operational regulations promulgated in late 2020 might have included more guidance on OPE and managing its escalation risks that is not reflected in the sources examined here. Meanwhile, US cyber capabilities and strategy are relatively more mature. US organizations demonstrate growing confidence in attribution capabilities, the clarity of escalation thresholds, and US ability to control escalation from OPE or low-level cyber attacks. These factors have led to a doctrine for cyber operations that gives the military a freer hand.\nNeither China nor the United States appears to be overly concerned about its espionage activities being misperceived as OPE during a crisis, albeit for different reasons. On the one hand, China appears to be inattentive to the specific\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nescalation risks posed by OPE. On the other hand, the United States appears to be aware of the specific escalation risks associated with OPE but is confident that they can be mitigated. This suggests that both states might approach a crisis confident that their intrusions will not be discovered, misperceived, or lead to the use of force. The PLA's attention to the escalation risks associated with OPE might increase as Chinese cyber doctrine and capabilities further develop. But increased awareness is by no means a given. Chinese experts and writings on crisis management and nuclear strategy – areas where PLA doctrine and capabilities are more mature – have also tended to downplay drivers of inadvertent escalation.\nOf course, the lack of concern about the escalation risks associated with OPE could reflect a shared lack of concern that cyber attacks could cause much harm in a crisis, supporting the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. OPE may simply be accepted practice between these two countries.[125] They might expect that some of their key networks will be disabled by their adversaries' offensive cyber operations during future conflicts. They might prepare to fight without those networks instead of pre-empting cyber attacks that could disable them. We are cautious, however, about interpreting the evidence as confirmation of the bluster hypothesis. Evidence that China both acknowledges and shares US confidence that inadvertent cyber escalation risks can be managed – which we did not find – would have reduced the need for caution in interpreting the evidence in favor of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis.\n## Initiatives to Mitigate Misperceptions\nIn the absence of a shared understanding of cyber conflict, two initiatives could reduce the risk of inadvertent cyber escalation via the misperception pathway in a future Sino-American crisis: dialogue to ensure that both parties understand each other's approach to cyber operations, and a crisis communication mechanism specific to cyber operations. Dialogue and crisis communication could reduce the likelihood of either side misperceiving the other's cyber intrusion as OPE, or as confirmation of the other's hostile intentions, because of differences in their understandings of cyber conflict and operations.[126] Unfortunately, China and the United States do not currently have an official military cyber dialogue that could bridge some of the gaps in their understandings of military cyber operations before a crisis emerges, despite establishing official dialogues to enable cooperation in non-military areas of the cyber relationship in 2015. Nor do China and the United States currently have a mechanism in place for crisis communications dedicated to cyber matters. By contrast, the United States has a three-tier cyber communications protocol in\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\nplace with Russia that involves a direct line between the White House and the Kremlin.¹²⁷\n## Conclusion\nCould military cyber capabilities contribute to the outbreak of conflict in a future crisis involving the United States and China? Although our empirical analysis is unable to provide a definitive answer to this question, it provides enough evidence to suggest that inadvertent escalation could occur if one state discovered the other's cyber intrusions in a crisis. Over the past decade or so, the United States has made unilateral attempts to limit the risks of inadvertent escalation occurring, first with strict organizational procedures governing all cyber operations and later with more robust operational procedures to defend its networks. There is little evidence that China has taken similar steps to unilaterally mitigate inadvertent escalation risks from cyber operations. The bilateral cyber relationship also lacks the shared understandings of these risks, and mechanisms for dialogue in peacetime or communications in crises, that could improve crisis stability.\nEven a small probability of inadvertent escalation could have extremely serious consequences, given how destructive a Sino-American conflict could be and the variety of other escalation risks present in the relationship. Our empirical analysis could also support the claim that cyber capabilities do not pose a serious enough threat for decision-makers to use force – whether cyber or kinetic – to pre-empt or retaliate. However, in the absence of stronger evidence to support this bluster hypothesis, we do not dismiss the risk that the OPE-espionage distinction problem could add to crisis instability given the stakes at hand.\nThis chapter suggests that further research is needed to establish whether US confidence that cyber operations do not add to crisis stability is well founded. US adversaries' reluctance to escalate in response to cyber attacks or intrusions might reflect their countervailing strategic and political disincentives to escalate, rather than the stabilizing nature of cyber operations.¹²⁸ Brandon Valeriano, Benjamin M. Jensen, and Ryan C. Maness find that the United States has been successful in using cyberspace to coerce adversaries.¹²⁹ Scholars have pointed out that cyber operations are likely to have their greatest effects on international relations when combined with superior conventional military power.¹³⁰ The possibility that US conventional military power might mask the destabilizing effects of cyber operations suggests that the United States should be cautious as Chinese conventional military capabilities improve. If a Sino-American crisis had occurred during the past decade, Beijing would have\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nfaced strong countervailing pressures not to use force in response to a cyber intrusion, even if it judged that intrusion to pose a serious threat. Going forward, even if the PRC views an intrusion as a serious but manageable threat, its growing conventional capabilities and tense relationship with Washington could create an excuse for deliberate PRC escalation. And if the intrusion were intolerable, political and strategic disincentives could not be counted on to restrain China's leaders from using force.",

The ease with which the intrusion is discovered could also signal that the intruder intended to use it immediately and chose not to take the time to develop a stealthier presence.\n33.

Cunningham In the context of an increasingly competitive Sino-American relationship, US analysts are increasingly concerned about crisis instability, defined as the temptation for either country to use force rather than continue to bargain diplomatically during a crisis. Scholars and analysts focused on the US-China relationship have warned that cyber capabilities could add incentives for either the United States or China to use force in a crisis. Despite these concerns, there is no consensus among cyber scholars that offensive cyber capabilities contribute to the risk of great-power political crises escalating into conflicts.\nAs the previous chapter by Jason Healey and Robert Jervis has shown, certain features of cyber capabilities could create new pathways through which a great-power crisis could escalate into a conventional conflict.\nThis chapter examines one of these novel escalation pathways in the context of the Sino-American relationship: the difficulty of distinguishing between hacking for espionage and operational preparation of the environment (OPE), an essential precursor to most high-end cyber attacks. This OPE-espionage distinction problem creates pathways for inadvertent escalation, which occurs\"when a combatant deliberately takes actions that it does not perceive to be escalatory but are interpreted that way by the enemy,\"during a crisis or conflict. A state could correctly detect an adversary's OPE and, fearing an imminent cyber attack with severe consequences, choose to use force first, escalating the conflict with a cyber or even kinetic attack. But a state could also misperceive an adversary's efforts to collect intelligence via cyber means as OPE and pre-empt that attack with conventional or cyber attacks of its own. A state discovering that its adversary has intruded into its nuclear command, control, and communications networks during a crisis presents a particularly concerning scenario.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Despite these concerns, academic studies based on observational data, surveys, and simulations find little correlation between cyber attacks and escalation, either in peacetime or during conflicts.6 Scholars have reasoned that most cyber attacks are simply not destructive enough to worsen crisis or conflict outcomes.7 These limited effects, coupled with the bloodless, secret nature of cyber attacks, might instead open up new pathways for de-escalation and enhance crisis stability.8 However, the external validity of existing empirical findings to military crises among great powers is limited because no such crisis has occurred in the past two decades and they are difficult to replicate in surveys, simulations, and wargames.9 To evaluate the diverging concerns of the US policy community and the ongoing scholarly debates on cyber escalation and crisis instability among great powers, this chapter examines the escalation risks created by OPE in a future crisis scenario involving the United States and China. Scholars have already identified several sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship, including a systematic lack of attention among Chinese experts to inadvertent escalation risks in the nuclear, conventional, and space domains.10 A Sino-American crisis scenario is a most likely case for theoretical claims that cyber capabilities create novel escalation risks. Both countries would be most likely to react to any independent effect of cyber technology on their incentives to use force, if such incentives exist, in a crisis. Indeed, scholars have already raised concerns that cyber capabilities could fuel Sino-American crisis instability, although they have not examined the OPE-espionage distinction problem in much detail.11 To assess the escalation risks posed by this problem, we follow the methodological approach of scholars who have examined other sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship. Specifically, we examine the two countries' leadership statements, threat perceptions, procedures for authorizing cyber operations, organizational structures, capabilities, and policies for evidence that they create, recognize, and seek to manage escalatory risks.\nOur analysis suggests that inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE would be present in a future Sino-American crisis scenario. Official US policy for offensive cyber operations recognizes the escalation risks associated with cyber espionage being mistaken for OPE, but recent changes to US cyber strategy may increase these risks. Meanwhile, Chinese writings recognize the difficulty of distinguishing between cyber attacks and OPE but appear to ignore the consequences for crisis instability. We also find that a lack of mutual understanding in the Sino-American cyber relationship adds to the likelihood of the two countries misperceiving each other's behavior.\nOur empirical findings have two key limitations. First, our sources are scarce, imperfect, and some years old, especially on the Chinese side. We BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM follow best practices for using open sources to analyze Chinese military strategy, but caution is still needed when drawing conclusions from such sources. Nevertheless, these sources still make a valuable contribution to existing policy debates and scholarly research about cyber conflict, which rarely draws on Chinese perspectives. Second, our empirical findings could support the claim that cyber technology either does – or does not – add to crisis instability. Leaders from both countries might choose to ignore the escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem even if they are present. But neither country's relaxed approach to these risks is justified by a careful assessment of the independent effect of cyber technology on an adversary's incentives to use force in a crisis, which makes us hesitant to dismiss them.\nThis chapter begins with a brief explanation of OPE as a distinctive feature of cyber attacks. The second section outlines the competing hypotheses about cyber escalation in existing scholarly literature and the mechanisms that could link detection of an intrusion in a crisis with the decision to use force. The third, fourth, and fifth sections examine the evidence for these hypotheses in US documents and statements, Chinese writings and organizational practices, and the bilateral cyber relationship, respectively. The sixth section evaluates the escalation risks.\n## Operational Preparation of the Environment Performing OPE is essential to enabling significant cyber operations that could have strategic effects on the target.[12] To develop a cyber capability with a potent or customized effect on a target network, substantial reconnaissance and preparation are required from within that targeted network. In 2010, the Department of Defense defined\"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment\"as: Non-intelligence enabling functions within cyberspace conducted to plan and prepare for potential follow-up military operations. [Cyber-OPE] includes but is not limited to identifying data, system/network configurations, or physical structures... for the purpose of determining system vulnerabilities; and actions taken to assure future access and/or control of the system, network, or data during anticipated hostilities.[13] While cyber OPE has analogues in other forms of military operations – especially in the world of special operations and covert action – it differs from operations that are more familiar to policymakers, such as conventional and nuclear operations. Preparations to use cyber capabilities have different recon This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD naissance requirements than most other operations.¹⁴ Much of the development and preparation for a cyber operation requires access to or occurs within adversary networks. Moreover, the accesses and payloads that make offensive cyber operations possible are often specific to a particular network.¹⁵ Gaining and maintaining access to a target network is also generally difficult, resource intensive, and specific to the target network.¹⁶ Overall, the effects of an attack, the ability to sustain those effects over time, and the ability of an attack to limit unintended consequences all depend on how well the attacker has prepared and understood the target network and the likely actions of the network's defenders once the attack commences.¹⁷ A few examples illustrate the importance of OPE to sophisticated offensive cyber operations. Stuxnet was enabled by months if not years of reconnaissance, while Iranian hackers spent months inside the computer networks of Sands Casino and Saudi Aramco before they attacked in 2012.¹⁸ North Korean hackers did the same with their attacks on the computer networks of Sony Pictures.¹⁹ Russian hackers prepared in a similar way for their NotPetya operation, which reportedly inflicted over $10 billion in damage.²⁰ Some attacks, most notably denial-of-service efforts, do not fit into this trend, but lack potency as a result.²¹ OPE is also difficult to distinguish from espionage once it is discovered by a target. In theory, there might be ways for a target to tell whether an intrusion is espionage or whether it facilitates an attack. But there are no foolproof solutions to this OPE-espionage distinction problem. For example, an uptick in communication between the attacker and malicious code implanted in the target system could signal its purpose, but an attack could occur without any of those signals. Those signals could also accompany routine intelligence collection.²² Even if an attacker tries to use those signals to distinguish OPE from espionage, the target may not receive those signals or treat them as credible.²³ The nature of the target network may provide some hints – for example, critical infrastructure industrial control systems are more likely to be exploited for OPE than intelligence gathering – but this is not always the case.²⁴ Moreover, the exploitation of an adversary's networks for intelligence gathering could be repurposed for OPE without any tell-tale signs that the target might detect. For example, there is some evidence to suggest that the first blackout in Ukraine began with an espionage objective but later morphed into an attack operation.²⁵ ## The Novel Escalation Risks of OPE How and why could an intrusion discovered in the midst of a crisis between two great powers create incentives for the use of force?

Answers to these questions are key to understanding the potential for cyber operations to contribute to crisis instability -- or stability.\nWe define a crisis as “a confrontation between two states involving a serious threat to vital national interests for both sides in which there is the expectation of a short time for resolution, and in which there is understood to be a sharply increased risk of war.” We define escalation as “an increase in the intensity or scope of conflict that crosses threshold(s) considered significant by one or more of the participants.” In a great-power crisis, escalation would involve the use of force, with either cyber or kinetic attacks. We use the term “cyber escalation risks” to refer to an increased temptation to use force in a crisis due to the nature of cyber technology.\nIf decision-makers discover an intrusion into their key military or civilian networks during a crisis, most scholars agree that those decision-makers could not rule out the possibility that the intrusion enables OPE. The decision-makers' response to that discovery will depend on how they assess the seriousness of the threat posed by the intrusion and whether the state also has strategic or political incentives to use force. The interaction of these two factors suggests four possibilities: the inadvertent escalation and deliberate escalation hypotheses that expect the use of force, and the bluster and countervailing hypotheses that do not expect the use of force. We focus on the logic underpinning the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it best represents the concerns in current US policy debates about the destabilizing effect of cyber technology in a future Sino-American crisis.\n### Intrusion Detection in a Crisis The scenario in which OPE could trigger the use of force in a crisis would likely begin months if not years before the crisis. An adversary that wants the option to carry out offensive cyber operations in a future conflict against a state's important military or civilian networks would conduct OPE during peacetime. Once a crisis has begun it is almost certainly too late to complete this complex, time-consuming task.\nOnce a political crisis began -- for example, over an accidental collision between two rivals' military aircraft, the scenario that triggered the last Sino-American crisis in 2001 -- decision-makers in both states would have to decide whether to back down, bargain diplomatically, or bargain with the use of force. During their deliberations, the target state's decision-makers might discover their adversary's intrusions into important computer networks, including those that might be OPE. Such discoveries are more likely in a crisis PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD because states anticipate espionage and attacks in that context and will step up network defenses accordingly.³⁰ If target’s decision-makers decide it is most prudent to treat the intrusion as OPE, and they believe that the intrusion poses a serious threat, the OPE-espionage distinction problem creates an incentive to use force rather than bargain diplomatically.\nMore generally, the OPE-espionage distinction problem complicates the task of the target’s decision-makers charged with assessing the intent behind the intrusion. Motivations for the intrusion include OPE, monitoring the target’s military operations, or gathering intelligence about its offensive cyber operations.³¹ The specifics of the intrusion may provide some hints of intent but are unlikely to be definitive.³² Testing of small-scale attacks or an uptick in communication between the intruder and code it has implanted in the target system could also signal that it is OPE.³³ The intruder would also have difficulty reassuring the target state of its intent if the intrusion is for intelligence purposes.³⁴ To preserve its operational security, the intruder would have incentives not to acknowledge which adversary networks it has exploited and for what purpose, lest the target use that information to remove the intruder.³⁵ Even if the intruder sought to reassure the target of its intent not to use the intrusion to enable an attack, it would have trouble credibly committing not to use the intrusion for OPE in the future.\n## The Inadvertent Escalation Pathway The claim that cyber operations create incentives to use force in a crisis is a specific instance of a general claim that military operations and technology can cause misperceptions among adversaries with serious consequences for crisis stability and intra-war escalation.³⁶ One potential consequence of those misperceptions is inadvertent escalation. The canonical scenario of inadvertent escalation is a conventional war among nuclear powers in which one party conducts “large-scale conventional operations that produce patterns of damage or threat to the major elements of a state’s nuclear force.”³⁷ The target state interprets the attack as a deliberate attempt to degrade its nuclear force and responds by using nuclear weapons or accelerating preparations for their use.³⁸ Similarly, escalation to the use of cyber or kinetic force could occur in a crisis as an unintended consequence of the normal conduct of cyber espionage.\nMisperceptions commonly associated with the security dilemma are one reason that inadvertent escalation could occur.³⁹ Specifically, the difficulty of distinguishing between an adversary’s offensive and defensive military operations is sufficient to produce misperceptions about the intent of the attacking state within the target state.⁴⁰ The attacking state’s conventional military This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM operations could therefore make its adversary less secure in unintended ways,⁴¹ which creates an incentive for the target state to use force sooner rather than later.⁴² The target state need only calculate that its ability to achieve its conflict objectives will diminish in the future if it ignores the attacker’s actions in the present.⁴³ The OPE-espionage distinction problem could trigger the use of force if the target state’s leaders make worst-case-scenario assessments of the attacker’s intent and capability to damage an important information network. There are four mechanisms by which a state could make a worst-case-scenario assessment of the seriousness of the threat posed by an intrusion and decide to use force, whether a cyber or kinetic attack. First, a state that detects an adversary’s OPE might use force to pre-empt a cyber attack that could put the state at a military disadvantage in a future conflict.⁴⁴ Second, the combination of the crisis environment and the OPE-espionage distinction problem could lead the state to attribute aggressive intentions to the adversary with regards to both the network intrusion and the overall crisis, incentivizing the use of force.⁴⁵ Third, the discovery of an intrusion that might be OPE could affect decision-makers’ emotions in ways that make the use of force more likely.⁴⁶ Fourth, the uneven distribution of information about the nature of cyber operations in national security bureaucracies might make the use of force more likely when those bureaucracies discover intrusions in a crisis. Intrusions that some cyber specialists see as a routine part of cyber operations may alarm more senior generalists, especially in a crisis. Top decision-makers may not have sufficient knowledge or information to assess the risks posed by a cyber intrusion to their military capabilities.⁴⁷ ## The Deliberate Escalation Pathway States might assess that a cyber intrusion poses a serious but tolerable threat yet choose to use force in response because they have strategic and political incentives to escalate. Those strategic and political incentives usually involve gaining a military advantage, signaling resolve, or pre-empting an adversary’s attempt to signal resolve by using force.⁴⁸ Scholars have questioned whether states make decisions to escalate because of the independent effects of technology alone. Based on historical case studies, Caitlin Talmadge argues that new technologies might not force decision-makers to take escalatory actions, but rather “seem likely to be an intervening variable.” States seek out new technologies to enable them to increase the risk of escalation, or turn to them opportunistically in a conflict, rather than their hands being forced to escalate in a crisis because they did not anticipate the escalatory pressures created This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD by their prior decisions to deploy certain military capabilities.⁴⁹ These actions involve deliberate escalation: “[when] a combatant deliberately increases the intensity or scope of an operation to gain an advantage or avoid defeat.”⁵⁰ ## The Bluster De-escalation Pathway Decision-makers may decide not to use force if they discover an intrusion in a crisis – even if they are confident that the intruder has performed OPE – because they do not think the intrusion poses a serious threat. This “bluster” hypothesis suggests that cyber technology does not contribute to crisis instability and might even help to stabilize crises. It draws on existing empirical research which indicates that cyber attacks are perceived to be more bluster than bite. States and individuals tend not to retaliate in response to cyber attacks.⁵¹ One explanation for this empirical finding is that decision-makers do not view cyber attacks as sufficiently damaging or destructive to warrant the use of force in response.⁵² Applying these arguments to a crisis scenario in which an intrusion is discovered, decision-makers might calculate that the cost of the cyber attack is likely to be low and can be absorbed. This explanation suggests that states would not anticipate a military disadvantage from a cyber attack, contrary to the military disadvantage mechanism outlined above.\nDecision-makers might even view cyber attacks as a signal that an adversary wants to avoid a conventional conflict. When the effects of cyber and kinetic attacks are held constant, Jacquelyn Schneider and Sarah Kreps found that US survey respondents were less likely to support retaliation for cyber attacks than kinetic attacks.⁵³ Decision-makers might therefore interpret the discovery of an intrusion as a signal of an adversary’s intent to avoid crossing the threshold of conventional armed conflict,⁵⁴ rather than its hostile intent, contrary to the misperception mechanism outlined above.\n## The Countervailing De-escalation Hypothesis Finally, decision-makers might view the intrusion as posing a serious threat but have countervailing political or strategic incentives not to respond with the use of force. Decision-makers could react to an intrusion in this de-escalatory manner if they want to defuse the crisis because, for example, the stakes of the crisis do not merit fighting a war, or if they lacked the conventional military power to achieve their political objectives if a conflict broke out. Decision-makers with multiple adversaries might also be wary of mis-attributing an intrusion carried out by one adversary to another if they cannot attribute the intrusion to its perpetrator with sufficient confidence in the time frame of the This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM crisis.⁵⁵ Other countervailing incentives may also originate in domestic politics. The ambiguity of intent behind cyber intrusions could help more moderate decision-makers build a coalition for restraint in the crisis and counter pressure from decision-makers with more hawkish preferences.⁵⁶ ## Evaluating Cyber Escalation Hypotheses How might scholars determine which of these four hypotheses is most likely in a great-power crisis, when no crisis has occurred since China and the United States were both armed with military cyber capabilities? There is no perfect solution to this problem. To complement existing empirical studies, most of which capture US popular or elite views of cyber escalation, our approach focuses on capturing both US and Chinese elite views by examining their approach to cyber OPE, escalation, and military operations.\nOur empirical analysis is guided by observable implications derived from the four hypotheses. The inadvertent escalation hypothesis would expect states to express concern about any intrusions into their networks and to recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. States might also recognize inadvertent escalation risks and take steps to manage cyber escalation risks in their procedures, authorities, and organizational structures for cyber operations. Inadvertent escalation is also more likely to occur when two states have a poor understanding of each other's cyber activities and lack crisis communications mechanisms to verify the nature of an intrusion. The bluster de-escalation hypothesis would expect states that possess good attribution capabilities, defend their networks against intrusions, and effectively repel intruders who do breach defenses to be more relaxed about discovering intrusions into their networks. Not only might they be less likely to experience worrying intrusions, but they might also be able to better assess the intent and the severity of the threat posed by an intrusion.\nWhile it is difficult to describe the strategic and political incentives that could provide evidence to support the deliberate escalation or countervailing hypotheses in a future crisis, some ex ante features of a great-power relationship would shape those incentives. Deliberate escalation is more likely to occur when the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally stronger than its adversary, does not confront multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has high political stakes in the crisis. The countervailing hypothesis is more likely to find support if the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally weaker than its adversary, faces multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has low political stakes in the crisis. A scenario in which the conventional military balance is roughly equal and both states see the conflict as high stakes This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD would be the most likely case for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it minimizes countervailing political and strategic incentives to de-escalate if a threatening cyber intrusion is discovered in a crisis. A US-China crisis scenario is more evenly matched than most cyber dyads, although it would still involve some asymmetries in stakes and the conventional military balance that could obfuscate the independent effect of cyber technology on the temptation to use force in a crisis.^[57]^ ## Escalation Risks in US Cyber Operations US decision-makers recognize the inadvertent escalation risks posed by cyber operations, and OPE in particular, but they have taken steps to mitigate those risks. The Obama administration implemented organizational practices that carefully managed cyber operations that could produce escalation. The Trump administration relaxed those organizational practices after gaining confidence in operational practices. These practices provide evidence in favor of either the inadvertent escalation hypothesis or the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. As part of its more muscular approach, US Cyber Command has also concluded that most cyber intrusions could not produce serious enough effects to result in escalation. At first glance this judgment supports the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. But it could also support the countervailing de-escalation hypothesis. US adversaries might view its intrusions as very threatening but face disincentives to use force because of US conventional military preponderance.\n## Leadership Views of OPE The public statements of leaders and government reactions to discoveries of intrusions into military networks indicate that the United States views intrusions as threatening, in part because they could be used either for OPE or intelligence gathering. After a Russian hack of Pentagon systems in 2015 that the United States was able to repel, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter summarized the American position aptly when he said,\"[It] can't be good for anybody to be inside of our networks - whatever their motivation.\"^[58]^ Similarly, Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency (NSA) and US Cyber Command, and his adviser Michael Sulmeyer explained that the United States turned to a more aggressive policy\"to prevent toeholds from turning into beachheads so that a single compromise will not threaten the military's ability to accomplish its mission.\"^[59]^ While the details of most US responses to foreign hacking efforts are not public, two historical cases demonstrate that policymakers worried about the This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM implications of minor intrusions. In a 1998 hack known as Solar Sunrise, intruders penetrated the US military's logistics and communications networks. The Joint Staff general in charge of information operations, John Campbell, worried that the breach would permit significant attacks, especially at a time of heightened tensions with Iraq.\"If you take one part of that machine, and disable it,\"he said,\"you've got a real problem trying to make a deployment take place.\"60 Campbell's comments reflect an assessment that the intrusion could have placed the United States at a military disadvantage in a conflict. The discovery did not take place during a major crisis and therefore lacked the time pressure element that would create incentives to use force. Nevertheless, an investigation concluded the breach was the work of three teenagers and their 20-year-old mentor after various parts of the US government had already spun up to prepare for a response.\nA second incident, Moonlight Maze, occurred in 1998 and 1999 and involved Russian penetration of unclassified American networks. The US government hacked back into Russian computers to gain more intelligence.[61] One of the White House's top national security officials, Richard Clarke, labeled the activities\"cyberwar reconnaissance.\"[62] Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre indicated that the United States was\"in the middle of a cyber war\"to the Intelligence Committees of Congress during a classified briefing.[63] ## OPE in Cyber Operations US operators and decision-makers have recognized the need for OPE to conduct sophisticated cyber operations since at least 2010. The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a memo in 2010 mandating the use of the term\"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment,\"which referred to those cyber operations that serve\"as an enabling function for another military operation.\"[64] From the earliest days of the US Cyber Command, secret documents – now declassified – indicated that conducting OPE was one of its core tasks.[65] Planners at the highest levels of the US government eventually recognized the importance of OPE. During the Obama administration, the most significant high-level document governing America's offensive cyber capability was Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20). The president signed the classified document in secret in the fall of 2012. The White House released a fact sheet that made no mention of offensive cyber capabilities,[66] but the full classified document, leaked in 2013 by Edward Snowden, reveals a strategy that directly considers offensive action and contrasts it with other forms of cyber operations. The strategy lays out a clear typology of cyber activity. This includes\"cyber This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD collection,” which refers to intelligence-gathering activities for purposes other than offensive preparation. It also includes “non-intrusive defensive countermeasures,” meaning steps taken within one’s own network, such as deploying antivirus and other basic security measures. The document also introduces the concept of “Defensive Cyber Effects Operations,” defined as efforts that have an effect on an adversary’s computer systems – presumably, hacking or other interference – but only for the purposes of defense. PPD-20 provides high-level procedures for managing this kind of aggressive defensive action.⁶⁷ Most significantly, though, the classified version of PPD-20 defines offensive action in some detail. It introduces the concept of “Offensive Cyber Effects Operations” (OCEO), which are distinct from cyber collection, non-intrusive defensive countermeasures, or defensive cyber effects operations. Instead, these efforts are designed to cause effects in adversary networks.⁶⁸ The document extols the unique virtues of these kinds of offensive cyber operations, which “can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance U.S. national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging.”⁶⁹ PPD-20 acknowledges the need for OPE to realize these offensive options. It indicates that “the development and sustainment of [offensive cyber] capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist.”⁷⁰ PPD-20 directs the US government to begin this operational preparation. The relevant agencies “shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, [and] establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities.”⁷¹ With his signature, President Barack Obama authorized the preparatory activity.\n## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risks PPD-20 reveals US policymakers’ cognisance of the risks that arise from actually using offensive cyber capabilities. As a result, the document highlights a process to carefully manage offensive actions that might do serious harm or invite escalation. It emphasizes inter-agency coordination, balancing defense and national security interests with diplomatic and economic ones. Most notably, the process requires the highest level of executive branch oversight – presidential approval – for any cyber operation that is “reasonably likely to result in significant consequences.”⁷² This term is broadly defined: “Loss of life, significant responsive actions against the United States, significant damage to property, serious adverse U.S. foreign policy consequences, or serious This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM economic impact on the United States.”73 It is likely that cyber operations that do not meet that threshold could otherwise be approved by the agency carrying out the operation without such high-level inter-agency vetting.\nCrucially, PPD-20 does not limit these restrictions to cyber attacks but emphasizes that they apply to all cyber operations. In short, President Obama wanted direct oversight of any operation that might meet the threshold of significant consequences – regardless of whether that operation involved collecting intelligence, defending American computers, preparing an offensive capability, or launching an attack. The directive suggests that the Obama administration was concerned, at least in theory, about the risks of cyber escalation even as it appreciated the operational necessity to prepare offensive capabilities in advance.\nThe Trump administration adopted a more relaxed set of organizational procedures for managing cyber escalation risks. Upon unveiling its new national cyber strategy in 2018, the Trump White House criticized the preceding administration for what it saw as its overly cautious posture and promised to be more aggressive in its engagements with adversaries. Then-National Security Adviser John Bolton said, “Our hands are not tied as they were in the Obama administration.” Nor was the need for more aggressive action just a partisan view. In his confirmation hearing, the incoming NSA director and commander of US Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone warned that the United States had to do more because American adversaries “don’t fear us.”74 These views were translated into policy by President Donald Trump’s signature on “National Security Presidential Memorandum 13.” The goal of the memorandum, which remains classified, is to provide military commanders with greater flexibility to integrate cyber operations into their overall approach to warfighting and deterrence.75 By delegating this authority to the Pentagon, the Trump administration attempted to foster a faster and more aggressive process, one that would generate more operational effects more quickly. But this approach also rebalanced the trade-off between operational agility and whole-of-government coordination to manage cyber escalation risks in favor of the former. According to the general on the Joint Staff responsible for cyber operations, this change sharply contrasted with the Obama administration’s approach, which was “an interagency process that went through the National Security Council... to deputies’ committee to principals’ committee and [where], in effect, anyone could stop the process along the way.” Nor, he argued, was the distinction just semantics or bureaucratic minutia, but one that “makes all the difference in the world in terms of the speed at which you can move.”76 This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms It is unclear whether current US policy, set by the Trump memorandum, frees commanders to both prepare for and launch cyber capabilities. But there are hints that the memo and complementary legislative changes implemented by Congress provide a freer hand in developing the malicious code and gaining access to target networks required to provide commanders with offensive options. For example, in a media interview, the former deputy commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, indicated that changes to congressional legislation “freed us up to do some of the things, the operational preparation of the environment, that we were limited from doing outside of the counterterrorism mission and now can do much more broadly against all of our peers and competitors.” In addition, a New York Times story from June 2019 describes more aggressive American preparatory measures against the Russian power grid.\nOverall, the Trump administration was much less worried about the escalation risk associated with cyber operations than the Obama administration. The Biden administration appears to have largely continued this approach since taking office in 2021. Michael Daniel, the former coordinator for cyber security in the Obama White House, observed that the Trump administration was “willing to take more risks than previous administrations.” While the Trump administration's approach was untested in a crisis with a near‐peer competitor, it was informed by the US experience with cyber conflict over the past decade as well as the increasing risk tolerance of US decision‐makers. To justify its new posture, US Cyber Command has argued that “adversaries continuously operate against us below the threshold of armed conflict,” in what it described as a “new normal.” Moreover, the command argued that US efforts to counter this adversarial activity will not lead to retaliation in or outside of cyberspace that would cross that threshold.\nThese claims have been fiercely debated in the academic literature, with critics of the so‐called persistent engagement approach arguing that the new strategy could produce escalation. For example, some contend that the thresholds for armed conflict are not as clear as US Cyber Command has suggested. Others argue that persistent engagement creates too many red lines for adversaries and is therefore not a realistic means for shaping behavior. Nakasone and Sulmeyer responded to these concerns with reassurance that:“Cyber Command takes these concerns seriously, and reducing this risk is a critical part of the planning process. We are confident that this more proactive approach enables Cyber Command to conduct operations that impose costs while responsibly managing escalation.\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM # Capabilities for Managing Escalation Risks In the past decade, the United States has developed some of the world's most sophisticated cyber capabilities to better defend its networks, attribute intrusions, and expel intruders in peacetime. To better defend networks, the United States has invested in major systems, such as EINSTEIN 3, that aim to thwart intrusions. To improve rapid attribution of intrusions and increase situational awareness, the United States established various cross-agency working groups and bulked up teams within the NSA and US Cyber Command. To the extent that these capabilities are effective, they might mitigate cyber escalation risks by reducing the likelihood that intruders will successfully break into US networks and alarm policymakers who have to decide on how to respond within the compressed time period of a crisis. However, the compromise of SolarWinds network management system in 2021, which enabled Russian government operators to intrude into numerous US government systems for months without detection, suggests that defense and attribution capabilities are imperfect and do not eliminate the possibility of the United States discovering an intrusion during a crisis.\n# Escalation Risks in Chinese Cyber Operations There is little evidence to indicate that China has scrutinized the inadvertent escalation risks posed by OPE as carefully as the United States, although Chinese sources bearing on this question are older, scarcer, and less authoritative than those for the United States.83 This lack of attention could be evidence of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis, as it might reflect a judgment that cyber intrusions pose a manageable threat to China's leaders. But this lack of concern should be interpreted in the context of a relative lack of concern about inadvertent escalation risks posed by nuclear, space, and conventional military operations among Chinese experts. As such, we favor the interpretation of China's inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks as support for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis. Inattention to the inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE could help to realize such risks in a crisis for three reasons. First, China is more likely to misperceive US cyber intrusions. Second, it is more likely to overlook the ways that its own cyber intrusions could be misperceived. Third, China is much less likely to take steps to mitigate these risks. Available sources provide little insight into whether the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has put in place organizational or operational practices to manage inadvertent cyber escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Leadership Views of OPE Chinese policymakers' fears about foreign hackers have grown in tandem with the expansion of the Chinese government's and military's dependence on computer networks. In a major speech on national cyber security policy in 2016, Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping stated that, “Cyber security has a strong covert character; a technological vulnerability or security risk can stay hidden for a number of years without being discovered.” As a result, “we do not know who came in, whether it was an enemy or a friend, or what they did.” Xi implied that while this enemy or friend's intrusion could remain “latent” inside a network for a long time, it could be “activated whenever (yidan jiu fazuo le).”84 The Chinese government has not publicly acknowledged any specific incidents in which it discovered that foreign state actors had exploited its government or military networks. China's closest analogue to the Solar Sunrise and Moonlight Maze incidents was Edward Snowden's revelations regarding US government surveillance of Chinese computer networks. Snowden's revelations are often cited by the country's cyber security scholars as evidence of China's vulnerability and the inadequacy of its network defenses, which failed to prevent or detect US government intrusions. Chinese experts claim that the NSA also targeted the country's military networks.85 A Chinese cyber security firm reported that the CIA had spied on Chinese state‐owned enterprises but did not identify any government networks penetrated.86 There is no detailed evidence about how the Chinese government responded to any of these incidents, nor did they occur in the context of a major crisis.\nChinese writings examining US cyber operations can provide insights into how Chinese experts view these operations in the absence of open discussions about these topics in China. Chinese experts affiliated with the PLA note that OPE is one of the cyber missions outlined in US doctrinal publications but do not mention the crisis escalation risks that could result from the OPE‐espionage distinction problem.87 While the Trump administration's more muscular approach to cyber operations raised concerns among Chinese authors for its emphasis on pre‐emption and potential to spark arms race instability, those experts are less focused on crisis instability than US scholars.88 There are some recent exceptions. For example, former PLA officer Lyu Jinghua writes that “it is worthwhile to explore whether the tension in cyberspace can be de‐escalated or whether the chances of the breakout of crisis can be lowered if there could be a basic consensus among countries that cyber activities conducted or supported by countries during peacetime are a contest of intelligence rather than conflicts or preparation of conflicts.\nIt remains unclear whether Chinese decision-makers share the views of experts who worry about the escalation risks of OPE and whether those concerns have led to practices to mitigate those risks.\n### OPE in Cyber Operations Like US officials, PLA strategists also distinguish between cyber surveillance, offense and defense, and deterrence as the main styles of cyber struggle. PLA texts do not use the term “operational preparation of the environment” when describing PLA operations, but they do recognize that effective offensive cyber operations require extensive advance preparation. A 2015 book authored by experts from the PLA Army Engineering University, 54th Institute, and other PLA organizations acknowledges that significant advance preparations are needed to ensure that cyber operations can be used to diminish an adversary's combat power. While many methods of attack are available, “a cyber attack capable of producing significant effects is a cyber attack for which ample preparations have already been made at an earlier time... it is not a decision that one makes as the situation requires.”\nPLA writings indicate that China places a similar degree of emphasis on OPE as the United States. The 2015 book characterizes OPE as more demanding than network exploitation for espionage:“It is necessary to carry out careful and meticulous reconnaissance and scanning of the target, in order to obtain even more detailed, specific information about it. As such, we must carry out deeper reconnaissance and scanning of the target, [and] the extent of secrecy and concealment [of those tasks] far exceeds the extent of carrying out [those] tasks for computer network exploitation.”\nBut reconnaissance and scanning are only the first steps in preparations for an attack. The authors emphasize the importance of obfuscation throughout the various procedures required to prepare for offensive cyber operations: selecting and employing a method of gaining access to the target network, moving laterally through it, gaining privileges, and maintaining access. An intrusion can serve multiple purposes: “attack actions occur after the intrusion of computer networks, escalating privileges and exfiltrating all required data.”\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD PLA writings recognize that holding targets at risk for the purpose of deterrence also requires OPE. An article outlining principles of cyber deterrence authored by an unnamed Academy of Military Science expert in 2016 indicated that successful cyber deterrence, which included carrying out coercive and retaliatory attacks, required “complete and meticulous preparation in peacetime.” Those preparations included “long-term, sustained network reconnaissance” to become familiar with an adversary’s network situation, map the structure of its networks, and discover hardware and software vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be used to leave backdoors, set up “springboards,” and install logic bombs and Trojan horses “to retain points of penetration to launch future cyber attacks.”95 PLA texts recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. The 2013 Science of Military Strategy published by the Academy of Military Science acknowledges that, “from a technological perspective, the principles of the task (gongzuo yuanli) of cyber surveillance and cyber attacks are essentially identical.” The book explains: “cyber surveillance means and methods are often also the means and methods of cyber attacks.” Furthermore, it highlights that cyber espionage can easily be turned into an attack: “According to the aspirations and intentions of the actor, it is possible to just press a key or initiate a sequence of commands, and the conversion between cyber surveillance and cyber attack is immediately completed.” The authors conclude that the relationship between cyber espionage and combat cannot be severed.96 In addition, OPE can erode the distinction between peacetime and conflict in cyberspace. The 2017 Science of Military Strategy published by the National Defense University indicates that, “compared to traditional domains, the boundary between war and peace in the cyber domain is fuzzier.” The book describes the lack of clear boundaries as follows: “cyber and electronic domain warfare already exists in peacetime; when war is imminent (linzhan) it becomes more intense; [and] often sustained confrontation directly merges into actual war.”97 These views are repeated in a revised edition of the book published in 2020.98 Two PLA authors affiliated with the former General Staff Research Institute argue that one reason for the blurred boundary between war and peace in cyberspace is that “‘backdoors’ and ‘exploits’ are pre-placed in an enemy’s network systems early; it is very difficult to determine from which moment war begins.”99 This view contrasts with US Cyber Command’s views of a clearer threshold of armed conflict in cyberspace.\nAs in the United States, PLA texts indicate that China intends to conduct offensive cyber operations. OPE will therefore likely be necessary to target the high-value military and civilian critical infrastructure networks that could contribute to crisis instability.

CUNNINGHAM describes “‘soft’ paralysis of the information network nodes of adversary warfare systems” that the PLA could implement alongside kinetic attacks and psychological operations in a future joint information operations campaign. The book indicates that the PLA would need to “completely analyze the structure and relationship of interconnections and restrictions among the adversary’s systems for command and control, intelligence and warning, and firepower attack (huoli daji), and their support and sustainment,” to select the appropriate means for offensive cyber attacks. Those means include offensive cyber operations that would require OPE: “systems intrusion, computer virus attacks, attacks to cut off servers, and network deception attacks.” The book indicates that PLA attacks would not be limited to military networks, but could also “infiltrate, attack, and paralyze the adversary’s important civilian networks (minyong wangluo xitong).”¹⁰⁰ The PLA has moderated its expectations of the ease and effectiveness of such attacks as it has learned more about offensive cyber operations over time.¹⁰¹ But has by no means taken them off the table, as demonstrated by its ongoing exploitation of Taiwanese critical infrastructure, and Indian critical infrastructure networks during the conflict along the Sino-Indian border in 2020.¹⁰² ## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risk PLA texts do not discuss the danger of the OPE-espionage distinction problem and the risk of escalation if an intrusion is discovered in a crisis. It is unclear whether Chinese decision-makers have implemented procedures for managing inadvertent escalation risks posed by its cyber operations. Past PLA writings do not indicate that managing those risks was a priority in organizational procedures for cyber operations. This inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks specifically is surprising given that China has paid increasing attention to three other types of escalation risks: deliberate cyber attacks that could result in an adversary overreaction, unauthorized and accidental cyber attacks perpetrated by the PLA, and the potential for North Korean cyber attacks to be mis-attributed to China and draw it into a conflict with one of Pyongyang’s enemies.\nThe 2013 Science of Military Strategy indicates that “every country in the world is conducting cyber reconnaissance activities of differing degrees, but the possibility of this triggering a bilateral crisis, or a war starting because of this reason, is not high.”¹⁰³ The authors do not reconcile this observation with their observation that cyber surveillance and attack are indistinguishable. Similarly, the Academy of Military Science expert writing in 2016 warned of escalation risks from cyber operations that are too weak or too strong in their This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD effects on an adversary. The expert called for unified control over all aspects of cyber operations but did not recognize the possibility that espionage could be misperceived as OPE and prompt an adversary to use force.¹⁰⁴ Chinese researchers writing for academic and policy audiences vary in their assessments of whether cyber operations in general contribute to crisis instability, but they also do not pay specific attention to the OPE inadvertent escalation pathway. Associate Professor Liu Yangyue at the National University of Defense Technology is generally sanguine about the effects of cyber operations on strategic stability. He dismisses the argument in Western literature that a state could escalate in response to an initial cyber attack to stop an adversary from conducting further attacks.¹⁰⁵ Drawing on the same observational data used in Western cyber security scholarship, he argues that “when they face cyber attacks (believed to come from their enemies), states do not inevitably make worst-case calculations in their style of behavior, or let this guide their policies for responding.”¹⁰⁶ Similarly, Li Bin and Zhao Tong report that: Some Chinese experts have challenged the popular view that cyber technology will negatively affect crisis stability, because they believe this conclusion is based completely on logical deduction, instead of empirical evidence. These experts have noted that states are usually very cautious about launching military retaliations to cyber attacks, and it is very rare for cyber attacks to lead to escalation.¹⁰⁷ Nevertheless, Liu does express concern about the escalation risks posed by the difficulty of attribution. Citing the example of the Solar Sunrise intrusion discovered prior to US airstrikes against Iraq in 1998, he argues that if third-party espionage or OPE “is coincidentally discovered during a military mission, or the attacker uses more sophisticated means to conceal their identity, then this kind of attack could become a fuse for an unintended crisis.”¹⁰⁸ Other Chinese scholars are less sanguine about the escalation risks in cyberspace. But they tend to focus on the use-or-lose incentives to carry out cyber attacks early in a crisis or conflict, rather than inadvertent escalation due to the discovery of an intrusion.¹⁰⁹ PRC experts have also expressed concern about the US concept of “cross-domain deterrence,” which they interpret as threats to use conventional military operations (or even nuclear threats) to retaliate for cyber attacks.¹¹⁰ The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Ariel Levite and former PLA Col. Lyu Jinghua wrote in China Military Science that in a Sino-American conflict scenario, “one of the earliest and most destabilising venues for conflict would be cyberspace, thanks to the potential military utility of early employment of cyber assets.” Levite and Lyu acknowledge that “cyber This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM actions in these scenarios also hold serious escalatory potential, complicating the challenges of keeping conflicts below the level of outright military confrontation.” They acknowledge the OPE inadvertent escalation risk, but only briefly: “intelligence operations to monitor these networks might be misinterpreted as attacks on them, or at least attack preparations.”¹¹¹ It is unclear whether PLA planning for offensive cyber operations accounts for the escalation risks associated with OPE and, if so, how those risks are managed. The PLA promulgated a new generation of doctrine in November 2020, the first update to its official doctrine since 1999.¹¹² Unfortunately, no information about their content was available at the time of writing. Up until at least 2015, official PLA doctrine for offensive cyber operations was likely covered by doctrine for information operations, which combined electronic, cyber, and kinetic attacks.¹¹³ PLA texts published before 2015 hinted that, in the future, the PLA might have operational doctrine for stand-alone cyber operations as well as joint information operations involving cyber attacks.¹¹⁴ The PLA established the Strategic Support Force (SSF) in 2015–2016, during one of the most significant set of reforms in its history. The SSF consolidated most existing PLA cyber offense, defense, and espionage units from separate parts of its former General Staff Department and services into a Network Systems Department within the Strategic Support Force. Before the reforms, the PLA General Staff Department’s Third Department was believed to be the primary organization for cyber espionage within the PLA, while the Fourth Department was believed to have primary responsibility for offensive cyber operations.¹¹⁵ The consolidation of the former Third and Fourth departments into one organization is likely to enable the PLA to better integrate cyber operations for espionage and attack.¹¹⁶ These new organizational arrangements for military cyber operations should in theory improve the ability of top leaders to recognize and manage the crisis escalation risks associated with OPE. One of the key effects, if not drivers, of the consolidation of Chinese military cyber forces into the SSF is to enable top military leaders to exercise stricter oversight over PLA cyber operations to prevent accidental and unauthorized cyber attacks.¹¹⁷ Indeed, PLA writings published around the time the SSF was created emphasize the principle of “unified command” (tongyi zhihui) of cyber offense, defense, espionage, and control, and both PLA and non-PLA cyber capabilities.¹¹⁸ Details of how this principle of unified command is implemented in practice are scarce. Moreover, the ability of the new command structure to manage escalation risks in practice might have taken a back seat to other force building priorities. For example, the PLA’s efforts to guard against unauthorized and accidental use of cyber operations is in tension with its efforts to recruit the best cyber talent from outside This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD of the PLA. The SSF's use of contractors may revive many of the problems with oversight of cyber operations that China's leaders encountered prior to the 2015–2016 reforms.^[119]^ The nature and extent of leadership oversight of PLA cyber operations are difficult to determine. It is possible that China has established a formal institutional structure for inter-agency vetting of military plans and operations that crosses civilian and military lines. Drawing on a PLA publication about cyber operations published in 2017, John Chen, Joe McReynolds, and Kieran Green observe that “peacetime planning and guidance of cyberspace operations... at the strategic level rest in the hands of such national network security leadership organizations as the [Communist Party] Cybersecurity and Informatization Commission, while planning and guidance during wartime are the responsibility of the [PLA] CMC Joint Operations Command Center.”^[120]^ In other words, a civilian Party body takes the lead in peacetime and the PLA’s Central Military Commission takes the lead in wartime. It remains unclear how this dual command structure functions in practice. Most importantly, it remains unclear whether and, if so, to what degree managing inadvertent escalation risks resulting from OPE is a priority for the military and civilian leaders with oversight over PLA cyber operations.\n## Capabilities for Managing Cyber Risk China is developing cyber situational awareness capabilities, including attribution capabilities. But they likely lag behind the United States in its development of capabilities that could disambiguate between attackers and mitigate inadvertent escalation risks. An official white paper outlining China’s international cyberspace strategy published in 2017 indicated that: [China] will expedite the development of a [military] cyber force and enhance capabilities in terms of situational awareness, cyber defense, supporting state activities and participating in international cooperation, to prevent major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security, and maintain national security and social stability.^[121]^ It is difficult to assess the extent of improvement in China’s attribution and defense capabilities since adopting these priorities in 2015. The Chinese government’s procedures for defending its networks are unclear and it has not publicly attributed cyber attacks to another state. Nevertheless, in 2018 Xi Jinping acknowledged the deterrent effect of China’s improved capability to detect intruders.^[122]^ Some Chinese cyber security firms have begun to publicly This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM attribute intrusions to known groups of hackers using industry identifiers.¹²³ They have also called for greater efforts to prevent OPE within critical infrastructure networks. For example, the Chinese company Antiy argued that China needed to “make progress in weakening the ability of an adversary to ‘prepare the battlefield’ in our industrial control [systems] and infrastructure to achieve [serious] consequences.”¹²⁴ ## Misperception in the Sino-American Cyber Relationship Do the United States and China have a shared understanding of the nature of cyber conflict, the role of OPE, and the potential for crisis instability because of the OPE-espionage distinction problem? Comparing US and Chinese approaches to cyber conflict reveals some similarities, as well as differences that could hamper future bilateral efforts to manage cyber escalation risks. Both countries recognize that OPE is necessary for sophisticated offensive cyber operations yet is indistinguishable from intrusions for the purpose of espionage, defense, or data theft. Both countries view the presence of nation-state hackers in their networks as threatening. But the two countries do not appear to share an understanding of the inadvertent escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem or the clarity of the threshold of an armed attack in cyberspace.\nThe comparison also reveals asymmetries in the relative maturity of cyber doctrine and capabilities in both countries. These asymmetries might explain the lack of attention to inadvertent escalation risks in China’s approach to cyber conflict. China’s doctrine, procedures, and authorities for conducting cyber operations appear to have been overhauled by the 2015–2016 PLA reforms and took some years afterwards to crystallize into their current form. As a result, the PLA has less experience integrating espionage, offensive, and defensive cyber operations and incorporating civilian oversight into its cyber operations than the United States. The PLA operational regulations promulgated in late 2020 might have included more guidance on OPE and managing its escalation risks that is not reflected in the sources examined here. Meanwhile, US cyber capabilities and strategy are relatively more mature. US organizations demonstrate growing confidence in attribution capabilities, the clarity of escalation thresholds, and US ability to control escalation from OPE or low-level cyber attacks. These factors have led to a doctrine for cyber operations that gives the military a freer hand.\nNeither China nor the United States appears to be overly concerned about its espionage activities being misperceived as OPE during a crisis, albeit for different reasons. On the one hand, China appears to be inattentive to the specific This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD escalation risks posed by OPE. On the other hand, the United States appears to be aware of the specific escalation risks associated with OPE but is confident that they can be mitigated. This suggests that both states might approach a crisis confident that their intrusions will not be discovered, misperceived, or lead to the use of force. The PLA's attention to the escalation risks associated with OPE might increase as Chinese cyber doctrine and capabilities further develop. But increased awareness is by no means a given. Chinese experts and writings on crisis management and nuclear strategy – areas where PLA doctrine and capabilities are more mature – have also tended to downplay drivers of inadvertent escalation.\nOf course, the lack of concern about the escalation risks associated with OPE could reflect a shared lack of concern that cyber attacks could cause much harm in a crisis, supporting the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. OPE may simply be accepted practice between these two countries.[125] They might expect that some of their key networks will be disabled by their adversaries' offensive cyber operations during future conflicts. They might prepare to fight without those networks instead of pre-empting cyber attacks that could disable them. We are cautious, however, about interpreting the evidence as confirmation of the bluster hypothesis. Evidence that China both acknowledges and shares US confidence that inadvertent cyber escalation risks can be managed – which we did not find – would have reduced the need for caution in interpreting the evidence in favor of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis.\n## Initiatives to Mitigate Misperceptions In the absence of a shared understanding of cyber conflict, two initiatives could reduce the risk of inadvertent cyber escalation via the misperception pathway in a future Sino-American crisis: dialogue to ensure that both parties understand each other's approach to cyber operations, and a crisis communication mechanism specific to cyber operations. Dialogue and crisis communication could reduce the likelihood of either side misperceiving the other's cyber intrusion as OPE, or as confirmation of the other's hostile intentions, because of differences in their understandings of cyber conflict and operations.[126] Unfortunately, China and the United States do not currently have an official military cyber dialogue that could bridge some of the gaps in their understandings of military cyber operations before a crisis emerges, despite establishing official dialogues to enable cooperation in non-military areas of the cyber relationship in 2015. Nor do China and the United States currently have a mechanism in place for crisis communications dedicated to cyber matters. By contrast, the United States has a three-tier cyber communications protocol in This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM place with Russia that involves a direct line between the White House and the Kremlin.¹²⁷ ## Conclusion Could military cyber capabilities contribute to the outbreak of conflict in a future crisis involving the United States and China? Although our empirical analysis is unable to provide a definitive answer to this question, it provides enough evidence to suggest that inadvertent escalation could occur if one state discovered the other's cyber intrusions in a crisis. Over the past decade or so, the United States has made unilateral attempts to limit the risks of inadvertent escalation occurring, first with strict organizational procedures governing all cyber operations and later with more robust operational procedures to defend its networks. There is little evidence that China has taken similar steps to unilaterally mitigate inadvertent escalation risks from cyber operations. The bilateral cyber relationship also lacks the shared understandings of these risks, and mechanisms for dialogue in peacetime or communications in crises, that could improve crisis stability.\nEven a small probability of inadvertent escalation could have extremely serious consequences, given how destructive a Sino-American conflict could be and the variety of other escalation risks present in the relationship. Our empirical analysis could also support the claim that cyber capabilities do not pose a serious enough threat for decision-makers to use force – whether cyber or kinetic – to pre-empt or retaliate. However, in the absence of stronger evidence to support this bluster hypothesis, we do not dismiss the risk that the OPE-espionage distinction problem could add to crisis instability given the stakes at hand.\nThis chapter suggests that further research is needed to establish whether US confidence that cyber operations do not add to crisis stability is well founded. US adversaries' reluctance to escalate in response to cyber attacks or intrusions might reflect their countervailing strategic and political disincentives to escalate, rather than the stabilizing nature of cyber operations.¹²⁸ Brandon Valeriano, Benjamin M. Jensen, and Ryan C. Maness find that the United States has been successful in using cyberspace to coerce adversaries.¹²⁹ Scholars have pointed out that cyber operations are likely to have their greatest effects on international relations when combined with superior conventional military power.¹³⁰ The possibility that US conventional military power might mask the destabilizing effects of cyber operations suggests that the United States should be cautious as Chinese conventional military capabilities improve.

Going forward, even if the PRC views an intrusion as a serious but manageable threat, its growing conventional capabilities and tense relationship with Washington could create an excuse for deliberate PRC escalation. And if the intrusion were intolerable, political and strategic disincentives could not be counted on to restrain China's leaders from using force.",

Cunningham In the context of an increasingly competitive Sino-American relationship, US analysts are increasingly concerned about crisis instability, defined as the temptation for either country to use force rather than continue to bargain diplomatically during a crisis. Scholars and analysts focused on the US-China relationship have warned that cyber capabilities could add incentives for either the United States or China to use force in a crisis. Despite these concerns, there is no consensus among cyber scholars that offensive cyber capabilities contribute to the risk of great-power political crises escalating into conflicts.\nAs the previous chapter by Jason Healey and Robert Jervis has shown, certain features of cyber capabilities could create new pathways through which a great-power crisis could escalate into a conventional conflict.\nThis chapter examines one of these novel escalation pathways in the context of the Sino-American relationship: the difficulty of distinguishing between hacking for espionage and operational preparation of the environment (OPE), an essential precursor to most high-end cyber attacks. This OPE-espionage distinction problem creates pathways for inadvertent escalation, which occurs\"when a combatant deliberately takes actions that it does not perceive to be escalatory but are interpreted that way by the enemy,\"during a crisis or conflict. A state could correctly detect an adversary's OPE and, fearing an imminent cyber attack with severe consequences, choose to use force first, escalating the conflict with a cyber or even kinetic attack. But a state could also misperceive an adversary's efforts to collect intelligence via cyber means as OPE and pre-empt that attack with conventional or cyber attacks of its own. A state discovering that its adversary has intruded into its nuclear command, control, and communications networks during a crisis presents a particularly concerning scenario.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Despite these concerns, academic studies based on observational data, surveys, and simulations find little correlation between cyber attacks and escalation, either in peacetime or during conflicts.6 Scholars have reasoned that most cyber attacks are simply not destructive enough to worsen crisis or conflict outcomes.7 These limited effects, coupled with the bloodless, secret nature of cyber attacks, might instead open up new pathways for de-escalation and enhance crisis stability.8 However, the external validity of existing empirical findings to military crises among great powers is limited because no such crisis has occurred in the past two decades and they are difficult to replicate in surveys, simulations, and wargames.9 To evaluate the diverging concerns of the US policy community and the ongoing scholarly debates on cyber escalation and crisis instability among great powers, this chapter examines the escalation risks created by OPE in a future crisis scenario involving the United States and China. Scholars have already identified several sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship, including a systematic lack of attention among Chinese experts to inadvertent escalation risks in the nuclear, conventional, and space domains.10 A Sino-American crisis scenario is a most likely case for theoretical claims that cyber capabilities create novel escalation risks. Both countries would be most likely to react to any independent effect of cyber technology on their incentives to use force, if such incentives exist, in a crisis. Indeed, scholars have already raised concerns that cyber capabilities could fuel Sino-American crisis instability, although they have not examined the OPE-espionage distinction problem in much detail.11 To assess the escalation risks posed by this problem, we follow the methodological approach of scholars who have examined other sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship. Specifically, we examine the two countries' leadership statements, threat perceptions, procedures for authorizing cyber operations, organizational structures, capabilities, and policies for evidence that they create, recognize, and seek to manage escalatory risks.\nOur analysis suggests that inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE would be present in a future Sino-American crisis scenario. Official US policy for offensive cyber operations recognizes the escalation risks associated with cyber espionage being mistaken for OPE, but recent changes to US cyber strategy may increase these risks. Meanwhile, Chinese writings recognize the difficulty of distinguishing between cyber attacks and OPE but appear to ignore the consequences for crisis instability. We also find that a lack of mutual understanding in the Sino-American cyber relationship adds to the likelihood of the two countries misperceiving each other's behavior.\nOur empirical findings have two key limitations. First, our sources are scarce, imperfect, and some years old, especially on the Chinese side. We BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM follow best practices for using open sources to analyze Chinese military strategy, but caution is still needed when drawing conclusions from such sources. Nevertheless, these sources still make a valuable contribution to existing policy debates and scholarly research about cyber conflict, which rarely draws on Chinese perspectives. Second, our empirical findings could support the claim that cyber technology either does – or does not – add to crisis instability. Leaders from both countries might choose to ignore the escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem even if they are present. But neither country's relaxed approach to these risks is justified by a careful assessment of the independent effect of cyber technology on an adversary's incentives to use force in a crisis, which makes us hesitant to dismiss them.\nThis chapter begins with a brief explanation of OPE as a distinctive feature of cyber attacks. The second section outlines the competing hypotheses about cyber escalation in existing scholarly literature and the mechanisms that could link detection of an intrusion in a crisis with the decision to use force. The third, fourth, and fifth sections examine the evidence for these hypotheses in US documents and statements, Chinese writings and organizational practices, and the bilateral cyber relationship, respectively. The sixth section evaluates the escalation risks.\n## Operational Preparation of the Environment Performing OPE is essential to enabling significant cyber operations that could have strategic effects on the target.[12] To develop a cyber capability with a potent or customized effect on a target network, substantial reconnaissance and preparation are required from within that targeted network. In 2010, the Department of Defense defined\"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment\"as: Non-intelligence enabling functions within cyberspace conducted to plan and prepare for potential follow-up military operations. [Cyber-OPE] includes but is not limited to identifying data, system/network configurations, or physical structures... for the purpose of determining system vulnerabilities; and actions taken to assure future access and/or control of the system, network, or data during anticipated hostilities.[13] While cyber OPE has analogues in other forms of military operations – especially in the world of special operations and covert action – it differs from operations that are more familiar to policymakers, such as conventional and nuclear operations. Preparations to use cyber capabilities have different recon This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD naissance requirements than most other operations.¹⁴ Much of the development and preparation for a cyber operation requires access to or occurs within adversary networks. Moreover, the accesses and payloads that make offensive cyber operations possible are often specific to a particular network.¹⁵ Gaining and maintaining access to a target network is also generally difficult, resource intensive, and specific to the target network.¹⁶ Overall, the effects of an attack, the ability to sustain those effects over time, and the ability of an attack to limit unintended consequences all depend on how well the attacker has prepared and understood the target network and the likely actions of the network's defenders once the attack commences.¹⁷ A few examples illustrate the importance of OPE to sophisticated offensive cyber operations. Stuxnet was enabled by months if not years of reconnaissance, while Iranian hackers spent months inside the computer networks of Sands Casino and Saudi Aramco before they attacked in 2012.¹⁸ North Korean hackers did the same with their attacks on the computer networks of Sony Pictures.¹⁹ Russian hackers prepared in a similar way for their NotPetya operation, which reportedly inflicted over $10 billion in damage.²⁰ Some attacks, most notably denial-of-service efforts, do not fit into this trend, but lack potency as a result.²¹ OPE is also difficult to distinguish from espionage once it is discovered by a target. In theory, there might be ways for a target to tell whether an intrusion is espionage or whether it facilitates an attack. But there are no foolproof solutions to this OPE-espionage distinction problem. For example, an uptick in communication between the attacker and malicious code implanted in the target system could signal its purpose, but an attack could occur without any of those signals. Those signals could also accompany routine intelligence collection.²² Even if an attacker tries to use those signals to distinguish OPE from espionage, the target may not receive those signals or treat them as credible.²³ The nature of the target network may provide some hints – for example, critical infrastructure industrial control systems are more likely to be exploited for OPE than intelligence gathering – but this is not always the case.²⁴ Moreover, the exploitation of an adversary's networks for intelligence gathering could be repurposed for OPE without any tell-tale signs that the target might detect. For example, there is some evidence to suggest that the first blackout in Ukraine began with an espionage objective but later morphed into an attack operation.²⁵ ## The Novel Escalation Risks of OPE How and why could an intrusion discovered in the midst of a crisis between two great powers create incentives for the use of force? How and why might This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms decision-makers choose to use force when faced with those incentives? Answers to these questions are key to understanding the potential for cyber operations to contribute to crisis instability -- or stability.\nWe define a crisis as “a confrontation between two states involving a serious threat to vital national interests for both sides in which there is the expectation of a short time for resolution, and in which there is understood to be a sharply increased risk of war.” We define escalation as “an increase in the intensity or scope of conflict that crosses threshold(s) considered significant by one or more of the participants.” In a great-power crisis, escalation would involve the use of force, with either cyber or kinetic attacks. We use the term “cyber escalation risks” to refer to an increased temptation to use force in a crisis due to the nature of cyber technology.\nIf decision-makers discover an intrusion into their key military or civilian networks during a crisis, most scholars agree that those decision-makers could not rule out the possibility that the intrusion enables OPE. The decision-makers' response to that discovery will depend on how they assess the seriousness of the threat posed by the intrusion and whether the state also has strategic or political incentives to use force. The interaction of these two factors suggests four possibilities: the inadvertent escalation and deliberate escalation hypotheses that expect the use of force, and the bluster and countervailing hypotheses that do not expect the use of force. We focus on the logic underpinning the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it best represents the concerns in current US policy debates about the destabilizing effect of cyber technology in a future Sino-American crisis.\n### Intrusion Detection in a Crisis The scenario in which OPE could trigger the use of force in a crisis would likely begin months if not years before the crisis. An adversary that wants the option to carry out offensive cyber operations in a future conflict against a state's important military or civilian networks would conduct OPE during peacetime. Once a crisis has begun it is almost certainly too late to complete this complex, time-consuming task.\nOnce a political crisis began -- for example, over an accidental collision between two rivals' military aircraft, the scenario that triggered the last Sino-American crisis in 2001 -- decision-makers in both states would have to decide whether to back down, bargain diplomatically, or bargain with the use of force. During their deliberations, the target state's decision-makers might discover their adversary's intrusions into important computer networks, including those that might be OPE. Such discoveries are more likely in a crisis PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD because states anticipate espionage and attacks in that context and will step up network defenses accordingly.³⁰ If target’s decision-makers decide it is most prudent to treat the intrusion as OPE, and they believe that the intrusion poses a serious threat, the OPE-espionage distinction problem creates an incentive to use force rather than bargain diplomatically.\nMore generally, the OPE-espionage distinction problem complicates the task of the target’s decision-makers charged with assessing the intent behind the intrusion. Motivations for the intrusion include OPE, monitoring the target’s military operations, or gathering intelligence about its offensive cyber operations.³¹ The specifics of the intrusion may provide some hints of intent but are unlikely to be definitive.³² Testing of small-scale attacks or an uptick in communication between the intruder and code it has implanted in the target system could also signal that it is OPE.³³ The intruder would also have difficulty reassuring the target state of its intent if the intrusion is for intelligence purposes.³⁴ To preserve its operational security, the intruder would have incentives not to acknowledge which adversary networks it has exploited and for what purpose, lest the target use that information to remove the intruder.³⁵ Even if the intruder sought to reassure the target of its intent not to use the intrusion to enable an attack, it would have trouble credibly committing not to use the intrusion for OPE in the future.\n## The Inadvertent Escalation Pathway The claim that cyber operations create incentives to use force in a crisis is a specific instance of a general claim that military operations and technology can cause misperceptions among adversaries with serious consequences for crisis stability and intra-war escalation.³⁶ One potential consequence of those misperceptions is inadvertent escalation. The canonical scenario of inadvertent escalation is a conventional war among nuclear powers in which one party conducts “large-scale conventional operations that produce patterns of damage or threat to the major elements of a state’s nuclear force.”³⁷ The target state interprets the attack as a deliberate attempt to degrade its nuclear force and responds by using nuclear weapons or accelerating preparations for their use.³⁸ Similarly, escalation to the use of cyber or kinetic force could occur in a crisis as an unintended consequence of the normal conduct of cyber espionage.\nMisperceptions commonly associated with the security dilemma are one reason that inadvertent escalation could occur.³⁹ Specifically, the difficulty of distinguishing between an adversary’s offensive and defensive military operations is sufficient to produce misperceptions about the intent of the attacking state within the target state.⁴⁰ The attacking state’s conventional military This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM operations could therefore make its adversary less secure in unintended ways,⁴¹ which creates an incentive for the target state to use force sooner rather than later.⁴² The target state need only calculate that its ability to achieve its conflict objectives will diminish in the future if it ignores the attacker’s actions in the present.⁴³ The OPE-espionage distinction problem could trigger the use of force if the target state’s leaders make worst-case-scenario assessments of the attacker’s intent and capability to damage an important information network. There are four mechanisms by which a state could make a worst-case-scenario assessment of the seriousness of the threat posed by an intrusion and decide to use force, whether a cyber or kinetic attack. First, a state that detects an adversary’s OPE might use force to pre-empt a cyber attack that could put the state at a military disadvantage in a future conflict.⁴⁴ Second, the combination of the crisis environment and the OPE-espionage distinction problem could lead the state to attribute aggressive intentions to the adversary with regards to both the network intrusion and the overall crisis, incentivizing the use of force.⁴⁵ Third, the discovery of an intrusion that might be OPE could affect decision-makers’ emotions in ways that make the use of force more likely.⁴⁶ Fourth, the uneven distribution of information about the nature of cyber operations in national security bureaucracies might make the use of force more likely when those bureaucracies discover intrusions in a crisis. Intrusions that some cyber specialists see as a routine part of cyber operations may alarm more senior generalists, especially in a crisis. Top decision-makers may not have sufficient knowledge or information to assess the risks posed by a cyber intrusion to their military capabilities.⁴⁷ ## The Deliberate Escalation Pathway States might assess that a cyber intrusion poses a serious but tolerable threat yet choose to use force in response because they have strategic and political incentives to escalate. Those strategic and political incentives usually involve gaining a military advantage, signaling resolve, or pre-empting an adversary’s attempt to signal resolve by using force.⁴⁸ Scholars have questioned whether states make decisions to escalate because of the independent effects of technology alone. Based on historical case studies, Caitlin Talmadge argues that new technologies might not force decision-makers to take escalatory actions, but rather “seem likely to be an intervening variable.” States seek out new technologies to enable them to increase the risk of escalation, or turn to them opportunistically in a conflict, rather than their hands being forced to escalate in a crisis because they did not anticipate the escalatory pressures created This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD by their prior decisions to deploy certain military capabilities.⁴⁹ These actions involve deliberate escalation: “[when] a combatant deliberately increases the intensity or scope of an operation to gain an advantage or avoid defeat.”⁵⁰ ## The Bluster De-escalation Pathway Decision-makers may decide not to use force if they discover an intrusion in a crisis – even if they are confident that the intruder has performed OPE – because they do not think the intrusion poses a serious threat. This “bluster” hypothesis suggests that cyber technology does not contribute to crisis instability and might even help to stabilize crises. It draws on existing empirical research which indicates that cyber attacks are perceived to be more bluster than bite. States and individuals tend not to retaliate in response to cyber attacks.⁵¹ One explanation for this empirical finding is that decision-makers do not view cyber attacks as sufficiently damaging or destructive to warrant the use of force in response.⁵² Applying these arguments to a crisis scenario in which an intrusion is discovered, decision-makers might calculate that the cost of the cyber attack is likely to be low and can be absorbed. This explanation suggests that states would not anticipate a military disadvantage from a cyber attack, contrary to the military disadvantage mechanism outlined above.\nDecision-makers might even view cyber attacks as a signal that an adversary wants to avoid a conventional conflict. When the effects of cyber and kinetic attacks are held constant, Jacquelyn Schneider and Sarah Kreps found that US survey respondents were less likely to support retaliation for cyber attacks than kinetic attacks.⁵³ Decision-makers might therefore interpret the discovery of an intrusion as a signal of an adversary’s intent to avoid crossing the threshold of conventional armed conflict,⁵⁴ rather than its hostile intent, contrary to the misperception mechanism outlined above.\n## The Countervailing De-escalation Hypothesis Finally, decision-makers might view the intrusion as posing a serious threat but have countervailing political or strategic incentives not to respond with the use of force. Decision-makers could react to an intrusion in this de-escalatory manner if they want to defuse the crisis because, for example, the stakes of the crisis do not merit fighting a war, or if they lacked the conventional military power to achieve their political objectives if a conflict broke out. Decision-makers with multiple adversaries might also be wary of mis-attributing an intrusion carried out by one adversary to another if they cannot attribute the intrusion to its perpetrator with sufficient confidence in the time frame of the This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM crisis.⁵⁵ Other countervailing incentives may also originate in domestic politics. The ambiguity of intent behind cyber intrusions could help more moderate decision-makers build a coalition for restraint in the crisis and counter pressure from decision-makers with more hawkish preferences.⁵⁶ ## Evaluating Cyber Escalation Hypotheses How might scholars determine which of these four hypotheses is most likely in a great-power crisis, when no crisis has occurred since China and the United States were both armed with military cyber capabilities? There is no perfect solution to this problem. To complement existing empirical studies, most of which capture US popular or elite views of cyber escalation, our approach focuses on capturing both US and Chinese elite views by examining their approach to cyber OPE, escalation, and military operations.\nOur empirical analysis is guided by observable implications derived from the four hypotheses. The inadvertent escalation hypothesis would expect states to express concern about any intrusions into their networks and to recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. States might also recognize inadvertent escalation risks and take steps to manage cyber escalation risks in their procedures, authorities, and organizational structures for cyber operations. Inadvertent escalation is also more likely to occur when two states have a poor understanding of each other's cyber activities and lack crisis communications mechanisms to verify the nature of an intrusion. The bluster de-escalation hypothesis would expect states that possess good attribution capabilities, defend their networks against intrusions, and effectively repel intruders who do breach defenses to be more relaxed about discovering intrusions into their networks. Not only might they be less likely to experience worrying intrusions, but they might also be able to better assess the intent and the severity of the threat posed by an intrusion.\nWhile it is difficult to describe the strategic and political incentives that could provide evidence to support the deliberate escalation or countervailing hypotheses in a future crisis, some ex ante features of a great-power relationship would shape those incentives. Deliberate escalation is more likely to occur when the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally stronger than its adversary, does not confront multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has high political stakes in the crisis. The countervailing hypothesis is more likely to find support if the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally weaker than its adversary, faces multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has low political stakes in the crisis. A scenario in which the conventional military balance is roughly equal and both states see the conflict as high stakes This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD would be the most likely case for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it minimizes countervailing political and strategic incentives to de-escalate if a threatening cyber intrusion is discovered in a crisis. A US-China crisis scenario is more evenly matched than most cyber dyads, although it would still involve some asymmetries in stakes and the conventional military balance that could obfuscate the independent effect of cyber technology on the temptation to use force in a crisis.^[57]^ ## Escalation Risks in US Cyber Operations US decision-makers recognize the inadvertent escalation risks posed by cyber operations, and OPE in particular, but they have taken steps to mitigate those risks. The Obama administration implemented organizational practices that carefully managed cyber operations that could produce escalation. The Trump administration relaxed those organizational practices after gaining confidence in operational practices. These practices provide evidence in favor of either the inadvertent escalation hypothesis or the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. As part of its more muscular approach, US Cyber Command has also concluded that most cyber intrusions could not produce serious enough effects to result in escalation. At first glance this judgment supports the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. But it could also support the countervailing de-escalation hypothesis. US adversaries might view its intrusions as very threatening but face disincentives to use force because of US conventional military preponderance.\n## Leadership Views of OPE The public statements of leaders and government reactions to discoveries of intrusions into military networks indicate that the United States views intrusions as threatening, in part because they could be used either for OPE or intelligence gathering. After a Russian hack of Pentagon systems in 2015 that the United States was able to repel, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter summarized the American position aptly when he said,\"[It] can't be good for anybody to be inside of our networks - whatever their motivation.\"^[58]^ Similarly, Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency (NSA) and US Cyber Command, and his adviser Michael Sulmeyer explained that the United States turned to a more aggressive policy\"to prevent toeholds from turning into beachheads so that a single compromise will not threaten the military's ability to accomplish its mission.\"^[59]^ While the details of most US responses to foreign hacking efforts are not public, two historical cases demonstrate that policymakers worried about the This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM implications of minor intrusions. In a 1998 hack known as Solar Sunrise, intruders penetrated the US military's logistics and communications networks. The Joint Staff general in charge of information operations, John Campbell, worried that the breach would permit significant attacks, especially at a time of heightened tensions with Iraq.\"If you take one part of that machine, and disable it,\"he said,\"you've got a real problem trying to make a deployment take place.\"60 Campbell's comments reflect an assessment that the intrusion could have placed the United States at a military disadvantage in a conflict. The discovery did not take place during a major crisis and therefore lacked the time pressure element that would create incentives to use force. Nevertheless, an investigation concluded the breach was the work of three teenagers and their 20-year-old mentor after various parts of the US government had already spun up to prepare for a response.\nA second incident, Moonlight Maze, occurred in 1998 and 1999 and involved Russian penetration of unclassified American networks. The US government hacked back into Russian computers to gain more intelligence.[61] One of the White House's top national security officials, Richard Clarke, labeled the activities\"cyberwar reconnaissance.\"[62] Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre indicated that the United States was\"in the middle of a cyber war\"to the Intelligence Committees of Congress during a classified briefing.[63] ## OPE in Cyber Operations US operators and decision-makers have recognized the need for OPE to conduct sophisticated cyber operations since at least 2010. The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a memo in 2010 mandating the use of the term\"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment,\"which referred to those cyber operations that serve\"as an enabling function for another military operation.\"[64] From the earliest days of the US Cyber Command, secret documents – now declassified – indicated that conducting OPE was one of its core tasks.[65] Planners at the highest levels of the US government eventually recognized the importance of OPE. During the Obama administration, the most significant high-level document governing America's offensive cyber capability was Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20). The president signed the classified document in secret in the fall of 2012. The White House released a fact sheet that made no mention of offensive cyber capabilities,[66] but the full classified document, leaked in 2013 by Edward Snowden, reveals a strategy that directly considers offensive action and contrasts it with other forms of cyber operations. The strategy lays out a clear typology of cyber activity. This includes\"cyber This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD collection,” which refers to intelligence-gathering activities for purposes other than offensive preparation. It also includes “non-intrusive defensive countermeasures,” meaning steps taken within one’s own network, such as deploying antivirus and other basic security measures. The document also introduces the concept of “Defensive Cyber Effects Operations,” defined as efforts that have an effect on an adversary’s computer systems – presumably, hacking or other interference – but only for the purposes of defense. PPD-20 provides high-level procedures for managing this kind of aggressive defensive action.⁶⁷ Most significantly, though, the classified version of PPD-20 defines offensive action in some detail. It introduces the concept of “Offensive Cyber Effects Operations” (OCEO), which are distinct from cyber collection, non-intrusive defensive countermeasures, or defensive cyber effects operations. Instead, these efforts are designed to cause effects in adversary networks.⁶⁸ The document extols the unique virtues of these kinds of offensive cyber operations, which “can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance U.S. national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging.”⁶⁹ PPD-20 acknowledges the need for OPE to realize these offensive options. It indicates that “the development and sustainment of [offensive cyber] capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist.”⁷⁰ PPD-20 directs the US government to begin this operational preparation. The relevant agencies “shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, [and] establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities.”⁷¹ With his signature, President Barack Obama authorized the preparatory activity.\n## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risks PPD-20 reveals US policymakers’ cognisance of the risks that arise from actually using offensive cyber capabilities. As a result, the document highlights a process to carefully manage offensive actions that might do serious harm or invite escalation. It emphasizes inter-agency coordination, balancing defense and national security interests with diplomatic and economic ones. Most notably, the process requires the highest level of executive branch oversight – presidential approval – for any cyber operation that is “reasonably likely to result in significant consequences.”⁷² This term is broadly defined: “Loss of life, significant responsive actions against the United States, significant damage to property, serious adverse U.S. foreign policy consequences, or serious This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM economic impact on the United States.”73 It is likely that cyber operations that do not meet that threshold could otherwise be approved by the agency carrying out the operation without such high-level inter-agency vetting.\nCrucially, PPD-20 does not limit these restrictions to cyber attacks but emphasizes that they apply to all cyber operations. In short, President Obama wanted direct oversight of any operation that might meet the threshold of significant consequences – regardless of whether that operation involved collecting intelligence, defending American computers, preparing an offensive capability, or launching an attack. The directive suggests that the Obama administration was concerned, at least in theory, about the risks of cyber escalation even as it appreciated the operational necessity to prepare offensive capabilities in advance.\nThe Trump administration adopted a more relaxed set of organizational procedures for managing cyber escalation risks. Upon unveiling its new national cyber strategy in 2018, the Trump White House criticized the preceding administration for what it saw as its overly cautious posture and promised to be more aggressive in its engagements with adversaries. Then-National Security Adviser John Bolton said, “Our hands are not tied as they were in the Obama administration.” Nor was the need for more aggressive action just a partisan view. In his confirmation hearing, the incoming NSA director and commander of US Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone warned that the United States had to do more because American adversaries “don’t fear us.”74 These views were translated into policy by President Donald Trump’s signature on “National Security Presidential Memorandum 13.” The goal of the memorandum, which remains classified, is to provide military commanders with greater flexibility to integrate cyber operations into their overall approach to warfighting and deterrence.75 By delegating this authority to the Pentagon, the Trump administration attempted to foster a faster and more aggressive process, one that would generate more operational effects more quickly. But this approach also rebalanced the trade-off between operational agility and whole-of-government coordination to manage cyber escalation risks in favor of the former. According to the general on the Joint Staff responsible for cyber operations, this change sharply contrasted with the Obama administration’s approach, which was “an interagency process that went through the National Security Council... to deputies’ committee to principals’ committee and [where], in effect, anyone could stop the process along the way.” Nor, he argued, was the distinction just semantics or bureaucratic minutia, but one that “makes all the difference in the world in terms of the speed at which you can move.”76 This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms It is unclear whether current US policy, set by the Trump memorandum, frees commanders to both prepare for and launch cyber capabilities. But there are hints that the memo and complementary legislative changes implemented by Congress provide a freer hand in developing the malicious code and gaining access to target networks required to provide commanders with offensive options. For example, in a media interview, the former deputy commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, indicated that changes to congressional legislation “freed us up to do some of the things, the operational preparation of the environment, that we were limited from doing outside of the counterterrorism mission and now can do much more broadly against all of our peers and competitors.” In addition, a New York Times story from June 2019 describes more aggressive American preparatory measures against the Russian power grid.\nOverall, the Trump administration was much less worried about the escalation risk associated with cyber operations than the Obama administration. The Biden administration appears to have largely continued this approach since taking office in 2021. Michael Daniel, the former coordinator for cyber security in the Obama White House, observed that the Trump administration was “willing to take more risks than previous administrations.” While the Trump administration's approach was untested in a crisis with a near‐peer competitor, it was informed by the US experience with cyber conflict over the past decade as well as the increasing risk tolerance of US decision‐makers. To justify its new posture, US Cyber Command has argued that “adversaries continuously operate against us below the threshold of armed conflict,” in what it described as a “new normal.” Moreover, the command argued that US efforts to counter this adversarial activity will not lead to retaliation in or outside of cyberspace that would cross that threshold.\nThese claims have been fiercely debated in the academic literature, with critics of the so‐called persistent engagement approach arguing that the new strategy could produce escalation. For example, some contend that the thresholds for armed conflict are not as clear as US Cyber Command has suggested. Others argue that persistent engagement creates too many red lines for adversaries and is therefore not a realistic means for shaping behavior. Nakasone and Sulmeyer responded to these concerns with reassurance that:“Cyber Command takes these concerns seriously, and reducing this risk is a critical part of the planning process. We are confident that this more proactive approach enables Cyber Command to conduct operations that impose costs while responsibly managing escalation.\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM # Capabilities for Managing Escalation Risks In the past decade, the United States has developed some of the world's most sophisticated cyber capabilities to better defend its networks, attribute intrusions, and expel intruders in peacetime. To better defend networks, the United States has invested in major systems, such as EINSTEIN 3, that aim to thwart intrusions. To improve rapid attribution of intrusions and increase situational awareness, the United States established various cross-agency working groups and bulked up teams within the NSA and US Cyber Command. To the extent that these capabilities are effective, they might mitigate cyber escalation risks by reducing the likelihood that intruders will successfully break into US networks and alarm policymakers who have to decide on how to respond within the compressed time period of a crisis. However, the compromise of SolarWinds network management system in 2021, which enabled Russian government operators to intrude into numerous US government systems for months without detection, suggests that defense and attribution capabilities are imperfect and do not eliminate the possibility of the United States discovering an intrusion during a crisis.\n# Escalation Risks in Chinese Cyber Operations There is little evidence to indicate that China has scrutinized the inadvertent escalation risks posed by OPE as carefully as the United States, although Chinese sources bearing on this question are older, scarcer, and less authoritative than those for the United States.83 This lack of attention could be evidence of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis, as it might reflect a judgment that cyber intrusions pose a manageable threat to China's leaders. But this lack of concern should be interpreted in the context of a relative lack of concern about inadvertent escalation risks posed by nuclear, space, and conventional military operations among Chinese experts. As such, we favor the interpretation of China's inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks as support for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis. Inattention to the inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE could help to realize such risks in a crisis for three reasons. First, China is more likely to misperceive US cyber intrusions. Second, it is more likely to overlook the ways that its own cyber intrusions could be misperceived. Third, China is much less likely to take steps to mitigate these risks. Available sources provide little insight into whether the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has put in place organizational or operational practices to manage inadvertent cyber escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Leadership Views of OPE Chinese policymakers' fears about foreign hackers have grown in tandem with the expansion of the Chinese government's and military's dependence on computer networks. In a major speech on national cyber security policy in 2016, Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping stated that, “Cyber security has a strong covert character; a technological vulnerability or security risk can stay hidden for a number of years without being discovered.” As a result, “we do not know who came in, whether it was an enemy or a friend, or what they did.” Xi implied that while this enemy or friend's intrusion could remain “latent” inside a network for a long time, it could be “activated whenever (yidan jiu fazuo le).”84 The Chinese government has not publicly acknowledged any specific incidents in which it discovered that foreign state actors had exploited its government or military networks. China's closest analogue to the Solar Sunrise and Moonlight Maze incidents was Edward Snowden's revelations regarding US government surveillance of Chinese computer networks. Snowden's revelations are often cited by the country's cyber security scholars as evidence of China's vulnerability and the inadequacy of its network defenses, which failed to prevent or detect US government intrusions. Chinese experts claim that the NSA also targeted the country's military networks.85 A Chinese cyber security firm reported that the CIA had spied on Chinese state‐owned enterprises but did not identify any government networks penetrated.86 There is no detailed evidence about how the Chinese government responded to any of these incidents, nor did they occur in the context of a major crisis.\nChinese writings examining US cyber operations can provide insights into how Chinese experts view these operations in the absence of open discussions about these topics in China. Chinese experts affiliated with the PLA note that OPE is one of the cyber missions outlined in US doctrinal publications but do not mention the crisis escalation risks that could result from the OPE‐espionage distinction problem.87 While the Trump administration's more muscular approach to cyber operations raised concerns among Chinese authors for its emphasis on pre‐emption and potential to spark arms race instability, those experts are less focused on crisis instability than US scholars.88 There are some recent exceptions. For example, former PLA officer Lyu Jinghua writes that “it is worthwhile to explore whether the tension in cyberspace can be de‐escalated or whether the chances of the breakout of crisis can be lowered if there could be a basic consensus among countries that cyber activities conducted or supported by countries during peacetime are a contest of intelligence rather than conflicts or preparation of conflicts.\nIt remains unclear whether Chinese decision-makers share the views of experts who worry about the escalation risks of OPE and whether those concerns have led to practices to mitigate those risks.\n### OPE in Cyber Operations Like US officials, PLA strategists also distinguish between cyber surveillance, offense and defense, and deterrence as the main styles of cyber struggle. PLA texts do not use the term “operational preparation of the environment” when describing PLA operations, but they do recognize that effective offensive cyber operations require extensive advance preparation. A 2015 book authored by experts from the PLA Army Engineering University, 54th Institute, and other PLA organizations acknowledges that significant advance preparations are needed to ensure that cyber operations can be used to diminish an adversary's combat power. While many methods of attack are available, “a cyber attack capable of producing significant effects is a cyber attack for which ample preparations have already been made at an earlier time... it is not a decision that one makes as the situation requires.”\nPLA writings indicate that China places a similar degree of emphasis on OPE as the United States. The 2015 book characterizes OPE as more demanding than network exploitation for espionage:“It is necessary to carry out careful and meticulous reconnaissance and scanning of the target, in order to obtain even more detailed, specific information about it. As such, we must carry out deeper reconnaissance and scanning of the target, [and] the extent of secrecy and concealment [of those tasks] far exceeds the extent of carrying out [those] tasks for computer network exploitation.”\nBut reconnaissance and scanning are only the first steps in preparations for an attack. The authors emphasize the importance of obfuscation throughout the various procedures required to prepare for offensive cyber operations: selecting and employing a method of gaining access to the target network, moving laterally through it, gaining privileges, and maintaining access. An intrusion can serve multiple purposes: “attack actions occur after the intrusion of computer networks, escalating privileges and exfiltrating all required data.”\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD PLA writings recognize that holding targets at risk for the purpose of deterrence also requires OPE. An article outlining principles of cyber deterrence authored by an unnamed Academy of Military Science expert in 2016 indicated that successful cyber deterrence, which included carrying out coercive and retaliatory attacks, required “complete and meticulous preparation in peacetime.” Those preparations included “long-term, sustained network reconnaissance” to become familiar with an adversary’s network situation, map the structure of its networks, and discover hardware and software vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be used to leave backdoors, set up “springboards,” and install logic bombs and Trojan horses “to retain points of penetration to launch future cyber attacks.”95 PLA texts recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. The 2013 Science of Military Strategy published by the Academy of Military Science acknowledges that, “from a technological perspective, the principles of the task (gongzuo yuanli) of cyber surveillance and cyber attacks are essentially identical.” The book explains: “cyber surveillance means and methods are often also the means and methods of cyber attacks.” Furthermore, it highlights that cyber espionage can easily be turned into an attack: “According to the aspirations and intentions of the actor, it is possible to just press a key or initiate a sequence of commands, and the conversion between cyber surveillance and cyber attack is immediately completed.” The authors conclude that the relationship between cyber espionage and combat cannot be severed.96 In addition, OPE can erode the distinction between peacetime and conflict in cyberspace. The 2017 Science of Military Strategy published by the National Defense University indicates that, “compared to traditional domains, the boundary between war and peace in the cyber domain is fuzzier.” The book describes the lack of clear boundaries as follows: “cyber and electronic domain warfare already exists in peacetime; when war is imminent (linzhan) it becomes more intense; [and] often sustained confrontation directly merges into actual war.”97 These views are repeated in a revised edition of the book published in 2020.98 Two PLA authors affiliated with the former General Staff Research Institute argue that one reason for the blurred boundary between war and peace in cyberspace is that “‘backdoors’ and ‘exploits’ are pre-placed in an enemy’s network systems early; it is very difficult to determine from which moment war begins.”99 This view contrasts with US Cyber Command’s views of a clearer threshold of armed conflict in cyberspace.\nAs in the United States, PLA texts indicate that China intends to conduct offensive cyber operations. OPE will therefore likely be necessary to target the high-value military and civilian critical infrastructure networks that could contribute to crisis instability. A 2013 Academy of Military Science textbook This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM describes “‘soft’ paralysis of the information network nodes of adversary warfare systems” that the PLA could implement alongside kinetic attacks and psychological operations in a future joint information operations campaign. The book indicates that the PLA would need to “completely analyze the structure and relationship of interconnections and restrictions among the adversary’s systems for command and control, intelligence and warning, and firepower attack (huoli daji), and their support and sustainment,” to select the appropriate means for offensive cyber attacks. Those means include offensive cyber operations that would require OPE: “systems intrusion, computer virus attacks, attacks to cut off servers, and network deception attacks.” The book indicates that PLA attacks would not be limited to military networks, but could also “infiltrate, attack, and paralyze the adversary’s important civilian networks (minyong wangluo xitong).”¹⁰⁰ The PLA has moderated its expectations of the ease and effectiveness of such attacks as it has learned more about offensive cyber operations over time.¹⁰¹ But has by no means taken them off the table, as demonstrated by its ongoing exploitation of Taiwanese critical infrastructure, and Indian critical infrastructure networks during the conflict along the Sino-Indian border in 2020.¹⁰² ## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risk PLA texts do not discuss the danger of the OPE-espionage distinction problem and the risk of escalation if an intrusion is discovered in a crisis. It is unclear whether Chinese decision-makers have implemented procedures for managing inadvertent escalation risks posed by its cyber operations. Past PLA writings do not indicate that managing those risks was a priority in organizational procedures for cyber operations. This inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks specifically is surprising given that China has paid increasing attention to three other types of escalation risks: deliberate cyber attacks that could result in an adversary overreaction, unauthorized and accidental cyber attacks perpetrated by the PLA, and the potential for North Korean cyber attacks to be mis-attributed to China and draw it into a conflict with one of Pyongyang’s enemies.\nThe 2013 Science of Military Strategy indicates that “every country in the world is conducting cyber reconnaissance activities of differing degrees, but the possibility of this triggering a bilateral crisis, or a war starting because of this reason, is not high.”¹⁰³ The authors do not reconcile this observation with their observation that cyber surveillance and attack are indistinguishable. Similarly, the Academy of Military Science expert writing in 2016 warned of escalation risks from cyber operations that are too weak or too strong in their This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD effects on an adversary. The expert called for unified control over all aspects of cyber operations but did not recognize the possibility that espionage could be misperceived as OPE and prompt an adversary to use force.¹⁰⁴ Chinese researchers writing for academic and policy audiences vary in their assessments of whether cyber operations in general contribute to crisis instability, but they also do not pay specific attention to the OPE inadvertent escalation pathway. Associate Professor Liu Yangyue at the National University of Defense Technology is generally sanguine about the effects of cyber operations on strategic stability. He dismisses the argument in Western literature that a state could escalate in response to an initial cyber attack to stop an adversary from conducting further attacks.¹⁰⁵ Drawing on the same observational data used in Western cyber security scholarship, he argues that “when they face cyber attacks (believed to come from their enemies), states do not inevitably make worst-case calculations in their style of behavior, or let this guide their policies for responding.”¹⁰⁶ Similarly, Li Bin and Zhao Tong report that: Some Chinese experts have challenged the popular view that cyber technology will negatively affect crisis stability, because they believe this conclusion is based completely on logical deduction, instead of empirical evidence. These experts have noted that states are usually very cautious about launching military retaliations to cyber attacks, and it is very rare for cyber attacks to lead to escalation.¹⁰⁷ Nevertheless, Liu does express concern about the escalation risks posed by the difficulty of attribution. Citing the example of the Solar Sunrise intrusion discovered prior to US airstrikes against Iraq in 1998, he argues that if third-party espionage or OPE “is coincidentally discovered during a military mission, or the attacker uses more sophisticated means to conceal their identity, then this kind of attack could become a fuse for an unintended crisis.”¹⁰⁸ Other Chinese scholars are less sanguine about the escalation risks in cyberspace. But they tend to focus on the use-or-lose incentives to carry out cyber attacks early in a crisis or conflict, rather than inadvertent escalation due to the discovery of an intrusion.¹⁰⁹ PRC experts have also expressed concern about the US concept of “cross-domain deterrence,” which they interpret as threats to use conventional military operations (or even nuclear threats) to retaliate for cyber attacks.¹¹⁰ The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Ariel Levite and former PLA Col. Lyu Jinghua wrote in China Military Science that in a Sino-American conflict scenario, “one of the earliest and most destabilising venues for conflict would be cyberspace, thanks to the potential military utility of early employment of cyber assets.” Levite and Lyu acknowledge that “cyber This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM actions in these scenarios also hold serious escalatory potential, complicating the challenges of keeping conflicts below the level of outright military confrontation.” They acknowledge the OPE inadvertent escalation risk, but only briefly: “intelligence operations to monitor these networks might be misinterpreted as attacks on them, or at least attack preparations.”¹¹¹ It is unclear whether PLA planning for offensive cyber operations accounts for the escalation risks associated with OPE and, if so, how those risks are managed. The PLA promulgated a new generation of doctrine in November 2020, the first update to its official doctrine since 1999.¹¹² Unfortunately, no information about their content was available at the time of writing. Up until at least 2015, official PLA doctrine for offensive cyber operations was likely covered by doctrine for information operations, which combined electronic, cyber, and kinetic attacks.¹¹³ PLA texts published before 2015 hinted that, in the future, the PLA might have operational doctrine for stand-alone cyber operations as well as joint information operations involving cyber attacks.¹¹⁴ The PLA established the Strategic Support Force (SSF) in 2015–2016, during one of the most significant set of reforms in its history. The SSF consolidated most existing PLA cyber offense, defense, and espionage units from separate parts of its former General Staff Department and services into a Network Systems Department within the Strategic Support Force. Before the reforms, the PLA General Staff Department’s Third Department was believed to be the primary organization for cyber espionage within the PLA, while the Fourth Department was believed to have primary responsibility for offensive cyber operations.¹¹⁵ The consolidation of the former Third and Fourth departments into one organization is likely to enable the PLA to better integrate cyber operations for espionage and attack.¹¹⁶ These new organizational arrangements for military cyber operations should in theory improve the ability of top leaders to recognize and manage the crisis escalation risks associated with OPE. One of the key effects, if not drivers, of the consolidation of Chinese military cyber forces into the SSF is to enable top military leaders to exercise stricter oversight over PLA cyber operations to prevent accidental and unauthorized cyber attacks.¹¹⁷ Indeed, PLA writings published around the time the SSF was created emphasize the principle of “unified command” (tongyi zhihui) of cyber offense, defense, espionage, and control, and both PLA and non-PLA cyber capabilities.¹¹⁸ Details of how this principle of unified command is implemented in practice are scarce. Moreover, the ability of the new command structure to manage escalation risks in practice might have taken a back seat to other force building priorities. For example, the PLA’s efforts to guard against unauthorized and accidental use of cyber operations is in tension with its efforts to recruit the best cyber talent from outside This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD of the PLA. The SSF's use of contractors may revive many of the problems with oversight of cyber operations that China's leaders encountered prior to the 2015–2016 reforms.^[119]^ The nature and extent of leadership oversight of PLA cyber operations are difficult to determine. It is possible that China has established a formal institutional structure for inter-agency vetting of military plans and operations that crosses civilian and military lines. Drawing on a PLA publication about cyber operations published in 2017, John Chen, Joe McReynolds, and Kieran Green observe that “peacetime planning and guidance of cyberspace operations... at the strategic level rest in the hands of such national network security leadership organizations as the [Communist Party] Cybersecurity and Informatization Commission, while planning and guidance during wartime are the responsibility of the [PLA] CMC Joint Operations Command Center.”^[120]^ In other words, a civilian Party body takes the lead in peacetime and the PLA’s Central Military Commission takes the lead in wartime. It remains unclear how this dual command structure functions in practice. Most importantly, it remains unclear whether and, if so, to what degree managing inadvertent escalation risks resulting from OPE is a priority for the military and civilian leaders with oversight over PLA cyber operations.\n## Capabilities for Managing Cyber Risk China is developing cyber situational awareness capabilities, including attribution capabilities. But they likely lag behind the United States in its development of capabilities that could disambiguate between attackers and mitigate inadvertent escalation risks. An official white paper outlining China’s international cyberspace strategy published in 2017 indicated that: [China] will expedite the development of a [military] cyber force and enhance capabilities in terms of situational awareness, cyber defense, supporting state activities and participating in international cooperation, to prevent major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security, and maintain national security and social stability.^[121]^ It is difficult to assess the extent of improvement in China’s attribution and defense capabilities since adopting these priorities in 2015. The Chinese government’s procedures for defending its networks are unclear and it has not publicly attributed cyber attacks to another state. Nevertheless, in 2018 Xi Jinping acknowledged the deterrent effect of China’s improved capability to detect intruders.^[122]^ Some Chinese cyber security firms have begun to publicly This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM attribute intrusions to known groups of hackers using industry identifiers.¹²³ They have also called for greater efforts to prevent OPE within critical infrastructure networks. For example, the Chinese company Antiy argued that China needed to “make progress in weakening the ability of an adversary to ‘prepare the battlefield’ in our industrial control [systems] and infrastructure to achieve [serious] consequences.”¹²⁴ ## Misperception in the Sino-American Cyber Relationship Do the United States and China have a shared understanding of the nature of cyber conflict, the role of OPE, and the potential for crisis instability because of the OPE-espionage distinction problem? Comparing US and Chinese approaches to cyber conflict reveals some similarities, as well as differences that could hamper future bilateral efforts to manage cyber escalation risks. Both countries recognize that OPE is necessary for sophisticated offensive cyber operations yet is indistinguishable from intrusions for the purpose of espionage, defense, or data theft. Both countries view the presence of nation-state hackers in their networks as threatening. But the two countries do not appear to share an understanding of the inadvertent escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem or the clarity of the threshold of an armed attack in cyberspace.\nThe comparison also reveals asymmetries in the relative maturity of cyber doctrine and capabilities in both countries. These asymmetries might explain the lack of attention to inadvertent escalation risks in China’s approach to cyber conflict. China’s doctrine, procedures, and authorities for conducting cyber operations appear to have been overhauled by the 2015–2016 PLA reforms and took some years afterwards to crystallize into their current form. As a result, the PLA has less experience integrating espionage, offensive, and defensive cyber operations and incorporating civilian oversight into its cyber operations than the United States. The PLA operational regulations promulgated in late 2020 might have included more guidance on OPE and managing its escalation risks that is not reflected in the sources examined here. Meanwhile, US cyber capabilities and strategy are relatively more mature. US organizations demonstrate growing confidence in attribution capabilities, the clarity of escalation thresholds, and US ability to control escalation from OPE or low-level cyber attacks. These factors have led to a doctrine for cyber operations that gives the military a freer hand.\nNeither China nor the United States appears to be overly concerned about its espionage activities being misperceived as OPE during a crisis, albeit for different reasons. On the one hand, China appears to be inattentive to the specific This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD escalation risks posed by OPE. On the other hand, the United States appears to be aware of the specific escalation risks associated with OPE but is confident that they can be mitigated. This suggests that both states might approach a crisis confident that their intrusions will not be discovered, misperceived, or lead to the use of force. The PLA's attention to the escalation risks associated with OPE might increase as Chinese cyber doctrine and capabilities further develop. But increased awareness is by no means a given. Chinese experts and writings on crisis management and nuclear strategy – areas where PLA doctrine and capabilities are more mature – have also tended to downplay drivers of inadvertent escalation.\nOf course, the lack of concern about the escalation risks associated with OPE could reflect a shared lack of concern that cyber attacks could cause much harm in a crisis, supporting the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. OPE may simply be accepted practice between these two countries.[125] They might expect that some of their key networks will be disabled by their adversaries' offensive cyber operations during future conflicts. They might prepare to fight without those networks instead of pre-empting cyber attacks that could disable them. We are cautious, however, about interpreting the evidence as confirmation of the bluster hypothesis. Evidence that China both acknowledges and shares US confidence that inadvertent cyber escalation risks can be managed – which we did not find – would have reduced the need for caution in interpreting the evidence in favor of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis.\n## Initiatives to Mitigate Misperceptions In the absence of a shared understanding of cyber conflict, two initiatives could reduce the risk of inadvertent cyber escalation via the misperception pathway in a future Sino-American crisis: dialogue to ensure that both parties understand each other's approach to cyber operations, and a crisis communication mechanism specific to cyber operations. Dialogue and crisis communication could reduce the likelihood of either side misperceiving the other's cyber intrusion as OPE, or as confirmation of the other's hostile intentions, because of differences in their understandings of cyber conflict and operations.[126] Unfortunately, China and the United States do not currently have an official military cyber dialogue that could bridge some of the gaps in their understandings of military cyber operations before a crisis emerges, despite establishing official dialogues to enable cooperation in non-military areas of the cyber relationship in 2015. Nor do China and the United States currently have a mechanism in place for crisis communications dedicated to cyber matters. By contrast, the United States has a three-tier cyber communications protocol in This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM place with Russia that involves a direct line between the White House and the Kremlin.¹²⁷ ## Conclusion Could military cyber capabilities contribute to the outbreak of conflict in a future crisis involving the United States and China? Although our empirical analysis is unable to provide a definitive answer to this question, it provides enough evidence to suggest that inadvertent escalation could occur if one state discovered the other's cyber intrusions in a crisis. Over the past decade or so, the United States has made unilateral attempts to limit the risks of inadvertent escalation occurring, first with strict organizational procedures governing all cyber operations and later with more robust operational procedures to defend its networks. There is little evidence that China has taken similar steps to unilaterally mitigate inadvertent escalation risks from cyber operations. The bilateral cyber relationship also lacks the shared understandings of these risks, and mechanisms for dialogue in peacetime or communications in crises, that could improve crisis stability.\nEven a small probability of inadvertent escalation could have extremely serious consequences, given how destructive a Sino-American conflict could be and the variety of other escalation risks present in the relationship. Our empirical analysis could also support the claim that cyber capabilities do not pose a serious enough threat for decision-makers to use force – whether cyber or kinetic – to pre-empt or retaliate. However, in the absence of stronger evidence to support this bluster hypothesis, we do not dismiss the risk that the OPE-espionage distinction problem could add to crisis instability given the stakes at hand.\nThis chapter suggests that further research is needed to establish whether US confidence that cyber operations do not add to crisis stability is well founded. US adversaries' reluctance to escalate in response to cyber attacks or intrusions might reflect their countervailing strategic and political disincentives to escalate, rather than the stabilizing nature of cyber operations.¹²⁸ Brandon Valeriano, Benjamin M. Jensen, and Ryan C. Maness find that the United States has been successful in using cyberspace to coerce adversaries.¹²⁹ Scholars have pointed out that cyber operations are likely to have their greatest effects on international relations when combined with superior conventional military power.¹³⁰ The possibility that US conventional military power might mask the destabilizing effects of cyber operations suggests that the United States should be cautious as Chinese conventional military capabilities improve. If a Sino-American crisis had occurred during the past decade, Beijing would have This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD faced strong countervailing pressures not to use force in response to a cyber intrusion, even if it judged that intrusion to pose a serious threat. Going forward, even if the PRC views an intrusion as a serious but manageable threat, its growing conventional capabilities and tense relationship with Washington could create an excuse for deliberate PRC escalation. And if the intrusion were intolerable, political and strategic disincentives could not be counted on to restrain China's leaders from using force.",

Cunningham In the context of an increasingly competitive Sino-American relationship, US analysts are increasingly concerned about crisis instability, defined as the temptation for either country to use force rather than continue to bargain diplomatically during a crisis. Scholars and analysts focused on the US-China relationship have warned that cyber capabilities could add incentives for either the United States or China to use force in a crisis. Despite these concerns, there is no consensus among cyber scholars that offensive cyber capabilities contribute to the risk of great-power political crises escalating into conflicts.\nAs the previous chapter by Jason Healey and Robert Jervis has shown, certain features of cyber capabilities could create new pathways through which a great-power crisis could escalate into a conventional conflict.\nThis chapter examines one of these novel escalation pathways in the context of the Sino-American relationship: the difficulty of distinguishing between hacking for espionage and operational preparation of the environment (OPE), an essential precursor to most high-end cyber attacks. This OPE-espionage distinction problem creates pathways for inadvertent escalation, which occurs\"when a combatant deliberately takes actions that it does not perceive to be escalatory but are interpreted that way by the enemy,\"during a crisis or conflict. A state could correctly detect an adversary's OPE and, fearing an imminent cyber attack with severe consequences, choose to use force first, escalating the conflict with a cyber or even kinetic attack. But a state could also misperceive an adversary's efforts to collect intelligence via cyber means as OPE and pre-empt that attack with conventional or cyber attacks of its own. A state discovering that its adversary has intruded into its nuclear command, control, and communications networks during a crisis presents a particularly concerning scenario.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Despite these concerns, academic studies based on observational data, surveys, and simulations find little correlation between cyber attacks and escalation, either in peacetime or during conflicts.6 Scholars have reasoned that most cyber attacks are simply not destructive enough to worsen crisis or conflict outcomes.7 These limited effects, coupled with the bloodless, secret nature of cyber attacks, might instead open up new pathways for de-escalation and enhance crisis stability.8 However, the external validity of existing empirical findings to military crises among great powers is limited because no such crisis has occurred in the past two decades and they are difficult to replicate in surveys, simulations, and wargames.9 To evaluate the diverging concerns of the US policy community and the ongoing scholarly debates on cyber escalation and crisis instability among great powers, this chapter examines the escalation risks created by OPE in a future crisis scenario involving the United States and China. Scholars have already identified several sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship, including a systematic lack of attention among Chinese experts to inadvertent escalation risks in the nuclear, conventional, and space domains.10 A Sino-American crisis scenario is a most likely case for theoretical claims that cyber capabilities create novel escalation risks. Both countries would be most likely to react to any independent effect of cyber technology on their incentives to use force, if such incentives exist, in a crisis. Indeed, scholars have already raised concerns that cyber capabilities could fuel Sino-American crisis instability, although they have not examined the OPE-espionage distinction problem in much detail.11 To assess the escalation risks posed by this problem, we follow the methodological approach of scholars who have examined other sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship. Specifically, we examine the two countries' leadership statements, threat perceptions, procedures for authorizing cyber operations, organizational structures, capabilities, and policies for evidence that they create, recognize, and seek to manage escalatory risks.\nOur analysis suggests that inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE would be present in a future Sino-American crisis scenario. Official US policy for offensive cyber operations recognizes the escalation risks associated with cyber espionage being mistaken for OPE, but recent changes to US cyber strategy may increase these risks. Meanwhile, Chinese writings recognize the difficulty of distinguishing between cyber attacks and OPE but appear to ignore the consequences for crisis instability. We also find that a lack of mutual understanding in the Sino-American cyber relationship adds to the likelihood of the two countries misperceiving each other's behavior.\nOur empirical findings have two key limitations. First, our sources are scarce, imperfect, and some years old, especially on the Chinese side. We BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM follow best practices for using open sources to analyze Chinese military strategy, but caution is still needed when drawing conclusions from such sources. Nevertheless, these sources still make a valuable contribution to existing policy debates and scholarly research about cyber conflict, which rarely draws on Chinese perspectives. Second, our empirical findings could support the claim that cyber technology either does – or does not – add to crisis instability. Leaders from both countries might choose to ignore the escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem even if they are present. But neither country's relaxed approach to these risks is justified by a careful assessment of the independent effect of cyber technology on an adversary's incentives to use force in a crisis, which makes us hesitant to dismiss them.\nThis chapter begins with a brief explanation of OPE as a distinctive feature of cyber attacks. The second section outlines the competing hypotheses about cyber escalation in existing scholarly literature and the mechanisms that could link detection of an intrusion in a crisis with the decision to use force. The third, fourth, and fifth sections examine the evidence for these hypotheses in US documents and statements, Chinese writings and organizational practices, and the bilateral cyber relationship, respectively. The sixth section evaluates the escalation risks.\n## Operational Preparation of the Environment Performing OPE is essential to enabling significant cyber operations that could have strategic effects on the target.[12] To develop a cyber capability with a potent or customized effect on a target network, substantial reconnaissance and preparation are required from within that targeted network. In 2010, the Department of Defense defined\"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment\"as: Non-intelligence enabling functions within cyberspace conducted to plan and prepare for potential follow-up military operations. [Cyber-OPE] includes but is not limited to identifying data, system/network configurations, or physical structures... for the purpose of determining system vulnerabilities; and actions taken to assure future access and/or control of the system, network, or data during anticipated hostilities.[13] While cyber OPE has analogues in other forms of military operations – especially in the world of special operations and covert action – it differs from operations that are more familiar to policymakers, such as conventional and nuclear operations. Preparations to use cyber capabilities have different recon This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD naissance requirements than most other operations.¹⁴ Much of the development and preparation for a cyber operation requires access to or occurs within adversary networks. Moreover, the accesses and payloads that make offensive cyber operations possible are often specific to a particular network.¹⁵ Gaining and maintaining access to a target network is also generally difficult, resource intensive, and specific to the target network.¹⁶ Overall, the effects of an attack, the ability to sustain those effects over time, and the ability of an attack to limit unintended consequences all depend on how well the attacker has prepared and understood the target network and the likely actions of the network's defenders once the attack commences.¹⁷ A few examples illustrate the importance of OPE to sophisticated offensive cyber operations. Stuxnet was enabled by months if not years of reconnaissance, while Iranian hackers spent months inside the computer networks of Sands Casino and Saudi Aramco before they attacked in 2012.¹⁸ North Korean hackers did the same with their attacks on the computer networks of Sony Pictures.¹⁹ Russian hackers prepared in a similar way for their NotPetya operation, which reportedly inflicted over $10 billion in damage.²⁰ Some attacks, most notably denial-of-service efforts, do not fit into this trend, but lack potency as a result.²¹ OPE is also difficult to distinguish from espionage once it is discovered by a target. In theory, there might be ways for a target to tell whether an intrusion is espionage or whether it facilitates an attack. But there are no foolproof solutions to this OPE-espionage distinction problem. For example, an uptick in communication between the attacker and malicious code implanted in the target system could signal its purpose, but an attack could occur without any of those signals. Those signals could also accompany routine intelligence collection.²² Even if an attacker tries to use those signals to distinguish OPE from espionage, the target may not receive those signals or treat them as credible.²³ The nature of the target network may provide some hints – for example, critical infrastructure industrial control systems are more likely to be exploited for OPE than intelligence gathering – but this is not always the case.²⁴ Moreover, the exploitation of an adversary's networks for intelligence gathering could be repurposed for OPE without any tell-tale signs that the target might detect. For example, there is some evidence to suggest that the first blackout in Ukraine began with an espionage objective but later morphed into an attack operation.²⁵ ## The Novel Escalation Risks of OPE How and why could an intrusion discovered in the midst of a crisis between two great powers create incentives for the use of force? How and why might This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms decision-makers choose to use force when faced with those incentives? Answers to these questions are key to understanding the potential for cyber operations to contribute to crisis instability -- or stability.\nWe define a crisis as “a confrontation between two states involving a serious threat to vital national interests for both sides in which there is the expectation of a short time for resolution, and in which there is understood to be a sharply increased risk of war.” We define escalation as “an increase in the intensity or scope of conflict that crosses threshold(s) considered significant by one or more of the participants.” In a great-power crisis, escalation would involve the use of force, with either cyber or kinetic attacks. We use the term “cyber escalation risks” to refer to an increased temptation to use force in a crisis due to the nature of cyber technology.\nIf decision-makers discover an intrusion into their key military or civilian networks during a crisis, most scholars agree that those decision-makers could not rule out the possibility that the intrusion enables OPE. The decision-makers' response to that discovery will depend on how they assess the seriousness of the threat posed by the intrusion and whether the state also has strategic or political incentives to use force. The interaction of these two factors suggests four possibilities: the inadvertent escalation and deliberate escalation hypotheses that expect the use of force, and the bluster and countervailing hypotheses that do not expect the use of force. We focus on the logic underpinning the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it best represents the concerns in current US policy debates about the destabilizing effect of cyber technology in a future Sino-American crisis.\n### Intrusion Detection in a Crisis The scenario in which OPE could trigger the use of force in a crisis would likely begin months if not years before the crisis. An adversary that wants the option to carry out offensive cyber operations in a future conflict against a state's important military or civilian networks would conduct OPE during peacetime. Once a crisis has begun it is almost certainly too late to complete this complex, time-consuming task.\nOnce a political crisis began -- for example, over an accidental collision between two rivals' military aircraft, the scenario that triggered the last Sino-American crisis in 2001 -- decision-makers in both states would have to decide whether to back down, bargain diplomatically, or bargain with the use of force. During their deliberations, the target state's decision-makers might discover their adversary's intrusions into important computer networks, including those that might be OPE. Such discoveries are more likely in a crisis PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD because states anticipate espionage and attacks in that context and will step up network defenses accordingly.³⁰ If target’s decision-makers decide it is most prudent to treat the intrusion as OPE, and they believe that the intrusion poses a serious threat, the OPE-espionage distinction problem creates an incentive to use force rather than bargain diplomatically.\nMore generally, the OPE-espionage distinction problem complicates the task of the target’s decision-makers charged with assessing the intent behind the intrusion. Motivations for the intrusion include OPE, monitoring the target’s military operations, or gathering intelligence about its offensive cyber operations.³¹ The specifics of the intrusion may provide some hints of intent but are unlikely to be definitive.³² Testing of small-scale attacks or an uptick in communication between the intruder and code it has implanted in the target system could also signal that it is OPE.³³ The intruder would also have difficulty reassuring the target state of its intent if the intrusion is for intelligence purposes.³⁴ To preserve its operational security, the intruder would have incentives not to acknowledge which adversary networks it has exploited and for what purpose, lest the target use that information to remove the intruder.³⁵ Even if the intruder sought to reassure the target of its intent not to use the intrusion to enable an attack, it would have trouble credibly committing not to use the intrusion for OPE in the future.\n## The Inadvertent Escalation Pathway The claim that cyber operations create incentives to use force in a crisis is a specific instance of a general claim that military operations and technology can cause misperceptions among adversaries with serious consequences for crisis stability and intra-war escalation.³⁶ One potential consequence of those misperceptions is inadvertent escalation. The canonical scenario of inadvertent escalation is a conventional war among nuclear powers in which one party conducts “large-scale conventional operations that produce patterns of damage or threat to the major elements of a state’s nuclear force.”³⁷ The target state interprets the attack as a deliberate attempt to degrade its nuclear force and responds by using nuclear weapons or accelerating preparations for their use.³⁸ Similarly, escalation to the use of cyber or kinetic force could occur in a crisis as an unintended consequence of the normal conduct of cyber espionage.\nMisperceptions commonly associated with the security dilemma are one reason that inadvertent escalation could occur.³⁹ Specifically, the difficulty of distinguishing between an adversary’s offensive and defensive military operations is sufficient to produce misperceptions about the intent of the attacking state within the target state.⁴⁰ The attacking state’s conventional military This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM operations could therefore make its adversary less secure in unintended ways,⁴¹ which creates an incentive for the target state to use force sooner rather than later.⁴² The target state need only calculate that its ability to achieve its conflict objectives will diminish in the future if it ignores the attacker’s actions in the present.⁴³ The OPE-espionage distinction problem could trigger the use of force if the target state’s leaders make worst-case-scenario assessments of the attacker’s intent and capability to damage an important information network. There are four mechanisms by which a state could make a worst-case-scenario assessment of the seriousness of the threat posed by an intrusion and decide to use force, whether a cyber or kinetic attack. First, a state that detects an adversary’s OPE might use force to pre-empt a cyber attack that could put the state at a military disadvantage in a future conflict.⁴⁴ Second, the combination of the crisis environment and the OPE-espionage distinction problem could lead the state to attribute aggressive intentions to the adversary with regards to both the network intrusion and the overall crisis, incentivizing the use of force.⁴⁵ Third, the discovery of an intrusion that might be OPE could affect decision-makers’ emotions in ways that make the use of force more likely.⁴⁶ Fourth, the uneven distribution of information about the nature of cyber operations in national security bureaucracies might make the use of force more likely when those bureaucracies discover intrusions in a crisis. Intrusions that some cyber specialists see as a routine part of cyber operations may alarm more senior generalists, especially in a crisis. Top decision-makers may not have sufficient knowledge or information to assess the risks posed by a cyber intrusion to their military capabilities.⁴⁷ ## The Deliberate Escalation Pathway States might assess that a cyber intrusion poses a serious but tolerable threat yet choose to use force in response because they have strategic and political incentives to escalate. Those strategic and political incentives usually involve gaining a military advantage, signaling resolve, or pre-empting an adversary’s attempt to signal resolve by using force.⁴⁸ Scholars have questioned whether states make decisions to escalate because of the independent effects of technology alone. Based on historical case studies, Caitlin Talmadge argues that new technologies might not force decision-makers to take escalatory actions, but rather “seem likely to be an intervening variable.” States seek out new technologies to enable them to increase the risk of escalation, or turn to them opportunistically in a conflict, rather than their hands being forced to escalate in a crisis because they did not anticipate the escalatory pressures created This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD by their prior decisions to deploy certain military capabilities.⁴⁹ These actions involve deliberate escalation: “[when] a combatant deliberately increases the intensity or scope of an operation to gain an advantage or avoid defeat.”⁵⁰ ## The Bluster De-escalation Pathway Decision-makers may decide not to use force if they discover an intrusion in a crisis – even if they are confident that the intruder has performed OPE – because they do not think the intrusion poses a serious threat. This “bluster” hypothesis suggests that cyber technology does not contribute to crisis instability and might even help to stabilize crises. It draws on existing empirical research which indicates that cyber attacks are perceived to be more bluster than bite. States and individuals tend not to retaliate in response to cyber attacks.⁵¹ One explanation for this empirical finding is that decision-makers do not view cyber attacks as sufficiently damaging or destructive to warrant the use of force in response.⁵² Applying these arguments to a crisis scenario in which an intrusion is discovered, decision-makers might calculate that the cost of the cyber attack is likely to be low and can be absorbed. This explanation suggests that states would not anticipate a military disadvantage from a cyber attack, contrary to the military disadvantage mechanism outlined above.\nDecision-makers might even view cyber attacks as a signal that an adversary wants to avoid a conventional conflict. When the effects of cyber and kinetic attacks are held constant, Jacquelyn Schneider and Sarah Kreps found that US survey respondents were less likely to support retaliation for cyber attacks than kinetic attacks.⁵³ Decision-makers might therefore interpret the discovery of an intrusion as a signal of an adversary’s intent to avoid crossing the threshold of conventional armed conflict,⁵⁴ rather than its hostile intent, contrary to the misperception mechanism outlined above.\n## The Countervailing De-escalation Hypothesis Finally, decision-makers might view the intrusion as posing a serious threat but have countervailing political or strategic incentives not to respond with the use of force. Decision-makers could react to an intrusion in this de-escalatory manner if they want to defuse the crisis because, for example, the stakes of the crisis do not merit fighting a war, or if they lacked the conventional military power to achieve their political objectives if a conflict broke out. Decision-makers with multiple adversaries might also be wary of mis-attributing an intrusion carried out by one adversary to another if they cannot attribute the intrusion to its perpetrator with sufficient confidence in the time frame of the This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM crisis.⁵⁵ Other countervailing incentives may also originate in domestic politics. The ambiguity of intent behind cyber intrusions could help more moderate decision-makers build a coalition for restraint in the crisis and counter pressure from decision-makers with more hawkish preferences.⁵⁶ ## Evaluating Cyber Escalation Hypotheses How might scholars determine which of these four hypotheses is most likely in a great-power crisis, when no crisis has occurred since China and the United States were both armed with military cyber capabilities? There is no perfect solution to this problem. To complement existing empirical studies, most of which capture US popular or elite views of cyber escalation, our approach focuses on capturing both US and Chinese elite views by examining their approach to cyber OPE, escalation, and military operations.\nOur empirical analysis is guided by observable implications derived from the four hypotheses. The inadvertent escalation hypothesis would expect states to express concern about any intrusions into their networks and to recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. States might also recognize inadvertent escalation risks and take steps to manage cyber escalation risks in their procedures, authorities, and organizational structures for cyber operations. Inadvertent escalation is also more likely to occur when two states have a poor understanding of each other's cyber activities and lack crisis communications mechanisms to verify the nature of an intrusion. The bluster de-escalation hypothesis would expect states that possess good attribution capabilities, defend their networks against intrusions, and effectively repel intruders who do breach defenses to be more relaxed about discovering intrusions into their networks. Not only might they be less likely to experience worrying intrusions, but they might also be able to better assess the intent and the severity of the threat posed by an intrusion.\nWhile it is difficult to describe the strategic and political incentives that could provide evidence to support the deliberate escalation or countervailing hypotheses in a future crisis, some ex ante features of a great-power relationship would shape those incentives. Deliberate escalation is more likely to occur when the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally stronger than its adversary, does not confront multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has high political stakes in the crisis. The countervailing hypothesis is more likely to find support if the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally weaker than its adversary, faces multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has low political stakes in the crisis. A scenario in which the conventional military balance is roughly equal and both states see the conflict as high stakes This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD would be the most likely case for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it minimizes countervailing political and strategic incentives to de-escalate if a threatening cyber intrusion is discovered in a crisis. A US-China crisis scenario is more evenly matched than most cyber dyads, although it would still involve some asymmetries in stakes and the conventional military balance that could obfuscate the independent effect of cyber technology on the temptation to use force in a crisis.^[57]^ ## Escalation Risks in US Cyber Operations US decision-makers recognize the inadvertent escalation risks posed by cyber operations, and OPE in particular, but they have taken steps to mitigate those risks. The Obama administration implemented organizational practices that carefully managed cyber operations that could produce escalation. The Trump administration relaxed those organizational practices after gaining confidence in operational practices. These practices provide evidence in favor of either the inadvertent escalation hypothesis or the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. As part of its more muscular approach, US Cyber Command has also concluded that most cyber intrusions could not produce serious enough effects to result in escalation. At first glance this judgment supports the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. But it could also support the countervailing de-escalation hypothesis. US adversaries might view its intrusions as very threatening but face disincentives to use force because of US conventional military preponderance.\n## Leadership Views of OPE The public statements of leaders and government reactions to discoveries of intrusions into military networks indicate that the United States views intrusions as threatening, in part because they could be used either for OPE or intelligence gathering. After a Russian hack of Pentagon systems in 2015 that the United States was able to repel, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter summarized the American position aptly when he said,\"[It] can't be good for anybody to be inside of our networks - whatever their motivation.\"^[58]^ Similarly, Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency (NSA) and US Cyber Command, and his adviser Michael Sulmeyer explained that the United States turned to a more aggressive policy\"to prevent toeholds from turning into beachheads so that a single compromise will not threaten the military's ability to accomplish its mission.\"^[59]^ While the details of most US responses to foreign hacking efforts are not public, two historical cases demonstrate that policymakers worried about the This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM implications of minor intrusions. In a 1998 hack known as Solar Sunrise, intruders penetrated the US military's logistics and communications networks. The Joint Staff general in charge of information operations, John Campbell, worried that the breach would permit significant attacks, especially at a time of heightened tensions with Iraq.\"If you take one part of that machine, and disable it,\"he said,\"you've got a real problem trying to make a deployment take place.\"60 Campbell's comments reflect an assessment that the intrusion could have placed the United States at a military disadvantage in a conflict. The discovery did not take place during a major crisis and therefore lacked the time pressure element that would create incentives to use force. Nevertheless, an investigation concluded the breach was the work of three teenagers and their 20-year-old mentor after various parts of the US government had already spun up to prepare for a response.\nA second incident, Moonlight Maze, occurred in 1998 and 1999 and involved Russian penetration of unclassified American networks. The US government hacked back into Russian computers to gain more intelligence.[61] One of the White House's top national security officials, Richard Clarke, labeled the activities\"cyberwar reconnaissance.\"[62] Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre indicated that the United States was\"in the middle of a cyber war\"to the Intelligence Committees of Congress during a classified briefing.[63] ## OPE in Cyber Operations US operators and decision-makers have recognized the need for OPE to conduct sophisticated cyber operations since at least 2010. The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a memo in 2010 mandating the use of the term\"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment,\"which referred to those cyber operations that serve\"as an enabling function for another military operation.\"[64] From the earliest days of the US Cyber Command, secret documents – now declassified – indicated that conducting OPE was one of its core tasks.[65] Planners at the highest levels of the US government eventually recognized the importance of OPE. During the Obama administration, the most significant high-level document governing America's offensive cyber capability was Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20). The president signed the classified document in secret in the fall of 2012. The White House released a fact sheet that made no mention of offensive cyber capabilities,[66] but the full classified document, leaked in 2013 by Edward Snowden, reveals a strategy that directly considers offensive action and contrasts it with other forms of cyber operations. The strategy lays out a clear typology of cyber activity. This includes\"cyber This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD collection,” which refers to intelligence-gathering activities for purposes other than offensive preparation. It also includes “non-intrusive defensive countermeasures,” meaning steps taken within one’s own network, such as deploying antivirus and other basic security measures. The document also introduces the concept of “Defensive Cyber Effects Operations,” defined as efforts that have an effect on an adversary’s computer systems – presumably, hacking or other interference – but only for the purposes of defense. PPD-20 provides high-level procedures for managing this kind of aggressive defensive action.⁶⁷ Most significantly, though, the classified version of PPD-20 defines offensive action in some detail. It introduces the concept of “Offensive Cyber Effects Operations” (OCEO), which are distinct from cyber collection, non-intrusive defensive countermeasures, or defensive cyber effects operations. Instead, these efforts are designed to cause effects in adversary networks.⁶⁸ The document extols the unique virtues of these kinds of offensive cyber operations, which “can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance U.S. national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging.”⁶⁹ PPD-20 acknowledges the need for OPE to realize these offensive options. It indicates that “the development and sustainment of [offensive cyber] capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist.”⁷⁰ PPD-20 directs the US government to begin this operational preparation. The relevant agencies “shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, [and] establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities.”⁷¹ With his signature, President Barack Obama authorized the preparatory activity.\n## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risks PPD-20 reveals US policymakers’ cognisance of the risks that arise from actually using offensive cyber capabilities. As a result, the document highlights a process to carefully manage offensive actions that might do serious harm or invite escalation. It emphasizes inter-agency coordination, balancing defense and national security interests with diplomatic and economic ones. Most notably, the process requires the highest level of executive branch oversight – presidential approval – for any cyber operation that is “reasonably likely to result in significant consequences.”⁷² This term is broadly defined: “Loss of life, significant responsive actions against the United States, significant damage to property, serious adverse U.S. foreign policy consequences, or serious This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM economic impact on the United States.”73 It is likely that cyber operations that do not meet that threshold could otherwise be approved by the agency carrying out the operation without such high-level inter-agency vetting.\nCrucially, PPD-20 does not limit these restrictions to cyber attacks but emphasizes that they apply to all cyber operations. In short, President Obama wanted direct oversight of any operation that might meet the threshold of significant consequences – regardless of whether that operation involved collecting intelligence, defending American computers, preparing an offensive capability, or launching an attack. The directive suggests that the Obama administration was concerned, at least in theory, about the risks of cyber escalation even as it appreciated the operational necessity to prepare offensive capabilities in advance.\nThe Trump administration adopted a more relaxed set of organizational procedures for managing cyber escalation risks. Upon unveiling its new national cyber strategy in 2018, the Trump White House criticized the preceding administration for what it saw as its overly cautious posture and promised to be more aggressive in its engagements with adversaries. Then-National Security Adviser John Bolton said, “Our hands are not tied as they were in the Obama administration.” Nor was the need for more aggressive action just a partisan view. In his confirmation hearing, the incoming NSA director and commander of US Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone warned that the United States had to do more because American adversaries “don’t fear us.”74 These views were translated into policy by President Donald Trump’s signature on “National Security Presidential Memorandum 13.” The goal of the memorandum, which remains classified, is to provide military commanders with greater flexibility to integrate cyber operations into their overall approach to warfighting and deterrence.75 By delegating this authority to the Pentagon, the Trump administration attempted to foster a faster and more aggressive process, one that would generate more operational effects more quickly. But this approach also rebalanced the trade-off between operational agility and whole-of-government coordination to manage cyber escalation risks in favor of the former. According to the general on the Joint Staff responsible for cyber operations, this change sharply contrasted with the Obama administration’s approach, which was “an interagency process that went through the National Security Council... to deputies’ committee to principals’ committee and [where], in effect, anyone could stop the process along the way.” Nor, he argued, was the distinction just semantics or bureaucratic minutia, but one that “makes all the difference in the world in terms of the speed at which you can move.”76 This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms It is unclear whether current US policy, set by the Trump memorandum, frees commanders to both prepare for and launch cyber capabilities. But there are hints that the memo and complementary legislative changes implemented by Congress provide a freer hand in developing the malicious code and gaining access to target networks required to provide commanders with offensive options. For example, in a media interview, the former deputy commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, indicated that changes to congressional legislation “freed us up to do some of the things, the operational preparation of the environment, that we were limited from doing outside of the counterterrorism mission and now can do much more broadly against all of our peers and competitors.” In addition, a New York Times story from June 2019 describes more aggressive American preparatory measures against the Russian power grid.\nOverall, the Trump administration was much less worried about the escalation risk associated with cyber operations than the Obama administration. The Biden administration appears to have largely continued this approach since taking office in 2021. Michael Daniel, the former coordinator for cyber security in the Obama White House, observed that the Trump administration was “willing to take more risks than previous administrations.” While the Trump administration's approach was untested in a crisis with a near‐peer competitor, it was informed by the US experience with cyber conflict over the past decade as well as the increasing risk tolerance of US decision‐makers. To justify its new posture, US Cyber Command has argued that “adversaries continuously operate against us below the threshold of armed conflict,” in what it described as a “new normal.” Moreover, the command argued that US efforts to counter this adversarial activity will not lead to retaliation in or outside of cyberspace that would cross that threshold.\nThese claims have been fiercely debated in the academic literature, with critics of the so‐called persistent engagement approach arguing that the new strategy could produce escalation. For example, some contend that the thresholds for armed conflict are not as clear as US Cyber Command has suggested. Others argue that persistent engagement creates too many red lines for adversaries and is therefore not a realistic means for shaping behavior. Nakasone and Sulmeyer responded to these concerns with reassurance that:“Cyber Command takes these concerns seriously, and reducing this risk is a critical part of the planning process. We are confident that this more proactive approach enables Cyber Command to conduct operations that impose costs while responsibly managing escalation.\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM # Capabilities for Managing Escalation Risks In the past decade, the United States has developed some of the world's most sophisticated cyber capabilities to better defend its networks, attribute intrusions, and expel intruders in peacetime. To better defend networks, the United States has invested in major systems, such as EINSTEIN 3, that aim to thwart intrusions. To improve rapid attribution of intrusions and increase situational awareness, the United States established various cross-agency working groups and bulked up teams within the NSA and US Cyber Command. To the extent that these capabilities are effective, they might mitigate cyber escalation risks by reducing the likelihood that intruders will successfully break into US networks and alarm policymakers who have to decide on how to respond within the compressed time period of a crisis. However, the compromise of SolarWinds network management system in 2021, which enabled Russian government operators to intrude into numerous US government systems for months without detection, suggests that defense and attribution capabilities are imperfect and do not eliminate the possibility of the United States discovering an intrusion during a crisis.\n# Escalation Risks in Chinese Cyber Operations There is little evidence to indicate that China has scrutinized the inadvertent escalation risks posed by OPE as carefully as the United States, although Chinese sources bearing on this question are older, scarcer, and less authoritative than those for the United States.83 This lack of attention could be evidence of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis, as it might reflect a judgment that cyber intrusions pose a manageable threat to China's leaders. But this lack of concern should be interpreted in the context of a relative lack of concern about inadvertent escalation risks posed by nuclear, space, and conventional military operations among Chinese experts. As such, we favor the interpretation of China's inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks as support for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis. Inattention to the inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE could help to realize such risks in a crisis for three reasons. First, China is more likely to misperceive US cyber intrusions. Second, it is more likely to overlook the ways that its own cyber intrusions could be misperceived. Third, China is much less likely to take steps to mitigate these risks. Available sources provide little insight into whether the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has put in place organizational or operational practices to manage inadvertent cyber escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Leadership Views of OPE Chinese policymakers' fears about foreign hackers have grown in tandem with the expansion of the Chinese government's and military's dependence on computer networks. In a major speech on national cyber security policy in 2016, Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping stated that, “Cyber security has a strong covert character; a technological vulnerability or security risk can stay hidden for a number of years without being discovered.” As a result, “we do not know who came in, whether it was an enemy or a friend, or what they did.” Xi implied that while this enemy or friend's intrusion could remain “latent” inside a network for a long time, it could be “activated whenever (yidan jiu fazuo le).”84 The Chinese government has not publicly acknowledged any specific incidents in which it discovered that foreign state actors had exploited its government or military networks. China's closest analogue to the Solar Sunrise and Moonlight Maze incidents was Edward Snowden's revelations regarding US government surveillance of Chinese computer networks. Snowden's revelations are often cited by the country's cyber security scholars as evidence of China's vulnerability and the inadequacy of its network defenses, which failed to prevent or detect US government intrusions. Chinese experts claim that the NSA also targeted the country's military networks.85 A Chinese cyber security firm reported that the CIA had spied on Chinese state‐owned enterprises but did not identify any government networks penetrated.86 There is no detailed evidence about how the Chinese government responded to any of these incidents, nor did they occur in the context of a major crisis.\nChinese writings examining US cyber operations can provide insights into how Chinese experts view these operations in the absence of open discussions about these topics in China. Chinese experts affiliated with the PLA note that OPE is one of the cyber missions outlined in US doctrinal publications but do not mention the crisis escalation risks that could result from the OPE‐espionage distinction problem.87 While the Trump administration's more muscular approach to cyber operations raised concerns among Chinese authors for its emphasis on pre‐emption and potential to spark arms race instability, those experts are less focused on crisis instability than US scholars.88 There are some recent exceptions. For example, former PLA officer Lyu Jinghua writes that “it is worthwhile to explore whether the tension in cyberspace can be de‐escalated or whether the chances of the breakout of crisis can be lowered if there could be a basic consensus among countries that cyber activities conducted or supported by countries during peacetime are a contest of intelligence rather than conflicts or preparation of conflicts.\nIt remains unclear whether Chinese decision-makers share the views of experts who worry about the escalation risks of OPE and whether those concerns have led to practices to mitigate those risks.\n### OPE in Cyber Operations Like US officials, PLA strategists also distinguish between cyber surveillance, offense and defense, and deterrence as the main styles of cyber struggle. PLA texts do not use the term “operational preparation of the environment” when describing PLA operations, but they do recognize that effective offensive cyber operations require extensive advance preparation. A 2015 book authored by experts from the PLA Army Engineering University, 54th Institute, and other PLA organizations acknowledges that significant advance preparations are needed to ensure that cyber operations can be used to diminish an adversary's combat power. While many methods of attack are available, “a cyber attack capable of producing significant effects is a cyber attack for which ample preparations have already been made at an earlier time... it is not a decision that one makes as the situation requires.”\nPLA writings indicate that China places a similar degree of emphasis on OPE as the United States. The 2015 book characterizes OPE as more demanding than network exploitation for espionage:“It is necessary to carry out careful and meticulous reconnaissance and scanning of the target, in order to obtain even more detailed, specific information about it. As such, we must carry out deeper reconnaissance and scanning of the target, [and] the extent of secrecy and concealment [of those tasks] far exceeds the extent of carrying out [those] tasks for computer network exploitation.”\nBut reconnaissance and scanning are only the first steps in preparations for an attack. The authors emphasize the importance of obfuscation throughout the various procedures required to prepare for offensive cyber operations: selecting and employing a method of gaining access to the target network, moving laterally through it, gaining privileges, and maintaining access. An intrusion can serve multiple purposes: “attack actions occur after the intrusion of computer networks, escalating privileges and exfiltrating all required data.”\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD PLA writings recognize that holding targets at risk for the purpose of deterrence also requires OPE. An article outlining principles of cyber deterrence authored by an unnamed Academy of Military Science expert in 2016 indicated that successful cyber deterrence, which included carrying out coercive and retaliatory attacks, required “complete and meticulous preparation in peacetime.” Those preparations included “long-term, sustained network reconnaissance” to become familiar with an adversary’s network situation, map the structure of its networks, and discover hardware and software vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be used to leave backdoors, set up “springboards,” and install logic bombs and Trojan horses “to retain points of penetration to launch future cyber attacks.”95 PLA texts recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. The 2013 Science of Military Strategy published by the Academy of Military Science acknowledges that, “from a technological perspective, the principles of the task (gongzuo yuanli) of cyber surveillance and cyber attacks are essentially identical.” The book explains: “cyber surveillance means and methods are often also the means and methods of cyber attacks.” Furthermore, it highlights that cyber espionage can easily be turned into an attack: “According to the aspirations and intentions of the actor, it is possible to just press a key or initiate a sequence of commands, and the conversion between cyber surveillance and cyber attack is immediately completed.” The authors conclude that the relationship between cyber espionage and combat cannot be severed.96 In addition, OPE can erode the distinction between peacetime and conflict in cyberspace. The 2017 Science of Military Strategy published by the National Defense University indicates that, “compared to traditional domains, the boundary between war and peace in the cyber domain is fuzzier.” The book describes the lack of clear boundaries as follows: “cyber and electronic domain warfare already exists in peacetime; when war is imminent (linzhan) it becomes more intense; [and] often sustained confrontation directly merges into actual war.”97 These views are repeated in a revised edition of the book published in 2020.98 Two PLA authors affiliated with the former General Staff Research Institute argue that one reason for the blurred boundary between war and peace in cyberspace is that “‘backdoors’ and ‘exploits’ are pre-placed in an enemy’s network systems early; it is very difficult to determine from which moment war begins.”99 This view contrasts with US Cyber Command’s views of a clearer threshold of armed conflict in cyberspace.\nAs in the United States, PLA texts indicate that China intends to conduct offensive cyber operations. OPE will therefore likely be necessary to target the high-value military and civilian critical infrastructure networks that could contribute to crisis instability. A 2013 Academy of Military Science textbook This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM describes “‘soft’ paralysis of the information network nodes of adversary warfare systems” that the PLA could implement alongside kinetic attacks and psychological operations in a future joint information operations campaign. The book indicates that the PLA would need to “completely analyze the structure and relationship of interconnections and restrictions among the adversary’s systems for command and control, intelligence and warning, and firepower attack (huoli daji), and their support and sustainment,” to select the appropriate means for offensive cyber attacks. Those means include offensive cyber operations that would require OPE: “systems intrusion, computer virus attacks, attacks to cut off servers, and network deception attacks.” The book indicates that PLA attacks would not be limited to military networks, but could also “infiltrate, attack, and paralyze the adversary’s important civilian networks (minyong wangluo xitong).”¹⁰⁰ The PLA has moderated its expectations of the ease and effectiveness of such attacks as it has learned more about offensive cyber operations over time.¹⁰¹ But has by no means taken them off the table, as demonstrated by its ongoing exploitation of Taiwanese critical infrastructure, and Indian critical infrastructure networks during the conflict along the Sino-Indian border in 2020.¹⁰² ## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risk PLA texts do not discuss the danger of the OPE-espionage distinction problem and the risk of escalation if an intrusion is discovered in a crisis. It is unclear whether Chinese decision-makers have implemented procedures for managing inadvertent escalation risks posed by its cyber operations. Past PLA writings do not indicate that managing those risks was a priority in organizational procedures for cyber operations. This inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks specifically is surprising given that China has paid increasing attention to three other types of escalation risks: deliberate cyber attacks that could result in an adversary overreaction, unauthorized and accidental cyber attacks perpetrated by the PLA, and the potential for North Korean cyber attacks to be mis-attributed to China and draw it into a conflict with one of Pyongyang’s enemies.\nThe 2013 Science of Military Strategy indicates that “every country in the world is conducting cyber reconnaissance activities of differing degrees, but the possibility of this triggering a bilateral crisis, or a war starting because of this reason, is not high.”¹⁰³ The authors do not reconcile this observation with their observation that cyber surveillance and attack are indistinguishable. Similarly, the Academy of Military Science expert writing in 2016 warned of escalation risks from cyber operations that are too weak or too strong in their This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD effects on an adversary. The expert called for unified control over all aspects of cyber operations but did not recognize the possibility that espionage could be misperceived as OPE and prompt an adversary to use force.¹⁰⁴ Chinese researchers writing for academic and policy audiences vary in their assessments of whether cyber operations in general contribute to crisis instability, but they also do not pay specific attention to the OPE inadvertent escalation pathway. Associate Professor Liu Yangyue at the National University of Defense Technology is generally sanguine about the effects of cyber operations on strategic stability. He dismisses the argument in Western literature that a state could escalate in response to an initial cyber attack to stop an adversary from conducting further attacks.¹⁰⁵ Drawing on the same observational data used in Western cyber security scholarship, he argues that “when they face cyber attacks (believed to come from their enemies), states do not inevitably make worst-case calculations in their style of behavior, or let this guide their policies for responding.”¹⁰⁶ Similarly, Li Bin and Zhao Tong report that: Some Chinese experts have challenged the popular view that cyber technology will negatively affect crisis stability, because they believe this conclusion is based completely on logical deduction, instead of empirical evidence. These experts have noted that states are usually very cautious about launching military retaliations to cyber attacks, and it is very rare for cyber attacks to lead to escalation.¹⁰⁷ Nevertheless, Liu does express concern about the escalation risks posed by the difficulty of attribution. Citing the example of the Solar Sunrise intrusion discovered prior to US airstrikes against Iraq in 1998, he argues that if third-party espionage or OPE “is coincidentally discovered during a military mission, or the attacker uses more sophisticated means to conceal their identity, then this kind of attack could become a fuse for an unintended crisis.”¹⁰⁸ Other Chinese scholars are less sanguine about the escalation risks in cyberspace. But they tend to focus on the use-or-lose incentives to carry out cyber attacks early in a crisis or conflict, rather than inadvertent escalation due to the discovery of an intrusion.¹⁰⁹ PRC experts have also expressed concern about the US concept of “cross-domain deterrence,” which they interpret as threats to use conventional military operations (or even nuclear threats) to retaliate for cyber attacks.¹¹⁰ The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Ariel Levite and former PLA Col. Lyu Jinghua wrote in China Military Science that in a Sino-American conflict scenario, “one of the earliest and most destabilising venues for conflict would be cyberspace, thanks to the potential military utility of early employment of cyber assets.” Levite and Lyu acknowledge that “cyber This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM actions in these scenarios also hold serious escalatory potential, complicating the challenges of keeping conflicts below the level of outright military confrontation.” They acknowledge the OPE inadvertent escalation risk, but only briefly: “intelligence operations to monitor these networks might be misinterpreted as attacks on them, or at least attack preparations.”¹¹¹ It is unclear whether PLA planning for offensive cyber operations accounts for the escalation risks associated with OPE and, if so, how those risks are managed. The PLA promulgated a new generation of doctrine in November 2020, the first update to its official doctrine since 1999.¹¹² Unfortunately, no information about their content was available at the time of writing. Up until at least 2015, official PLA doctrine for offensive cyber operations was likely covered by doctrine for information operations, which combined electronic, cyber, and kinetic attacks.¹¹³ PLA texts published before 2015 hinted that, in the future, the PLA might have operational doctrine for stand-alone cyber operations as well as joint information operations involving cyber attacks.¹¹⁴ The PLA established the Strategic Support Force (SSF) in 2015–2016, during one of the most significant set of reforms in its history. The SSF consolidated most existing PLA cyber offense, defense, and espionage units from separate parts of its former General Staff Department and services into a Network Systems Department within the Strategic Support Force. Before the reforms, the PLA General Staff Department’s Third Department was believed to be the primary organization for cyber espionage within the PLA, while the Fourth Department was believed to have primary responsibility for offensive cyber operations.¹¹⁵ The consolidation of the former Third and Fourth departments into one organization is likely to enable the PLA to better integrate cyber operations for espionage and attack.¹¹⁶ These new organizational arrangements for military cyber operations should in theory improve the ability of top leaders to recognize and manage the crisis escalation risks associated with OPE. One of the key effects, if not drivers, of the consolidation of Chinese military cyber forces into the SSF is to enable top military leaders to exercise stricter oversight over PLA cyber operations to prevent accidental and unauthorized cyber attacks.¹¹⁷ Indeed, PLA writings published around the time the SSF was created emphasize the principle of “unified command” (tongyi zhihui) of cyber offense, defense, espionage, and control, and both PLA and non-PLA cyber capabilities.¹¹⁸ Details of how this principle of unified command is implemented in practice are scarce. Moreover, the ability of the new command structure to manage escalation risks in practice might have taken a back seat to other force building priorities. For example, the PLA’s efforts to guard against unauthorized and accidental use of cyber operations is in tension with its efforts to recruit the best cyber talent from outside This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD of the PLA. The SSF's use of contractors may revive many of the problems with oversight of cyber operations that China's leaders encountered prior to the 2015–2016 reforms.^[119]^ The nature and extent of leadership oversight of PLA cyber operations are difficult to determine. It is possible that China has established a formal institutional structure for inter-agency vetting of military plans and operations that crosses civilian and military lines. Drawing on a PLA publication about cyber operations published in 2017, John Chen, Joe McReynolds, and Kieran Green observe that “peacetime planning and guidance of cyberspace operations... at the strategic level rest in the hands of such national network security leadership organizations as the [Communist Party] Cybersecurity and Informatization Commission, while planning and guidance during wartime are the responsibility of the [PLA] CMC Joint Operations Command Center.”^[120]^ In other words, a civilian Party body takes the lead in peacetime and the PLA’s Central Military Commission takes the lead in wartime. It remains unclear how this dual command structure functions in practice. Most importantly, it remains unclear whether and, if so, to what degree managing inadvertent escalation risks resulting from OPE is a priority for the military and civilian leaders with oversight over PLA cyber operations.\n## Capabilities for Managing Cyber Risk China is developing cyber situational awareness capabilities, including attribution capabilities. But they likely lag behind the United States in its development of capabilities that could disambiguate between attackers and mitigate inadvertent escalation risks. An official white paper outlining China’s international cyberspace strategy published in 2017 indicated that: [China] will expedite the development of a [military] cyber force and enhance capabilities in terms of situational awareness, cyber defense, supporting state activities and participating in international cooperation, to prevent major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security, and maintain national security and social stability.^[121]^ It is difficult to assess the extent of improvement in China’s attribution and defense capabilities since adopting these priorities in 2015. The Chinese government’s procedures for defending its networks are unclear and it has not publicly attributed cyber attacks to another state. Nevertheless, in 2018 Xi Jinping acknowledged the deterrent effect of China’s improved capability to detect intruders.^[122]^ Some Chinese cyber security firms have begun to publicly This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM attribute intrusions to known groups of hackers using industry identifiers.¹²³ They have also called for greater efforts to prevent OPE within critical infrastructure networks. For example, the Chinese company Antiy argued that China needed to “make progress in weakening the ability of an adversary to ‘prepare the battlefield’ in our industrial control [systems] and infrastructure to achieve [serious] consequences.”¹²⁴ ## Misperception in the Sino-American Cyber Relationship Do the United States and China have a shared understanding of the nature of cyber conflict, the role of OPE, and the potential for crisis instability because of the OPE-espionage distinction problem? Comparing US and Chinese approaches to cyber conflict reveals some similarities, as well as differences that could hamper future bilateral efforts to manage cyber escalation risks. Both countries recognize that OPE is necessary for sophisticated offensive cyber operations yet is indistinguishable from intrusions for the purpose of espionage, defense, or data theft. Both countries view the presence of nation-state hackers in their networks as threatening. But the two countries do not appear to share an understanding of the inadvertent escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem or the clarity of the threshold of an armed attack in cyberspace.\nThe comparison also reveals asymmetries in the relative maturity of cyber doctrine and capabilities in both countries. These asymmetries might explain the lack of attention to inadvertent escalation risks in China’s approach to cyber conflict. China’s doctrine, procedures, and authorities for conducting cyber operations appear to have been overhauled by the 2015–2016 PLA reforms and took some years afterwards to crystallize into their current form. As a result, the PLA has less experience integrating espionage, offensive, and defensive cyber operations and incorporating civilian oversight into its cyber operations than the United States. The PLA operational regulations promulgated in late 2020 might have included more guidance on OPE and managing its escalation risks that is not reflected in the sources examined here. Meanwhile, US cyber capabilities and strategy are relatively more mature. US organizations demonstrate growing confidence in attribution capabilities, the clarity of escalation thresholds, and US ability to control escalation from OPE or low-level cyber attacks. These factors have led to a doctrine for cyber operations that gives the military a freer hand.\nNeither China nor the United States appears to be overly concerned about its espionage activities being misperceived as OPE during a crisis, albeit for different reasons. On the one hand, China appears to be inattentive to the specific This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD escalation risks posed by OPE. On the other hand, the United States appears to be aware of the specific escalation risks associated with OPE but is confident that they can be mitigated. This suggests that both states might approach a crisis confident that their intrusions will not be discovered, misperceived, or lead to the use of force. The PLA's attention to the escalation risks associated with OPE might increase as Chinese cyber doctrine and capabilities further develop. But increased awareness is by no means a given. Chinese experts and writings on crisis management and nuclear strategy – areas where PLA doctrine and capabilities are more mature – have also tended to downplay drivers of inadvertent escalation.\nOf course, the lack of concern about the escalation risks associated with OPE could reflect a shared lack of concern that cyber attacks could cause much harm in a crisis, supporting the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. OPE may simply be accepted practice between these two countries.[125] They might expect that some of their key networks will be disabled by their adversaries' offensive cyber operations during future conflicts. They might prepare to fight without those networks instead of pre-empting cyber attacks that could disable them. We are cautious, however, about interpreting the evidence as confirmation of the bluster hypothesis. Evidence that China both acknowledges and shares US confidence that inadvertent cyber escalation risks can be managed – which we did not find – would have reduced the need for caution in interpreting the evidence in favor of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis.\n## Initiatives to Mitigate Misperceptions In the absence of a shared understanding of cyber conflict, two initiatives could reduce the risk of inadvertent cyber escalation via the misperception pathway in a future Sino-American crisis: dialogue to ensure that both parties understand each other's approach to cyber operations, and a crisis communication mechanism specific to cyber operations. Dialogue and crisis communication could reduce the likelihood of either side misperceiving the other's cyber intrusion as OPE, or as confirmation of the other's hostile intentions, because of differences in their understandings of cyber conflict and operations.[126] Unfortunately, China and the United States do not currently have an official military cyber dialogue that could bridge some of the gaps in their understandings of military cyber operations before a crisis emerges, despite establishing official dialogues to enable cooperation in non-military areas of the cyber relationship in 2015. Nor do China and the United States currently have a mechanism in place for crisis communications dedicated to cyber matters. By contrast, the United States has a three-tier cyber communications protocol in This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM place with Russia that involves a direct line between the White House and the Kremlin.¹²⁷ ## Conclusion Could military cyber capabilities contribute to the outbreak of conflict in a future crisis involving the United States and China? Although our empirical analysis is unable to provide a definitive answer to this question, it provides enough evidence to suggest that inadvertent escalation could occur if one state discovered the other's cyber intrusions in a crisis. Over the past decade or so, the United States has made unilateral attempts to limit the risks of inadvertent escalation occurring, first with strict organizational procedures governing all cyber operations and later with more robust operational procedures to defend its networks. There is little evidence that China has taken similar steps to unilaterally mitigate inadvertent escalation risks from cyber operations. The bilateral cyber relationship also lacks the shared understandings of these risks, and mechanisms for dialogue in peacetime or communications in crises, that could improve crisis stability.\nEven a small probability of inadvertent escalation could have extremely serious consequences, given how destructive a Sino-American conflict could be and the variety of other escalation risks present in the relationship. Our empirical analysis could also support the claim that cyber capabilities do not pose a serious enough threat for decision-makers to use force – whether cyber or kinetic – to pre-empt or retaliate. However, in the absence of stronger evidence to support this bluster hypothesis, we do not dismiss the risk that the OPE-espionage distinction problem could add to crisis instability given the stakes at hand.\nThis chapter suggests that further research is needed to establish whether US confidence that cyber operations do not add to crisis stability is well founded. US adversaries' reluctance to escalate in response to cyber attacks or intrusions might reflect their countervailing strategic and political disincentives to escalate, rather than the stabilizing nature of cyber operations.¹²⁸ Brandon Valeriano, Benjamin M. Jensen, and Ryan C. Maness find that the United States has been successful in using cyberspace to coerce adversaries.¹²⁹ Scholars have pointed out that cyber operations are likely to have their greatest effects on international relations when combined with superior conventional military power.¹³⁰ The possibility that US conventional military power might mask the destabilizing effects of cyber operations suggests that the United States should be cautious as Chinese conventional military capabilities improve. If a Sino-American crisis had occurred during the past decade, Beijing would have This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD faced strong countervailing pressures not to use force in response to a cyber intrusion, even if it judged that intrusion to pose a serious threat. Going forward, even if the PRC views an intrusion as a serious but manageable threat, its growing conventional capabilities and tense relationship with Washington could create an excuse for deliberate PRC escalation. And if the intrusion were intolerable, political and strategic disincentives could not be counted on to restrain China's leaders from using force."

Cunningham\nIn the context of an increasingly competitive Sino-American relationship, US analysts are increasingly concerned about crisis instability, defined as the temptation for either country to use force rather than continue to bargain diplomatically during a crisis. Scholars and analysts focused on the US-China relationship have warned that cyber capabilities could add incentives for either the United States or China to use force in a crisis. Despite these concerns, there is no consensus among cyber scholars that offensive cyber capabilities contribute to the risk of great-power political crises escalating into conflicts.\nAs the previous chapter by Jason Healey and Robert Jervis has shown, certain features of cyber capabilities could create new pathways through which a great-power crisis could escalate into a conventional conflict.\nThis chapter examines one of these novel escalation pathways in the context of the Sino-American relationship: the difficulty of distinguishing between hacking for espionage and operational preparation of the environment (OPE), an essential precursor to most high-end cyber attacks. This OPE-espionage distinction problem creates pathways for inadvertent escalation, which occurs \"when a combatant deliberately takes actions that it does not perceive to be escalatory but are interpreted that way by the enemy,\" during a crisis or conflict. A state could correctly detect an adversary's OPE and, fearing an imminent cyber attack with severe consequences, choose to use force first, escalating the conflict with a cyber or even kinetic attack. But a state could also misperceive an adversary's efforts to collect intelligence via cyber means as OPE and pre-empt that attack with conventional or cyber attacks of its own. A state discovering that its adversary has intruded into its nuclear command, control, and communications networks during a crisis presents a particularly concerning scenario.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nDespite these concerns, academic studies based on observational data, surveys, and simulations find little correlation between cyber attacks and escalation, either in peacetime or during conflicts.6 Scholars have reasoned that most cyber attacks are simply not destructive enough to worsen crisis or conflict outcomes.7 These limited effects, coupled with the bloodless, secret nature of cyber attacks, might instead open up new pathways for de-escalation and enhance crisis stability.8 However, the external validity of existing empirical findings to military crises among great powers is limited because no such crisis has occurred in the past two decades and they are difficult to replicate in surveys, simulations, and wargames.9\nTo evaluate the diverging concerns of the US policy community and the ongoing scholarly debates on cyber escalation and crisis instability among great powers, this chapter examines the escalation risks created by OPE in a future crisis scenario involving the United States and China. Scholars have already identified several sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship, including a systematic lack of attention among Chinese experts to inadvertent escalation risks in the nuclear, conventional, and space domains.10 A Sino-American crisis scenario is a most likely case for theoretical claims that cyber capabilities create novel escalation risks. Both countries would be most likely to react to any independent effect of cyber technology on their incentives to use force, if such incentives exist, in a crisis. Indeed, scholars have already raised concerns that cyber capabilities could fuel Sino-American crisis instability, although they have not examined the OPE-espionage distinction problem in much detail.11 To assess the escalation risks posed by this problem, we follow the methodological approach of scholars who have examined other sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship. Specifically, we examine the two countries' leadership statements, threat perceptions, procedures for authorizing cyber operations, organizational structures, capabilities, and policies for evidence that they create, recognize, and seek to manage escalatory risks.\nOur analysis suggests that inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE would be present in a future Sino-American crisis scenario. Official US policy for offensive cyber operations recognizes the escalation risks associated with cyber espionage being mistaken for OPE, but recent changes to US cyber strategy may increase these risks. Meanwhile, Chinese writings recognize the difficulty of distinguishing between cyber attacks and OPE but appear to ignore the consequences for crisis instability. We also find that a lack of mutual understanding in the Sino-American cyber relationship adds to the likelihood of the two countries misperceiving each other's behavior.\nOur empirical findings have two key limitations. First, our sources are scarce, imperfect, and some years old, especially on the Chinese side. We\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\nfollow best practices for using open sources to analyze Chinese military strategy, but caution is still needed when drawing conclusions from such sources. Nevertheless, these sources still make a valuable contribution to existing policy debates and scholarly research about cyber conflict, which rarely draws on Chinese perspectives. Second, our empirical findings could support the claim that cyber technology either does – or does not – add to crisis instability. Leaders from both countries might choose to ignore the escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem even if they are present. But neither country's relaxed approach to these risks is justified by a careful assessment of the independent effect of cyber technology on an adversary's incentives to use force in a crisis, which makes us hesitant to dismiss them.\nThis chapter begins with a brief explanation of OPE as a distinctive feature of cyber attacks. The second section outlines the competing hypotheses about cyber escalation in existing scholarly literature and the mechanisms that could link detection of an intrusion in a crisis with the decision to use force. The third, fourth, and fifth sections examine the evidence for these hypotheses in US documents and statements, Chinese writings and organizational practices, and the bilateral cyber relationship, respectively. The sixth section evaluates the escalation risks.\n## Operational Preparation of the Environment\nPerforming OPE is essential to enabling significant cyber operations that could have strategic effects on the target. To develop a cyber capability with a potent or customized effect on a target network, substantial reconnaissance and preparation are required from within that targeted network. In 2010, the Department of Defense defined \"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment\" as:\nNon-intelligence enabling functions within cyberspace conducted to plan and prepare for potential follow-up military operations. [Cyber-OPE] includes but is not limited to identifying data, system/network configurations, or physical structures . . . for the purpose of determining system vulnerabilities; and actions taken to assure future access and/or control of the system, network, or data during anticipated hostilities.\nWhile cyber OPE has analogues in other forms of military operations – especially in the world of special operations and covert action – it differs from operations that are more familiar to policymakers, such as conventional and nuclear operations. Preparations to use cyber capabilities have different recon\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nnaissance requirements than most other operations.¹⁴ Much of the development and preparation for a cyber operation requires access to or occurs within adversary networks. Moreover, the accesses and payloads that make offensive cyber operations possible are often specific to a particular network.¹⁵\nGaining and maintaining access to a target network is also generally difficult, resource intensive, and specific to the target network.¹⁶ Overall, the effects of an attack, the ability to sustain those effects over time, and the ability of an attack to limit unintended consequences all depend on how well the attacker has prepared and understood the target network and the likely actions of the network's defenders once the attack commences.¹⁷\nA few examples illustrate the importance of OPE to sophisticated offensive cyber operations. Stuxnet was enabled by months if not years of reconnaissance, while Iranian hackers spent months inside the computer networks of Sands Casino and Saudi Aramco before they attacked in 2012.¹⁸ North Korean hackers did the same with their attacks on the computer networks of Sony Pictures.¹⁹ Russian hackers prepared in a similar way for their NotPetya operation, which reportedly inflicted over $10 billion in damage.²⁰ Some attacks, most notably denial-of-service efforts, do not fit into this trend, but lack potency as a result.²¹\nOPE is also difficult to distinguish from espionage once it is discovered by a target. In theory, there might be ways for a target to tell whether an intrusion is espionage or whether it facilitates an attack. But there are no foolproof solutions to this OPE-espionage distinction problem. For example, an uptick in communication between the attacker and malicious code implanted in the target system could signal its purpose, but an attack could occur without any of those signals. Those signals could also accompany routine intelligence collection.²² Even if an attacker tries to use those signals to distinguish OPE from espionage, the target may not receive those signals or treat them as credible.²³ The nature of the target network may provide some hints – for example, critical infrastructure industrial control systems are more likely to be exploited for OPE than intelligence gathering – but this is not always the case.²⁴ Moreover, the exploitation of an adversary's networks for intelligence gathering could be repurposed for OPE without any tell-tale signs that the target might detect. For example, there is some evidence to suggest that the first blackout in Ukraine began with an espionage objective but later morphed into an attack operation.²⁵\n## The Novel Escalation Risks of OPE\nHow and why could an intrusion discovered in the midst of a crisis between two great powers create incentives for the use of force? How and why might\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\ndecision-makers choose to use force when faced with those incentives? Answers to these questions are key to understanding the potential for cyber operations to contribute to crisis instability -- or stability.\nWe define a crisis as “a confrontation between two states involving a serious threat to vital national interests for both sides in which there is the expectation of a short time for resolution, and in which there is understood to be a sharply increased risk of war.” We define escalation as “an increase in the intensity or scope of conflict that crosses threshold(s) considered significant by one or more of the participants.” In a great-power crisis, escalation would involve the use of force, with either cyber or kinetic attacks. We use the term “cyber escalation risks” to refer to an increased temptation to use force in a crisis due to the nature of cyber technology.\nIf decision-makers discover an intrusion into their key military or civilian networks during a crisis, most scholars agree that those decision-makers could not rule out the possibility that the intrusion enables OPE. The decision-makers' response to that discovery will depend on how they assess the seriousness of the threat posed by the intrusion and whether the state also has strategic or political incentives to use force. The interaction of these two factors suggests four possibilities: the inadvertent escalation and deliberate escalation hypotheses that expect the use of force, and the bluster and countervailing hypotheses that do not expect the use of force. We focus on the logic underpinning the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it best represents the concerns in current US policy debates about the destabilizing effect of cyber technology in a future Sino-American crisis.\n### Intrusion Detection in a Crisis\nThe scenario in which OPE could trigger the use of force in a crisis would likely begin months if not years before the crisis. An adversary that wants the option to carry out offensive cyber operations in a future conflict against a state's important military or civilian networks would conduct OPE during peacetime. Once a crisis has begun it is almost certainly too late to complete this complex, time-consuming task.\nOnce a political crisis began -- for example, over an accidental collision between two rivals' military aircraft, the scenario that triggered the last Sino-American crisis in 2001 -- decision-makers in both states would have to decide whether to back down, bargain diplomatically, or bargain with the use of force. During their deliberations, the target state's decision-makers might discover their adversary's intrusions into important computer networks, including those that might be OPE. Such discoveries are more likely in a crisis\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nbecause states anticipate espionage and attacks in that context and will step up network defenses accordingly.³⁰ If target’s decision-makers decide it is most prudent to treat the intrusion as OPE, and they believe that the intrusion poses a serious threat, the OPE-espionage distinction problem creates an incentive to use force rather than bargain diplomatically.\nMore generally, the OPE-espionage distinction problem complicates the task of the target’s decision-makers charged with assessing the intent behind the intrusion. Motivations for the intrusion include OPE, monitoring the target’s military operations, or gathering intelligence about its offensive cyber operations.³¹ The specifics of the intrusion may provide some hints of intent but are unlikely to be definitive.³² Testing of small-scale attacks or an uptick in communication between the intruder and code it has implanted in the target system could also signal that it is OPE.³³ The intruder would also have difficulty reassuring the target state of its intent if the intrusion is for intelligence purposes.³⁴ To preserve its operational security, the intruder would have incentives not to acknowledge which adversary networks it has exploited and for what purpose, lest the target use that information to remove the intruder.³⁵ Even if the intruder sought to reassure the target of its intent not to use the intrusion to enable an attack, it would have trouble credibly committing not to use the intrusion for OPE in the future.\n## The Inadvertent Escalation Pathway\nThe claim that cyber operations create incentives to use force in a crisis is a specific instance of a general claim that military operations and technology can cause misperceptions among adversaries with serious consequences for crisis stability and intra-war escalation.³⁶ One potential consequence of those misperceptions is inadvertent escalation. The canonical scenario of inadvertent escalation is a conventional war among nuclear powers in which one party conducts “large-scale conventional operations that produce patterns of damage or threat to the major elements of a state’s nuclear force.”³⁷ The target state interprets the attack as a deliberate attempt to degrade its nuclear force and responds by using nuclear weapons or accelerating preparations for their use.³⁸ Similarly, escalation to the use of cyber or kinetic force could occur in a crisis as an unintended consequence of the normal conduct of cyber espionage.\nMisperceptions commonly associated with the security dilemma are one reason that inadvertent escalation could occur.³⁹ Specifically, the difficulty of distinguishing between an adversary’s offensive and defensive military operations is sufficient to produce misperceptions about the intent of the attacking state within the target state.⁴⁰ The attacking state’s conventional military\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\noperations could therefore make its adversary less secure in unintended ways,⁴¹ which creates an incentive for the target state to use force sooner rather than later.⁴² The target state need only calculate that its ability to achieve its conflict objectives will diminish in the future if it ignores the attacker’s actions in the present.⁴³\nThe OPE-espionage distinction problem could trigger the use of force if the target state’s leaders make worst-case-scenario assessments of the attacker’s intent and capability to damage an important information network. There are four mechanisms by which a state could make a worst-case-scenario assessment of the seriousness of the threat posed by an intrusion and decide to use force, whether a cyber or kinetic attack. First, a state that detects an adversary’s OPE might use force to pre-empt a cyber attack that could put the state at a military disadvantage in a future conflict.⁴⁴ Second, the combination of the crisis environment and the OPE-espionage distinction problem could lead the state to attribute aggressive intentions to the adversary with regards to both the network intrusion and the overall crisis, incentivizing the use of force.⁴⁵ Third, the discovery of an intrusion that might be OPE could affect decision-makers’ emotions in ways that make the use of force more likely.⁴⁶ Fourth, the uneven distribution of information about the nature of cyber operations in national security bureaucracies might make the use of force more likely when those bureaucracies discover intrusions in a crisis. Intrusions that some cyber specialists see as a routine part of cyber operations may alarm more senior generalists, especially in a crisis. Top decision-makers may not have sufficient knowledge or information to assess the risks posed by a cyber intrusion to their military capabilities.⁴⁷\n## The Deliberate Escalation Pathway\nStates might assess that a cyber intrusion poses a serious but tolerable threat yet choose to use force in response because they have strategic and political incentives to escalate. Those strategic and political incentives usually involve gaining a military advantage, signaling resolve, or pre-empting an adversary’s attempt to signal resolve by using force.⁴⁸ Scholars have questioned whether states make decisions to escalate because of the independent effects of technology alone. Based on historical case studies, Caitlin Talmadge argues that new technologies might not force decision-makers to take escalatory actions, but rather “seem likely to be an intervening variable.” States seek out new technologies to enable them to increase the risk of escalation, or turn to them opportunistically in a conflict, rather than their hands being forced to escalate in a crisis because they did not anticipate the escalatory pressures created\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nby their prior decisions to deploy certain military capabilities.⁴⁹ These actions involve deliberate escalation: “[when] a combatant deliberately increases the intensity or scope of an operation to gain an advantage or avoid defeat.”⁵⁰\n## The Bluster De-escalation Pathway\nDecision-makers may decide not to use force if they discover an intrusion in a crisis – even if they are confident that the intruder has performed OPE – because they do not think the intrusion poses a serious threat. This “bluster” hypothesis suggests that cyber technology does not contribute to crisis instability and might even help to stabilize crises. It draws on existing empirical research which indicates that cyber attacks are perceived to be more bluster than bite. States and individuals tend not to retaliate in response to cyber attacks.⁵¹ One explanation for this empirical finding is that decision-makers do not view cyber attacks as sufficiently damaging or destructive to warrant the use of force in response.⁵² Applying these arguments to a crisis scenario in which an intrusion is discovered, decision-makers might calculate that the cost of the cyber attack is likely to be low and can be absorbed. This explanation suggests that states would not anticipate a military disadvantage from a cyber attack, contrary to the military disadvantage mechanism outlined above.\nDecision-makers might even view cyber attacks as a signal that an adversary wants to avoid a conventional conflict. When the effects of cyber and kinetic attacks are held constant, Jacquelyn Schneider and Sarah Kreps found that US survey respondents were less likely to support retaliation for cyber attacks than kinetic attacks.⁵³ Decision-makers might therefore interpret the discovery of an intrusion as a signal of an adversary’s intent to avoid crossing the threshold of conventional armed conflict,⁵⁴ rather than its hostile intent, contrary to the misperception mechanism outlined above.\n## The Countervailing De-escalation Hypothesis\nFinally, decision-makers might view the intrusion as posing a serious threat but have countervailing political or strategic incentives not to respond with the use of force. Decision-makers could react to an intrusion in this de-escalatory manner if they want to defuse the crisis because, for example, the stakes of the crisis do not merit fighting a war, or if they lacked the conventional military power to achieve their political objectives if a conflict broke out. Decision-makers with multiple adversaries might also be wary of mis-attributing an intrusion carried out by one adversary to another if they cannot attribute the intrusion to its perpetrator with sufficient confidence in the time frame of the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\ncrisis.⁵⁵ Other countervailing incentives may also originate in domestic politics. The ambiguity of intent behind cyber intrusions could help more moderate decision-makers build a coalition for restraint in the crisis and counter pressure from decision-makers with more hawkish preferences.⁵⁶\n## Evaluating Cyber Escalation Hypotheses\nHow might scholars determine which of these four hypotheses is most likely in a great-power crisis, when no crisis has occurred since China and the United States were both armed with military cyber capabilities? There is no perfect solution to this problem. To complement existing empirical studies, most of which capture US popular or elite views of cyber escalation, our approach focuses on capturing both US and Chinese elite views by examining their approach to cyber OPE, escalation, and military operations.\nOur empirical analysis is guided by observable implications derived from the four hypotheses. The inadvertent escalation hypothesis would expect states to express concern about any intrusions into their networks and to recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. States might also recognize inadvertent escalation risks and take steps to manage cyber escalation risks in their procedures, authorities, and organizational structures for cyber operations. Inadvertent escalation is also more likely to occur when two states have a poor understanding of each other's cyber activities and lack crisis communications mechanisms to verify the nature of an intrusion. The bluster de-escalation hypothesis would expect states that possess good attribution capabilities, defend their networks against intrusions, and effectively repel intruders who do breach defenses to be more relaxed about discovering intrusions into their networks. Not only might they be less likely to experience worrying intrusions, but they might also be able to better assess the intent and the severity of the threat posed by an intrusion.\nWhile it is difficult to describe the strategic and political incentives that could provide evidence to support the deliberate escalation or countervailing hypotheses in a future crisis, some ex ante features of a great-power relationship would shape those incentives. Deliberate escalation is more likely to occur when the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally stronger than its adversary, does not confront multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has high political stakes in the crisis. The countervailing hypothesis is more likely to find support if the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally weaker than its adversary, faces multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has low political stakes in the crisis. A scenario in which the conventional military balance is roughly equal and both states see the conflict as high stakes\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nwould be the most likely case for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it minimizes countervailing political and strategic incentives to de-escalate if a threatening cyber intrusion is discovered in a crisis. A US-China crisis scenario is more evenly matched than most cyber dyads, although it would still involve some asymmetries in stakes and the conventional military balance that could obfuscate the independent effect of cyber technology on the temptation to use force in a crisis.^^\n## Escalation Risks in US Cyber Operations\nUS decision-makers recognize the inadvertent escalation risks posed by cyber operations, and OPE in particular, but they have taken steps to mitigate those risks. The Obama administration implemented organizational practices that carefully managed cyber operations that could produce escalation. The Trump administration relaxed those organizational practices after gaining confidence in operational practices. These practices provide evidence in favor of either the inadvertent escalation hypothesis or the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. As part of its more muscular approach, US Cyber Command has also concluded that most cyber intrusions could not produce serious enough effects to result in escalation. At first glance this judgment supports the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. But it could also support the countervailing de-escalation hypothesis. US adversaries might view its intrusions as very threatening but face disincentives to use force because of US conventional military preponderance.\n## Leadership Views of OPE\nThe public statements of leaders and government reactions to discoveries of intrusions into military networks indicate that the United States views intrusions as threatening, in part because they could be used either for OPE or intelligence gathering. After a Russian hack of Pentagon systems in 2015 that the United States was able to repel, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter summarized the American position aptly when he said, \"[It] can't be good for anybody to be inside of our networks - whatever their motivation.\"^^ Similarly, Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency (NSA) and US Cyber Command, and his adviser Michael Sulmeyer explained that the United States turned to a more aggressive policy \"to prevent toeholds from turning into beachheads so that a single compromise will not threaten the military's ability to accomplish its mission.\"^^\nWhile the details of most US responses to foreign hacking efforts are not public, two historical cases demonstrate that policymakers worried about the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\nimplications of minor intrusions. In a 1998 hack known as Solar Sunrise, intruders penetrated the US military's logistics and communications networks. The Joint Staff general in charge of information operations, John Campbell, worried that the breach would permit significant attacks, especially at a time of heightened tensions with Iraq. \"If you take one part of that machine, and disable it,\" he said, \"you've got a real problem trying to make a deployment take place.\"60 Campbell's comments reflect an assessment that the intrusion could have placed the United States at a military disadvantage in a conflict. The discovery did not take place during a major crisis and therefore lacked the time pressure element that would create incentives to use force. Nevertheless, an investigation concluded the breach was the work of three teenagers and their 20-year-old mentor after various parts of the US government had already spun up to prepare for a response.\nA second incident, Moonlight Maze, occurred in 1998 and 1999 and involved Russian penetration of unclassified American networks. The US government hacked back into Russian computers to gain more intelligence. One of the White House's top national security officials, Richard Clarke, labeled the activities \"cyberwar reconnaissance.\" Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre indicated that the United States was \"in the middle of a cyber war\" to the Intelligence Committees of Congress during a classified briefing.\n## OPE in Cyber Operations\nUS operators and decision-makers have recognized the need for OPE to conduct sophisticated cyber operations since at least 2010. The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a memo in 2010 mandating the use of the term \"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment,\" which referred to those cyber operations that serve \"as an enabling function for another military operation.\" From the earliest days of the US Cyber Command, secret documents – now declassified – indicated that conducting OPE was one of its core tasks.\nPlanners at the highest levels of the US government eventually recognized the importance of OPE. During the Obama administration, the most significant high-level document governing America's offensive cyber capability was Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20). The president signed the classified document in secret in the fall of 2012. The White House released a fact sheet that made no mention of offensive cyber capabilities, but the full classified document, leaked in 2013 by Edward Snowden, reveals a strategy that directly considers offensive action and contrasts it with other forms of cyber operations. The strategy lays out a clear typology of cyber activity. This includes \"cyber\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\ncollection,” which refers to intelligence-gathering activities for purposes other than offensive preparation. It also includes “non-intrusive defensive countermeasures,” meaning steps taken within one’s own network, such as deploying antivirus and other basic security measures. The document also introduces the concept of “Defensive Cyber Effects Operations,” defined as efforts that have an effect on an adversary’s computer systems – presumably, hacking or other interference – but only for the purposes of defense. PPD-20 provides high-level procedures for managing this kind of aggressive defensive action.⁶⁷\nMost significantly, though, the classified version of PPD-20 defines offensive action in some detail. It introduces the concept of “Offensive Cyber Effects Operations” (OCEO), which are distinct from cyber collection, non-intrusive defensive countermeasures, or defensive cyber effects operations. Instead, these efforts are designed to cause effects in adversary networks.⁶⁸ The document extols the unique virtues of these kinds of offensive cyber operations, which “can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance U.S. national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging.”⁶⁹\nPPD-20 acknowledges the need for OPE to realize these offensive options. It indicates that “the development and sustainment of [offensive cyber] capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist.”⁷⁰ PPD-20 directs the US government to begin this operational preparation. The relevant agencies “shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, [and] establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities.”⁷¹ With his signature, President Barack Obama authorized the preparatory activity.\n## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risks\nPPD-20 reveals US policymakers’ cognisance of the risks that arise from actually using offensive cyber capabilities. As a result, the document highlights a process to carefully manage offensive actions that might do serious harm or invite escalation. It emphasizes inter-agency coordination, balancing defense and national security interests with diplomatic and economic ones. Most notably, the process requires the highest level of executive branch oversight – presidential approval – for any cyber operation that is “reasonably likely to result in significant consequences.”⁷² This term is broadly defined: “Loss of life, significant responsive actions against the United States, significant damage to property, serious adverse U.S. foreign policy consequences, or serious\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\neconomic impact on the United States.”73 It is likely that cyber operations that do not meet that threshold could otherwise be approved by the agency carrying out the operation without such high-level inter-agency vetting.\nCrucially, PPD-20 does not limit these restrictions to cyber attacks but emphasizes that they apply to all cyber operations. In short, President Obama wanted direct oversight of any operation that might meet the threshold of significant consequences – regardless of whether that operation involved collecting intelligence, defending American computers, preparing an offensive capability, or launching an attack. The directive suggests that the Obama administration was concerned, at least in theory, about the risks of cyber escalation even as it appreciated the operational necessity to prepare offensive capabilities in advance.\nThe Trump administration adopted a more relaxed set of organizational procedures for managing cyber escalation risks. Upon unveiling its new national cyber strategy in 2018, the Trump White House criticized the preceding administration for what it saw as its overly cautious posture and promised to be more aggressive in its engagements with adversaries. Then-National Security Adviser John Bolton said, “Our hands are not tied as they were in the Obama administration.” Nor was the need for more aggressive action just a partisan view. In his confirmation hearing, the incoming NSA director and commander of US Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone warned that the United States had to do more because American adversaries “don’t fear us.”74\nThese views were translated into policy by President Donald Trump’s signature on “National Security Presidential Memorandum 13.” The goal of the memorandum, which remains classified, is to provide military commanders with greater flexibility to integrate cyber operations into their overall approach to warfighting and deterrence.75 By delegating this authority to the Pentagon, the Trump administration attempted to foster a faster and more aggressive process, one that would generate more operational effects more quickly. But this approach also rebalanced the trade-off between operational agility and whole-of-government coordination to manage cyber escalation risks in favor of the former. According to the general on the Joint Staff responsible for cyber operations, this change sharply contrasted with the Obama administration’s approach, which was “an interagency process that went through the National Security Council . . . to deputies’ committee to principals’ committee and [where], in effect, anyone could stop the process along the way.” Nor, he argued, was the distinction just semantics or bureaucratic minutia, but one that “makes all the difference in the world in terms of the speed at which you can move.”76\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nIt is unclear whether current US policy, set by the Trump memorandum, frees commanders to both prepare for and launch cyber capabilities. But there are hints that the memo and complementary legislative changes implemented by Congress provide a freer hand in developing the malicious code and gaining access to target networks required to provide commanders with offensive options. For example, in a media interview, the former deputy commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, indicated that changes to congressional legislation “freed us up to do some of the things, the operational preparation of the environment, that we were limited from doing outside of the counterterrorism mission and now can do much more broadly against all of our peers and competitors.” In addition, a New York Times story from June 2019 describes more aggressive American preparatory measures against the Russian power grid.\nOverall, the Trump administration was much less worried about the escalation risk associated with cyber operations than the Obama administration. The Biden administration appears to have largely continued this approach since taking office in 2021. Michael Daniel, the former coordinator for cyber security in the Obama White House, observed that the Trump administration was “willing to take more risks than previous administrations.” While the Trump administration's approach was untested in a crisis with a near‐peer competitor, it was informed by the US experience with cyber conflict over the past decade as well as the increasing risk tolerance of US decision‐makers. To justify its new posture, US Cyber Command has argued that “adversaries continuously operate against us below the threshold of armed conflict,” in what it described as a “new normal.” Moreover, the command argued that US efforts to counter this adversarial activity will not lead to retaliation in or outside of cyberspace that would cross that threshold.\nThese claims have been fiercely debated in the academic literature, with critics of the so‐called persistent engagement approach arguing that the new strategy could produce escalation. For example, some contend that the thresholds for armed conflict are not as clear as US Cyber Command has suggested. Others argue that persistent engagement creates too many red lines for adversaries and is therefore not a realistic means for shaping behavior. Nakasone and Sulmeyer responded to these concerns with reassurance that:“Cyber Command takes these concerns seriously, and reducing this risk is a critical part of the planning process. We are confident that this more proactive approach enables Cyber Command to conduct operations that impose costs while responsibly managing escalation.\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\n# Capabilities for Managing Escalation Risks\nIn the past decade, the United States has developed some of the world's most sophisticated cyber capabilities to better defend its networks, attribute intrusions, and expel intruders in peacetime. To better defend networks, the United States has invested in major systems, such as EINSTEIN 3, that aim to thwart intrusions. To improve rapid attribution of intrusions and increase situational awareness, the United States established various cross-agency working groups and bulked up teams within the NSA and US Cyber Command. To the extent that these capabilities are effective, they might mitigate cyber escalation risks by reducing the likelihood that intruders will successfully break into US networks and alarm policymakers who have to decide on how to respond within the compressed time period of a crisis. However, the compromise of SolarWinds network management system in 2021, which enabled Russian government operators to intrude into numerous US government systems for months without detection, suggests that defense and attribution capabilities are imperfect and do not eliminate the possibility of the United States discovering an intrusion during a crisis.\n# Escalation Risks in Chinese Cyber Operations\nThere is little evidence to indicate that China has scrutinized the inadvertent escalation risks posed by OPE as carefully as the United States, although Chinese sources bearing on this question are older, scarcer, and less authoritative than those for the United States.83 This lack of attention could be evidence of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis, as it might reflect a judgment that cyber intrusions pose a manageable threat to China's leaders. But this lack of concern should be interpreted in the context of a relative lack of concern about inadvertent escalation risks posed by nuclear, space, and conventional military operations among Chinese experts. As such, we favor the interpretation of China's inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks as support for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis. Inattention to the inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE could help to realize such risks in a crisis for three reasons. First, China is more likely to misperceive US cyber intrusions. Second, it is more likely to overlook the ways that its own cyber intrusions could be misperceived. Third, China is much less likely to take steps to mitigate these risks. Available sources provide little insight into whether the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has put in place organizational or operational practices to manage inadvertent cyber escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nLeadership Views of OPE\nChinese policymakers' fears about foreign hackers have grown in tandem with the expansion of the Chinese government's and military's dependence on computer networks. In a major speech on national cyber security policy in 2016, Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping stated that, “Cyber security has a strong covert character; a technological vulnerability or security risk can stay hidden for a number of years without being discovered.” As a result, “we do not know who came in, whether it was an enemy or a friend, or what they did.” Xi implied that while this enemy or friend's intrusion could remain “latent” inside a network for a long time, it could be “activated whenever (yidan jiu fazuo le).”84\nThe Chinese government has not publicly acknowledged any specific incidents in which it discovered that foreign state actors had exploited its government or military networks. China's closest analogue to the Solar Sunrise and Moonlight Maze incidents was Edward Snowden's revelations regarding US government surveillance of Chinese computer networks. Snowden's revelations are often cited by the country's cyber security scholars as evidence of China's vulnerability and the inadequacy of its network defenses, which failed to prevent or detect US government intrusions. Chinese experts claim that the NSA also targeted the country's military networks.85 A Chinese cyber security firm reported that the CIA had spied on Chinese state‐owned enterprises but did not identify any government networks penetrated.86 There is no detailed evidence about how the Chinese government responded to any of these incidents, nor did they occur in the context of a major crisis.\nChinese writings examining US cyber operations can provide insights into how Chinese experts view these operations in the absence of open discussions about these topics in China. Chinese experts affiliated with the PLA note that OPE is one of the cyber missions outlined in US doctrinal publications but do not mention the crisis escalation risks that could result from the OPE‐espionage distinction problem.87 While the Trump administration's more muscular approach to cyber operations raised concerns among Chinese authors for its emphasis on pre‐emption and potential to spark arms race instability, those experts are less focused on crisis instability than US scholars.88 There are some recent exceptions. For example, former PLA officer Lyu Jinghua writes that“it is worthwhile to explore whether the tension in cyberspace can be de‐escalated or whether the chances of the breakout of crisis can be lowered if there could be a basic consensus among countries that cyber activities\nconducted or supported by countries during peacetime are a contest of intelligence rather than conflicts or preparation of conflicts.\nIt remains unclear whether Chinese decision-makers share the views of experts who worry about the escalation risks of OPE and whether those concerns have led to practices to mitigate those risks.\n### OPE in Cyber Operations\nLike US officials, PLA strategists also distinguish between cyber surveillance, offense and defense, and deterrence as the main styles of cyber struggle. PLA texts do not use the term “operational preparation of the environment” when describing PLA operations, but they do recognize that effective offensive cyber operations require extensive advance preparation. A 2015 book authored by experts from the PLA Army Engineering University, 54th Institute, and other PLA organizations acknowledges that significant advance preparations are needed to ensure that cyber operations can be used to diminish an adversary's combat power. While many methods of attack are available, “a cyber attack capable of producing significant effects is a cyber attack for which ample preparations have already been made at an earlier time . . . it is not a decision that one makes as the situation requires.”\nPLA writings indicate that China places a similar degree of emphasis on OPE as the United States. The 2015 book characterizes OPE as more demanding than network exploitation for espionage:“It is necessary to carry out careful and meticulous reconnaissance and scanning of the target, in order to obtain even more detailed, specific information about it. As such, we must carry out deeper reconnaissance and scanning of the target, [and] the extent of secrecy and concealment [of those tasks] far exceeds the extent of carrying out [those] tasks for computer network exploitation.”\nBut reconnaissance and scanning are only the first steps in preparations for an attack. The authors emphasize the importance of obfuscation throughout the various procedures required to prepare for offensive cyber operations: selecting and employing a method of gaining access to the target network, moving laterally through it, gaining privileges, and maintaining access. An intrusion can serve multiple purposes: “attack actions occur after the intrusion of computer networks, escalating privileges and exfiltrating all required data.”\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nPLA writings recognize that holding targets at risk for the purpose of deterrence also requires OPE. An article outlining principles of cyber deterrence authored by an unnamed Academy of Military Science expert in 2016 indicated that successful cyber deterrence, which included carrying out coercive and retaliatory attacks, required “complete and meticulous preparation in peacetime.” Those preparations included “long-term, sustained network reconnaissance” to become familiar with an adversary’s network situation, map the structure of its networks, and discover hardware and software vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be used to leave backdoors, set up “springboards,” and install logic bombs and Trojan horses “to retain points of penetration to launch future cyber attacks.”95\nPLA texts recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. The 2013 Science of Military Strategy published by the Academy of Military Science acknowledges that, “from a technological perspective, the principles of the task (gongzuo yuanli) of cyber surveillance and cyber attacks are essentially identical.” The book explains: “cyber surveillance means and methods are often also the means and methods of cyber attacks.” Furthermore, it highlights that cyber espionage can easily be turned into an attack: “According to the aspirations and intentions of the actor, it is possible to just press a key or initiate a sequence of commands, and the conversion between cyber surveillance and cyber attack is immediately completed.” The authors conclude that the relationship between cyber espionage and combat cannot be severed.96\nIn addition, OPE can erode the distinction between peacetime and conflict in cyberspace. The 2017 Science of Military Strategy published by the National Defense University indicates that, “compared to traditional domains, the boundary between war and peace in the cyber domain is fuzzier.” The book describes the lack of clear boundaries as follows: “cyber and electronic domain warfare already exists in peacetime; when war is imminent (linzhan) it becomes more intense; [and] often sustained confrontation directly merges into actual war.”97 These views are repeated in a revised edition of the book published in 2020.98 Two PLA authors affiliated with the former General Staff Research Institute argue that one reason for the blurred boundary between war and peace in cyberspace is that “‘backdoors’ and ‘exploits’ are pre-placed in an enemy’s network systems early; it is very difficult to determine from which moment war begins.”99 This view contrasts with US Cyber Command’s views of a clearer threshold of armed conflict in cyberspace.\nAs in the United States, PLA texts indicate that China intends to conduct offensive cyber operations. OPE will therefore likely be necessary to target the high-value military and civilian critical infrastructure networks that could contribute to crisis instability. A 2013 Academy of Military Science textbook\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\ndescribes “‘soft’ paralysis of the information network nodes of adversary warfare systems” that the PLA could implement alongside kinetic attacks and psychological operations in a future joint information operations campaign. The book indicates that the PLA would need to “completely analyze the structure and relationship of interconnections and restrictions among the adversary’s systems for command and control, intelligence and warning, and firepower attack (huoli daji), and their support and sustainment,” to select the appropriate means for offensive cyber attacks. Those means include offensive cyber operations that would require OPE: “systems intrusion, computer virus attacks, attacks to cut off servers, and network deception attacks.” The book indicates that PLA attacks would not be limited to military networks, but could also “infiltrate, attack, and paralyze the adversary’s important civilian networks (minyong wangluo xitong).”¹⁰⁰ The PLA has moderated its expectations of the ease and effectiveness of such attacks as it has learned more about offensive cyber operations over time.¹⁰¹ But has by no means taken them off the table, as demonstrated by its ongoing exploitation of Taiwanese critical infrastructure, and Indian critical infrastructure networks during the conflict along the Sino-Indian border in 2020.¹⁰²\n## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risk\nPLA texts do not discuss the danger of the OPE-espionage distinction problem and the risk of escalation if an intrusion is discovered in a crisis. It is unclear whether Chinese decision-makers have implemented procedures for managing inadvertent escalation risks posed by its cyber operations. Past PLA writings do not indicate that managing those risks was a priority in organizational procedures for cyber operations. This inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks specifically is surprising given that China has paid increasing attention to three other types of escalation risks: deliberate cyber attacks that could result in an adversary overreaction, unauthorized and accidental cyber attacks perpetrated by the PLA, and the potential for North Korean cyber attacks to be mis-attributed to China and draw it into a conflict with one of Pyongyang’s enemies.\nThe 2013 Science of Military Strategy indicates that “every country in the world is conducting cyber reconnaissance activities of differing degrees, but the possibility of this triggering a bilateral crisis, or a war starting because of this reason, is not high.”¹⁰³ The authors do not reconcile this observation with their observation that cyber surveillance and attack are indistinguishable. Similarly, the Academy of Military Science expert writing in 2016 warned of escalation risks from cyber operations that are too weak or too strong in their\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\neffects on an adversary. The expert called for unified control over all aspects of cyber operations but did not recognize the possibility that espionage could be misperceived as OPE and prompt an adversary to use force.¹⁰⁴\nChinese researchers writing for academic and policy audiences vary in their assessments of whether cyber operations in general contribute to crisis instability, but they also do not pay specific attention to the OPE inadvertent escalation pathway. Associate Professor Liu Yangyue at the National University of Defense Technology is generally sanguine about the effects of cyber operations on strategic stability. He dismisses the argument in Western literature that a state could escalate in response to an initial cyber attack to stop an adversary from conducting further attacks.¹⁰⁵ Drawing on the same observational data used in Western cyber security scholarship, he argues that “when they face cyber attacks (believed to come from their enemies), states do not inevitably make worst-case calculations in their style of behavior, or let this guide their policies for responding.”¹⁰⁶ Similarly, Li Bin and Zhao Tong report that:\nSome Chinese experts have challenged the popular view that cyber technology will negatively affect crisis stability, because they believe this conclusion is based completely on logical deduction, instead of empirical evidence. These experts have noted that states are usually very cautious about launching military retaliations to cyber attacks, and it is very rare for cyber attacks to lead to escalation.¹⁰⁷\nNevertheless, Liu does express concern about the escalation risks posed by the difficulty of attribution. Citing the example of the Solar Sunrise intrusion discovered prior to US airstrikes against Iraq in 1998, he argues that if third-party espionage or OPE “is coincidentally discovered during a military mission, or the attacker uses more sophisticated means to conceal their identity, then this kind of attack could become a fuse for an unintended crisis.”¹⁰⁸\nOther Chinese scholars are less sanguine about the escalation risks in cyberspace. But they tend to focus on the use-or-lose incentives to carry out cyber attacks early in a crisis or conflict, rather than inadvertent escalation due to the discovery of an intrusion.¹⁰⁹ PRC experts have also expressed concern about the US concept of “cross-domain deterrence,” which they interpret as threats to use conventional military operations (or even nuclear threats) to retaliate for cyber attacks.¹¹⁰ The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Ariel Levite and former PLA Col. Lyu Jinghua wrote in China Military Science that in a Sino-American conflict scenario, “one of the earliest and most destabilising venues for conflict would be cyberspace, thanks to the potential military utility of early employment of cyber assets.” Levite and Lyu acknowledge that “cyber\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\nactions in these scenarios also hold serious escalatory potential, complicating the challenges of keeping conflicts below the level of outright military confrontation.” They acknowledge the OPE inadvertent escalation risk, but only briefly: “intelligence operations to monitor these networks might be misinterpreted as attacks on them, or at least attack preparations.”¹¹¹\nIt is unclear whether PLA planning for offensive cyber operations accounts for the escalation risks associated with OPE and, if so, how those risks are managed. The PLA promulgated a new generation of doctrine in November 2020, the first update to its official doctrine since 1999.¹¹² Unfortunately, no information about their content was available at the time of writing. Up until at least 2015, official PLA doctrine for offensive cyber operations was likely covered by doctrine for information operations, which combined electronic, cyber, and kinetic attacks.¹¹³ PLA texts published before 2015 hinted that, in the future, the PLA might have operational doctrine for stand-alone cyber operations as well as joint information operations involving cyber attacks.¹¹⁴\nThe PLA established the Strategic Support Force (SSF) in 2015–2016, during one of the most significant set of reforms in its history. The SSF consolidated most existing PLA cyber offense, defense, and espionage units from separate parts of its former General Staff Department and services into a Network Systems Department within the Strategic Support Force. Before the reforms, the PLA General Staff Department’s Third Department was believed to be the primary organization for cyber espionage within the PLA, while the Fourth Department was believed to have primary responsibility for offensive cyber operations.¹¹⁵ The consolidation of the former Third and Fourth departments into one organization is likely to enable the PLA to better integrate cyber operations for espionage and attack.¹¹⁶\nThese new organizational arrangements for military cyber operations should in theory improve the ability of top leaders to recognize and manage the crisis escalation risks associated with OPE. One of the key effects, if not drivers, of the consolidation of Chinese military cyber forces into the SSF is to enable top military leaders to exercise stricter oversight over PLA cyber operations to prevent accidental and unauthorized cyber attacks.¹¹⁷ Indeed, PLA writings published around the time the SSF was created emphasize the principle of “unified command” (tongyi zhihui) of cyber offense, defense, espionage, and control, and both PLA and non-PLA cyber capabilities.¹¹⁸ Details of how this principle of unified command is implemented in practice are scarce. Moreover, the ability of the new command structure to manage escalation risks in practice might have taken a back seat to other force building priorities. For example, the PLA’s efforts to guard against unauthorized and accidental use of cyber operations is in tension with its efforts to recruit the best cyber talent from outside\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nof the PLA. The SSF's use of contractors may revive many of the problems with oversight of cyber operations that China's leaders encountered prior to the 2015–2016 reforms.^^\nThe nature and extent of leadership oversight of PLA cyber operations are difficult to determine. It is possible that China has established a formal institutional structure for inter-agency vetting of military plans and operations that crosses civilian and military lines. Drawing on a PLA publication about cyber operations published in 2017, John Chen, Joe McReynolds, and Kieran Green observe that “peacetime planning and guidance of cyberspace operations . . . at the strategic level rest in the hands of such national network security leadership organizations as the [Communist Party] Cybersecurity and Informatization Commission, while planning and guidance during wartime are the responsibility of the [PLA] CMC Joint Operations Command Center.”^^ In other words, a civilian Party body takes the lead in peacetime and the PLA’s Central Military Commission takes the lead in wartime. It remains unclear how this dual command structure functions in practice. Most importantly, it remains unclear whether and, if so, to what degree managing inadvertent escalation risks resulting from OPE is a priority for the military and civilian leaders with oversight over PLA cyber operations.\n## Capabilities for Managing Cyber Risk\nChina is developing cyber situational awareness capabilities, including attribution capabilities. But they likely lag behind the United States in its development of capabilities that could disambiguate between attackers and mitigate inadvertent escalation risks. An official white paper outlining China’s international cyberspace strategy published in 2017 indicated that:\n[China] will expedite the development of a [military] cyber force and enhance capabilities in terms of situational awareness, cyber defense, supporting state activities and participating in international cooperation, to prevent major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security, and maintain national security and social stability.^^\nIt is difficult to assess the extent of improvement in China’s attribution and defense capabilities since adopting these priorities in 2015. The Chinese government’s procedures for defending its networks are unclear and it has not publicly attributed cyber attacks to another state. Nevertheless, in 2018 Xi Jinping acknowledged the deterrent effect of China’s improved capability to detect intruders.^^ Some Chinese cyber security firms have begun to publicly\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\nattribute intrusions to known groups of hackers using industry identifiers.¹²³ They have also called for greater efforts to prevent OPE within critical infrastructure networks. For example, the Chinese company Antiy argued that China needed to “make progress in weakening the ability of an adversary to ‘prepare the battlefield’ in our industrial control [systems] and infrastructure to achieve [serious] consequences.”¹²⁴\n## Misperception in the Sino-American Cyber Relationship\nDo the United States and China have a shared understanding of the nature of cyber conflict, the role of OPE, and the potential for crisis instability because of the OPE-espionage distinction problem? Comparing US and Chinese approaches to cyber conflict reveals some similarities, as well as differences that could hamper future bilateral efforts to manage cyber escalation risks. Both countries recognize that OPE is necessary for sophisticated offensive cyber operations yet is indistinguishable from intrusions for the purpose of espionage, defense, or data theft. Both countries view the presence of nation-state hackers in their networks as threatening. But the two countries do not appear to share an understanding of the inadvertent escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem or the clarity of the threshold of an armed attack in cyberspace.\nThe comparison also reveals asymmetries in the relative maturity of cyber doctrine and capabilities in both countries. These asymmetries might explain the lack of attention to inadvertent escalation risks in China’s approach to cyber conflict. China’s doctrine, procedures, and authorities for conducting cyber operations appear to have been overhauled by the 2015–2016 PLA reforms and took some years afterwards to crystallize into their current form. As a result, the PLA has less experience integrating espionage, offensive, and defensive cyber operations and incorporating civilian oversight into its cyber operations than the United States. The PLA operational regulations promulgated in late 2020 might have included more guidance on OPE and managing its escalation risks that is not reflected in the sources examined here. Meanwhile, US cyber capabilities and strategy are relatively more mature. US organizations demonstrate growing confidence in attribution capabilities, the clarity of escalation thresholds, and US ability to control escalation from OPE or low-level cyber attacks. These factors have led to a doctrine for cyber operations that gives the military a freer hand.\nNeither China nor the United States appears to be overly concerned about its espionage activities being misperceived as OPE during a crisis, albeit for different reasons. On the one hand, China appears to be inattentive to the specific\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nescalation risks posed by OPE. On the other hand, the United States appears to be aware of the specific escalation risks associated with OPE but is confident that they can be mitigated. This suggests that both states might approach a crisis confident that their intrusions will not be discovered, misperceived, or lead to the use of force. The PLA's attention to the escalation risks associated with OPE might increase as Chinese cyber doctrine and capabilities further develop. But increased awareness is by no means a given. Chinese experts and writings on crisis management and nuclear strategy – areas where PLA doctrine and capabilities are more mature – have also tended to downplay drivers of inadvertent escalation.\nOf course, the lack of concern about the escalation risks associated with OPE could reflect a shared lack of concern that cyber attacks could cause much harm in a crisis, supporting the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. OPE may simply be accepted practice between these two countries. They might expect that some of their key networks will be disabled by their adversaries' offensive cyber operations during future conflicts. They might prepare to fight without those networks instead of pre-empting cyber attacks that could disable them. We are cautious, however, about interpreting the evidence as confirmation of the bluster hypothesis. Evidence that China both acknowledges and shares US confidence that inadvertent cyber escalation risks can be managed – which we did not find – would have reduced the need for caution in interpreting the evidence in favor of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis.\n## Initiatives to Mitigate Misperceptions\nIn the absence of a shared understanding of cyber conflict, two initiatives could reduce the risk of inadvertent cyber escalation via the misperception pathway in a future Sino-American crisis: dialogue to ensure that both parties understand each other's approach to cyber operations, and a crisis communication mechanism specific to cyber operations. Dialogue and crisis communication could reduce the likelihood of either side misperceiving the other's cyber intrusion as OPE, or as confirmation of the other's hostile intentions, because of differences in their understandings of cyber conflict and operations. Unfortunately, China and the United States do not currently have an official military cyber dialogue that could bridge some of the gaps in their understandings of military cyber operations before a crisis emerges, despite establishing official dialogues to enable cooperation in non-military areas of the cyber relationship in 2015. Nor do China and the United States currently have a mechanism in place for crisis communications dedicated to cyber matters. By contrast, the United States has a three-tier cyber communications protocol in\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM\nplace with Russia that involves a direct line between the White House and the Kremlin.¹²⁷\n## Conclusion\nCould military cyber capabilities contribute to the outbreak of conflict in a future crisis involving the United States and China? Although our empirical analysis is unable to provide a definitive answer to this question, it provides enough evidence to suggest that inadvertent escalation could occur if one state discovered the other's cyber intrusions in a crisis. Over the past decade or so, the United States has made unilateral attempts to limit the risks of inadvertent escalation occurring, first with strict organizational procedures governing all cyber operations and later with more robust operational procedures to defend its networks. There is little evidence that China has taken similar steps to unilaterally mitigate inadvertent escalation risks from cyber operations. The bilateral cyber relationship also lacks the shared understandings of these risks, and mechanisms for dialogue in peacetime or communications in crises, that could improve crisis stability.\nEven a small probability of inadvertent escalation could have extremely serious consequences, given how destructive a Sino-American conflict could be and the variety of other escalation risks present in the relationship. Our empirical analysis could also support the claim that cyber capabilities do not pose a serious enough threat for decision-makers to use force – whether cyber or kinetic – to pre-empt or retaliate. However, in the absence of stronger evidence to support this bluster hypothesis, we do not dismiss the risk that the OPE-espionage distinction problem could add to crisis instability given the stakes at hand.\nThis chapter suggests that further research is needed to establish whether US confidence that cyber operations do not add to crisis stability is well founded. US adversaries' reluctance to escalate in response to cyber attacks or intrusions might reflect their countervailing strategic and political disincentives to escalate, rather than the stabilizing nature of cyber operations.¹²⁸ Brandon Valeriano, Benjamin M. Jensen, and Ryan C. Maness find that the United States has been successful in using cyberspace to coerce adversaries.¹²⁹ Scholars have pointed out that cyber operations are likely to have their greatest effects on international relations when combined with superior conventional military power.¹³⁰ The possibility that US conventional military power might mask the destabilizing effects of cyber operations suggests that the United States should be cautious as Chinese conventional military capabilities improve. If a Sino-American crisis had occurred during the past decade, Beijing would have\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD\nfaced strong countervailing pressures not to use force in response to a cyber intrusion, even if it judged that intrusion to pose a serious threat. Going forward, even if the PRC views an intrusion as a serious but manageable threat, its growing conventional capabilities and tense relationship with Washington could create an excuse for deliberate PRC escalation. And if the intrusion were intolerable, political and strategic disincentives could not be counted on to restrain China's leaders from using force."

Cunningham In the context of an increasingly competitive Sino-American relationship, US analysts are increasingly concerned about crisis instability, defined as the temptation for either country to use force rather than continue to bargain diplomatically during a crisis. Scholars and analysts focused on the US-China relationship have warned that cyber capabilities could add incentives for either the United States or China to use force in a crisis. Despite these concerns, there is no consensus among cyber scholars that offensive cyber capabilities contribute to the risk of great-power political crises escalating into conflicts.\nAs the previous chapter by Jason Healey and Robert Jervis has shown, certain features of cyber capabilities could create new pathways through which a great-power crisis could escalate into a conventional conflict.\nThis chapter examines one of these novel escalation pathways in the context of the Sino-American relationship: the difficulty of distinguishing between hacking for espionage and operational preparation of the environment (OPE), an essential precursor to most high-end cyber attacks. This OPE-espionage distinction problem creates pathways for inadvertent escalation, which occurs\"when a combatant deliberately takes actions that it does not perceive to be escalatory but are interpreted that way by the enemy,\"during a crisis or conflict. A state could correctly detect an adversary's OPE and, fearing an imminent cyber attack with severe consequences, choose to use force first, escalating the conflict with a cyber or even kinetic attack. But a state could also misperceive an adversary's efforts to collect intelligence via cyber means as OPE and pre-empt that attack with conventional or cyber attacks of its own. A state discovering that its adversary has intruded into its nuclear command, control, and communications networks during a crisis presents a particularly concerning scenario.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Despite these concerns, academic studies based on observational data, surveys, and simulations find little correlation between cyber attacks and escalation, either in peacetime or during conflicts.6 Scholars have reasoned that most cyber attacks are simply not destructive enough to worsen crisis or conflict outcomes.7 These limited effects, coupled with the bloodless, secret nature of cyber attacks, might instead open up new pathways for de-escalation and enhance crisis stability.8 However, the external validity of existing empirical findings to military crises among great powers is limited because no such crisis has occurred in the past two decades and they are difficult to replicate in surveys, simulations, and wargames.9 To evaluate the diverging concerns of the US policy community and the ongoing scholarly debates on cyber escalation and crisis instability among great powers, this chapter examines the escalation risks created by OPE in a future crisis scenario involving the United States and China. Scholars have already identified several sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship, including a systematic lack of attention among Chinese experts to inadvertent escalation risks in the nuclear, conventional, and space domains.10 A Sino-American crisis scenario is a most likely case for theoretical claims that cyber capabilities create novel escalation risks. Both countries would be most likely to react to any independent effect of cyber technology on their incentives to use force, if such incentives exist, in a crisis. Indeed, scholars have already raised concerns that cyber capabilities could fuel Sino-American crisis instability, although they have not examined the OPE-espionage distinction problem in much detail.11 To assess the escalation risks posed by this problem, we follow the methodological approach of scholars who have examined other sources of crisis instability in the Sino-American relationship. Specifically, we examine the two countries' leadership statements, threat perceptions, procedures for authorizing cyber operations, organizational structures, capabilities, and policies for evidence that they create, recognize, and seek to manage escalatory risks.\nOur analysis suggests that inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE would be present in a future Sino-American crisis scenario. Official US policy for offensive cyber operations recognizes the escalation risks associated with cyber espionage being mistaken for OPE, but recent changes to US cyber strategy may increase these risks. Meanwhile, Chinese writings recognize the difficulty of distinguishing between cyber attacks and OPE but appear to ignore the consequences for crisis instability. We also find that a lack of mutual understanding in the Sino-American cyber relationship adds to the likelihood of the two countries misperceiving each other's behavior.\nOur empirical findings have two key limitations. First, our sources are scarce, imperfect, and some years old, especially on the Chinese side. We BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM follow best practices for using open sources to analyze Chinese military strategy, but caution is still needed when drawing conclusions from such sources. Nevertheless, these sources still make a valuable contribution to existing policy debates and scholarly research about cyber conflict, which rarely draws on Chinese perspectives. Second, our empirical findings could support the claim that cyber technology either does – or does not – add to crisis instability. Leaders from both countries might choose to ignore the escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem even if they are present. But neither country's relaxed approach to these risks is justified by a careful assessment of the independent effect of cyber technology on an adversary's incentives to use force in a crisis, which makes us hesitant to dismiss them.\nThis chapter begins with a brief explanation of OPE as a distinctive feature of cyber attacks. The second section outlines the competing hypotheses about cyber escalation in existing scholarly literature and the mechanisms that could link detection of an intrusion in a crisis with the decision to use force. The third, fourth, and fifth sections examine the evidence for these hypotheses in US documents and statements, Chinese writings and organizational practices, and the bilateral cyber relationship, respectively. The sixth section evaluates the escalation risks.\n## Operational Preparation of the Environment Performing OPE is essential to enabling significant cyber operations that could have strategic effects on the target.[12] To develop a cyber capability with a potent or customized effect on a target network, substantial reconnaissance and preparation are required from within that targeted network. In 2010, the Department of Defense defined\"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment\"as: Non-intelligence enabling functions within cyberspace conducted to plan and prepare for potential follow-up military operations. [Cyber-OPE] includes but is not limited to identifying data, system/network configurations, or physical structures... for the purpose of determining system vulnerabilities; and actions taken to assure future access and/or control of the system, network, or data during anticipated hostilities.[13] While cyber OPE has analogues in other forms of military operations – especially in the world of special operations and covert action – it differs from operations that are more familiar to policymakers, such as conventional and nuclear operations. Preparations to use cyber capabilities have different recon This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD naissance requirements than most other operations.¹⁴ Much of the development and preparation for a cyber operation requires access to or occurs within adversary networks. Moreover, the accesses and payloads that make offensive cyber operations possible are often specific to a particular network.¹⁵ Gaining and maintaining access to a target network is also generally difficult, resource intensive, and specific to the target network.¹⁶ Overall, the effects of an attack, the ability to sustain those effects over time, and the ability of an attack to limit unintended consequences all depend on how well the attacker has prepared and understood the target network and the likely actions of the network's defenders once the attack commences.¹⁷ A few examples illustrate the importance of OPE to sophisticated offensive cyber operations. Stuxnet was enabled by months if not years of reconnaissance, while Iranian hackers spent months inside the computer networks of Sands Casino and Saudi Aramco before they attacked in 2012.¹⁸ North Korean hackers did the same with their attacks on the computer networks of Sony Pictures.¹⁹ Russian hackers prepared in a similar way for their NotPetya operation, which reportedly inflicted over $10 billion in damage.²⁰ Some attacks, most notably denial-of-service efforts, do not fit into this trend, but lack potency as a result.²¹ OPE is also difficult to distinguish from espionage once it is discovered by a target. In theory, there might be ways for a target to tell whether an intrusion is espionage or whether it facilitates an attack. But there are no foolproof solutions to this OPE-espionage distinction problem. For example, an uptick in communication between the attacker and malicious code implanted in the target system could signal its purpose, but an attack could occur without any of those signals. Those signals could also accompany routine intelligence collection.²² Even if an attacker tries to use those signals to distinguish OPE from espionage, the target may not receive those signals or treat them as credible.²³ The nature of the target network may provide some hints – for example, critical infrastructure industrial control systems are more likely to be exploited for OPE than intelligence gathering – but this is not always the case.²⁴ Moreover, the exploitation of an adversary's networks for intelligence gathering could be repurposed for OPE without any tell-tale signs that the target might detect. For example, there is some evidence to suggest that the first blackout in Ukraine began with an espionage objective but later morphed into an attack operation.²⁵ ## The Novel Escalation Risks of OPE How and why could an intrusion discovered in the midst of a crisis between two great powers create incentives for the use of force? How and why might This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms decision-makers choose to use force when faced with those incentives? Answers to these questions are key to understanding the potential for cyber operations to contribute to crisis instability -- or stability.\nWe define a crisis as “a confrontation between two states involving a serious threat to vital national interests for both sides in which there is the expectation of a short time for resolution, and in which there is understood to be a sharply increased risk of war.” We define escalation as “an increase in the intensity or scope of conflict that crosses threshold(s) considered significant by one or more of the participants.” In a great-power crisis, escalation would involve the use of force, with either cyber or kinetic attacks. We use the term “cyber escalation risks” to refer to an increased temptation to use force in a crisis due to the nature of cyber technology.\nIf decision-makers discover an intrusion into their key military or civilian networks during a crisis, most scholars agree that those decision-makers could not rule out the possibility that the intrusion enables OPE. The decision-makers' response to that discovery will depend on how they assess the seriousness of the threat posed by the intrusion and whether the state also has strategic or political incentives to use force. The interaction of these two factors suggests four possibilities: the inadvertent escalation and deliberate escalation hypotheses that expect the use of force, and the bluster and countervailing hypotheses that do not expect the use of force. We focus on the logic underpinning the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it best represents the concerns in current US policy debates about the destabilizing effect of cyber technology in a future Sino-American crisis.\n### Intrusion Detection in a Crisis The scenario in which OPE could trigger the use of force in a crisis would likely begin months if not years before the crisis. An adversary that wants the option to carry out offensive cyber operations in a future conflict against a state's important military or civilian networks would conduct OPE during peacetime. Once a crisis has begun it is almost certainly too late to complete this complex, time-consuming task.\nOnce a political crisis began -- for example, over an accidental collision between two rivals' military aircraft, the scenario that triggered the last Sino-American crisis in 2001 -- decision-makers in both states would have to decide whether to back down, bargain diplomatically, or bargain with the use of force. During their deliberations, the target state's decision-makers might discover their adversary's intrusions into important computer networks, including those that might be OPE. Such discoveries are more likely in a crisis PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD because states anticipate espionage and attacks in that context and will step up network defenses accordingly.³⁰ If target’s decision-makers decide it is most prudent to treat the intrusion as OPE, and they believe that the intrusion poses a serious threat, the OPE-espionage distinction problem creates an incentive to use force rather than bargain diplomatically.\nMore generally, the OPE-espionage distinction problem complicates the task of the target’s decision-makers charged with assessing the intent behind the intrusion. Motivations for the intrusion include OPE, monitoring the target’s military operations, or gathering intelligence about its offensive cyber operations.³¹ The specifics of the intrusion may provide some hints of intent but are unlikely to be definitive.³² Testing of small-scale attacks or an uptick in communication between the intruder and code it has implanted in the target system could also signal that it is OPE.³³ The intruder would also have difficulty reassuring the target state of its intent if the intrusion is for intelligence purposes.³⁴ To preserve its operational security, the intruder would have incentives not to acknowledge which adversary networks it has exploited and for what purpose, lest the target use that information to remove the intruder.³⁵ Even if the intruder sought to reassure the target of its intent not to use the intrusion to enable an attack, it would have trouble credibly committing not to use the intrusion for OPE in the future.\n## The Inadvertent Escalation Pathway The claim that cyber operations create incentives to use force in a crisis is a specific instance of a general claim that military operations and technology can cause misperceptions among adversaries with serious consequences for crisis stability and intra-war escalation.³⁶ One potential consequence of those misperceptions is inadvertent escalation. The canonical scenario of inadvertent escalation is a conventional war among nuclear powers in which one party conducts “large-scale conventional operations that produce patterns of damage or threat to the major elements of a state’s nuclear force.”³⁷ The target state interprets the attack as a deliberate attempt to degrade its nuclear force and responds by using nuclear weapons or accelerating preparations for their use.³⁸ Similarly, escalation to the use of cyber or kinetic force could occur in a crisis as an unintended consequence of the normal conduct of cyber espionage.\nMisperceptions commonly associated with the security dilemma are one reason that inadvertent escalation could occur.³⁹ Specifically, the difficulty of distinguishing between an adversary’s offensive and defensive military operations is sufficient to produce misperceptions about the intent of the attacking state within the target state.⁴⁰ The attacking state’s conventional military This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM operations could therefore make its adversary less secure in unintended ways,⁴¹ which creates an incentive for the target state to use force sooner rather than later.⁴² The target state need only calculate that its ability to achieve its conflict objectives will diminish in the future if it ignores the attacker’s actions in the present.⁴³ The OPE-espionage distinction problem could trigger the use of force if the target state’s leaders make worst-case-scenario assessments of the attacker’s intent and capability to damage an important information network. There are four mechanisms by which a state could make a worst-case-scenario assessment of the seriousness of the threat posed by an intrusion and decide to use force, whether a cyber or kinetic attack. First, a state that detects an adversary’s OPE might use force to pre-empt a cyber attack that could put the state at a military disadvantage in a future conflict.⁴⁴ Second, the combination of the crisis environment and the OPE-espionage distinction problem could lead the state to attribute aggressive intentions to the adversary with regards to both the network intrusion and the overall crisis, incentivizing the use of force.⁴⁵ Third, the discovery of an intrusion that might be OPE could affect decision-makers’ emotions in ways that make the use of force more likely.⁴⁶ Fourth, the uneven distribution of information about the nature of cyber operations in national security bureaucracies might make the use of force more likely when those bureaucracies discover intrusions in a crisis. Intrusions that some cyber specialists see as a routine part of cyber operations may alarm more senior generalists, especially in a crisis. Top decision-makers may not have sufficient knowledge or information to assess the risks posed by a cyber intrusion to their military capabilities.⁴⁷ ## The Deliberate Escalation Pathway States might assess that a cyber intrusion poses a serious but tolerable threat yet choose to use force in response because they have strategic and political incentives to escalate. Those strategic and political incentives usually involve gaining a military advantage, signaling resolve, or pre-empting an adversary’s attempt to signal resolve by using force.⁴⁸ Scholars have questioned whether states make decisions to escalate because of the independent effects of technology alone. Based on historical case studies, Caitlin Talmadge argues that new technologies might not force decision-makers to take escalatory actions, but rather “seem likely to be an intervening variable.” States seek out new technologies to enable them to increase the risk of escalation, or turn to them opportunistically in a conflict, rather than their hands being forced to escalate in a crisis because they did not anticipate the escalatory pressures created This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD by their prior decisions to deploy certain military capabilities.⁴⁹ These actions involve deliberate escalation: “[when] a combatant deliberately increases the intensity or scope of an operation to gain an advantage or avoid defeat.”⁵⁰ ## The Bluster De-escalation Pathway Decision-makers may decide not to use force if they discover an intrusion in a crisis – even if they are confident that the intruder has performed OPE – because they do not think the intrusion poses a serious threat. This “bluster” hypothesis suggests that cyber technology does not contribute to crisis instability and might even help to stabilize crises. It draws on existing empirical research which indicates that cyber attacks are perceived to be more bluster than bite. States and individuals tend not to retaliate in response to cyber attacks.⁵¹ One explanation for this empirical finding is that decision-makers do not view cyber attacks as sufficiently damaging or destructive to warrant the use of force in response.⁵² Applying these arguments to a crisis scenario in which an intrusion is discovered, decision-makers might calculate that the cost of the cyber attack is likely to be low and can be absorbed. This explanation suggests that states would not anticipate a military disadvantage from a cyber attack, contrary to the military disadvantage mechanism outlined above.\nDecision-makers might even view cyber attacks as a signal that an adversary wants to avoid a conventional conflict. When the effects of cyber and kinetic attacks are held constant, Jacquelyn Schneider and Sarah Kreps found that US survey respondents were less likely to support retaliation for cyber attacks than kinetic attacks.⁵³ Decision-makers might therefore interpret the discovery of an intrusion as a signal of an adversary’s intent to avoid crossing the threshold of conventional armed conflict,⁵⁴ rather than its hostile intent, contrary to the misperception mechanism outlined above.\n## The Countervailing De-escalation Hypothesis Finally, decision-makers might view the intrusion as posing a serious threat but have countervailing political or strategic incentives not to respond with the use of force. Decision-makers could react to an intrusion in this de-escalatory manner if they want to defuse the crisis because, for example, the stakes of the crisis do not merit fighting a war, or if they lacked the conventional military power to achieve their political objectives if a conflict broke out. Decision-makers with multiple adversaries might also be wary of mis-attributing an intrusion carried out by one adversary to another if they cannot attribute the intrusion to its perpetrator with sufficient confidence in the time frame of the This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM crisis.⁵⁵ Other countervailing incentives may also originate in domestic politics. The ambiguity of intent behind cyber intrusions could help more moderate decision-makers build a coalition for restraint in the crisis and counter pressure from decision-makers with more hawkish preferences.⁵⁶ ## Evaluating Cyber Escalation Hypotheses How might scholars determine which of these four hypotheses is most likely in a great-power crisis, when no crisis has occurred since China and the United States were both armed with military cyber capabilities? There is no perfect solution to this problem. To complement existing empirical studies, most of which capture US popular or elite views of cyber escalation, our approach focuses on capturing both US and Chinese elite views by examining their approach to cyber OPE, escalation, and military operations.\nOur empirical analysis is guided by observable implications derived from the four hypotheses. The inadvertent escalation hypothesis would expect states to express concern about any intrusions into their networks and to recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. States might also recognize inadvertent escalation risks and take steps to manage cyber escalation risks in their procedures, authorities, and organizational structures for cyber operations. Inadvertent escalation is also more likely to occur when two states have a poor understanding of each other's cyber activities and lack crisis communications mechanisms to verify the nature of an intrusion. The bluster de-escalation hypothesis would expect states that possess good attribution capabilities, defend their networks against intrusions, and effectively repel intruders who do breach defenses to be more relaxed about discovering intrusions into their networks. Not only might they be less likely to experience worrying intrusions, but they might also be able to better assess the intent and the severity of the threat posed by an intrusion.\nWhile it is difficult to describe the strategic and political incentives that could provide evidence to support the deliberate escalation or countervailing hypotheses in a future crisis, some ex ante features of a great-power relationship would shape those incentives. Deliberate escalation is more likely to occur when the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally stronger than its adversary, does not confront multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has high political stakes in the crisis. The countervailing hypothesis is more likely to find support if the state discovering the intrusion is conventionally weaker than its adversary, faces multiple nation-state adversaries in cyberspace, or has low political stakes in the crisis. A scenario in which the conventional military balance is roughly equal and both states see the conflict as high stakes This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD would be the most likely case for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis because it minimizes countervailing political and strategic incentives to de-escalate if a threatening cyber intrusion is discovered in a crisis. A US-China crisis scenario is more evenly matched than most cyber dyads, although it would still involve some asymmetries in stakes and the conventional military balance that could obfuscate the independent effect of cyber technology on the temptation to use force in a crisis.^[57]^ ## Escalation Risks in US Cyber Operations US decision-makers recognize the inadvertent escalation risks posed by cyber operations, and OPE in particular, but they have taken steps to mitigate those risks. The Obama administration implemented organizational practices that carefully managed cyber operations that could produce escalation. The Trump administration relaxed those organizational practices after gaining confidence in operational practices. These practices provide evidence in favor of either the inadvertent escalation hypothesis or the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. As part of its more muscular approach, US Cyber Command has also concluded that most cyber intrusions could not produce serious enough effects to result in escalation. At first glance this judgment supports the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. But it could also support the countervailing de-escalation hypothesis. US adversaries might view its intrusions as very threatening but face disincentives to use force because of US conventional military preponderance.\n## Leadership Views of OPE The public statements of leaders and government reactions to discoveries of intrusions into military networks indicate that the United States views intrusions as threatening, in part because they could be used either for OPE or intelligence gathering. After a Russian hack of Pentagon systems in 2015 that the United States was able to repel, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter summarized the American position aptly when he said,\"[It] can't be good for anybody to be inside of our networks - whatever their motivation.\"^[58]^ Similarly, Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency (NSA) and US Cyber Command, and his adviser Michael Sulmeyer explained that the United States turned to a more aggressive policy\"to prevent toeholds from turning into beachheads so that a single compromise will not threaten the military's ability to accomplish its mission.\"^[59]^ While the details of most US responses to foreign hacking efforts are not public, two historical cases demonstrate that policymakers worried about the This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM implications of minor intrusions. In a 1998 hack known as Solar Sunrise, intruders penetrated the US military's logistics and communications networks. The Joint Staff general in charge of information operations, John Campbell, worried that the breach would permit significant attacks, especially at a time of heightened tensions with Iraq.\"If you take one part of that machine, and disable it,\"he said,\"you've got a real problem trying to make a deployment take place.\"60 Campbell's comments reflect an assessment that the intrusion could have placed the United States at a military disadvantage in a conflict. The discovery did not take place during a major crisis and therefore lacked the time pressure element that would create incentives to use force. Nevertheless, an investigation concluded the breach was the work of three teenagers and their 20-year-old mentor after various parts of the US government had already spun up to prepare for a response.\nA second incident, Moonlight Maze, occurred in 1998 and 1999 and involved Russian penetration of unclassified American networks. The US government hacked back into Russian computers to gain more intelligence.[61] One of the White House's top national security officials, Richard Clarke, labeled the activities\"cyberwar reconnaissance.\"[62] Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre indicated that the United States was\"in the middle of a cyber war\"to the Intelligence Committees of Congress during a classified briefing.[63] ## OPE in Cyber Operations US operators and decision-makers have recognized the need for OPE to conduct sophisticated cyber operations since at least 2010. The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a memo in 2010 mandating the use of the term\"Cyber Operations in Preparation of the Environment,\"which referred to those cyber operations that serve\"as an enabling function for another military operation.\"[64] From the earliest days of the US Cyber Command, secret documents – now declassified – indicated that conducting OPE was one of its core tasks.[65] Planners at the highest levels of the US government eventually recognized the importance of OPE. During the Obama administration, the most significant high-level document governing America's offensive cyber capability was Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20). The president signed the classified document in secret in the fall of 2012. The White House released a fact sheet that made no mention of offensive cyber capabilities,[66] but the full classified document, leaked in 2013 by Edward Snowden, reveals a strategy that directly considers offensive action and contrasts it with other forms of cyber operations. The strategy lays out a clear typology of cyber activity. This includes\"cyber This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD collection,” which refers to intelligence-gathering activities for purposes other than offensive preparation. It also includes “non-intrusive defensive countermeasures,” meaning steps taken within one’s own network, such as deploying antivirus and other basic security measures. The document also introduces the concept of “Defensive Cyber Effects Operations,” defined as efforts that have an effect on an adversary’s computer systems – presumably, hacking or other interference – but only for the purposes of defense. PPD-20 provides high-level procedures for managing this kind of aggressive defensive action.⁶⁷ Most significantly, though, the classified version of PPD-20 defines offensive action in some detail. It introduces the concept of “Offensive Cyber Effects Operations” (OCEO), which are distinct from cyber collection, non-intrusive defensive countermeasures, or defensive cyber effects operations. Instead, these efforts are designed to cause effects in adversary networks.⁶⁸ The document extols the unique virtues of these kinds of offensive cyber operations, which “can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance U.S. national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging.”⁶⁹ PPD-20 acknowledges the need for OPE to realize these offensive options. It indicates that “the development and sustainment of [offensive cyber] capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist.”⁷⁰ PPD-20 directs the US government to begin this operational preparation. The relevant agencies “shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, [and] establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities.”⁷¹ With his signature, President Barack Obama authorized the preparatory activity.\n## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risks PPD-20 reveals US policymakers’ cognisance of the risks that arise from actually using offensive cyber capabilities. As a result, the document highlights a process to carefully manage offensive actions that might do serious harm or invite escalation. It emphasizes inter-agency coordination, balancing defense and national security interests with diplomatic and economic ones. Most notably, the process requires the highest level of executive branch oversight – presidential approval – for any cyber operation that is “reasonably likely to result in significant consequences.”⁷² This term is broadly defined: “Loss of life, significant responsive actions against the United States, significant damage to property, serious adverse U.S. foreign policy consequences, or serious This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM economic impact on the United States.”73 It is likely that cyber operations that do not meet that threshold could otherwise be approved by the agency carrying out the operation without such high-level inter-agency vetting.\nCrucially, PPD-20 does not limit these restrictions to cyber attacks but emphasizes that they apply to all cyber operations. In short, President Obama wanted direct oversight of any operation that might meet the threshold of significant consequences – regardless of whether that operation involved collecting intelligence, defending American computers, preparing an offensive capability, or launching an attack. The directive suggests that the Obama administration was concerned, at least in theory, about the risks of cyber escalation even as it appreciated the operational necessity to prepare offensive capabilities in advance.\nThe Trump administration adopted a more relaxed set of organizational procedures for managing cyber escalation risks. Upon unveiling its new national cyber strategy in 2018, the Trump White House criticized the preceding administration for what it saw as its overly cautious posture and promised to be more aggressive in its engagements with adversaries. Then-National Security Adviser John Bolton said, “Our hands are not tied as they were in the Obama administration.” Nor was the need for more aggressive action just a partisan view. In his confirmation hearing, the incoming NSA director and commander of US Cyber Command Gen. Paul Nakasone warned that the United States had to do more because American adversaries “don’t fear us.”74 These views were translated into policy by President Donald Trump’s signature on “National Security Presidential Memorandum 13.” The goal of the memorandum, which remains classified, is to provide military commanders with greater flexibility to integrate cyber operations into their overall approach to warfighting and deterrence.75 By delegating this authority to the Pentagon, the Trump administration attempted to foster a faster and more aggressive process, one that would generate more operational effects more quickly. But this approach also rebalanced the trade-off between operational agility and whole-of-government coordination to manage cyber escalation risks in favor of the former. According to the general on the Joint Staff responsible for cyber operations, this change sharply contrasted with the Obama administration’s approach, which was “an interagency process that went through the National Security Council... to deputies’ committee to principals’ committee and [where], in effect, anyone could stop the process along the way.” Nor, he argued, was the distinction just semantics or bureaucratic minutia, but one that “makes all the difference in the world in terms of the speed at which you can move.”76 This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms It is unclear whether current US policy, set by the Trump memorandum, frees commanders to both prepare for and launch cyber capabilities. But there are hints that the memo and complementary legislative changes implemented by Congress provide a freer hand in developing the malicious code and gaining access to target networks required to provide commanders with offensive options. For example, in a media interview, the former deputy commander of U.S. Cyber Command, Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, indicated that changes to congressional legislation “freed us up to do some of the things, the operational preparation of the environment, that we were limited from doing outside of the counterterrorism mission and now can do much more broadly against all of our peers and competitors.” In addition, a New York Times story from June 2019 describes more aggressive American preparatory measures against the Russian power grid.\nOverall, the Trump administration was much less worried about the escalation risk associated with cyber operations than the Obama administration. The Biden administration appears to have largely continued this approach since taking office in 2021. Michael Daniel, the former coordinator for cyber security in the Obama White House, observed that the Trump administration was “willing to take more risks than previous administrations.” While the Trump administration's approach was untested in a crisis with a near‐peer competitor, it was informed by the US experience with cyber conflict over the past decade as well as the increasing risk tolerance of US decision‐makers. To justify its new posture, US Cyber Command has argued that “adversaries continuously operate against us below the threshold of armed conflict,” in what it described as a “new normal.” Moreover, the command argued that US efforts to counter this adversarial activity will not lead to retaliation in or outside of cyberspace that would cross that threshold.\nThese claims have been fiercely debated in the academic literature, with critics of the so‐called persistent engagement approach arguing that the new strategy could produce escalation. For example, some contend that the thresholds for armed conflict are not as clear as US Cyber Command has suggested. Others argue that persistent engagement creates too many red lines for adversaries and is therefore not a realistic means for shaping behavior. Nakasone and Sulmeyer responded to these concerns with reassurance that:“Cyber Command takes these concerns seriously, and reducing this risk is a critical part of the planning process. We are confident that this more proactive approach enables Cyber Command to conduct operations that impose costs while responsibly managing escalation.\nBEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM # Capabilities for Managing Escalation Risks In the past decade, the United States has developed some of the world's most sophisticated cyber capabilities to better defend its networks, attribute intrusions, and expel intruders in peacetime. To better defend networks, the United States has invested in major systems, such as EINSTEIN 3, that aim to thwart intrusions. To improve rapid attribution of intrusions and increase situational awareness, the United States established various cross-agency working groups and bulked up teams within the NSA and US Cyber Command. To the extent that these capabilities are effective, they might mitigate cyber escalation risks by reducing the likelihood that intruders will successfully break into US networks and alarm policymakers who have to decide on how to respond within the compressed time period of a crisis. However, the compromise of SolarWinds network management system in 2021, which enabled Russian government operators to intrude into numerous US government systems for months without detection, suggests that defense and attribution capabilities are imperfect and do not eliminate the possibility of the United States discovering an intrusion during a crisis.\n# Escalation Risks in Chinese Cyber Operations There is little evidence to indicate that China has scrutinized the inadvertent escalation risks posed by OPE as carefully as the United States, although Chinese sources bearing on this question are older, scarcer, and less authoritative than those for the United States.83 This lack of attention could be evidence of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis, as it might reflect a judgment that cyber intrusions pose a manageable threat to China's leaders. But this lack of concern should be interpreted in the context of a relative lack of concern about inadvertent escalation risks posed by nuclear, space, and conventional military operations among Chinese experts. As such, we favor the interpretation of China's inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks as support for the inadvertent escalation hypothesis. Inattention to the inadvertent escalation risks associated with OPE could help to realize such risks in a crisis for three reasons. First, China is more likely to misperceive US cyber intrusions. Second, it is more likely to overlook the ways that its own cyber intrusions could be misperceived. Third, China is much less likely to take steps to mitigate these risks. Available sources provide little insight into whether the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has put in place organizational or operational practices to manage inadvertent cyber escalation.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Leadership Views of OPE Chinese policymakers' fears about foreign hackers have grown in tandem with the expansion of the Chinese government's and military's dependence on computer networks. In a major speech on national cyber security policy in 2016, Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping stated that, “Cyber security has a strong covert character; a technological vulnerability or security risk can stay hidden for a number of years without being discovered.” As a result, “we do not know who came in, whether it was an enemy or a friend, or what they did.” Xi implied that while this enemy or friend's intrusion could remain “latent” inside a network for a long time, it could be “activated whenever (yidan jiu fazuo le).”84 The Chinese government has not publicly acknowledged any specific incidents in which it discovered that foreign state actors had exploited its government or military networks. China's closest analogue to the Solar Sunrise and Moonlight Maze incidents was Edward Snowden's revelations regarding US government surveillance of Chinese computer networks. Snowden's revelations are often cited by the country's cyber security scholars as evidence of China's vulnerability and the inadequacy of its network defenses, which failed to prevent or detect US government intrusions. Chinese experts claim that the NSA also targeted the country's military networks.85 A Chinese cyber security firm reported that the CIA had spied on Chinese state‐owned enterprises but did not identify any government networks penetrated.86 There is no detailed evidence about how the Chinese government responded to any of these incidents, nor did they occur in the context of a major crisis.\nChinese writings examining US cyber operations can provide insights into how Chinese experts view these operations in the absence of open discussions about these topics in China. Chinese experts affiliated with the PLA note that OPE is one of the cyber missions outlined in US doctrinal publications but do not mention the crisis escalation risks that could result from the OPE‐espionage distinction problem.87 While the Trump administration's more muscular approach to cyber operations raised concerns among Chinese authors for its emphasis on pre‐emption and potential to spark arms race instability, those experts are less focused on crisis instability than US scholars.88 There are some recent exceptions. For example, former PLA officer Lyu Jinghua writes that “it is worthwhile to explore whether the tension in cyberspace can be de‐escalated or whether the chances of the breakout of crisis can be lowered if there could be a basic consensus among countries that cyber activities conducted or supported by countries during peacetime are a contest of intelligence rather than conflicts or preparation of conflicts.\nIt remains unclear whether Chinese decision-makers share the views of experts who worry about the escalation risks of OPE and whether those concerns have led to practices to mitigate those risks.\n### OPE in Cyber Operations Like US officials, PLA strategists also distinguish between cyber surveillance, offense and defense, and deterrence as the main styles of cyber struggle. PLA texts do not use the term “operational preparation of the environment” when describing PLA operations, but they do recognize that effective offensive cyber operations require extensive advance preparation. A 2015 book authored by experts from the PLA Army Engineering University, 54th Institute, and other PLA organizations acknowledges that significant advance preparations are needed to ensure that cyber operations can be used to diminish an adversary's combat power. While many methods of attack are available, “a cyber attack capable of producing significant effects is a cyber attack for which ample preparations have already been made at an earlier time... it is not a decision that one makes as the situation requires.”\nPLA writings indicate that China places a similar degree of emphasis on OPE as the United States. The 2015 book characterizes OPE as more demanding than network exploitation for espionage:“It is necessary to carry out careful and meticulous reconnaissance and scanning of the target, in order to obtain even more detailed, specific information about it. As such, we must carry out deeper reconnaissance and scanning of the target, [and] the extent of secrecy and concealment [of those tasks] far exceeds the extent of carrying out [those] tasks for computer network exploitation.”\nBut reconnaissance and scanning are only the first steps in preparations for an attack. The authors emphasize the importance of obfuscation throughout the various procedures required to prepare for offensive cyber operations: selecting and employing a method of gaining access to the target network, moving laterally through it, gaining privileges, and maintaining access. An intrusion can serve multiple purposes: “attack actions occur after the intrusion of computer networks, escalating privileges and exfiltrating all required data.”\nPREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD PLA writings recognize that holding targets at risk for the purpose of deterrence also requires OPE. An article outlining principles of cyber deterrence authored by an unnamed Academy of Military Science expert in 2016 indicated that successful cyber deterrence, which included carrying out coercive and retaliatory attacks, required “complete and meticulous preparation in peacetime.” Those preparations included “long-term, sustained network reconnaissance” to become familiar with an adversary’s network situation, map the structure of its networks, and discover hardware and software vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be used to leave backdoors, set up “springboards,” and install logic bombs and Trojan horses “to retain points of penetration to launch future cyber attacks.”95 PLA texts recognize the OPE-espionage distinction problem. The 2013 Science of Military Strategy published by the Academy of Military Science acknowledges that, “from a technological perspective, the principles of the task (gongzuo yuanli) of cyber surveillance and cyber attacks are essentially identical.” The book explains: “cyber surveillance means and methods are often also the means and methods of cyber attacks.” Furthermore, it highlights that cyber espionage can easily be turned into an attack: “According to the aspirations and intentions of the actor, it is possible to just press a key or initiate a sequence of commands, and the conversion between cyber surveillance and cyber attack is immediately completed.” The authors conclude that the relationship between cyber espionage and combat cannot be severed.96 In addition, OPE can erode the distinction between peacetime and conflict in cyberspace. The 2017 Science of Military Strategy published by the National Defense University indicates that, “compared to traditional domains, the boundary between war and peace in the cyber domain is fuzzier.” The book describes the lack of clear boundaries as follows: “cyber and electronic domain warfare already exists in peacetime; when war is imminent (linzhan) it becomes more intense; [and] often sustained confrontation directly merges into actual war.”97 These views are repeated in a revised edition of the book published in 2020.98 Two PLA authors affiliated with the former General Staff Research Institute argue that one reason for the blurred boundary between war and peace in cyberspace is that “‘backdoors’ and ‘exploits’ are pre-placed in an enemy’s network systems early; it is very difficult to determine from which moment war begins.”99 This view contrasts with US Cyber Command’s views of a clearer threshold of armed conflict in cyberspace.\nAs in the United States, PLA texts indicate that China intends to conduct offensive cyber operations. OPE will therefore likely be necessary to target the high-value military and civilian critical infrastructure networks that could contribute to crisis instability.

CUNNINGHAM describes “‘soft’ paralysis of the information network nodes of adversary warfare systems” that the PLA could implement alongside kinetic attacks and psychological operations in a future joint information operations campaign. The book indicates that the PLA would need to “completely analyze the structure and relationship of interconnections and restrictions among the adversary’s systems for command and control, intelligence and warning, and firepower attack (huoli daji), and their support and sustainment,” to select the appropriate means for offensive cyber attacks. Those means include offensive cyber operations that would require OPE: “systems intrusion, computer virus attacks, attacks to cut off servers, and network deception attacks.” The book indicates that PLA attacks would not be limited to military networks, but could also “infiltrate, attack, and paralyze the adversary’s important civilian networks (minyong wangluo xitong).”¹⁰⁰ The PLA has moderated its expectations of the ease and effectiveness of such attacks as it has learned more about offensive cyber operations over time.¹⁰¹ But has by no means taken them off the table, as demonstrated by its ongoing exploitation of Taiwanese critical infrastructure, and Indian critical infrastructure networks during the conflict along the Sino-Indian border in 2020.¹⁰² ## Procedures for Managing Escalation Risk PLA texts do not discuss the danger of the OPE-espionage distinction problem and the risk of escalation if an intrusion is discovered in a crisis. It is unclear whether Chinese decision-makers have implemented procedures for managing inadvertent escalation risks posed by its cyber operations. Past PLA writings do not indicate that managing those risks was a priority in organizational procedures for cyber operations. This inattention to inadvertent cyber escalation risks specifically is surprising given that China has paid increasing attention to three other types of escalation risks: deliberate cyber attacks that could result in an adversary overreaction, unauthorized and accidental cyber attacks perpetrated by the PLA, and the potential for North Korean cyber attacks to be mis-attributed to China and draw it into a conflict with one of Pyongyang’s enemies.\nThe 2013 Science of Military Strategy indicates that “every country in the world is conducting cyber reconnaissance activities of differing degrees, but the possibility of this triggering a bilateral crisis, or a war starting because of this reason, is not high.”¹⁰³ The authors do not reconcile this observation with their observation that cyber surveillance and attack are indistinguishable. Similarly, the Academy of Military Science expert writing in 2016 warned of escalation risks from cyber operations that are too weak or too strong in their This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD effects on an adversary. The expert called for unified control over all aspects of cyber operations but did not recognize the possibility that espionage could be misperceived as OPE and prompt an adversary to use force.¹⁰⁴ Chinese researchers writing for academic and policy audiences vary in their assessments of whether cyber operations in general contribute to crisis instability, but they also do not pay specific attention to the OPE inadvertent escalation pathway. Associate Professor Liu Yangyue at the National University of Defense Technology is generally sanguine about the effects of cyber operations on strategic stability. He dismisses the argument in Western literature that a state could escalate in response to an initial cyber attack to stop an adversary from conducting further attacks.¹⁰⁵ Drawing on the same observational data used in Western cyber security scholarship, he argues that “when they face cyber attacks (believed to come from their enemies), states do not inevitably make worst-case calculations in their style of behavior, or let this guide their policies for responding.”¹⁰⁶ Similarly, Li Bin and Zhao Tong report that: Some Chinese experts have challenged the popular view that cyber technology will negatively affect crisis stability, because they believe this conclusion is based completely on logical deduction, instead of empirical evidence. These experts have noted that states are usually very cautious about launching military retaliations to cyber attacks, and it is very rare for cyber attacks to lead to escalation.¹⁰⁷ Nevertheless, Liu does express concern about the escalation risks posed by the difficulty of attribution. Citing the example of the Solar Sunrise intrusion discovered prior to US airstrikes against Iraq in 1998, he argues that if third-party espionage or OPE “is coincidentally discovered during a military mission, or the attacker uses more sophisticated means to conceal their identity, then this kind of attack could become a fuse for an unintended crisis.”¹⁰⁸ Other Chinese scholars are less sanguine about the escalation risks in cyberspace. But they tend to focus on the use-or-lose incentives to carry out cyber attacks early in a crisis or conflict, rather than inadvertent escalation due to the discovery of an intrusion.¹⁰⁹ PRC experts have also expressed concern about the US concept of “cross-domain deterrence,” which they interpret as threats to use conventional military operations (or even nuclear threats) to retaliate for cyber attacks.¹¹⁰ The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Ariel Levite and former PLA Col. Lyu Jinghua wrote in China Military Science that in a Sino-American conflict scenario, “one of the earliest and most destabilising venues for conflict would be cyberspace, thanks to the potential military utility of early employment of cyber assets.” Levite and Lyu acknowledge that “cyber This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM actions in these scenarios also hold serious escalatory potential, complicating the challenges of keeping conflicts below the level of outright military confrontation.” They acknowledge the OPE inadvertent escalation risk, but only briefly: “intelligence operations to monitor these networks might be misinterpreted as attacks on them, or at least attack preparations.”¹¹¹ It is unclear whether PLA planning for offensive cyber operations accounts for the escalation risks associated with OPE and, if so, how those risks are managed. The PLA promulgated a new generation of doctrine in November 2020, the first update to its official doctrine since 1999.¹¹² Unfortunately, no information about their content was available at the time of writing. Up until at least 2015, official PLA doctrine for offensive cyber operations was likely covered by doctrine for information operations, which combined electronic, cyber, and kinetic attacks.¹¹³ PLA texts published before 2015 hinted that, in the future, the PLA might have operational doctrine for stand-alone cyber operations as well as joint information operations involving cyber attacks.¹¹⁴ The PLA established the Strategic Support Force (SSF) in 2015–2016, during one of the most significant set of reforms in its history. The SSF consolidated most existing PLA cyber offense, defense, and espionage units from separate parts of its former General Staff Department and services into a Network Systems Department within the Strategic Support Force. Before the reforms, the PLA General Staff Department’s Third Department was believed to be the primary organization for cyber espionage within the PLA, while the Fourth Department was believed to have primary responsibility for offensive cyber operations.¹¹⁵ The consolidation of the former Third and Fourth departments into one organization is likely to enable the PLA to better integrate cyber operations for espionage and attack.¹¹⁶ These new organizational arrangements for military cyber operations should in theory improve the ability of top leaders to recognize and manage the crisis escalation risks associated with OPE. One of the key effects, if not drivers, of the consolidation of Chinese military cyber forces into the SSF is to enable top military leaders to exercise stricter oversight over PLA cyber operations to prevent accidental and unauthorized cyber attacks.¹¹⁷ Indeed, PLA writings published around the time the SSF was created emphasize the principle of “unified command” (tongyi zhihui) of cyber offense, defense, espionage, and control, and both PLA and non-PLA cyber capabilities.¹¹⁸ Details of how this principle of unified command is implemented in practice are scarce. Moreover, the ability of the new command structure to manage escalation risks in practice might have taken a back seat to other force building priorities. For example, the PLA’s efforts to guard against unauthorized and accidental use of cyber operations is in tension with its efforts to recruit the best cyber talent from outside This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD of the PLA. The SSF's use of contractors may revive many of the problems with oversight of cyber operations that China's leaders encountered prior to the 2015–2016 reforms.^[119]^ The nature and extent of leadership oversight of PLA cyber operations are difficult to determine. It is possible that China has established a formal institutional structure for inter-agency vetting of military plans and operations that crosses civilian and military lines. Drawing on a PLA publication about cyber operations published in 2017, John Chen, Joe McReynolds, and Kieran Green observe that “peacetime planning and guidance of cyberspace operations... at the strategic level rest in the hands of such national network security leadership organizations as the [Communist Party] Cybersecurity and Informatization Commission, while planning and guidance during wartime are the responsibility of the [PLA] CMC Joint Operations Command Center.”^[120]^ In other words, a civilian Party body takes the lead in peacetime and the PLA’s Central Military Commission takes the lead in wartime. It remains unclear how this dual command structure functions in practice. Most importantly, it remains unclear whether and, if so, to what degree managing inadvertent escalation risks resulting from OPE is a priority for the military and civilian leaders with oversight over PLA cyber operations.\n## Capabilities for Managing Cyber Risk China is developing cyber situational awareness capabilities, including attribution capabilities. But they likely lag behind the United States in its development of capabilities that could disambiguate between attackers and mitigate inadvertent escalation risks. An official white paper outlining China’s international cyberspace strategy published in 2017 indicated that: [China] will expedite the development of a [military] cyber force and enhance capabilities in terms of situational awareness, cyber defense, supporting state activities and participating in international cooperation, to prevent major cyber crisis, safeguard cyberspace security, and maintain national security and social stability.^[121]^ It is difficult to assess the extent of improvement in China’s attribution and defense capabilities since adopting these priorities in 2015. The Chinese government’s procedures for defending its networks are unclear and it has not publicly attributed cyber attacks to another state. Nevertheless, in 2018 Xi Jinping acknowledged the deterrent effect of China’s improved capability to detect intruders.^[122]^ Some Chinese cyber security firms have begun to publicly This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM attribute intrusions to known groups of hackers using industry identifiers.¹²³ They have also called for greater efforts to prevent OPE within critical infrastructure networks. For example, the Chinese company Antiy argued that China needed to “make progress in weakening the ability of an adversary to ‘prepare the battlefield’ in our industrial control [systems] and infrastructure to achieve [serious] consequences.”¹²⁴ ## Misperception in the Sino-American Cyber Relationship Do the United States and China have a shared understanding of the nature of cyber conflict, the role of OPE, and the potential for crisis instability because of the OPE-espionage distinction problem? Comparing US and Chinese approaches to cyber conflict reveals some similarities, as well as differences that could hamper future bilateral efforts to manage cyber escalation risks. Both countries recognize that OPE is necessary for sophisticated offensive cyber operations yet is indistinguishable from intrusions for the purpose of espionage, defense, or data theft. Both countries view the presence of nation-state hackers in their networks as threatening. But the two countries do not appear to share an understanding of the inadvertent escalation risks posed by the OPE-espionage distinction problem or the clarity of the threshold of an armed attack in cyberspace.\nThe comparison also reveals asymmetries in the relative maturity of cyber doctrine and capabilities in both countries. These asymmetries might explain the lack of attention to inadvertent escalation risks in China’s approach to cyber conflict. China’s doctrine, procedures, and authorities for conducting cyber operations appear to have been overhauled by the 2015–2016 PLA reforms and took some years afterwards to crystallize into their current form. As a result, the PLA has less experience integrating espionage, offensive, and defensive cyber operations and incorporating civilian oversight into its cyber operations than the United States. The PLA operational regulations promulgated in late 2020 might have included more guidance on OPE and managing its escalation risks that is not reflected in the sources examined here. Meanwhile, US cyber capabilities and strategy are relatively more mature. US organizations demonstrate growing confidence in attribution capabilities, the clarity of escalation thresholds, and US ability to control escalation from OPE or low-level cyber attacks. These factors have led to a doctrine for cyber operations that gives the military a freer hand.\nNeither China nor the United States appears to be overly concerned about its espionage activities being misperceived as OPE during a crisis, albeit for different reasons. On the one hand, China appears to be inattentive to the specific This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD escalation risks posed by OPE. On the other hand, the United States appears to be aware of the specific escalation risks associated with OPE but is confident that they can be mitigated. This suggests that both states might approach a crisis confident that their intrusions will not be discovered, misperceived, or lead to the use of force. The PLA's attention to the escalation risks associated with OPE might increase as Chinese cyber doctrine and capabilities further develop. But increased awareness is by no means a given. Chinese experts and writings on crisis management and nuclear strategy – areas where PLA doctrine and capabilities are more mature – have also tended to downplay drivers of inadvertent escalation.\nOf course, the lack of concern about the escalation risks associated with OPE could reflect a shared lack of concern that cyber attacks could cause much harm in a crisis, supporting the bluster de-escalation hypothesis. OPE may simply be accepted practice between these two countries.[125] They might expect that some of their key networks will be disabled by their adversaries' offensive cyber operations during future conflicts. They might prepare to fight without those networks instead of pre-empting cyber attacks that could disable them. We are cautious, however, about interpreting the evidence as confirmation of the bluster hypothesis. Evidence that China both acknowledges and shares US confidence that inadvertent cyber escalation risks can be managed – which we did not find – would have reduced the need for caution in interpreting the evidence in favor of the bluster de-escalation hypothesis.\n## Initiatives to Mitigate Misperceptions In the absence of a shared understanding of cyber conflict, two initiatives could reduce the risk of inadvertent cyber escalation via the misperception pathway in a future Sino-American crisis: dialogue to ensure that both parties understand each other's approach to cyber operations, and a crisis communication mechanism specific to cyber operations. Dialogue and crisis communication could reduce the likelihood of either side misperceiving the other's cyber intrusion as OPE, or as confirmation of the other's hostile intentions, because of differences in their understandings of cyber conflict and operations.[126] Unfortunately, China and the United States do not currently have an official military cyber dialogue that could bridge some of the gaps in their understandings of military cyber operations before a crisis emerges, despite establishing official dialogues to enable cooperation in non-military areas of the cyber relationship in 2015. Nor do China and the United States currently have a mechanism in place for crisis communications dedicated to cyber matters. By contrast, the United States has a three-tier cyber communications protocol in This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms BEN BUCHANAN AND FIONA S. CUNNINGHAM place with Russia that involves a direct line between the White House and the Kremlin.¹²⁷ ## Conclusion Could military cyber capabilities contribute to the outbreak of conflict in a future crisis involving the United States and China? Although our empirical analysis is unable to provide a definitive answer to this question, it provides enough evidence to suggest that inadvertent escalation could occur if one state discovered the other's cyber intrusions in a crisis. Over the past decade or so, the United States has made unilateral attempts to limit the risks of inadvertent escalation occurring, first with strict organizational procedures governing all cyber operations and later with more robust operational procedures to defend its networks. There is little evidence that China has taken similar steps to unilaterally mitigate inadvertent escalation risks from cyber operations. The bilateral cyber relationship also lacks the shared understandings of these risks, and mechanisms for dialogue in peacetime or communications in crises, that could improve crisis stability.\nEven a small probability of inadvertent escalation could have extremely serious consequences, given how destructive a Sino-American conflict could be and the variety of other escalation risks present in the relationship. Our empirical analysis could also support the claim that cyber capabilities do not pose a serious enough threat for decision-makers to use force – whether cyber or kinetic – to pre-empt or retaliate. However, in the absence of stronger evidence to support this bluster hypothesis, we do not dismiss the risk that the OPE-espionage distinction problem could add to crisis instability given the stakes at hand.\nThis chapter suggests that further research is needed to establish whether US confidence that cyber operations do not add to crisis stability is well founded. US adversaries' reluctance to escalate in response to cyber attacks or intrusions might reflect their countervailing strategic and political disincentives to escalate, rather than the stabilizing nature of cyber operations.¹²⁸ Brandon Valeriano, Benjamin M. Jensen, and Ryan C. Maness find that the United States has been successful in using cyberspace to coerce adversaries.¹²⁹ Scholars have pointed out that cyber operations are likely to have their greatest effects on international relations when combined with superior conventional military power.¹³⁰ The possibility that US conventional military power might mask the destabilizing effects of cyber operations suggests that the United States should be cautious as Chinese conventional military capabilities improve. If a Sino-American crisis had occurred during the past decade, Beijing would have This content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:06 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms PREPARING THE CYBER BATTLEFIELD faced strong countervailing pressures not to use force in response to a cyber intrusion, even if it judged that intrusion to pose a serious threat. Going forward, even if the PRC views an intrusion as a serious but manageable threat, its growing conventional capabilities and tense relationship with Washington could create an excuse for deliberate PRC escalation. And if the intrusion were intolerable, political and strategic disincentives could not be counted on to restrain China's leaders from using force."
