This misses the larger possibilities for political/military chain reactions that cyber warfare may prompt, possibly leading to armed conflict. This article utilizes Offense-Defense theory to appraise the influence of cyber warfare on international security and the prospects for conflict. Offense-Defense theory, as applied here, better explains the relationship between technological innovation and international politics, and leads to different conclusions from other realist approaches. Redefining the Offense-Defense balance to accommodate cyberspace leads to an emphasis on the offensive advantages of cyber capabilities. The offensive and defensive cyber postures of China, Russia, the United States, and NATO are examined here to empirically assess the role of cyber warfare in security policy. Evidence shows that innovations in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) allow states to take greater risks and adopt more vigilant or offensive positions toward adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but make decisions to escalate easier and cheaper. A strategic enabler that provides attackers greater freedom of action, cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if it is not a sufficient one.\n## Introduction\nIn September 2007, Israeli military cyber warriors reportedly hacked into the Syrian monitoring and anti-aircraft missile defences to allow Israeli fighter jets to bomb the suspected nuclear reactor near Deir el-Zor.¹ As described by one account:\n[T]he main attack was preceded by an engagement with a single Syrian radar site at Tall al-Abuad near the Turkish border. It was assaulted with what appears to be a combination of electronic attack and precision bombs to enable the Israeli force to enter and exit Syrian airspace. Almost immediately, the entire Syrian radar system went off the air for a period of time that included the raid.²\nThis incident, along with others discussed here, suggests that we are in the course of a new era, similar to past transformations in international security, such as the airplane, the tank, or the nuclear bomb, innovations that culminated in radical departures in strategic thinking and behaviour. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) not only drives the internet, the iPhone, or the Global Positioning System (GPS). Nowadays, ICT has become an integral and possibly an essential military\nContemporary Security Policy, Vol.34, No.1, 2013, pp.40-63\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2013.771031 © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis\ncapability. The cyber sphere of action it created is replacing the conventional battlefield.3\nSome observers argue that for realists cyber warfare is ‘old wine in a new bottle'; its added value is rather marginal.4 This downplays the broader implications of cyber warfare, stressing only technical aspects and focusing on information warfare (IW), one operative manifestation of cyber warfare, rather than the possibilities for political/military chain reaction that cyber warfare may prompt, ending in armed conflict.5 Consequently, this article is not concerned with specific cyber tactics like computer-based commercial espionage or phishing per se. Rather, this analysis stresses the integration of ICT applications aimed at disrupting, paralysing, and possibly destroying another state's assets, with a direct bearing on national security and critical infrastructure, and especially its capacity to conduct military operations.6\nThis article has two main objectives. First, despite the large number of studies dealing with cyber warfare, we are still lacking a realist theoretical conceptualization of its influence on international security in general and on the pervasiveness of war in particular.7 This analysis examines the relevance of realism as a technologically, rather than a territorially, based explanation for international security in the information age. Considering the fact that ‘[r]ealist theories ... still provide a context and motivation for many of the most important theoretical debates in the field', as Jack Donnelly asserts, it is almost inconceivable that realism will not take a shot at explaining the dramatic technological shift in the security environment caused by cyber warfare.8 This article employs realist Offense-Defense theory to evaluate the expected effect of ICT on the prevalence of war, using the most suitable realist framework to explore the nexus between technological innovation and international politics, and especially questions of war and peace.9 In contrast to other scholars, who apply Offense-Defense theory to support cyber deterrence, this treatment stresses the need to dramatically modify Offense-Defense terminology to better address cyber warfare's unique and revolutionary features.10\nSecond, this article tests this Offense-Defense framework, empirically evaluating the role of cyber warfare in contemporary military strategic thinking and state behaviour. The evolving cyber postures of China, Russia, NATO, and the United States show to what extent cyber warfare concepts have gained traction among leaders, strategists, and military planners. Since we are dealing with ongoing technological developments, their policy implications far from determined, this study is more of a probe into a possible future rather than a final ruling. Nevertheless, from existing evidence it is possible to infer that ICT allows states to take greater risks and thus adopt more vigilant or offensive positions vis-à-vis their adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but their existence makes the decision to escalate armed conflict easier and considerably cheaper. ICT can be considered a strategic enabler and an efficient force multiplier that provides the attacker with greater freedom of action.\nThe article first, briefly, discusses the current status of Offense-Defense theory and suggests a fundamental conceptual amendment to allow realism to better incorporate cyber warfare into accounts of contemporary international security. It then proceeds to evaluate the cyber Offense-Defense balance to locate its strategic orientation. The cyber posture of four of the prominent actors in contemporary world\naffairs -- China, Russia, NATO, and the United States -- are examined in order to assess the effect of the cyber Offense-Defense balance on their security policies.\nIt is the conclusion of this article that for realism to maintain its relevance, it must transcend traditional territorial and kinetic traits of international security, or at least give more room for novel technological factors, and consider cyberspace as an alternative realm that states utilize to attack others. ICT and employment of cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if not a sufficient one, and realism must adjust its theoretical foundations and predictions accordingly. At a minimum, cyber warfare is an influential force multiplier or conflict enabler. At a maximum, it is a strategic game changer.11 But while the potential of cyber warfare to revolutionize international security and interstate conflict is dramatic, the scale of this transformation will be determined by political rather than technological considerations.\n## Cybernating Offense-Defense Theory\nOffense-Defense theory has generated heated debates ever since it was introduced by Robert Jervis and George Quester in the late 1970s.12 Jervis contended that the orientation of different military capabilities and weaponry systems may influence interstate security dilemmas and therefore the prevalence of war or peace. ‘When we say that the offense has the advantage, we simply mean that it is easier to destroy the other's army', he explains. ‘When the defense has the advantage, it is easier to protect and hold than it is to move forward, destroy and take.' Quester, applying the same logic, concluded that ‘likelihoods of war are thus clearly influenced by how effective the offensive weapon seems to be, as compared with the defensive'.13\nOffense-Defense theory was heavily criticized for both its methodological foundation and empirical applicability.14 Thus, various attempts were made to salvage the theory and present an amended version that would bolster its standing as a leading realist theory.15 One of the most lethal criticisms had to do with the difficulty of differentiating between the offensive or defensive nature of military capabilities or technologies. In response, Charles Glaser and Chaim Kaufmann, for example, suggested that the Offense-Defense balance -- the driving engine of the theory -- should be considered as the ‘... ratio of the cost of the forces the attacker requires to take territory to the cost of the forces the defender has deployed'.16\nStill, the traditional interpretation of Offense-Defense theory, as stipulated by both advocates and critics, is somewhat anachronistic and to some extent irrelevant to the information age. It presumes that war is conducted and concluded according to a kinetic basis and a territorial logic. Furthermore, the determinism of offensive and defensive capabilities, the security dilemma and armed conflict, is simplistic. It fosters a flawed ‘major war pathology' that does not necessarily exist today. One can plausibly imagine an armed conflict that is not necessarily aimed at unconditional surrender or territorial occupation, but tends to be much more limited, although it can turn into an all-out war of course, a kind of slippery slope interstate militarized dynamics.17 Second, and more importantly, since the conduct of contemporary warfare is dependent on ICT infrastructure, cyberspace becomes a contested\ndomain in which cyberwar, or major technological conflicts, may take place or even be determined.18 As James Adams notes, ‘[a]round the world, information technology increasingly pervades weapons systems, defense infrastructures and national economies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new international battlefield'.19\nCyberwar may not solely determine the outcomes of future armed conflicts and interstate rivalries, but it can influence leaders' determination to prefer military options over political solutions. Since the early 1990s, policymakers have become deeply aware of ICT-based systems' vulnerability, their influence on states' national security posture, and the ability to conduct military operations.20 Former American Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn recently acknowledged that ICT\n> enables almost everything the US military does: logistical support and global command and control of forces, real-time provision of intelligence, and remote operations ... The US government's digital infrastructure now gives the United States critical advantages over any adversary, but its reliance on computer networks also potentially enables adversaries to gain valuable intelligence about US capabilities and operations, to impede the United States' conventional military forces, and to disrupt the US economy.21\nBut is cyberspace defence or offence oriented? According to Lynn, the answer is straightforward: ‘In cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand'.22 This may be intuitively correct, and surely this position is shared by the vast majority of scholars and practitioners, but how can Offense-Defense theory provide a more founded answer to this question? This article suggests that Offense-Defense theory can effectively perform this task after updating its conceptual basis. Essentially, the balance between offence and defence is determined, in the traditional fashion, according to two key factors: mobility enhancement and firepower's degree of destructiveness.23 However, these determinants are not necessarily relevant to cyber warfare and thus must be redefined in order to address the technologically different security environment we are dealing with in the information age and the various expressions of cyber warfare.24\n### From Mobility to ‘Versatility'\nUnlike the customary kinetic and territorially based interpretation of the term mobility in Offense-Defense theory literature that relates to the possibility of relocating combatants at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,25 in cyberspace mobility actually relates to the capacity to technologically attack different types of ICT-based targets at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than thinking in terms of the physical allocation of armed forces across or between combat zones, in cyberwar we should talk of cyber versatility that corresponds to levels of war hierarchy.26\nStrategic targets or critical infrastructures consist of vital or centre-of-gravity assets whose destruction may have a colossal effect on a state's national security and its capacity to operate normally.27 Such elements include a state's military constellations, defence industrial base, satellite communication, electrical power grid, internet connectivity, central banking system, stock market, ministries, and\ngovernmental agencies.28 On the operational level, where the focus is on related ICT-based systems, cyber warfare may foil the use of military and warning systems such as anti-aircraft missile systems, reconnaissance capabilities, or the hacking into an enemy's technological capabilities such as drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).29 On the tactical level, when the focus is on a particular and segmented ICT-based system, cyber warfare may interrupt battlefield communication and coordination, disrupt electronic signals such as radio and GPS signals, or eliminate them completely.30\n### From Firepower to ‘Byte Power'\nUnlike the customary territorially based interpretation of this feature in the Offense-Defense theory literature that primarily revolves around accuracy and destructiveness of certain weapons, in cyberspace firepower actually relates to the degree of technological damage that can be inflicted on the enemy's ICT-based infrastructure at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than talk of kinetic firepower, in cyber warfare the idea is to examine how much byte power a state can extract and direct towards an adversary's ICT-based targets.\nWhile the Offense-Defense theory literature typically maintains that the greater a weapon's firepower the greater its contribution to the defence,31 this assertion is challenged by prominent Offense-Defense theorists and it seems largely misguided in cyberspace. Glaser and Kaufman argue, for example, that ‘... there can be exceptions when specific firepower innovations are differentially useful against defender'.32 It seems that moving from the territorial and/or the kinetic to cyberspace allows such an exception, especially if we are dealing with highly accurate and low-signature cyber capabilities that allow the attacking and possible neutralization of an enemy's defence systems with virtual anonymity.33 Furthermore, and primarily as a complementary mechanism, selective or surgical cyberattacks may greatly improve the effectiveness of offensive conventional weapons by creating a cyber window of opportunity for conventional activities through which both combatants and equipment can penetrate more easily an otherwise unassailable target.34\nTo sum up this section, ICT-induced cyber capabilities tilt the Offense-Defense balance in favour of the offence, not in the prospects of gaining and maintaining control over territory and material resources as a manifestation of victory, but rather in the actual possibility to paralyse the enemy's military deployment and civilian preparedness and drastically limit its retaliatory potential. Since the use of cyber capabilities according to both indicators suggests that offence has the advantage, let us turn to evaluate the relevance of cyber warfare to the process of policymaking. For offence-dominant cyber capabilities to actually influence calculations and decisions in matters of war and peace, leaders and policymakers must be aware of these technologically advanced capabilities and acknowledge their strategic advantages. In the words of Keir Lieber, the influence of technological innovation ‘... is always filtered through the strategies that state decision makers employ in pursuit of their political goals. In simplest terms, politics -- more than technology -- is the master'.35\nThe aim is not, however, to meticulously describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures, i.e. the overall strategy designed to\naddress different ICT-based challenges and threats by applying a multitude of proactive and passive measures. Rather, I present a succinct account to highlight key features and contemporary ramifications for war and peace. Given their offensive nature, the following section will try to assess whether the use of cyber capabilities actually prompted armed conflict, and under what conditions.\n## The Politics of Cyberwar and Peace\nGenerally speaking, America, China, and Russia have long histories of attempting to combine political aims with advanced technology, while NATO primarily benefited from the American efforts. The Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), warmly adopted by the Americans in the late 1980s and successfully implemented during the Gulf War, was in fact an adaptation of the 1970s Soviet Military-Technical Revolution (MTR). As Elliot Cohen observes, the idea was to promote ‘... an imminent technical revolution that would give conventional weapons a level of effectiveness in the field comparable to that of small tactical nuclear weapons'.\nThe following accounts describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures to assess the influence of ICT-based capabilities on strategic thinking and behaviour. There is an important caveat to this analysis; cyber warfare suffers from a major problem of attributing attacks to specific state actors. Some of the cases discussed below include acts by non-state actors such as individuals, hacktivists, netizens, or more organized cyber militias and cyber gangs. Nevertheless, there is a growing consensus in the literature that these non-state actors mostly operate in tandem with national governments and follow their lead as proxies and their contribution should be considered an integral part of a state's overall cyber policy.\n### American Cyber Posture\nIt seems that the most robust, sophisticated, and technically and institutionally up-to-date cyber posture is the American one, despite its paradoxical defensive nature. While the United States is the primary target for different forms of cyber warfare, especially cyber spying and phishing, it also possesses the highest potential to become a cyber superpower with the most vigorous state-run ICT-based posture. In the early 1990s, the Gulf War exhibited American technological superiority in terms of both hardware and software as countless stealth fighters bombarded Iraq without being detected by Iraqi anti-aircraft missile systems using state of the art precision-guided munitions (PGMs). American technological superiority was a decisive factor in defeating Iraq. As commander of US Central Command during the Gulf War, Norman Schwarzkopf argued that technological innovation worked ‘beyond our wildest expectations'.\nGiven America's growing reliance on ICT in the battlefield and in the supportive and logistical military formations, and repeated reports concerning a breach of computer networks such as in the case of the air force's Rome Air Development Center in March 1994, it became clear that this virtual Achilles heel must be protected. In 1995,\nthe Clinton administration's national security strategy proclaimed that ‘the threat of intrusions to our military and commercial information systems poses a significant risk to national security and must be addressed'. In June 1997 the US government conducted Eligible Receiver, the very first information warfare (IW) exercise that exposed the vulnerability of American military and civilian critical infrastructures in case of a coordinated cyberattack.\nBut as American policymakers and strategists feared their vital technological structures, they also become increasingly interested in exploiting this new strategic domain in their favour. Indeed, while the Kosovo war was overwhelmingly won by conducting conventional massive air bombing against Serb targets, some observers asserted that the accuracy and efficiency of these aerial campaigns were the outcome of cyber warfare-like operations, especially in directing the bombers to their targets from the ground. Furthermore, while it is not exactly clear what additional cyber measures were used against Serb targets, it was reported that the United States and NATO conducted various sophisticated cyberattacks that included penetrations of Serbian ICT systems and overloading them with data or manipulating their databases. Hence the use of cyber capabilities at the operational level was not only disruptive in nature but also proactive and offensive in its attempt to frustrate Serbian defensive formation and retaliatory military options.\nDuring the War on Terror campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, cyber warfare did not play a significant role. In both cases, the United States had virtually no critical ICT assets to attack or disrupt and the focus was on traditional, if irregular, combat operations. Nevertheless, it was reported that a month before the Iraq War began, President Bush signed a secret directive ordering the development of an American strategy for large-scale pre-emptive cyberattacks against adversaries of the United States.\nIt was then reported that the United States was pre-emptively cutting off the Iraqi computer network and internet grid that connected civilian and government agencies before war began in March 2003. According to Richard Clarke, the Iraqi Defense Ministry's email system was hacked by the Americans in order to warn high-ranking officers about opposing the future invasion and to assure them that the objective was to overthrow Saddam Hussein and not to destroy Iraq's political, military, and socioeconomic structures. Another path that was explored but not pursued was hacking into the regime's financial institutions and foreign bank accounts in order to locate Saddam Hussein's hidden assets.\nAt about the same time, Chinese hackers apparently orchestrated a major cyberattack on American computer systems at NASA and Sandia National Laboratories. It was made clearer following these incidents and others that the United States must re-evaluate its cyber policy and possibly change its approach. Yet the discourse remained rather defensive, primarily focused on protecting American critical infrastructure and confidential databases. When George W. Bush published his administration's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003, its objective was ‘... to secure the portions of cyberspace that they own, operate, control, or with which they interact'. The military establishment, on the other hand, was much more assertive in its approach to cyber warfare, as the 2004 Military Strategy asserted:\nThe Armed Forces must have the ability to operate across the air, land, sea, space and cyberspace domains of the battlespace ... The non-linear nature of the current security environment requires multi-layered active and passive measures to counter numerous diverse conventional and asymmetric threats ... They also include threats in cyberspace aimed at networks and data critical to US information-enabled systems. Such threats require a comprehensive concept of deterrence encompassing traditional adversaries, terrorist networks and rogue states able to employ any range of capabilities.52”\nThe 2005 National Defense Strategy further proclaimed that alongside traditional and irregular security challenges the United States confronts, cyberwarfare may constitute a threat that under certain conditions “... can fundamentally alter long-established concepts of warfare. Some potential adversaries are seeking disruptive capabilities to exploit US vulnerabilities and offset the current advantages of the United States and its partners'.53 Consequently, the stated military applications of cyber capabilities were made more offensive than ever a year later when the 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations noted:“[T]he United States must have cyberspace superiority to ensure our freedom of action and deny the same to our adversaries through the integration of network defense, exploitation, and attack ... Offensive capabilities in cyberspace offer the United States and our adversaries an opportunity to gain and maintain the initiative. DOD cyberspace operations are strongest when offensive and defensive capabilities are mutually supporting. This requires a long-range focus and dedicated resources to achieve this goal.54”\nThe director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Keith Alexander, argued in 2007 that the United States should reformulate the operational and institutional foundations of its cyber posture in order to address the technologically induced security environment, since“while we have ample national level strategies, we have yet to translate these strategies into operational art through development of joint doctrine for cyberspace. Through the doctrine vetting process, we can develop a common understanding of what it means to conduct warfare within and through cyberspace.55”\nIndeed, in early 2008 President Bush issued a directive that allows American intelligence agencies, especially the NSA, to monitor all internet traffic of the federal government in order to protect vital assets from cyberattacks. What makes this directive a major turning point in American cyber warfare evolution is that under Bush's initiative, the NSA with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) could provide the Pentagon with evidence that a pre-emptive cyberattack is crucial in order to protect American critical infrastructure.56\nIn early 2009, soon after taking office, President Barack Obama announced his administration's cyber policy, which remained rather committed to the defensive notion of protecting and securing critical infrastructure in what was often referred to as cyber security.57 Yet in April it was reported that the White House was, in\nfact, in the final stages of establishing a new cyber agency under the Pentagon's authority which could develop offensive cyber weapons alongside defending American ICT critical infrastructure. Former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, was appointed as director of the Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and while he was rather cautious in attributing any offensive aspects to the new command, the Pentagon declared that the mission of this new agency was to:“[d]irect the operations and defence of specified Department of Defense information networks [involving some 90,000 military personnel] and prepare to, when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, [to] ensure US allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.”\nMore recently, it was reported that the Pentagon is formulating a particular strategy that will engage the threats emanating from cyber warfare under the premise that any such attack on behalf of a foreign country constitutes a declaration of war that may result in armed conflict. In effect, however, President Obama did not approve a pre-emptive cyber offensive against Libya before the United States led the military campaign against Muammar Qaddafi in March 2011. The idea was to use cyber warfare in order to hinder Libya's air defence systems, but the option was abandoned, according to some government officials, because the Obama administration feared it would act as a precedent for Russian or Chinese future offensive attacks. One Defense Department official said the cyber options ‘... were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya's air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn't pan out'. Another White House official argued that ‘[t]hese cybercapabilities are still like the Ferrari that you keep in the garage and only take out for the big race and not just for a run around town, unless nothing else can get you there'.\nIn the aftermath of the war in Libya, the White House attempted to provide the most comprehensive and inclusive cyber strategy to date. But despite the clear defensive tone of the document, especially when considering the ambiguity of the parts relating to cyber deterrence mechanisms, there was more than a hint of offensive reasoning:“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic -- as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.”\nThe debate concerning the defensive or offensive posture of American cyber strategy or its passive or proactive nature is still ongoing. Recently, General Robert Kehler, Commander of US Strategic Command that oversees CYBERCOM, commented that the optimal solution would involve both: ‘I think we are looking at\nwhat an offensive component would be: what does that look like? What kind of options would we want to be able to offer? I think that we have always said that there needs to be an offense and defense mix'. These questions remain unanswered.\n### Chinese Cyber Posture\nIt is extremely difficult to fully account for the cyber posture of China and its development over the years. In China, defence-related transparency is a rare commodity. Yet it is widely known and established that the Chinese pursued a robust modernization in military technology and tactics from the late 1970s. Maoist ideology not only determined the political and societal structure of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its inception in 1949, it also served as China's military national defence strategy in that it revolved around the concept of ‘People's War' and the mobilization of the masses for a protracted armed conflict. After the death of Mao in 1976, and under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, a new conceptualization of Chinese warfare emerged that gradually became highly receptive to technological, industrial, and economic developments, making the entire defence apparatus much more open to engage the challenge of future armed conflict in the information age. From an operative vantage point, China gradually abandoned Mao's conception of active defence in favour of a pre-emptive military orientation that advocates a first strike mentality.\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, which strained Sino-American relations, highlighted historical anti-Western sentiments and created a shaky setting for the post-Cold War era. Consequently, by the mid 1990s China was caught paradoxically in an international constellation that was just as challenging as the Cold War international system. American intentions to redraw the global and regional landscape, and especially Washington's reactions to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, were badly received in Beijing. Consequently, the United States was increasingly considered to be a major source of danger to China's national interests and political order.\nAmerican military performance during the Gulf War highlighted the technological inferiority of the PLA and encouraged the Chinese leadership to accelerate and broaden existing plans to modernize and improve the army's capabilities for the purpose of potentially waging a limited or local war. Indeed, newly elected General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Jiang Zemin was confident that a comprehensive modernization of the Chinese armed forces amid what he considered American military superiority and interference in China's internal affairs was of great importance. Thus, he encouraged technological modernization according to American standards when he told members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in early 1993 that ‘[w]e must win high-tech, small-scale wars under modern conditions'. Similarly, the Chairman of the Commission on Science, Technology and National Defense Industry (COSTIND) General Ding Henggao warned that ‘[t]he one who possesses high-tech superiority will have the upper hand on the battlefield'.\nModernizing and increasing the professionalism of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was also matched with vigorous ICT-based innovation. As Major General\nWeng Pufang, former director of the Strategy Department of the Chinese Academy of Military Science, argued in a 1995 article he published in a Chinese military journal:“The thrust of China's military construction and development of weapons and equipment will no longer be toward strengthening the ‘firepower antipersonnel system' of the industrial age, but toward the strengthening of information technology, information weapons and information networking. Our sights must not be fixed on the firepower warfare of the industrial age, rather they must be trained on the information warfare of the information age.74”\nThe PLA became highly interested in exploiting these technological innovations and restructured its ICT-based military units to comprise the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Department (GSD), currently entrusted with exploitation of foreign computer networks, whereas the Fourth Department of the GSD is responsible for attacking foreign computer networks.75 Indeed, after an agreement with Cuba was signed in February 1998, China built two cyber warfare stations, one eavesdropping telephone and internet communications in the United States and the other more concerned with monitoring American military satellite systems.76 But in addition to these military units, the Chinese government has reportedly outsourced some of its cyber warfare tasks to civilian groups that are systematically activated and thus enable greater international flexibility due to cyber warfare's attribution problem.77\nIn the early 2000s, Beijing was ostensibly involved in numerous successful attempts to hack into American databases and critical infrastructure such as nuclear and electric power plants, satellite systems, and a number of Department of Defense contractors that store confidential information and blueprints of future weapon systems.78 China also launched an ambitious anti-satellite weapons program aimed at levelling the odds against American espionage and to attack satellite systems that are perceived by Beijing as utterly anti-Chinese in nature.79 Hence, China's cyber posture is primarily a deterrent against American military superiority but it has deep and conscious long-term advantages that Beijing may cash in on in time of need. In fact, China's cyber posture will only benefit an offensive orientation compared with the current defensive traits of the American cyber posture if Beijing needs to prevent Washington from interfering in matters related to Taiwan, for example.80 China's 2000 Defense White Paper explicitly adhered to this transformative phase of the PLA's posture into an ICT-based modernized army:“Faced with the world's military developments and the characteristics of modern warfare, the Chinese armed forces will, in the course of modernizing their weaponry, devote themselves to transforming semi-mechanized and mechanized weapon systems to automatized and informationized systems as soon as possible, so that they can possess weapons as advanced as possible and assure the accomplishment of the sacred missions assigned to them by the nation.81”\nA report submitted to the American Congress in 2007 argued that China not only possesses the cyber capabilities required to conduct comprehensive offensive cyberattacks against the United States: ‘In 2005, the PLA began to incorporate offensive\nCYBER POSTURING AND THE OFFENSE-DEFENSE BALANCE\nComputer Network Operations (CNOs) into its exercises, primarily in first strikes against enemy networks'. Indeed, China's 2008 Defense White Paper proclaimed in the sections dealing with the technological dimensions of modern warfare that\nChina is accelerating reform and innovation in its defense-related science, technology and industry ... Defense-related science, technology and industry are striving to enhance the informationization of weaponry and equipment design and development, and to render product design more digitalized, modularized, standardized and reliable.[83]\nIn sum, the Chinese consider cyber warfare and its auxiliary elements as a power multiplier, integral to their national security strategy. Thus far, China has refrained from presenting a comprehensive cyber strategy but in practice it has primarily involved strategic and tactical hacking into American and other Western countries' databases and internet systems for reasons of technological and operative military espionage. While there were numerous indications of China's involvement in penetrating critical ICT-based infrastructure in the United States, Beijing has not used its existing cyber assets thus far to directly attack American strategic military assets in order to neutralize them but instead has focused on cyber spying. This pattern may change under certain conditions, especially if Beijing wishes to diversify its policy alternatives in case of a Sino-American confrontation.[84]\n## Russian Cyber Posture\nWhereas in the two previous cases the strategizing of ICT as military capabilities was ambiguous at best, and there was certainly no actual use of cyber warfare as part of armed conflict, the case of Russia in the first decade of the 21st century can be easily dubbed as an exemplary case for the opposite. To begin with, during most of the 1990s Russia was grappling with the devastating economic, social, and political effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign and defence policy was primarily focused on '... disarmament and limitation of the arms race - in terms of releasing as many resources as possible and creating the most favorable conditions for the implementation of our socioeconomic reforms'.[85]\nIn December 1994, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signalled his intention to alter Russia's foreign and defence orientation when he decided to invade Chechnya, a conflict that '... demonstrated the full extent of the armed forces' decline. In virtually every respect, the Russian military failed the challenge it was supposed to easily master'.[86] By 1996, in face of failure in Chechnya and growing domestic opposition, Yeltsin moved to replace the moderate and pro-Western Kozyrev with Yevgeny Primakov who also served as Prime Minister between September 1998 and May 1999. Indicatively, in his first press conference Primakov asserted that 'Russia was and remains a great power. Her foreign policy should correspond to that status'.[87]\nThe weaknesses of Russia's conventional and non-conventional military postures led many Russian military thinkers and officials to regard ICT-based capabilities as a way to compensate for strategic inferiority. During the mid 1990s, the Russian Army\nCONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY\nand Defense Ministry began seriously examining the nexus between technology and the regular military structure.⁸⁸ Russia was openly using IW during the second Chechen war.⁸⁹ The first major indication of coordinated Russian cyber warfare (in addition to IW) took place in Estonia in 2007, after a monument commemorating the Red Army’s re-conquest of Estonia during the Second World War was moved despite the Kremlin’s explicit warning.⁹⁰\nRather than exclusively resorting to military force in order to resolve what Moscow considered explicit anti-Russian reactionary sentiments and policies, as they did during the Chechen military campaigns in 1994 and 1999 for example, this time Moscow pursued a much more sophisticated approach that included inducing political riots in Estonia and targeting Estonia’s ICT infrastructure such as the banking sector, parliament’s website and email system, emergency phone lines, hospitals, and universities.⁹¹ During a period of several weeks in May 2007, after the statue was relocated, official Estonian governmental websites and vital telecommunications infrastructure were attacked and rendered inactive, according to most accounts, by Russian perpetrators.⁹²\nRussian policymakers began to appreciate the role of ICT and cyber warfare as an auxiliary instrument of coercion and statecraft against what they considered uncooperative regimes in the post-Soviet rim. And the lessons learned during the Estonian affair were apparently applied as part of Russia’s involvement in the Georgian war in August 2008.⁹³ Essentially, in response to Georgia’s attack against South Ossetia, Russian forces invaded Georgia and practically subdued it within a matter of days. Yet even before the first bullet was fired, the Kremlin decided to employ a preemptive strategic disruptive cyber attack.⁹⁴\nIn mid July, several cyberattacks were waged against Georgian websites and two weeks later a second wave of cyberattacks on Georgian targets was detected. A few days into the war, the vast majority of Georgian government websites were not functioning; in effect, the Georgian government was, as one study asserted, ‘cyber-locked’, without viable access to the internet and to its state-run agencies including the National Bank of Georgia.⁹⁵ No less important, the Georgian government was unable to communicate with the citizens or conduct its own retaliatory IW against Russia.⁹⁶ Fortunately for Georgia, and unlike in the Estonian case, critical infrastructure such as the electrical power grid is far less modernized and consequently more difficult to damage by using ICT-based capabilities.⁹⁷\nIn February 2010, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev approved the new Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation where some key references to the use of cyber warfare as an instrumental offensive military capability can be clearly observed. For example, when dealing with the features of modern military conflicts, the document states that such one trait, from Russia’s perspective, is the ‘... early conduct [of] information warfare activities to achieve political objectives without the use of military force, and subsequently – in the interest of creating a favorable reaction of the international community – to use military force’. And when referring to Russian future acquisition plans for the armed forces, the doctrine highlights that a key task involves the ‘... development of the forces and means of information warfare’.⁹⁸\nIn early 2012 the Russian Ministry of Defense revealed the Kremlin's cyber strategy under the title Conceptual Views Regarding the Activity of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space. It refrains from referring to offensive cyber warfare, but it does address issues pertaining to control, prevention, and solution of cyber conflicts. The document acknowledges the right of Russia to employ counteroffensive cyber warfare: ‘The escalation of a conflict in the cyber-space and its turn into a crisis gives the right to an individual or collective self-defense and the use of any means necessary that do not contradict the universally accepted norms and the principles of international law'. Based on Russia's past behaviour and the recent proclamation of its cyber strategy, it appears that Moscow may be more than willing to use different forms of cyber warfare should political needs emerge.\n### NATO Cyber Posture\nThus far, our empirical description has exclusively focused on state actors, but since NATO plays such a major role in the contemporary security environment it seems that examining the way it relates to cyber warfare will present a more accurate account for our purposes. Interestingly enough, despite NATO's transparency on the whole, there is very little access to the more operational and sometimes technical aspects of the Alliance's cyber strategy. Nevertheless, from the available materials we can identify NATO's defensive approach to cyber warfare and cyber security.\nOriginally, NATO was not only established to address the Soviet threat in Europe. Lord Ismay, NATO's first Secretary General, contended that its objectives were to keep ‘the Russians out, the Germans down, and the Americans in'. After the Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, NATO had to reinvent itself and identify new objectives in order to preserve its relevance and mere existence. The multiplicity of political and military goals combined with the willingness of its member states enabled NATO to successfully overcome this transitional period and undergo a process of remarkable institutional change that resulted in a renewed transatlantic mandate to develop new mechanisms and strategies in order to cope with the changing security environment.\nThe treatment of cyber warfare as part of NATO's evolving security concerns became decidedly evident in the early 2000s. Unlike the United States, China, or Russia, who were individually concerned with cyber warfare of various kinds and for different reasons as described earlier, throughout the 1990s NATO was primarily focused on its internal restructuring, the expansion eastwards to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and, of course, militarily operating in the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia.\nThe 1999 Strategic Concept declared that ‘[s]tate and non-state adversaries may try to exploit the Alliance's growing reliance on information systems through information operations designed to disrupt such systems. They may attempt to use strategies of this kind to counter NATO's superiority in traditional weaponry'. Yet the first explicit reference to cyber warfare was actually made in November 2002 during NATO's Prague summit, when it was declared that the member countries\ndecided to ‘... strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber attacks'. One operative outcome was the establishment of NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which was charged with the task of protecting ICT infrastructure and networks from unauthorized intrusion for espionage purposes or attempts to infect them with viruses. But this was a rather technical organ lacking any long-term military planning capacity, a feature that did not change significantly even following NATO's summit in Riga in November 2006 which further called for developing cyber-deterrence capabilities and doctrines. Russian cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 explicated NATO's military, infrastructural, and political weaknesses in the face of this new form of security threat, but the response as articulated by NATO's defence ministers was remarkably protective, arguing that ‘[u]rgent work is needed to enhance the ability to protect information systems of critical importance'.\nIn early 2008 it was reported that NATO officials further debated the need to protect the Alliance's assets against future cyberattacks, claiming that ‘[c]yber defence is now mentioned at the highest level along with missile defence and energy security'. While the attacks against Estonia did not result in the application of the collective security clause of the treaty, it did trigger a prompt institutional response. In January the Policy on Cyber Defence was presented and approved. During the Bucharest summit in April, the Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA) and the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) were established. Whereas the CDMA was entrusted with overseeing NATO's cyber defence efforts and providing guidance and assistance to the member countries in case of cyber-related crises, the CCDCOE, located in Estonia, was designed ‘... to enhance the capability, cooperation and information sharing among NATO, NATO nations and partners in cyber defence by virtue of education, research and development, lessons learned and consultation'.\nBoth agencies represent a highly defensive reaction to NATO's security challenges involving cyber warfare. As the Bucharest summit declaration proclaimed, the official cyber policy ‘... emphasizes the need for NATO and nations to protect key information systems in accordance with their respective responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack'. Yet Russia's continued use of cyber warfare during the war in Georgia highlighted its escalatory nature and the possible negative implications on conventional military conflicts. In April 2009, as part of the Declaration on Alliance Security, NATO moved further to identify cyberattacks alongside terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as the key global threats to member states and the international community.\nBut the major breakthrough in NATO strategic thinking regarding cyber warfare, which went beyond the strictly technical aspect of network protection, occurred during mid 2010. A team of leading experts in matters of security, headed by former American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, was asked to prepare a preliminary report to be used as a basis for NATO's new Strategic Concept. According to this report, entitled NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement and submitted in May:\nThe next significant attack on the Alliance may well come down a fibre [sic] optic cable. Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern. However, the risk of a large-scale attack on NATO's command and control systems or energy grids could readily warrant consultations under Article 4 and could possibly lead to collective defence measures under Article 5. Effective cyber defence requires the means to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from attacks.111”\nStill, the recommendations reflected the defensive posture that was already advocated and implemented thus far by NATO. Furthermore, and extremely relevant to the Alliance's strategic planners, the Albright Commission was reluctant to engage the question of whether cyberattacks against NATO member states would constitute a direct act of aggression that would trigger the collective security clause. Instead, it defined a rather ambiguous principle according to which such a decision must be made considering ‘... the nature, source, scope, and other aspects of the particular security challenge'.112 The same defensive reasoning can be observed in the ensuing final version of the Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon summit six months later. In the words of the document, NATO will: “develop further our ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyberattacks, including by using the NATO planning process to enhance and coordinate national cyber-defence capabilities, bringing all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection, and better integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and response with member nations.113”\nYet again, the numerous references to cyber warfare as a security threat were extremely narrow to include at best espionage, hacking, or disruption and there was no discussion about the possibility to conduct pre-emptive or retaliatory cyber warfare.114 In fact, Stephane Abrial, commander of Allied Command Transformation (ACT) responsible for leading the Alliance's transformation of capabilities and forces, was against defining the Strategic Concept's notion of ‘in-depth cyberdefense' as a ‘military-only, or even a military-centric, strategy'. Instead, Abrial focuses on NATO's ‘permanent mission [which] involves countering the daily attempts made by hackers to break into our systems, which are by necessity interconnected, making a weakness in one country's systems a weakness in all'.115 Other key NATO officials, including General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continued to conceptualize cyber warfare in defensive terms, arguing that recent cyberattacks ‘... increased the urgency to strengthen cyber defences not only at NATO, but across the Alliance as a whole'. There is no public discourse involving NATO officials that suggests treating cyber capabilities as an offensive feature of the Alliance's cyber strategy. The most proactive proposal to date was the option to dispatch NATO's cyber Rapid Reaction Teams in order to assist member countries suffering from cyberattacks, or ‘incidents' as Rasmussen calls them, should they ask for such assistance.116\nIt appears that NATO is focused on prevention of attacks on its institutional assets and member countries rather than initiating cyberattacks against others. As the\nAmerican representative to the CCDCOE concluded, when it comes to NATO, its major contribution to cyber defence will probably involve eroding the ‘... hacker's greatest advantages -- anonymity'. NATO's strategic thinking will continue to utilize its pooled capabilities in order to promote defensive solutions to cyber warfare of various kinds and it will continue to treat it as a threat rather than as an offensive feature to be proactively utilized.\n## Conclusions\nCyber warfare has become the latest buzzword in security studies, but some analysts downplay its importance for both policymakers and military strategists, calling it a ‘distracting and nonsensical' term. Yet while other observers also treat it as a complimentary aspect of modern warfare, they nonetheless underline its unique features, as Lynn publicly did:“The cyberthreat does not involve the existential implications ushered in by the nuclear age, but there are important similarities. Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming US advantages in conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneous and exceedingly hard to trace.”\nThe article initially identified the conceptual factors that determine the offensive or defensive nature of certain military technologies. Then it adjusted these elements in order to fit the information age and its a-territorial nature. Instead of evaluating strategic orientation by traditional Offense-Defensive characteristics like mobility and firepower, the cyber Offense-Defense balance is better assessed for its technological versatility and byte power; the capacity to attack an enemy's assets on different levels (strategic, operative, and tactical), and the degree of destruction that can be inflicted on enemy assets at each of these levels.\nThe article then turned to evaluate the practical influence of cyber warfare on policy and behaviour. The American case, while perhaps being the less confrontational since there was no report of meaningful offensive American use of cyber capabilities against a foreign country or since the United States is able to avoid any direct attribution, was the most documented and comprehensive from an institutional/organizational perspective. The intellectual evolutionary process pursued by officials in the military and civil branches of government is still ongoing, and the United States is far from having a comprehensive cyber strategy. The creation of USCYBERCOM is a significant step, but it is certainly not enough since apparently there is still no highly structured and comprehensive ideational, institutional, and operational outline for American cyber warfare and cyber defence.\nThe case of China is similar in its ambiguity, but for different reasons. Unlike the United States, Beijing is rather secretive in treating its cyber posture just as it is generally reluctant to fully expose its military apparatus, causing American policymakers, military officials, and legislators to repeatedly criticize China's lack of transparency in matters related to its defence budget and the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s modernization. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that China\nnot only has a very clear vision for its cyber posture as part of the country's wider military and technological modernization process, but it is also willing to use these capabilities in order to erode American military advantage. While Beijing is allegedly more interested in cyber espionage in order to obtain secret and up-to-date information about American capabilities and critical infrastructure, it will probably not shy away from using the same technology in order to curtail certain American assets, primarily non-combative ones (electric power plants etc.) and this may indicate that future Sino-American armed conflict will be augmented with vigorous cyber warfare.123 As a recent report submitted to Congress asserted, China's history of cyber warfare and its growing integration into the country's military strategy ‘suggests that the PLA may strike with Computer Network Operations (CNOs) and Electronic Warfare (EW) weapons in the opening phases of a conflict to degrade enemy information systems rather than attempt a traditional force-on-force attack directly where the PLA is at a disadvantage against more technologically advanced countries like the US'.124\nThe Russian case seemingly presents a better opportunity to observe the influence of cyber warfare on decisions of war and peace. From the empirical record it is evident that Russia explicitly used its cyber capabilities in both the Estonian and Georgian incidents, even if Moscow also used by-proxy entities for that purpose.125 The first incident was, of course, more of a diplomatic manoeuvre in order to curb Estonia's anti-Russian attitudes as the Kremlin perceived the matter. There was classical Soviet-era use of Russian ‘political activists' in order to encourage street unrest and orchestrated anti-government protests, but there was also the use of cyber warfare in order to paralyse then Estonian banking system and other key government agencies. Thus, one should treat this episode as an experiment in utilizing cyber capabilities in order to obtain certain political means. As the case of the Georgian war illustrated, this time cyber warfare was an integral, if not a decisive, part of the policymaking process and the military activities aimed at subduing the ‘defiant' Saakashvili administration. Clearly, the conventional dimension of the conflict was predominant, mainly due to the technological profile of Georgia's critical infrastructure, but the Russian use of cyberattacks hampered Georgian domestic vital communications between different branches of the government and completely prevented any Georgian IW counterattack.126\nNATO's cyber posture reflects the Alliance's historical defensive raison d'être that was articulated during the Cold War and reaffirmed following its end. For NATO officials, cyber warfare relates primarily to attempts by foreign actors to penetrate the organization's computer and information networks in order to retrieve confidential data. They are deeply reluctant to widen their approach to define such attacks as a cause for triggering the collective security clause of the treaty. Hence when Estonia was under Russian cyberattack, the most that NATO was able to offer Tallinn was technical assistance in reactivating and protecting its ICT networks from future attacks. Furthermore, even amid the Albright Commission's call to devise and implement a comprehensive cyber strategy, the institutional response was minor and essentially focused on network protection rather than explicit cyber deterrence, let alone an offensive reorientation.\nCONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY\nThe use of cyber capabilities makes a difference for policymakers since it allows them to minimize the risks of taking certain offensive actions and it is a relatively effective low-cost alternative, as the Israeli attack on Syria suggests, and it will become more common in the future. Cyber warfare, like all other forms of combat, is a political expression nonetheless in that there is a need for a conscious decision to apply it in order to achieve certain objectives. In the cases reviewed in this article, cyber capabilities were used selectively and in different intensities, as illustrated by the American reluctance to use pre-emptive cyber warfare against Libya. Hence future research should look at the way cyber warfare is prioritized over conventional/kinetic options in order to elucidate the conditions under which policymakers will prefer the former over the latter and vice versa. Furthermore, such studies should empirically appraise how integral cyber warfare has become at the strategic, operative, and tactical levels.\nOverall, cyber warfare is becoming an accepted military expedient since it allows leaders to achieve their political objectives with much less risk in the short term, even if in the long term it may actually lead to 'non-cyber' escalation.[127] Prussian strategist and military thinker Carl von Clausewitz wrote long ago that '... a prince or a general can best demonstrate his genius by managing a campaign exactly to suit his objectives and his resources, doing neither too much nor too little'.[128] Cyber warfare allows policymakers and the military to do exactly that, and with additional adjustments realism can help to better explain the process even if there is more work to be done in pursuit of this goal.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nAn earlier version of this article was presented at the annual meeting of the Israeli Association for International Studies (IAIS), Herzliya, 25 December 2011.

This misses the larger possibilities for political/military chain reactions that cyber warfare may prompt, possibly leading to armed conflict. This article utilizes Offense-Defense theory to appraise the influence of cyber warfare on international security and the prospects for conflict. Offense-Defense theory, as applied here, better explains the relationship between technological innovation and international politics, and leads to different conclusions from other realist approaches. Redefining the Offense-Defense balance to accommodate cyberspace leads to an emphasis on the offensive advantages of cyber capabilities. The offensive and defensive cyber postures of China, Russia, the United States, and NATO are examined here to empirically assess the role of cyber warfare in security policy. Evidence shows that innovations in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) allow states to take greater risks and adopt more vigilant or offensive positions toward adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but make decisions to escalate easier and cheaper. A strategic enabler that provides attackers greater freedom of action, cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if it is not a sufficient one.\n## Introduction In September 2007, Israeli military cyber warriors reportedly hacked into the Syrian monitoring and anti-aircraft missile defences to allow Israeli fighter jets to bomb the suspected nuclear reactor near Deir el-Zor.¹ As described by one account: [T]he main attack was preceded by an engagement with a single Syrian radar site at Tall al-Abuad near the Turkish border. It was assaulted with what appears to be a combination of electronic attack and precision bombs to enable the Israeli force to enter and exit Syrian airspace. Almost immediately, the entire Syrian radar system went off the air for a period of time that included the raid.² This incident, along with others discussed here, suggests that we are in the course of a new era, similar to past transformations in international security, such as the airplane, the tank, or the nuclear bomb, innovations that culminated in radical departures in strategic thinking and behaviour. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) not only drives the internet, the iPhone, or the Global Positioning System (GPS). Nowadays, ICT has become an integral and possibly an essential military Contemporary Security Policy, Vol.34, No.1, 2013, pp.40-63 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2013.771031 © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis capability. The cyber sphere of action it created is replacing the conventional battlefield.3 Some observers argue that for realists cyber warfare is ‘old wine in a new bottle'; its added value is rather marginal.4 This downplays the broader implications of cyber warfare, stressing only technical aspects and focusing on information warfare (IW), one operative manifestation of cyber warfare, rather than the possibilities for political/military chain reaction that cyber warfare may prompt, ending in armed conflict.5 Consequently, this article is not concerned with specific cyber tactics like computer-based commercial espionage or phishing per se. Rather, this analysis stresses the integration of ICT applications aimed at disrupting, paralysing, and possibly destroying another state's assets, with a direct bearing on national security and critical infrastructure, and especially its capacity to conduct military operations.6 This article has two main objectives. First, despite the large number of studies dealing with cyber warfare, we are still lacking a realist theoretical conceptualization of its influence on international security in general and on the pervasiveness of war in particular.7 This analysis examines the relevance of realism as a technologically, rather than a territorially, based explanation for international security in the information age. Considering the fact that ‘[r]ealist theories... still provide a context and motivation for many of the most important theoretical debates in the field', as Jack Donnelly asserts, it is almost inconceivable that realism will not take a shot at explaining the dramatic technological shift in the security environment caused by cyber warfare.8 This article employs realist Offense-Defense theory to evaluate the expected effect of ICT on the prevalence of war, using the most suitable realist framework to explore the nexus between technological innovation and international politics, and especially questions of war and peace.9 In contrast to other scholars, who apply Offense-Defense theory to support cyber deterrence, this treatment stresses the need to dramatically modify Offense-Defense terminology to better address cyber warfare's unique and revolutionary features.10 Second, this article tests this Offense-Defense framework, empirically evaluating the role of cyber warfare in contemporary military strategic thinking and state behaviour. The evolving cyber postures of China, Russia, NATO, and the United States show to what extent cyber warfare concepts have gained traction among leaders, strategists, and military planners. Since we are dealing with ongoing technological developments, their policy implications far from determined, this study is more of a probe into a possible future rather than a final ruling. Nevertheless, from existing evidence it is possible to infer that ICT allows states to take greater risks and thus adopt more vigilant or offensive positions vis-à-vis their adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but their existence makes the decision to escalate armed conflict easier and considerably cheaper. ICT can be considered a strategic enabler and an efficient force multiplier that provides the attacker with greater freedom of action.\nThe article first, briefly, discusses the current status of Offense-Defense theory and suggests a fundamental conceptual amendment to allow realism to better incorporate cyber warfare into accounts of contemporary international security. It then proceeds to evaluate the cyber Offense-Defense balance to locate its strategic orientation. The cyber posture of four of the prominent actors in contemporary world affairs -- China, Russia, NATO, and the United States -- are examined in order to assess the effect of the cyber Offense-Defense balance on their security policies.\nIt is the conclusion of this article that for realism to maintain its relevance, it must transcend traditional territorial and kinetic traits of international security, or at least give more room for novel technological factors, and consider cyberspace as an alternative realm that states utilize to attack others. ICT and employment of cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if not a sufficient one, and realism must adjust its theoretical foundations and predictions accordingly. At a minimum, cyber warfare is an influential force multiplier or conflict enabler. At a maximum, it is a strategic game changer.11 But while the potential of cyber warfare to revolutionize international security and interstate conflict is dramatic, the scale of this transformation will be determined by political rather than technological considerations.\n## Cybernating Offense-Defense Theory Offense-Defense theory has generated heated debates ever since it was introduced by Robert Jervis and George Quester in the late 1970s.12 Jervis contended that the orientation of different military capabilities and weaponry systems may influence interstate security dilemmas and therefore the prevalence of war or peace. ‘When we say that the offense has the advantage, we simply mean that it is easier to destroy the other's army', he explains. ‘When the defense has the advantage, it is easier to protect and hold than it is to move forward, destroy and take.' Quester, applying the same logic, concluded that ‘likelihoods of war are thus clearly influenced by how effective the offensive weapon seems to be, as compared with the defensive'.13 Offense-Defense theory was heavily criticized for both its methodological foundation and empirical applicability.14 Thus, various attempts were made to salvage the theory and present an amended version that would bolster its standing as a leading realist theory.15 One of the most lethal criticisms had to do with the difficulty of differentiating between the offensive or defensive nature of military capabilities or technologies. In response, Charles Glaser and Chaim Kaufmann, for example, suggested that the Offense-Defense balance -- the driving engine of the theory -- should be considered as the ‘... ratio of the cost of the forces the attacker requires to take territory to the cost of the forces the defender has deployed'.16 Still, the traditional interpretation of Offense-Defense theory, as stipulated by both advocates and critics, is somewhat anachronistic and to some extent irrelevant to the information age. It presumes that war is conducted and concluded according to a kinetic basis and a territorial logic. Furthermore, the determinism of offensive and defensive capabilities, the security dilemma and armed conflict, is simplistic. It fosters a flawed ‘major war pathology' that does not necessarily exist today. One can plausibly imagine an armed conflict that is not necessarily aimed at unconditional surrender or territorial occupation, but tends to be much more limited, although it can turn into an all-out war of course, a kind of slippery slope interstate militarized dynamics.17 Second, and more importantly, since the conduct of contemporary warfare is dependent on ICT infrastructure, cyberspace becomes a contested domain in which cyberwar, or major technological conflicts, may take place or even be determined.18 As James Adams notes, ‘[a]round the world, information technology increasingly pervades weapons systems, defense infrastructures and national economies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new international battlefield'.19 Cyberwar may not solely determine the outcomes of future armed conflicts and interstate rivalries, but it can influence leaders' determination to prefer military options over political solutions. Since the early 1990s, policymakers have become deeply aware of ICT-based systems' vulnerability, their influence on states' national security posture, and the ability to conduct military operations.20 Former American Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn recently acknowledged that ICT > enables almost everything the US military does: logistical support and global command and control of forces, real-time provision of intelligence, and remote operations... The US government's digital infrastructure now gives the United States critical advantages over any adversary, but its reliance on computer networks also potentially enables adversaries to gain valuable intelligence about US capabilities and operations, to impede the United States' conventional military forces, and to disrupt the US economy.21 But is cyberspace defence or offence oriented? According to Lynn, the answer is straightforward: ‘In cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand'.22 This may be intuitively correct, and surely this position is shared by the vast majority of scholars and practitioners, but how can Offense-Defense theory provide a more founded answer to this question? This article suggests that Offense-Defense theory can effectively perform this task after updating its conceptual basis. Essentially, the balance between offence and defence is determined, in the traditional fashion, according to two key factors: mobility enhancement and firepower's degree of destructiveness.23 However, these determinants are not necessarily relevant to cyber warfare and thus must be redefined in order to address the technologically different security environment we are dealing with in the information age and the various expressions of cyber warfare.24 ### From Mobility to ‘Versatility' Unlike the customary kinetic and territorially based interpretation of the term mobility in Offense-Defense theory literature that relates to the possibility of relocating combatants at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,25 in cyberspace mobility actually relates to the capacity to technologically attack different types of ICT-based targets at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than thinking in terms of the physical allocation of armed forces across or between combat zones, in cyberwar we should talk of cyber versatility that corresponds to levels of war hierarchy.26 Strategic targets or critical infrastructures consist of vital or centre-of-gravity assets whose destruction may have a colossal effect on a state's national security and its capacity to operate normally.27 Such elements include a state's military constellations, defence industrial base, satellite communication, electrical power grid, internet connectivity, central banking system, stock market, ministries, and governmental agencies.28 On the operational level, where the focus is on related ICT-based systems, cyber warfare may foil the use of military and warning systems such as anti-aircraft missile systems, reconnaissance capabilities, or the hacking into an enemy's technological capabilities such as drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).29 On the tactical level, when the focus is on a particular and segmented ICT-based system, cyber warfare may interrupt battlefield communication and coordination, disrupt electronic signals such as radio and GPS signals, or eliminate them completely.30 ### From Firepower to ‘Byte Power' Unlike the customary territorially based interpretation of this feature in the Offense-Defense theory literature that primarily revolves around accuracy and destructiveness of certain weapons, in cyberspace firepower actually relates to the degree of technological damage that can be inflicted on the enemy's ICT-based infrastructure at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than talk of kinetic firepower, in cyber warfare the idea is to examine how much byte power a state can extract and direct towards an adversary's ICT-based targets.\nWhile the Offense-Defense theory literature typically maintains that the greater a weapon's firepower the greater its contribution to the defence,31 this assertion is challenged by prominent Offense-Defense theorists and it seems largely misguided in cyberspace. Glaser and Kaufman argue, for example, that ‘... there can be exceptions when specific firepower innovations are differentially useful against defender'.32 It seems that moving from the territorial and/or the kinetic to cyberspace allows such an exception, especially if we are dealing with highly accurate and low-signature cyber capabilities that allow the attacking and possible neutralization of an enemy's defence systems with virtual anonymity.33 Furthermore, and primarily as a complementary mechanism, selective or surgical cyberattacks may greatly improve the effectiveness of offensive conventional weapons by creating a cyber window of opportunity for conventional activities through which both combatants and equipment can penetrate more easily an otherwise unassailable target.34 To sum up this section, ICT-induced cyber capabilities tilt the Offense-Defense balance in favour of the offence, not in the prospects of gaining and maintaining control over territory and material resources as a manifestation of victory, but rather in the actual possibility to paralyse the enemy's military deployment and civilian preparedness and drastically limit its retaliatory potential. Since the use of cyber capabilities according to both indicators suggests that offence has the advantage, let us turn to evaluate the relevance of cyber warfare to the process of policymaking. For offence-dominant cyber capabilities to actually influence calculations and decisions in matters of war and peace, leaders and policymakers must be aware of these technologically advanced capabilities and acknowledge their strategic advantages. In the words of Keir Lieber, the influence of technological innovation ‘... is always filtered through the strategies that state decision makers employ in pursuit of their political goals. In simplest terms, politics -- more than technology -- is the master'.35 The aim is not, however, to meticulously describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures, i.e. the overall strategy designed to address different ICT-based challenges and threats by applying a multitude of proactive and passive measures. Rather, I present a succinct account to highlight key features and contemporary ramifications for war and peace. Given their offensive nature, the following section will try to assess whether the use of cyber capabilities actually prompted armed conflict, and under what conditions.\n## The Politics of Cyberwar and Peace Generally speaking, America, China, and Russia have long histories of attempting to combine political aims with advanced technology, while NATO primarily benefited from the American efforts. The Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), warmly adopted by the Americans in the late 1980s and successfully implemented during the Gulf War, was in fact an adaptation of the 1970s Soviet Military-Technical Revolution (MTR). As Elliot Cohen observes, the idea was to promote ‘... an imminent technical revolution that would give conventional weapons a level of effectiveness in the field comparable to that of small tactical nuclear weapons'.\nThe following accounts describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures to assess the influence of ICT-based capabilities on strategic thinking and behaviour. There is an important caveat to this analysis; cyber warfare suffers from a major problem of attributing attacks to specific state actors. Some of the cases discussed below include acts by non-state actors such as individuals, hacktivists, netizens, or more organized cyber militias and cyber gangs. Nevertheless, there is a growing consensus in the literature that these non-state actors mostly operate in tandem with national governments and follow their lead as proxies and their contribution should be considered an integral part of a state's overall cyber policy.\n### American Cyber Posture It seems that the most robust, sophisticated, and technically and institutionally up-to-date cyber posture is the American one, despite its paradoxical defensive nature. While the United States is the primary target for different forms of cyber warfare, especially cyber spying and phishing, it also possesses the highest potential to become a cyber superpower with the most vigorous state-run ICT-based posture. In the early 1990s, the Gulf War exhibited American technological superiority in terms of both hardware and software as countless stealth fighters bombarded Iraq without being detected by Iraqi anti-aircraft missile systems using state of the art precision-guided munitions (PGMs). American technological superiority was a decisive factor in defeating Iraq. As commander of US Central Command during the Gulf War, Norman Schwarzkopf argued that technological innovation worked ‘beyond our wildest expectations'.\nGiven America's growing reliance on ICT in the battlefield and in the supportive and logistical military formations, and repeated reports concerning a breach of computer networks such as in the case of the air force's Rome Air Development Center in March 1994, it became clear that this virtual Achilles heel must be protected. In 1995, the Clinton administration's national security strategy proclaimed that ‘the threat of intrusions to our military and commercial information systems poses a significant risk to national security and must be addressed'. In June 1997 the US government conducted Eligible Receiver, the very first information warfare (IW) exercise that exposed the vulnerability of American military and civilian critical infrastructures in case of a coordinated cyberattack.\nBut as American policymakers and strategists feared their vital technological structures, they also become increasingly interested in exploiting this new strategic domain in their favour. Indeed, while the Kosovo war was overwhelmingly won by conducting conventional massive air bombing against Serb targets, some observers asserted that the accuracy and efficiency of these aerial campaigns were the outcome of cyber warfare-like operations, especially in directing the bombers to their targets from the ground. Furthermore, while it is not exactly clear what additional cyber measures were used against Serb targets, it was reported that the United States and NATO conducted various sophisticated cyberattacks that included penetrations of Serbian ICT systems and overloading them with data or manipulating their databases. Hence the use of cyber capabilities at the operational level was not only disruptive in nature but also proactive and offensive in its attempt to frustrate Serbian defensive formation and retaliatory military options.\nDuring the War on Terror campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, cyber warfare did not play a significant role. In both cases, the United States had virtually no critical ICT assets to attack or disrupt and the focus was on traditional, if irregular, combat operations. Nevertheless, it was reported that a month before the Iraq War began, President Bush signed a secret directive ordering the development of an American strategy for large-scale pre-emptive cyberattacks against adversaries of the United States.\nIt was then reported that the United States was pre-emptively cutting off the Iraqi computer network and internet grid that connected civilian and government agencies before war began in March 2003. According to Richard Clarke, the Iraqi Defense Ministry's email system was hacked by the Americans in order to warn high-ranking officers about opposing the future invasion and to assure them that the objective was to overthrow Saddam Hussein and not to destroy Iraq's political, military, and socioeconomic structures. Another path that was explored but not pursued was hacking into the regime's financial institutions and foreign bank accounts in order to locate Saddam Hussein's hidden assets.\nAt about the same time, Chinese hackers apparently orchestrated a major cyberattack on American computer systems at NASA and Sandia National Laboratories. It was made clearer following these incidents and others that the United States must re-evaluate its cyber policy and possibly change its approach. Yet the discourse remained rather defensive, primarily focused on protecting American critical infrastructure and confidential databases. When George W. Bush published his administration's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003, its objective was ‘... to secure the portions of cyberspace that they own, operate, control, or with which they interact'. The military establishment, on the other hand, was much more assertive in its approach to cyber warfare, as the 2004 Military Strategy asserted: The Armed Forces must have the ability to operate across the air, land, sea, space and cyberspace domains of the battlespace... The non-linear nature of the current security environment requires multi-layered active and passive measures to counter numerous diverse conventional and asymmetric threats... They also include threats in cyberspace aimed at networks and data critical to US information-enabled systems. Such threats require a comprehensive concept of deterrence encompassing traditional adversaries, terrorist networks and rogue states able to employ any range of capabilities.52” The 2005 National Defense Strategy further proclaimed that alongside traditional and irregular security challenges the United States confronts, cyberwarfare may constitute a threat that under certain conditions “... can fundamentally alter long-established concepts of warfare. Some potential adversaries are seeking disruptive capabilities to exploit US vulnerabilities and offset the current advantages of the United States and its partners'.53 Consequently, the stated military applications of cyber capabilities were made more offensive than ever a year later when the 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations noted:“[T]he United States must have cyberspace superiority to ensure our freedom of action and deny the same to our adversaries through the integration of network defense, exploitation, and attack... Offensive capabilities in cyberspace offer the United States and our adversaries an opportunity to gain and maintain the initiative. DOD cyberspace operations are strongest when offensive and defensive capabilities are mutually supporting. This requires a long-range focus and dedicated resources to achieve this goal.54” The director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Keith Alexander, argued in 2007 that the United States should reformulate the operational and institutional foundations of its cyber posture in order to address the technologically induced security environment, since “while we have ample national level strategies, we have yet to translate these strategies into operational art through development of joint doctrine for cyberspace. Through the doctrine vetting process, we can develop a common understanding of what it means to conduct warfare within and through cyberspace.55” Indeed, in early 2008 President Bush issued a directive that allows American intelligence agencies, especially the NSA, to monitor all internet traffic of the federal government in order to protect vital assets from cyberattacks. What makes this directive a major turning point in American cyber warfare evolution is that under Bush's initiative, the NSA with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) could provide the Pentagon with evidence that a pre-emptive cyberattack is crucial in order to protect American critical infrastructure.56 In early 2009, soon after taking office, President Barack Obama announced his administration's cyber policy, which remained rather committed to the defensive notion of protecting and securing critical infrastructure in what was often referred to as cyber security.57 Yet in April it was reported that the White House was, in fact, in the final stages of establishing a new cyber agency under the Pentagon's authority which could develop offensive cyber weapons alongside defending American ICT critical infrastructure. Former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, was appointed as director of the Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and while he was rather cautious in attributing any offensive aspects to the new command, the Pentagon declared that the mission of this new agency was to:“[d]irect the operations and defence of specified Department of Defense information networks [involving some 90,000 military personnel] and prepare to, when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, [to] ensure US allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.”\nMore recently, it was reported that the Pentagon is formulating a particular strategy that will engage the threats emanating from cyber warfare under the premise that any such attack on behalf of a foreign country constitutes a declaration of war that may result in armed conflict. In effect, however, President Obama did not approve a pre-emptive cyber offensive against Libya before the United States led the military campaign against Muammar Qaddafi in March 2011. The idea was to use cyber warfare in order to hinder Libya's air defence systems, but the option was abandoned, according to some government officials, because the Obama administration feared it would act as a precedent for Russian or Chinese future offensive attacks. One Defense Department official said the cyber options ‘... were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya's air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn't pan out'. Another White House official argued that ‘[t]hese cybercapabilities are still like the Ferrari that you keep in the garage and only take out for the big race and not just for a run around town, unless nothing else can get you there'.\nIn the aftermath of the war in Libya, the White House attempted to provide the most comprehensive and inclusive cyber strategy to date. But despite the clear defensive tone of the document, especially when considering the ambiguity of the parts relating to cyber deterrence mechanisms, there was more than a hint of offensive reasoning:“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic -- as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.”\nThe debate concerning the defensive or offensive posture of American cyber strategy or its passive or proactive nature is still ongoing. Recently, General Robert Kehler, Commander of US Strategic Command that oversees CYBERCOM, commented that the optimal solution would involve both: ‘I think we are looking at what an offensive component would be: what does that look like? What kind of options would we want to be able to offer? I think that we have always said that there needs to be an offense and defense mix'. These questions remain unanswered.\n### Chinese Cyber Posture It is extremely difficult to fully account for the cyber posture of China and its development over the years. In China, defence-related transparency is a rare commodity. Yet it is widely known and established that the Chinese pursued a robust modernization in military technology and tactics from the late 1970s. Maoist ideology not only determined the political and societal structure of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its inception in 1949, it also served as China's military national defence strategy in that it revolved around the concept of ‘People's War' and the mobilization of the masses for a protracted armed conflict. After the death of Mao in 1976, and under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, a new conceptualization of Chinese warfare emerged that gradually became highly receptive to technological, industrial, and economic developments, making the entire defence apparatus much more open to engage the challenge of future armed conflict in the information age. From an operative vantage point, China gradually abandoned Mao's conception of active defence in favour of a pre-emptive military orientation that advocates a first strike mentality.\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, which strained Sino-American relations, highlighted historical anti-Western sentiments and created a shaky setting for the post-Cold War era. Consequently, by the mid 1990s China was caught paradoxically in an international constellation that was just as challenging as the Cold War international system. American intentions to redraw the global and regional landscape, and especially Washington's reactions to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, were badly received in Beijing. Consequently, the United States was increasingly considered to be a major source of danger to China's national interests and political order.\nAmerican military performance during the Gulf War highlighted the technological inferiority of the PLA and encouraged the Chinese leadership to accelerate and broaden existing plans to modernize and improve the army's capabilities for the purpose of potentially waging a limited or local war. Indeed, newly elected General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Jiang Zemin was confident that a comprehensive modernization of the Chinese armed forces amid what he considered American military superiority and interference in China's internal affairs was of great importance. Thus, he encouraged technological modernization according to American standards when he told members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in early 1993 that ‘[w]e must win high-tech, small-scale wars under modern conditions'. Similarly, the Chairman of the Commission on Science, Technology and National Defense Industry (COSTIND) General Ding Henggao warned that ‘[t]he one who possesses high-tech superiority will have the upper hand on the battlefield'.\nModernizing and increasing the professionalism of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was also matched with vigorous ICT-based innovation. As Major General Weng Pufang, former director of the Strategy Department of the Chinese Academy of Military Science, argued in a 1995 article he published in a Chinese military journal:“The thrust of China's military construction and development of weapons and equipment will no longer be toward strengthening the ‘firepower antipersonnel system' of the industrial age, but toward the strengthening of information technology, information weapons and information networking. Our sights must not be fixed on the firepower warfare of the industrial age, rather they must be trained on the information warfare of the information age.74” The PLA became highly interested in exploiting these technological innovations and restructured its ICT-based military units to comprise the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Department (GSD), currently entrusted with exploitation of foreign computer networks, whereas the Fourth Department of the GSD is responsible for attacking foreign computer networks.75 Indeed, after an agreement with Cuba was signed in February 1998, China built two cyber warfare stations, one eavesdropping telephone and internet communications in the United States and the other more concerned with monitoring American military satellite systems.76 But in addition to these military units, the Chinese government has reportedly outsourced some of its cyber warfare tasks to civilian groups that are systematically activated and thus enable greater international flexibility due to cyber warfare's attribution problem.77 In the early 2000s, Beijing was ostensibly involved in numerous successful attempts to hack into American databases and critical infrastructure such as nuclear and electric power plants, satellite systems, and a number of Department of Defense contractors that store confidential information and blueprints of future weapon systems.78 China also launched an ambitious anti-satellite weapons program aimed at levelling the odds against American espionage and to attack satellite systems that are perceived by Beijing as utterly anti-Chinese in nature.79 Hence, China's cyber posture is primarily a deterrent against American military superiority but it has deep and conscious long-term advantages that Beijing may cash in on in time of need. In fact, China's cyber posture will only benefit an offensive orientation compared with the current defensive traits of the American cyber posture if Beijing needs to prevent Washington from interfering in matters related to Taiwan, for example.80 China's 2000 Defense White Paper explicitly adhered to this transformative phase of the PLA's posture into an ICT-based modernized army:“Faced with the world's military developments and the characteristics of modern warfare, the Chinese armed forces will, in the course of modernizing their weaponry, devote themselves to transforming semi-mechanized and mechanized weapon systems to automatized and informationized systems as soon as possible, so that they can possess weapons as advanced as possible and assure the accomplishment of the sacred missions assigned to them by the nation.81” A report submitted to the American Congress in 2007 argued that China not only possesses the cyber capabilities required to conduct comprehensive offensive cyberattacks against the United States: ‘In 2005, the PLA began to incorporate offensive CYBER POSTURING AND THE OFFENSE-DEFENSE BALANCE Computer Network Operations (CNOs) into its exercises, primarily in first strikes against enemy networks'. Indeed, China's 2008 Defense White Paper proclaimed in the sections dealing with the technological dimensions of modern warfare that China is accelerating reform and innovation in its defense-related science, technology and industry... Defense-related science, technology and industry are striving to enhance the informationization of weaponry and equipment design and development, and to render product design more digitalized, modularized, standardized and reliable.[83] In sum, the Chinese consider cyber warfare and its auxiliary elements as a power multiplier, integral to their national security strategy. Thus far, China has refrained from presenting a comprehensive cyber strategy but in practice it has primarily involved strategic and tactical hacking into American and other Western countries' databases and internet systems for reasons of technological and operative military espionage. While there were numerous indications of China's involvement in penetrating critical ICT-based infrastructure in the United States, Beijing has not used its existing cyber assets thus far to directly attack American strategic military assets in order to neutralize them but instead has focused on cyber spying. This pattern may change under certain conditions, especially if Beijing wishes to diversify its policy alternatives in case of a Sino-American confrontation.[84] ## Russian Cyber Posture Whereas in the two previous cases the strategizing of ICT as military capabilities was ambiguous at best, and there was certainly no actual use of cyber warfare as part of armed conflict, the case of Russia in the first decade of the 21st century can be easily dubbed as an exemplary case for the opposite. To begin with, during most of the 1990s Russia was grappling with the devastating economic, social, and political effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign and defence policy was primarily focused on '... disarmament and limitation of the arms race - in terms of releasing as many resources as possible and creating the most favorable conditions for the implementation of our socioeconomic reforms'.[85] In December 1994, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signalled his intention to alter Russia's foreign and defence orientation when he decided to invade Chechnya, a conflict that '... demonstrated the full extent of the armed forces' decline. In virtually every respect, the Russian military failed the challenge it was supposed to easily master'.[86] By 1996, in face of failure in Chechnya and growing domestic opposition, Yeltsin moved to replace the moderate and pro-Western Kozyrev with Yevgeny Primakov who also served as Prime Minister between September 1998 and May 1999. Indicatively, in his first press conference Primakov asserted that 'Russia was and remains a great power. Her foreign policy should correspond to that status'.[87] The weaknesses of Russia's conventional and non-conventional military postures led many Russian military thinkers and officials to regard ICT-based capabilities as a way to compensate for strategic inferiority. During the mid 1990s, the Russian Army CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY and Defense Ministry began seriously examining the nexus between technology and the regular military structure.⁸⁸ Russia was openly using IW during the second Chechen war.⁸⁹ The first major indication of coordinated Russian cyber warfare (in addition to IW) took place in Estonia in 2007, after a monument commemorating the Red Army’s re-conquest of Estonia during the Second World War was moved despite the Kremlin’s explicit warning.⁹⁰ Rather than exclusively resorting to military force in order to resolve what Moscow considered explicit anti-Russian reactionary sentiments and policies, as they did during the Chechen military campaigns in 1994 and 1999 for example, this time Moscow pursued a much more sophisticated approach that included inducing political riots in Estonia and targeting Estonia’s ICT infrastructure such as the banking sector, parliament’s website and email system, emergency phone lines, hospitals, and universities.⁹¹ During a period of several weeks in May 2007, after the statue was relocated, official Estonian governmental websites and vital telecommunications infrastructure were attacked and rendered inactive, according to most accounts, by Russian perpetrators.⁹² Russian policymakers began to appreciate the role of ICT and cyber warfare as an auxiliary instrument of coercion and statecraft against what they considered uncooperative regimes in the post-Soviet rim. And the lessons learned during the Estonian affair were apparently applied as part of Russia’s involvement in the Georgian war in August 2008.⁹³ Essentially, in response to Georgia’s attack against South Ossetia, Russian forces invaded Georgia and practically subdued it within a matter of days. Yet even before the first bullet was fired, the Kremlin decided to employ a preemptive strategic disruptive cyber attack.⁹⁴ In mid July, several cyberattacks were waged against Georgian websites and two weeks later a second wave of cyberattacks on Georgian targets was detected. A few days into the war, the vast majority of Georgian government websites were not functioning; in effect, the Georgian government was, as one study asserted, ‘cyber-locked’, without viable access to the internet and to its state-run agencies including the National Bank of Georgia.⁹⁵ No less important, the Georgian government was unable to communicate with the citizens or conduct its own retaliatory IW against Russia.⁹⁶ Fortunately for Georgia, and unlike in the Estonian case, critical infrastructure such as the electrical power grid is far less modernized and consequently more difficult to damage by using ICT-based capabilities.⁹⁷ In February 2010, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev approved the new Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation where some key references to the use of cyber warfare as an instrumental offensive military capability can be clearly observed. For example, when dealing with the features of modern military conflicts, the document states that such one trait, from Russia’s perspective, is the ‘... early conduct [of] information warfare activities to achieve political objectives without the use of military force, and subsequently – in the interest of creating a favorable reaction of the international community – to use military force’. And when referring to Russian future acquisition plans for the armed forces, the doctrine highlights that a key task involves the ‘... development of the forces and means of information warfare’.⁹⁸ In early 2012 the Russian Ministry of Defense revealed the Kremlin's cyber strategy under the title Conceptual Views Regarding the Activity of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space. It refrains from referring to offensive cyber warfare, but it does address issues pertaining to control, prevention, and solution of cyber conflicts. The document acknowledges the right of Russia to employ counteroffensive cyber warfare: ‘The escalation of a conflict in the cyber-space and its turn into a crisis gives the right to an individual or collective self-defense and the use of any means necessary that do not contradict the universally accepted norms and the principles of international law'. Based on Russia's past behaviour and the recent proclamation of its cyber strategy, it appears that Moscow may be more than willing to use different forms of cyber warfare should political needs emerge.\n### NATO Cyber Posture Thus far, our empirical description has exclusively focused on state actors, but since NATO plays such a major role in the contemporary security environment it seems that examining the way it relates to cyber warfare will present a more accurate account for our purposes. Interestingly enough, despite NATO's transparency on the whole, there is very little access to the more operational and sometimes technical aspects of the Alliance's cyber strategy. Nevertheless, from the available materials we can identify NATO's defensive approach to cyber warfare and cyber security.\nOriginally, NATO was not only established to address the Soviet threat in Europe. Lord Ismay, NATO's first Secretary General, contended that its objectives were to keep ‘the Russians out, the Germans down, and the Americans in'. After the Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, NATO had to reinvent itself and identify new objectives in order to preserve its relevance and mere existence. The multiplicity of political and military goals combined with the willingness of its member states enabled NATO to successfully overcome this transitional period and undergo a process of remarkable institutional change that resulted in a renewed transatlantic mandate to develop new mechanisms and strategies in order to cope with the changing security environment.\nThe treatment of cyber warfare as part of NATO's evolving security concerns became decidedly evident in the early 2000s. Unlike the United States, China, or Russia, who were individually concerned with cyber warfare of various kinds and for different reasons as described earlier, throughout the 1990s NATO was primarily focused on its internal restructuring, the expansion eastwards to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and, of course, militarily operating in the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia.\nThe 1999 Strategic Concept declared that ‘[s]tate and non-state adversaries may try to exploit the Alliance's growing reliance on information systems through information operations designed to disrupt such systems. They may attempt to use strategies of this kind to counter NATO's superiority in traditional weaponry'. Yet the first explicit reference to cyber warfare was actually made in November 2002 during NATO's Prague summit, when it was declared that the member countries decided to ‘... strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber attacks'. One operative outcome was the establishment of NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which was charged with the task of protecting ICT infrastructure and networks from unauthorized intrusion for espionage purposes or attempts to infect them with viruses. But this was a rather technical organ lacking any long-term military planning capacity, a feature that did not change significantly even following NATO's summit in Riga in November 2006 which further called for developing cyber-deterrence capabilities and doctrines. Russian cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 explicated NATO's military, infrastructural, and political weaknesses in the face of this new form of security threat, but the response as articulated by NATO's defence ministers was remarkably protective, arguing that ‘[u]rgent work is needed to enhance the ability to protect information systems of critical importance'.\nIn early 2008 it was reported that NATO officials further debated the need to protect the Alliance's assets against future cyberattacks, claiming that ‘[c]yber defence is now mentioned at the highest level along with missile defence and energy security'. While the attacks against Estonia did not result in the application of the collective security clause of the treaty, it did trigger a prompt institutional response. In January the Policy on Cyber Defence was presented and approved. During the Bucharest summit in April, the Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA) and the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) were established. Whereas the CDMA was entrusted with overseeing NATO's cyber defence efforts and providing guidance and assistance to the member countries in case of cyber-related crises, the CCDCOE, located in Estonia, was designed ‘... to enhance the capability, cooperation and information sharing among NATO, NATO nations and partners in cyber defence by virtue of education, research and development, lessons learned and consultation'.\nBoth agencies represent a highly defensive reaction to NATO's security challenges involving cyber warfare. As the Bucharest summit declaration proclaimed, the official cyber policy ‘... emphasizes the need for NATO and nations to protect key information systems in accordance with their respective responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack'. Yet Russia's continued use of cyber warfare during the war in Georgia highlighted its escalatory nature and the possible negative implications on conventional military conflicts. In April 2009, as part of the Declaration on Alliance Security, NATO moved further to identify cyberattacks alongside terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as the key global threats to member states and the international community.\nBut the major breakthrough in NATO strategic thinking regarding cyber warfare, which went beyond the strictly technical aspect of network protection, occurred during mid 2010. A team of leading experts in matters of security, headed by former American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, was asked to prepare a preliminary report to be used as a basis for NATO's new Strategic Concept. According to this report, entitled NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement and submitted in May: The next significant attack on the Alliance may well come down a fibre [sic] optic cable. Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern. However, the risk of a large-scale attack on NATO's command and control systems or energy grids could readily warrant consultations under Article 4 and could possibly lead to collective defence measures under Article 5. Effective cyber defence requires the means to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from attacks.111” Still, the recommendations reflected the defensive posture that was already advocated and implemented thus far by NATO. Furthermore, and extremely relevant to the Alliance's strategic planners, the Albright Commission was reluctant to engage the question of whether cyberattacks against NATO member states would constitute a direct act of aggression that would trigger the collective security clause. Instead, it defined a rather ambiguous principle according to which such a decision must be made considering ‘... the nature, source, scope, and other aspects of the particular security challenge'.112 The same defensive reasoning can be observed in the ensuing final version of the Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon summit six months later. In the words of the document, NATO will: “develop further our ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyberattacks, including by using the NATO planning process to enhance and coordinate national cyber-defence capabilities, bringing all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection, and better integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and response with member nations.113” Yet again, the numerous references to cyber warfare as a security threat were extremely narrow to include at best espionage, hacking, or disruption and there was no discussion about the possibility to conduct pre-emptive or retaliatory cyber warfare.114 In fact, Stephane Abrial, commander of Allied Command Transformation (ACT) responsible for leading the Alliance's transformation of capabilities and forces, was against defining the Strategic Concept's notion of ‘in-depth cyberdefense' as a ‘military-only, or even a military-centric, strategy'. Instead, Abrial focuses on NATO's ‘permanent mission [which] involves countering the daily attempts made by hackers to break into our systems, which are by necessity interconnected, making a weakness in one country's systems a weakness in all'.115 Other key NATO officials, including General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continued to conceptualize cyber warfare in defensive terms, arguing that recent cyberattacks ‘... increased the urgency to strengthen cyber defences not only at NATO, but across the Alliance as a whole'. There is no public discourse involving NATO officials that suggests treating cyber capabilities as an offensive feature of the Alliance's cyber strategy. The most proactive proposal to date was the option to dispatch NATO's cyber Rapid Reaction Teams in order to assist member countries suffering from cyberattacks, or ‘incidents' as Rasmussen calls them, should they ask for such assistance.116 It appears that NATO is focused on prevention of attacks on its institutional assets and member countries rather than initiating cyberattacks against others. As the American representative to the CCDCOE concluded, when it comes to NATO, its major contribution to cyber defence will probably involve eroding the ‘... hacker's greatest advantages -- anonymity'. NATO's strategic thinking will continue to utilize its pooled capabilities in order to promote defensive solutions to cyber warfare of various kinds and it will continue to treat it as a threat rather than as an offensive feature to be proactively utilized.\n## Conclusions Cyber warfare has become the latest buzzword in security studies, but some analysts downplay its importance for both policymakers and military strategists, calling it a ‘distracting and nonsensical' term. Yet while other observers also treat it as a complimentary aspect of modern warfare, they nonetheless underline its unique features, as Lynn publicly did:“The cyberthreat does not involve the existential implications ushered in by the nuclear age, but there are important similarities. Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming US advantages in conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneous and exceedingly hard to trace.”\nThe article initially identified the conceptual factors that determine the offensive or defensive nature of certain military technologies. Then it adjusted these elements in order to fit the information age and its a-territorial nature. Instead of evaluating strategic orientation by traditional Offense-Defensive characteristics like mobility and firepower, the cyber Offense-Defense balance is better assessed for its technological versatility and byte power; the capacity to attack an enemy's assets on different levels (strategic, operative, and tactical), and the degree of destruction that can be inflicted on enemy assets at each of these levels.\nThe article then turned to evaluate the practical influence of cyber warfare on policy and behaviour. The American case, while perhaps being the less confrontational since there was no report of meaningful offensive American use of cyber capabilities against a foreign country or since the United States is able to avoid any direct attribution, was the most documented and comprehensive from an institutional/organizational perspective. The intellectual evolutionary process pursued by officials in the military and civil branches of government is still ongoing, and the United States is far from having a comprehensive cyber strategy. The creation of USCYBERCOM is a significant step, but it is certainly not enough since apparently there is still no highly structured and comprehensive ideational, institutional, and operational outline for American cyber warfare and cyber defence.\nThe case of China is similar in its ambiguity, but for different reasons. Unlike the United States, Beijing is rather secretive in treating its cyber posture just as it is generally reluctant to fully expose its military apparatus, causing American policymakers, military officials, and legislators to repeatedly criticize China's lack of transparency in matters related to its defence budget and the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s modernization. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that China not only has a very clear vision for its cyber posture as part of the country's wider military and technological modernization process, but it is also willing to use these capabilities in order to erode American military advantage. While Beijing is allegedly more interested in cyber espionage in order to obtain secret and up-to-date information about American capabilities and critical infrastructure, it will probably not shy away from using the same technology in order to curtail certain American assets, primarily non-combative ones (electric power plants etc.) and this may indicate that future Sino-American armed conflict will be augmented with vigorous cyber warfare.123 As a recent report submitted to Congress asserted, China's history of cyber warfare and its growing integration into the country's military strategy ‘suggests that the PLA may strike with Computer Network Operations (CNOs) and Electronic Warfare (EW) weapons in the opening phases of a conflict to degrade enemy information systems rather than attempt a traditional force-on-force attack directly where the PLA is at a disadvantage against more technologically advanced countries like the US'.124 The Russian case seemingly presents a better opportunity to observe the influence of cyber warfare on decisions of war and peace. From the empirical record it is evident that Russia explicitly used its cyber capabilities in both the Estonian and Georgian incidents, even if Moscow also used by-proxy entities for that purpose.125 The first incident was, of course, more of a diplomatic manoeuvre in order to curb Estonia's anti-Russian attitudes as the Kremlin perceived the matter. There was classical Soviet-era use of Russian ‘political activists' in order to encourage street unrest and orchestrated anti-government protests, but there was also the use of cyber warfare in order to paralyse then Estonian banking system and other key government agencies. Thus, one should treat this episode as an experiment in utilizing cyber capabilities in order to obtain certain political means. As the case of the Georgian war illustrated, this time cyber warfare was an integral, if not a decisive, part of the policymaking process and the military activities aimed at subduing the ‘defiant' Saakashvili administration. Clearly, the conventional dimension of the conflict was predominant, mainly due to the technological profile of Georgia's critical infrastructure, but the Russian use of cyberattacks hampered Georgian domestic vital communications between different branches of the government and completely prevented any Georgian IW counterattack.126 NATO's cyber posture reflects the Alliance's historical defensive raison d'être that was articulated during the Cold War and reaffirmed following its end. For NATO officials, cyber warfare relates primarily to attempts by foreign actors to penetrate the organization's computer and information networks in order to retrieve confidential data. They are deeply reluctant to widen their approach to define such attacks as a cause for triggering the collective security clause of the treaty. Hence when Estonia was under Russian cyberattack, the most that NATO was able to offer Tallinn was technical assistance in reactivating and protecting its ICT networks from future attacks. Furthermore, even amid the Albright Commission's call to devise and implement a comprehensive cyber strategy, the institutional response was minor and essentially focused on network protection rather than explicit cyber deterrence, let alone an offensive reorientation.\nCONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY The use of cyber capabilities makes a difference for policymakers since it allows them to minimize the risks of taking certain offensive actions and it is a relatively effective low-cost alternative, as the Israeli attack on Syria suggests, and it will become more common in the future. Cyber warfare, like all other forms of combat, is a political expression nonetheless in that there is a need for a conscious decision to apply it in order to achieve certain objectives. In the cases reviewed in this article, cyber capabilities were used selectively and in different intensities, as illustrated by the American reluctance to use pre-emptive cyber warfare against Libya. Hence future research should look at the way cyber warfare is prioritized over conventional/kinetic options in order to elucidate the conditions under which policymakers will prefer the former over the latter and vice versa. Furthermore, such studies should empirically appraise how integral cyber warfare has become at the strategic, operative, and tactical levels.\nOverall, cyber warfare is becoming an accepted military expedient since it allows leaders to achieve their political objectives with much less risk in the short term, even if in the long term it may actually lead to 'non-cyber' escalation.[127] Prussian strategist and military thinker Carl von Clausewitz wrote long ago that '... a prince or a general can best demonstrate his genius by managing a campaign exactly to suit his objectives and his resources, doing neither too much nor too little'.[128] Cyber warfare allows policymakers and the military to do exactly that, and with additional adjustments realism can help to better explain the process even if there is more work to be done in pursuit of this goal.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS An earlier version of this article was presented at the annual meeting of the Israeli Association for International Studies (IAIS), Herzliya, 25 December 2011.

      "## Introduction In September 2007, Israeli military cyber warriors reportedly hacked into the Syrian monitoring and anti-aircraft missile defences to allow Israeli fighter jets to bomb the suspected nuclear reactor near Deir el-Zor.¹ As described by one account: [T]he main attack was preceded by an engagement with a single Syrian radar site at Tall al-Abuad near the Turkish border. It was assaulted with what appears to be a combination of electronic attack and precision bombs to enable the Israeli force to enter and exit Syrian airspace. Almost immediately, the entire Syrian radar system went off the air for a period of time that included the raid.² This incident, along with others discussed here, suggests that we are in the course of a new era, similar to past transformations in international security, such as the airplane, the tank, or the nuclear bomb, innovations that culminated in radical departures in strategic thinking and behaviour. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) not only drives the internet, the iPhone, or the Global Positioning System (GPS). Nowadays, ICT has become an integral and possibly an essential military Contemporary Security Policy, Vol.34, No.1, 2013, pp.40-63 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2013.771031 © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis capability. The cyber sphere of action it created is replacing the conventional battlefield.3 Some observers argue that for realists cyber warfare is ‘old wine in a new bottle'; its added value is rather marginal.4 This downplays the broader implications of cyber warfare, stressing only technical aspects and focusing on information warfare (IW), one operative manifestation of cyber warfare, rather than the possibilities for political/military chain reaction that cyber warfare may prompt, ending in armed conflict.5 Consequently, this article is not concerned with specific cyber tactics like computer-based commercial espionage or phishing per se. Rather, this analysis stresses the integration of ICT applications aimed at disrupting, paralysing, and possibly destroying another state's assets, with a direct bearing on national security and critical infrastructure, and especially its capacity to conduct military operations.6 This article has two main objectives. First, despite the large number of studies dealing with cyber warfare, we are still lacking a realist theoretical conceptualization of its influence on international security in general and on the pervasiveness of war in particular.7 This analysis examines the relevance of realism as a technologically, rather than a territorially, based explanation for international security in the information age. Considering the fact that ‘[r]ealist theories... still provide a context and motivation for many of the most important theoretical debates in the field', as Jack Donnelly asserts, it is almost inconceivable that realism will not take a shot at explaining the dramatic technological shift in the security environment caused by cyber warfare.8 This article employs realist Offense-Defense theory to evaluate the expected effect of ICT on the prevalence of war, using the most suitable realist framework to explore the nexus between technological innovation and international politics, and especially questions of war and peace.9 In contrast to other scholars, who apply Offense-Defense theory to support cyber deterrence, this treatment stresses the need to dramatically modify Offense-Defense terminology to better address cyber warfare's unique and revolutionary features.10 Second, this article tests this Offense-Defense framework, empirically evaluating the role of cyber warfare in contemporary military strategic thinking and state behaviour. The evolving cyber postures of China, Russia, NATO, and the United States show to what extent cyber warfare concepts have gained traction among leaders, strategists, and military planners. Since we are dealing with ongoing technological developments, their policy implications far from determined, this study is more of a probe into a possible future rather than a final ruling. Nevertheless, from existing evidence it is possible to infer that ICT allows states to take greater risks and thus adopt more vigilant or offensive positions vis-à-vis their adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but their existence makes the decision to escalate armed conflict easier and considerably cheaper. ICT can be considered a strategic enabler and an efficient force multiplier that provides the attacker with greater freedom of action."

      "## Cybernating Offense-Defense Theory Offense-Defense theory has generated heated debates ever since it was introduced by Robert Jervis and George Quester in the late 1970s.12 Jervis contended that the orientation of different military capabilities and weaponry systems may influence interstate security dilemmas and therefore the prevalence of war or peace. ‘When we say that the offense has the advantage, we simply mean that it is easier to destroy the other's army', he explains. ‘When the defense has the advantage, it is easier to protect and hold than it is to move forward, destroy and take.' Quester, applying the same logic, concluded that ‘likelihoods of war are thus clearly influenced by how effective the offensive weapon seems to be, as compared with the defensive'.13 Offense-Defense theory was heavily criticized for both its methodological foundation and empirical applicability.14 Thus, various attempts were made to salvage the theory and present an amended version that would bolster its standing as a leading realist theory.15 One of the most lethal criticisms had to do with the difficulty of differentiating between the offensive or defensive nature of military capabilities or technologies. In response, Charles Glaser and Chaim Kaufmann, for example, suggested that the Offense-Defense balance -- the driving engine of the theory -- should be considered as the ‘... ratio of the cost of the forces the attacker requires to take territory to the cost of the forces the defender has deployed'.16 Still, the traditional interpretation of Offense-Defense theory, as stipulated by both advocates and critics, is somewhat anachronistic and to some extent irrelevant to the information age. It presumes that war is conducted and concluded according to a kinetic basis and a territorial logic. Furthermore, the determinism of offensive and defensive capabilities, the security dilemma and armed conflict, is simplistic. It fosters a flawed ‘major war pathology' that does not necessarily exist today. One can plausibly imagine an armed conflict that is not necessarily aimed at unconditional surrender or territorial occupation, but tends to be much more limited, although it can turn into an all-out war of course, a kind of slippery slope interstate militarized dynamics.17 Second, and more importantly, since the conduct of contemporary warfare is dependent on ICT infrastructure, cyberspace becomes a contested domain in which cyberwar, or major technological conflicts, may take place or even be determined.18 As James Adams notes, ‘[a]round the world, information technology increasingly pervades weapons systems, defense infrastructures and national economies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new international battlefield'.19 Cyberwar may not solely determine the outcomes of future armed conflicts and interstate rivalries, but it can influence leaders' determination to prefer military options over political solutions. Since the early 1990s, policymakers have become deeply aware of ICT-based systems' vulnerability, their influence on states' national security posture, and the ability to conduct military operations.20 Former American Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn recently acknowledged that ICT > enables almost everything the US military does: logistical support and global command and control of forces, real-time provision of intelligence, and remote operations... The US government's digital infrastructure now gives the United States critical advantages over any adversary, but its reliance on computer networks also potentially enables adversaries to gain valuable intelligence about US capabilities and operations, to impede the United States' conventional military forces, and to disrupt the US economy.21 But is cyberspace defence or offence oriented? According to Lynn, the answer is straightforward: ‘In cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand'.22 This may be intuitively correct, and surely this position is shared by the vast majority of scholars and practitioners, but how can Offense-Defense theory provide a more founded answer to this question? This article suggests that Offense-Defense theory can effectively perform this task after updating its conceptual basis. Essentially, the balance between offence and defence is determined, in the traditional fashion, according to two key factors: mobility enhancement and firepower's degree of destructiveness.23 However, these determinants are not necessarily relevant to cyber warfare and thus must be redefined in order to address the technologically different security environment we are dealing with in the information age and the various expressions of cyber warfare.24 ### From Mobility to ‘Versatility' Unlike the customary kinetic and territorially based interpretation of the term mobility in Offense-Defense theory literature that relates to the possibility of relocating combatants at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,25 in cyberspace mobility actually relates to the capacity to technologically attack different types of ICT-based targets at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than thinking in terms of the physical allocation of armed forces across or between combat zones, in cyberwar we should talk of cyber versatility that corresponds to levels of war hierarchy.26 Strategic targets or critical infrastructures consist of vital or centre-of-gravity assets whose destruction may have a colossal effect on a state's national security and its capacity to operate normally.27 Such elements include a state's military constellations, defence industrial base, satellite communication, electrical power grid, internet connectivity, central banking system, stock market, ministries, and governmental agencies.28 On the operational level, where the focus is on related ICT-based systems, cyber warfare may foil the use of military and warning systems such as anti-aircraft missile systems, reconnaissance capabilities, or the hacking into an enemy's technological capabilities such as drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).29 On the tactical level, when the focus is on a particular and segmented ICT-based system, cyber warfare may interrupt battlefield communication and coordination, disrupt electronic signals such as radio and GPS signals, or eliminate them completely.30 ### From Firepower to ‘Byte Power' Unlike the customary territorially based interpretation of this feature in the Offense-Defense theory literature that primarily revolves around accuracy and destructiveness of certain weapons, in cyberspace firepower actually relates to the degree of technological damage that can be inflicted on the enemy's ICT-based infrastructure at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than talk of kinetic firepower, in cyber warfare the idea is to examine how much byte power a state can extract and direct towards an adversary's ICT-based targets."

      "## Conclusions Cyber warfare has become the latest buzzword in security studies, but some analysts downplay its importance for both policymakers and military strategists, calling it a ‘distracting and nonsensical' term. Yet while other observers also treat it as a complimentary aspect of modern warfare, they nonetheless underline its unique features, as Lynn publicly did:“The cyberthreat does not involve the existential implications ushered in by the nuclear age, but there are important similarities. Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming US advantages in conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneous and exceedingly hard to trace.”"

This misses the larger possibilities for political/military chain reactions that cyber warfare may prompt, possibly leading to armed conflict. This article utilizes Offense-Defense theory to appraise the influence of cyber warfare on international security and the prospects for conflict. Offense-Defense theory, as applied here, better explains the relationship between technological innovation and international politics, and leads to different conclusions from other realist approaches. Redefining the Offense-Defense balance to accommodate cyberspace leads to an emphasis on the offensive advantages of cyber capabilities. The offensive and defensive cyber postures of China, Russia, the United States, and NATO are examined here to empirically assess the role of cyber warfare in security policy. Evidence shows that innovations in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) allow states to take greater risks and adopt more vigilant or offensive positions toward adversaries.

It then proceeds to evaluate the cyber Offense-Defense balance to locate its strategic orientation. The cyber posture of four of the prominent actors in contemporary world affairs -- China, Russia, NATO, and the United States -- are examined in order to assess the effect of the cyber Offense-Defense balance on their security policies.\nIt is the conclusion of this article that for realism to maintain its relevance, it must transcend traditional territorial and kinetic traits of international security, or at least give more room for novel technological factors, and consider cyberspace as an alternative realm that states utilize to attack others. ICT and employment of cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if not a sufficient one, and realism must adjust its theoretical foundations and predictions accordingly. At a minimum, cyber warfare is an influential force multiplier or conflict enabler. At a maximum, it is a strategic game changer.11 But while the potential of cyber warfare to revolutionize international security and interstate conflict is dramatic, the scale of this transformation will be determined by political rather than technological considerations.",

Rather than talk of kinetic firepower, in cyber warfare the idea is to examine how much byte power a state can extract and direct towards an adversary's ICT-based targets.": "While the Offense-Defense theory literature typically maintains that the greater a weapon's firepower the greater its contribution to the defence,31 this assertion is challenged by prominent Offense-Defense theorists and it seems largely misguided in cyberspace. Glaser and Kaufman argue, for example, that ‘... there can be exceptions when specific firepower innovations are differentially useful against defender'.32 It seems that moving from the territorial and/or the kinetic to cyberspace allows such an exception, especially if we are dealing with highly accurate and low-signature cyber capabilities that allow the attacking and possible neutralization of an enemy's defence systems with virtual anonymity.33 Furthermore, and primarily as a complementary mechanism, selective or surgical cyberattacks may greatly improve the effectiveness of offensive conventional weapons by creating a cyber window of opportunity for conventional activities through which both combatants and equipment can penetrate more easily an otherwise unassailable target.34 To sum up this section, ICT-induced cyber capabilities tilt the Offense-Defense balance in favour of the offence, not in the prospects of gaining and maintaining control over territory and material resources as a manifestation of victory, but rather in the actual possibility to paralyse the enemy's military deployment and civilian preparedness and drastically limit its retaliatory potential. Since the use of cyber capabilities according to both indicators suggests that offence has the advantage, let us turn to evaluate the relevance of cyber warfare to the process of policymaking. For offence-dominant cyber capabilities to actually influence calculations and decisions in matters of war and peace, leaders and policymakers must be aware of these technologically advanced capabilities and acknowledge their strategic advantages. In the words of Keir Lieber, the influence of technological innovation ‘... is always filtered through the strategies that state decision makers employ in pursuit of their political goals. In simplest terms, politics -- more than technology -- is the master'.35 The aim is not, however, to meticulously describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures, i.e. the overall strategy designed to address different ICT-based challenges and threats by applying a multitude of proactive and passive measures. Rather, I present a succinct account to highlight key features and contemporary ramifications for war and peace. Given their offensive nature, the following section will try to assess whether the use of cyber capabilities actually prompted armed conflict, and under what conditions.",
    "## The Politics of Cyberwar and Peace Generally speaking, America, China, and Russia have long histories of attempting to combine political aims with advanced technology, while NATO primarily benefited from the American efforts. The Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), warmly adopted by the Americans in the late 1980s and successfully implemented during the Gulf War, was in fact an adaptation of the 1970s Soviet Military-Technical Revolution (MTR). As Elliot Cohen observes, the idea was to promote ‘... an imminent technical revolution that would give conventional weapons a level of effectiveness in the field comparable to that of small tactical nuclear weapons'.": "The following accounts describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures to assess the influence of ICT-based capabilities on strategic thinking and behaviour. There is an important caveat to this analysis; cyber warfare suffers from a major problem of attributing attacks to specific state actors. Some of the cases discussed below include acts by non-state actors such as individuals, hacktivists, netizens, or more organized cyber militias and cyber gangs. Nevertheless, there is a growing consensus in the literature that these non-state actors mostly operate in tandem with national governments and follow their lead as proxies and their contribution should be considered an integral part of a state's overall cyber policy.\n### American Cyber Posture It seems that the most robust, sophisticated, and technically and institutionally up-to-date cyber posture is the American one, despite its paradoxical defensive nature. While the United States is the primary target for different forms of cyber warfare, especially cyber spying and phishing, it also possesses the highest potential to become a cyber superpower with the most vigorous state-run ICT-based posture. In the early 1990s, the Gulf War exhibited American technological superiority in terms of both hardware and software as countless stealth fighters bombarded Iraq without being detected by Iraqi anti-aircraft missile systems using state of the art precision-guided munitions (PGMs). American technological superiority was a decisive factor in defeating Iraq. As commander of US Central Command during the Gulf War, Norman Schwarzkopf argued that technological innovation worked ‘beyond our wildest expectations'.\nGiven America's growing reliance on ICT in the battlefield and in the supportive and logistical military formations, and repeated reports concerning a breach of computer networks such as in the case of the air force's Rome Air Development Center in March 1994, it became clear that this virtual Achilles heel must be protected. In 1995, the Clinton administration's national security strategy proclaimed that ‘the threat of intrusions to our military and commercial information systems poses a significant risk to national security and must be addressed'. In June 1997 the US government conducted Eligible Receiver, the very first information warfare (IW) exercise that exposed the vulnerability of American military and civilian critical infrastructures in case of a coordinated cyberattack.\nBut as American policymakers and strategists feared their vital technological structures, they also become increasingly interested in exploiting this new strategic domain in their favour. Indeed, while the Kosovo war was overwhelmingly won by conducting conventional massive air bombing against Serb targets, some observers asserted that the accuracy and efficiency of these aerial campaigns were the outcome of cyber warfare-like operations, especially in directing the bombers to their targets from the ground. Furthermore, while it is not exactly clear what additional cyber measures were used against Serb targets, it was reported that the United States and NATO conducted various sophisticated cyberattacks that included penetrations of Serbian ICT systems and overloading them with data or manipulating their databases. Hence the use of cyber capabilities at the operational level was not only disruptive in nature but also proactive and offensive in its attempt to frustrate Serbian defensive formation and retaliatory military options.\nDuring the War on Terror campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, cyber warfare did not play a significant role. In both cases, the United States had virtually no critical ICT assets to attack or disrupt and the focus was on traditional, if irregular, combat operations. Nevertheless, it was reported that a month before the Iraq War began, President Bush signed a secret directive ordering the development of an American strategy for large-scale pre-emptive cyberattacks against adversaries of the United States.\nIt was then reported that the United States was pre-emptively cutting off the Iraqi computer network and internet grid that connected civilian and government agencies before war began in March 2003. According to Richard Clarke, the Iraqi Defense Ministry's email system was hacked by the Americans in order to warn high-ranking officers about opposing the future invasion and to assure them that the objective was to overthrow Saddam Hussein and not to destroy Iraq's political, military, and socioeconomic structures. Another path that was explored but not pursued was hacking into the regime's financial institutions and foreign bank accounts in order to locate Saddam Hussein's hidden assets.\nAt about the same time, Chinese hackers apparently orchestrated a major cyberattack on American computer systems at NASA and Sandia National Laboratories. It was made clearer following these incidents and others that the United States must re-evaluate its cyber policy and possibly change its approach. Yet the discourse remained rather defensive, primarily focused on protecting American critical infrastructure and confidential databases. When George W. Bush published his administration's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003, its objective was ‘... to secure the portions of cyberspace that they own, operate, control, or with which they interact'. The military establishment, on the other hand, was much more assertive in its approach to cyber warfare, as the 2004 Military Strategy asserted: The Armed Forces must have the ability to operate across the air, land, sea, space and cyberspace domains of the battlespace... The non-linear nature of the current security environment requires multi-layered active and passive measures to counter numerous diverse conventional and asymmetric threats... They also include threats in cyberspace aimed at networks and data critical to US information-enabled systems. Such threats require a comprehensive concept of deterrence encompassing traditional adversaries, terrorist networks and rogue states able to employ any range of capabilities.52” The 2005 National Defense Strategy further proclaimed that alongside traditional and irregular security challenges the United States confronts, cyberwarfare may constitute a threat that under certain conditions “... can fundamentally alter long-established concepts of warfare. Some potential adversaries are seeking disruptive capabilities to exploit US vulnerabilities and offset the current advantages of the United States and its partners'.53 Consequently, the stated military applications of cyber capabilities were made more offensive than ever a year later when the 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations noted:“[T]he United States must have cyberspace superiority to ensure our freedom of action and deny the same to our adversaries through the integration of network defense, exploitation, and attack... Offensive capabilities in cyberspace offer the United States and our adversaries an opportunity to gain and maintain the initiative. DOD cyberspace operations are strongest when offensive and defensive capabilities are mutually supporting. This requires a long-range focus and dedicated resources to achieve this goal.54” The director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Keith Alexander, argued in 2007 that the United States should reformulate the operational and institutional foundations of its cyber posture in order to address the technologically induced security environment, since “while we have ample national level strategies, we have yet to translate these strategies into operational art through development of joint doctrine for cyberspace. Through the doctrine vetting process, we can develop a common understanding of what it means to conduct warfare within and through cyberspace.55” Indeed, in early 2008 President Bush issued a directive that allows American intelligence agencies, especially the NSA, to monitor all internet traffic of the federal government in order to protect vital assets from cyberattacks. What makes this directive a major turning point in American cyber warfare evolution is that under Bush's initiative, the NSA with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) could provide the Pentagon with evidence that a pre-emptive cyberattack is crucial in order to protect American critical infrastructure.56 In early 2009, soon after taking office, President Barack Obama announced his administration's cyber policy, which remained rather committed to the defensive notion of protecting and securing critical infrastructure in what was often referred to as cyber security.57 Yet in April it was reported that the White House was, in fact, in the final stages of establishing a new cyber agency under the Pentagon's authority which could develop offensive cyber weapons alongside defending American ICT critical infrastructure. Former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, was appointed as director of the Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and while he was rather cautious in attributing any offensive aspects to the new command, the Pentagon declared that the mission of this new agency was to:“[d]irect the operations and defence of specified Department of Defense information networks [involving some 90,000 military personnel] and prepare to, when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, [to] ensure US allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.”\nMore recently, it was reported that the Pentagon is formulating a particular strategy that will engage the threats emanating from cyber warfare under the premise that any such attack on behalf of a foreign country constitutes a declaration of war that may result in armed conflict. In effect, however, President Obama did not approve a pre-emptive cyber offensive against Libya before the United States led the military campaign against Muammar Qaddafi in March 2011. The idea was to use cyber warfare in order to hinder Libya's air defence systems, but the option was abandoned, according to some government officials, because the Obama administration feared it would act as a precedent for Russian or Chinese future offensive attacks. One Defense Department official said the cyber options ‘... were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya's air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn't pan out'. Another White House official argued that ‘[t]hese cybercapabilities are still like the Ferrari that you keep in the garage and only take out for the big race and not just for a run around town, unless nothing else can get you there'.\nIn the aftermath of the war in Libya, the White House attempted to provide the most comprehensive and inclusive cyber strategy to date. But despite the clear defensive tone of the document, especially when considering the ambiguity of the parts relating to cyber deterrence mechanisms, there was more than a hint of offensive reasoning:“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic -- as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.”\nThe debate concerning the defensive or offensive posture of American cyber strategy or its passive or proactive nature is still ongoing. Recently, General Robert Kehler, Commander of US Strategic Command that oversees CYBERCOM, commented that the optimal solution would involve both: ‘I think we are looking at what an offensive component would be: what does that look like? What kind of options would we want to be able to offer? I think that we have always said that there needs to be an offense and defense mix'. These questions remain unanswered.\n### Chinese Cyber Posture It is extremely difficult to fully account for the cyber posture of China and its development over the years. In China, defence-related transparency is a rare commodity. Yet it is widely known and established that the Chinese pursued a robust modernization in military technology and tactics from the late 1970s. Maoist ideology not only determined the political and societal structure of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its inception in 1949, it also served as China's military national defence strategy in that it revolved around the concept of ‘People's War' and the mobilization of the masses for a protracted armed conflict. After the death of Mao in 1976, and under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, a new conceptualization of Chinese warfare emerged that gradually became highly receptive to technological, industrial, and economic developments, making the entire defence apparatus much more open to engage the challenge of future armed conflict in the information age. From an operative vantage point, China gradually abandoned Mao's conception of active defence in favour of a pre-emptive military orientation that advocates a first strike mentality.\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, which strained Sino-American relations, highlighted historical anti-Western sentiments and created a shaky setting for the post-Cold War era. Consequently, by the mid 1990s China was caught paradoxically in an international constellation that was just as challenging as the Cold War international system. American intentions to redraw the global and regional landscape, and especially Washington's reactions to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, were badly received in Beijing. Consequently, the United States was increasingly considered to be a major source of danger to China's national interests and political order.\nAmerican military performance during the Gulf War highlighted the technological inferiority of the PLA and encouraged the Chinese leadership to accelerate and broaden existing plans to modernize and improve the army's capabilities for the purpose of potentially waging a limited or local war. Indeed, newly elected General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Jiang Zemin was confident that a comprehensive modernization of the Chinese armed forces amid what he considered American military superiority and interference in China's internal affairs was of great importance. Thus, he encouraged technological modernization according to American standards when he told members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in early 1993 that ‘[w]e must win high-tech, small-scale wars under modern conditions'. Similarly, the Chairman of the Commission on Science, Technology and National Defense Industry (COSTIND) General Ding Henggao warned that ‘[t]he one who possesses high-tech superiority will have the upper hand on the battlefield'.\nModernizing and increasing the professionalism of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was also matched with vigorous ICT-based innovation. As Major General Weng Pufang, former director of the Strategy Department of the Chinese Academy of Military Science, argued in a 1995 article he published in a Chinese military journal:“The thrust of China's military construction and development of weapons and equipment will no longer be toward strengthening the ‘firepower antipersonnel system' of the industrial age, but toward the strengthening of information technology, information weapons and information networking. Our sights must not be fixed on the firepower warfare of the industrial age, rather they must be trained on the information warfare of the information age.74” The PLA became highly interested in exploiting these technological innovations and restructured its ICT-based military units to comprise the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Department (GSD), currently entrusted with exploitation of foreign computer networks, whereas the Fourth Department of the GSD is responsible for attacking foreign computer networks.75 Indeed, after an agreement with Cuba was signed in February 1998, China built two cyber warfare stations, one eavesdropping telephone and internet communications in the United States and the other more concerned with monitoring American military satellite systems.76 But in addition to these military units, the Chinese government has reportedly outsourced some of its cyber warfare tasks to civilian groups that are systematically activated and thus enable greater international flexibility due to cyber warfare's attribution problem.77 In the early 2000s, Beijing was ostensibly involved in numerous successful attempts to hack into American databases and critical infrastructure such as nuclear and electric power plants, satellite systems, and a number of Department of Defense contractors that store confidential information and blueprints of future weapon systems.78 China also launched an ambitious anti-satellite weapons program aimed at levelling the odds against American espionage and to attack satellite systems that are perceived by Beijing as utterly anti-Chinese in nature.79 Hence, China's cyber posture is primarily a deterrent against American military superiority but it has deep and conscious long-term advantages that Beijing may cash in on in time of need. In fact, China's cyber posture will only benefit an offensive orientation compared with the current defensive traits of the American cyber posture if Beijing needs to prevent Washington from interfering in matters related to Taiwan, for example.80 China's 2000 Defense White Paper explicitly adhered to this transformative phase of the PLA's posture into an ICT-based modernized army:“Faced with the world's military developments and the characteristics of modern warfare, the Chinese armed forces will, in the course of modernizing their weaponry, devote themselves to transforming semi-mechanized and mechanized weapon systems to automatized and informationized systems as soon as possible, so that they can possess weapons as advanced as possible and assure the accomplishment of the sacred missions assigned to them by the nation.81” A report submitted to the American Congress in 2007 argued that China not only possesses the cyber capabilities required to conduct comprehensive offensive cyberattacks against the United States: ‘In 2005, the PLA began to incorporate offensive CYBER POSTURING AND THE OFFENSE-DEFENSE BALANCE Computer Network Operations (CNOs) into its exercises, primarily in first strikes against enemy networks'. Indeed, China's 2008 Defense White Paper proclaimed in the sections dealing with the technological dimensions of modern warfare that China is accelerating reform and innovation in its defense-related science, technology and industry... Defense-related science, technology and industry are striving to enhance the informationization of weaponry and equipment design and development, and to render product design more digitalized, modularized, standardized and reliable.[83] In sum, the Chinese consider cyber warfare and its auxiliary elements as a power multiplier, integral to their national security strategy. Thus far, China has refrained from presenting a comprehensive cyber strategy but in practice it has primarily involved strategic and tactical hacking into American and other Western countries' databases and internet systems for reasons of technological and operative military espionage. While there were numerous indications of China's involvement in penetrating critical ICT-based infrastructure in the United States, Beijing has not used its existing cyber assets thus far to directly attack American strategic military assets in order to neutralize them but instead has focused on cyber spying. This pattern may change under certain conditions, especially if Beijing wishes to diversify its policy alternatives in case of a Sino-American confrontation.[84] ## Russian Cyber Posture Whereas in the two previous cases the strategizing of ICT as military capabilities was ambiguous at best, and there was certainly no actual use of cyber warfare as part of armed conflict, the case of Russia in the first decade of the 21st century can be easily dubbed as an exemplary case for the opposite. To begin with, during most of the 1990s Russia was grappling with the devastating economic, social, and political effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign and defence policy was primarily focused on '... disarmament and limitation of the arms race - in terms of releasing as many resources as possible and creating the most favorable conditions for the implementation of our socioeconomic reforms'.[85] In December 1994, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signalled his intention to alter Russia's foreign and defence orientation when he decided to invade Chechnya, a conflict that '... demonstrated the full extent of the armed forces' decline. In virtually every respect, the Russian military failed the challenge it was supposed to easily master'.[86] By 1996, in face of failure in Chechnya and growing domestic opposition, Yeltsin moved to replace the moderate and pro-Western Kozyrev with Yevgeny Primakov who also served as Prime Minister between September 1998 and May 1999. Indicatively, in his first press conference Primakov asserted that 'Russia was and remains a great power. Her foreign policy should correspond to that status'.[87] The weaknesses of Russia's conventional and non-conventional military postures led many Russian military thinkers and officials to regard ICT-based capabilities as a way to compensate for strategic inferiority. During the mid 1990s, the Russian Army CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY and Defense Ministry began seriously examining the nexus between technology and the regular military structure.⁸⁸ Russia was openly using IW during the second Chechen war.⁸⁹ The first major indication of coordinated Russian cyber warfare (in addition to IW) took place in Estonia in 2007, after a monument commemorating the Red Army’s re-conquest of Estonia during the Second World War was moved despite the Kremlin’s explicit warning.⁹⁰ Rather than exclusively resorting to military force in order to resolve what Moscow considered explicit anti-Russian reactionary sentiments and policies, as they did during the Chechen military campaigns in 1994 and 1999 for example, this time Moscow pursued a much more sophisticated approach that included inducing political riots in Estonia and targeting Estonia’s ICT infrastructure such as the banking sector, parliament’s website and email system, emergency phone lines, hospitals, and universities.⁹¹ During a period of several weeks in May 2007, after the statue was relocated, official Estonian governmental websites and vital telecommunications infrastructure were attacked and rendered inactive, according to most accounts, by Russian perpetrators.⁹² Russian policymakers began to appreciate the role of ICT and cyber warfare as an auxiliary instrument of coercion and statecraft against what they considered uncooperative regimes in the post-Soviet rim. And the lessons learned during the Estonian affair were apparently applied as part of Russia’s involvement in the Georgian war in August 2008.⁹³ Essentially, in response to Georgia’s attack against South Ossetia, Russian forces invaded Georgia and practically subdued it within a matter of days. Yet even before the first bullet was fired, the Kremlin decided to employ a preemptive strategic disruptive cyber attack.⁹⁴ In mid July, several cyberattacks were waged against Georgian websites and two weeks later a second wave of cyberattacks on Georgian targets was detected. A few days into the war, the vast majority of Georgian government websites were not functioning; in effect, the Georgian government was, as one study asserted, ‘cyber-locked’, without viable access to the internet and to its state-run agencies including the National Bank of Georgia.⁹⁵ No less important, the Georgian government was unable to communicate with the citizens or conduct its own retaliatory IW against Russia.⁹⁶ Fortunately for Georgia, and unlike in the Estonian case, critical infrastructure such as the electrical power grid is far less modernized and consequently more difficult to damage by using ICT-based capabilities.⁹⁷ In February 2010, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev approved the new Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation where some key references to the use of cyber warfare as an instrumental offensive military capability can be clearly observed. For example, when dealing with the features of modern military conflicts, the document states that such one trait, from Russia’s perspective, is the ‘... early conduct [of] information warfare activities to achieve political objectives without the use of military force, and subsequently – in the interest of creating a favorable reaction of the international community – to use military force’. And when referring to Russian future acquisition plans for the armed forces, the doctrine highlights that a key task involves the ‘... development of the forces and means of information warfare’.⁹⁸ In early 2012 the Russian Ministry of Defense revealed the Kremlin's cyber strategy under the title Conceptual Views Regarding the Activity of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space. It refrains from referring to offensive cyber warfare, but it does address issues pertaining to control, prevention, and solution of cyber conflicts. The document acknowledges the right of Russia to employ counteroffensive cyber warfare: ‘The escalation of a conflict in the cyber-space and its turn into a crisis gives the right to an individual or collective self-defense and the use of any means necessary that do not contradict the universally accepted norms and the principles of international law'. Based on Russia's past behaviour and the recent proclamation of its cyber strategy, it appears that Moscow may be more than willing to use different forms of cyber warfare should political needs emerge.\n### NATO Cyber Posture Thus far, our empirical description has exclusively focused on state actors, but since NATO plays such a major role in the contemporary security environment it seems that examining the way it relates to cyber warfare will present a more accurate account for our purposes. Interestingly enough, despite NATO's transparency on the whole, there is very little access to the more operational and sometimes technical aspects of the Alliance's cyber strategy. Nevertheless, from the available materials we can identify NATO's defensive approach to cyber warfare and cyber security.\nOriginally, NATO was not only established to address the Soviet threat in Europe. Lord Ismay, NATO's first Secretary General, contended that its objectives were to keep ‘the Russians out, the Germans down, and the Americans in'. After the Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, NATO had to reinvent itself and identify new objectives in order to preserve its relevance and mere existence. The multiplicity of political and military goals combined with the willingness of its member states enabled NATO to successfully overcome this transitional period and undergo a process of remarkable institutional change that resulted in a renewed transatlantic mandate to develop new mechanisms and strategies in order to cope with the changing security environment.\nThe treatment of cyber warfare as part of NATO's evolving security concerns became decidedly evident in the early 2000s. Unlike the United States, China, or Russia, who were individually concerned with cyber warfare of various kinds and for different reasons as described earlier, throughout the 1990s NATO was primarily focused on its internal restructuring, the expansion eastwards to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and, of course, militarily operating in the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia.\nThe 1999 Strategic Concept declared that ‘[s]tate and non-state adversaries may try to exploit the Alliance's growing reliance on information systems through information operations designed to disrupt such systems. They may attempt to use strategies of this kind to counter NATO's superiority in traditional weaponry'. Yet the first explicit reference to cyber warfare was actually made in November 2002 during NATO's Prague summit, when it was declared that the member countries decided to ‘... strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber attacks'. One operative outcome was the establishment of NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which was charged with the task of protecting ICT infrastructure and networks from unauthorized intrusion for espionage purposes or attempts to infect them with viruses. But this was a rather technical organ lacking any long-term military planning capacity, a feature that did not change significantly even following NATO's summit in Riga in November 2006 which further called for developing cyber-deterrence capabilities and doctrines. Russian cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 explicated NATO's military, infrastructural, and political weaknesses in the face of this new form of security threat, but the response as articulated by NATO's defence ministers was remarkably protective, arguing that ‘[u]rgent work is needed to enhance the ability to protect information systems of critical importance'.\nIn early 2008 it was reported that NATO officials further debated the need to protect the Alliance's assets against future cyberattacks, claiming that ‘[c]yber defence is now mentioned at the highest level along with missile defence and energy security'. While the attacks against Estonia did not result in the application of the collective security clause of the treaty, it did trigger a prompt institutional response. In January the Policy on Cyber Defence was presented and approved. During the Bucharest summit in April, the Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA) and the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) were established. Whereas the CDMA was entrusted with overseeing NATO's cyber defence efforts and providing guidance and assistance to the member countries in case of cyber-related crises, the CCDCOE, located in Estonia, was designed ‘... to enhance the capability, cooperation and information sharing among NATO, NATO nations and partners in cyber defence by virtue of education, research and development, lessons learned and consultation'.\nBoth agencies represent a highly defensive reaction to NATO's security challenges involving cyber warfare. As the Bucharest summit declaration proclaimed, the official cyber policy ‘... emphasizes the need for NATO and nations to protect key information systems in accordance with their respective responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack'. Yet Russia's continued use of cyber warfare during the war in Georgia highlighted its escalatory nature and the possible negative implications on conventional military conflicts. In April 2009, as part of the Declaration on Alliance Security, NATO moved further to identify cyberattacks alongside terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as the key global threats to member states and the international community.\nBut the major breakthrough in NATO strategic thinking regarding cyber warfare, which went beyond the strictly technical aspect of network protection, occurred during mid 2010. A team of leading experts in matters of security, headed by former American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, was asked to prepare a preliminary report to be used as a basis for NATO's new Strategic Concept. According to this report, entitled NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement and submitted in May: The next significant attack on the Alliance may well come down a fibre [sic] optic cable. Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern. However, the risk of a large-scale attack on NATO's command and control systems or energy grids could readily warrant consultations under Article 4 and could possibly lead to collective defence measures under Article 5. Effective cyber defence requires the means to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from attacks.111” Still, the recommendations reflected the defensive posture that was already advocated and implemented thus far by NATO. Furthermore, and extremely relevant to the Alliance's strategic planners, the Albright Commission was reluctant to engage the question of whether cyberattacks against NATO member states would constitute a direct act of aggression that would trigger the collective security clause. Instead, it defined a rather ambiguous principle according to which such a decision must be made considering ‘... the nature, source, scope, and other aspects of the particular security challenge'.112 The same defensive reasoning can be observed in the ensuing final version of the Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon summit six months later. In the words of the document, NATO will: “develop further our ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyberattacks, including by using the NATO planning process to enhance and coordinate national cyber-defence capabilities, bringing all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection, and better integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and response with member nations.113” Yet again, the numerous references to cyber warfare as a security threat were extremely narrow to include at best espionage, hacking, or disruption and there was no discussion about the possibility to conduct pre-emptive or retaliatory cyber warfare.114 In fact, Stephane Abrial, commander of Allied Command Transformation (ACT) responsible for leading the Alliance's transformation of capabilities and forces, was against defining the Strategic Concept's notion of ‘in-depth cyberdefense' as a ‘military-only, or even a military-centric, strategy'. Instead, Abrial focuses on NATO's ‘permanent mission [which] involves countering the daily attempts made by hackers to break into our systems, which are by necessity interconnected, making a weakness in one country's systems a weakness in all'.115 Other key NATO officials, including General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continued to conceptualize cyber warfare in defensive terms, arguing that recent cyberattacks ‘... increased the urgency to strengthen cyber defences not only at NATO, but across the Alliance as a whole'. There is no public discourse involving NATO officials that suggests treating cyber capabilities as an offensive feature of the Alliance's cyber strategy. The most proactive proposal to date was the option to dispatch NATO's cyber Rapid Reaction Teams in order to assist member countries suffering from cyberattacks, or ‘incidents' as Rasmussen calls them, should they ask for such assistance.116 It appears that NATO is focused on prevention of attacks on its institutional assets and member countries rather than initiating cyberattacks against others. As the American representative to the CCDCOE concluded, when it comes to NATO, its major contribution to cyber defence will probably involve eroding the ‘... hacker's greatest advantages -- anonymity'. NATO's strategic thinking will continue to utilize its pooled capabilities in order to promote defensive solutions to cyber warfare of various kinds and it will continue to treat it as a threat rather than as an offensive feature to be proactively utilized.",
    "## Conclusions Cyber warfare has become the latest buzzword in security studies, but some analysts downplay its importance for both policymakers and military strategists, calling it a ‘distracting and nonsensical' term. Yet while other observers also treat it as a complimentary aspect of modern warfare, they nonetheless underline its unique features, as Lynn publicly did:“The cyberthreat does not involve the existential implications ushered in by the nuclear age, but there are important similarities. Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming US advantages in conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneous and exceedingly hard to trace.”": "The article initially identified the conceptual factors that determine the offensive or defensive nature of certain military technologies. Then it adjusted these elements in order to fit the information age and its a-territorial nature. Instead of evaluating strategic orientation by traditional Offense-Defensive characteristics like mobility and firepower, the cyber Offense-Defense balance is better assessed for its technological versatility and byte power; the capacity to attack an enemy's assets on different levels (strategic, operative, and tactical), and the degree of destruction that can be inflicted on enemy assets at each of these levels.\nThe article then turned to evaluate the practical influence of cyber warfare on policy and behaviour. The American case, while perhaps being the less confrontational since there was no report of meaningful offensive American use of cyber capabilities against a foreign country or since the United States is able to avoid any direct attribution, was the most documented and comprehensive from an institutional/organizational perspective. The intellectual evolutionary process pursued by officials in the military and civil branches of government is still ongoing, and the United States is far from having a comprehensive cyber strategy. The creation of USCYBERCOM is a significant step, but it is certainly not enough since apparently there is still no highly structured and comprehensive ideational, institutional, and operational outline for American cyber warfare and cyber defence.\nThe case of China is similar in its ambiguity, but for different reasons. Unlike the United States, Beijing is rather secretive in treating its cyber posture just as it is generally reluctant to fully expose its military apparatus, causing American policymakers, military officials, and legislators to repeatedly criticize China's lack of transparency in matters related to its defence budget and the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s modernization. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that China not only has a very clear vision for its cyber posture as part of the country's wider military and technological modernization process, but it is also willing to use these capabilities in order to erode American military advantage. While Beijing is allegedly more interested in cyber espionage in order to obtain secret and up-to-date information about American capabilities and critical infrastructure, it will probably not shy away from using the same technology in order to curtail certain American assets, primarily non-combative ones (electric power plants etc.) and this may indicate that future Sino-American armed conflict will be augmented with vigorous cyber warfare.123 As a recent report submitted to Congress asserted, China's history of cyber warfare and its growing integration into the country's military strategy ‘suggests that the PLA may strike with Computer Network Operations (CNOs) and Electronic Warfare (EW) weapons in the opening phases of a conflict to degrade enemy information systems rather than attempt a traditional force-on-force attack directly where the PLA is at a disadvantage against more technologically advanced countries like the US'.124 The Russian case seemingly presents a better opportunity to observe the influence of cyber warfare on decisions of war and peace. From the empirical record it is evident that Russia explicitly used its cyber capabilities in both the Estonian and Georgian incidents, even if Moscow also used by-proxy entities for that purpose.125 The first incident was, of course, more of a diplomatic manoeuvre in order to curb Estonia's anti-Russian attitudes as the Kremlin perceived the matter. There was classical Soviet-era use of Russian ‘political activists' in order to encourage street unrest and orchestrated anti-government protests, but there was also the use of cyber warfare in order to paralyse then Estonian banking system and other key government agencies. Thus, one should treat this episode as an experiment in utilizing cyber capabilities in order to obtain certain political means. As the case of the Georgian war illustrated, this time cyber warfare was an integral, if not a decisive, part of the policymaking process and the military activities aimed at subduing the ‘defiant' Saakashvili administration. Clearly, the conventional dimension of the conflict was predominant, mainly due to the technological profile of Georgia's critical infrastructure, but the Russian use of cyberattacks hampered Georgian domestic vital communications between different branches of the government and completely prevented any Georgian IW counterattack.126 NATO's cyber posture reflects the Alliance's historical defensive raison d'être that was articulated during the Cold War and reaffirmed following its end. For NATO officials, cyber warfare relates primarily to attempts by foreign actors to penetrate the organization's computer and information networks in order to retrieve confidential data. They are deeply reluctant to widen their approach to define such attacks as a cause for triggering the collective security clause of the treaty. Hence when Estonia was under Russian cyberattack, the most that NATO was able to offer Tallinn was technical assistance in reactivating and protecting its ICT networks from future attacks. Furthermore, even amid the Albright Commission's call to devise and implement a comprehensive cyber strategy, the institutional response was minor and essentially focused on network protection rather than explicit cyber deterrence, let alone an offensive reorientation.\nCONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY The use of cyber capabilities makes a difference for policymakers since it allows them to minimize the risks of taking certain offensive actions and it is a relatively effective low-cost alternative, as the Israeli attack on Syria suggests, and it will become more common in the future. Cyber warfare, like all other forms of combat, is a political expression nonetheless in that there is a need for a conscious decision to apply it in order to achieve certain objectives. In the cases reviewed in this article, cyber capabilities were used selectively and in different intensities, as illustrated by the American reluctance to use pre-emptive cyber warfare against Libya. Hence future research should look at the way cyber warfare is prioritized over conventional/kinetic options in order to elucidate the conditions under which policymakers will prefer the former over the latter and vice versa. Furthermore, such studies should empirically appraise how integral cyber warfare has become at the strategic, operative, and tactical levels.\nOverall, cyber warfare is becoming an accepted military expedient since it allows leaders to achieve their political objectives with much less risk in the short term, even if in the long term it may actually lead to 'non-cyber' escalation.[127] Prussian strategist and military thinker Carl von Clausewitz wrote long ago that '... a prince or a general can best demonstrate his genius by managing a campaign exactly to suit his objectives and his resources, doing neither too much nor too little'.[128] Cyber warfare allows policymakers and the military to do exactly that, and with additional adjustments realism can help to better explain the process even if there is more work to be done in pursuit of this goal.",

This misses the larger possibilities for political/military chain reactions that cyber warfare may prompt, possibly leading to armed conflict. This article utilizes Offense-Defense theory to appraise the influence of cyber warfare on international security and the prospects for conflict. Offense-Defense theory, as applied here, better explains the relationship between technological innovation and international politics, and leads to different conclusions from other realist approaches. Redefining the Offense-Defense balance to accommodate cyberspace leads to an emphasis on the offensive advantages of cyber capabilities. The offensive and defensive cyber postures of China, Russia, the United States, and NATO are examined here to empirically assess the role of cyber warfare in security policy. Evidence shows that innovations in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) allow states to take greater risks and adopt more vigilant or offensive positions toward adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but make decisions to escalate easier and cheaper. A strategic enabler that provides attackers greater freedom of action, cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if it is not a sufficient one.\n## Introduction In September 2007, Israeli military cyber warriors reportedly hacked into the Syrian monitoring and anti-aircraft missile defences to allow Israeli fighter jets to bomb the suspected nuclear reactor near Deir el-Zor.¹ As described by one account: [T]he main attack was preceded by an engagement with a single Syrian radar site at Tall al-Abuad near the Turkish border. It was assaulted with what appears to be a combination of electronic attack and precision bombs to enable the Israeli force to enter and exit Syrian airspace. Almost immediately, the entire Syrian radar system went off the air for a period of time that included the raid.² This incident, along with others discussed here, suggests that we are in the course of a new era, similar to past transformations in international security, such as the airplane, the tank, or the nuclear bomb, innovations that culminated in radical departures in strategic thinking and behaviour. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) not only drives the internet, the iPhone, or the Global Positioning System (GPS). Nowadays, ICT has become an integral and possibly an essential military Contemporary Security Policy, Vol.34, No.1, 2013, pp.40-63 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2013.771031 © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis capability. The cyber sphere of action it created is replacing the conventional battlefield.3 Some observers argue that for realists cyber warfare is ‘old wine in a new bottle'; its added value is rather marginal.4 This downplays the broader implications of cyber warfare, stressing only technical aspects and focusing on information warfare (IW), one operative manifestation of cyber warfare, rather than the possibilities for political/military chain reaction that cyber warfare may prompt, ending in armed conflict.5 Consequently, this article is not concerned with specific cyber tactics like computer-based commercial espionage or phishing per se. Rather, this analysis stresses the integration of ICT applications aimed at disrupting, paralysing, and possibly destroying another state's assets, with a direct bearing on national security and critical infrastructure, and especially its capacity to conduct military operations.6 This article has two main objectives. First, despite the large number of studies dealing with cyber warfare, we are still lacking a realist theoretical conceptualization of its influence on international security in general and on the pervasiveness of war in particular.7 This analysis examines the relevance of realism as a technologically, rather than a territorially, based explanation for international security in the information age. Considering the fact that ‘[r]ealist theories... still provide a context and motivation for many of the most important theoretical debates in the field', as Jack Donnelly asserts, it is almost inconceivable that realism will not take a shot at explaining the dramatic technological shift in the security environment caused by cyber warfare.8 This article employs realist Offense-Defense theory to evaluate the expected effect of ICT on the prevalence of war, using the most suitable realist framework to explore the nexus between technological innovation and international politics, and especially questions of war and peace.9 In contrast to other scholars, who apply Offense-Defense theory to support cyber deterrence, this treatment stresses the need to dramatically modify Offense-Defense terminology to better address cyber warfare's unique and revolutionary features.10 Second, this article tests this Offense-Defense framework, empirically evaluating the role of cyber warfare in contemporary military strategic thinking and state behaviour. The evolving cyber postures of China, Russia, NATO, and the United States show to what extent cyber warfare concepts have gained traction among leaders, strategists, and military planners. Since we are dealing with ongoing technological developments, their policy implications far from determined, this study is more of a probe into a possible future rather than a final ruling. Nevertheless, from existing evidence it is possible to infer that ICT allows states to take greater risks and thus adopt more vigilant or offensive positions vis-à-vis their adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but their existence makes the decision to escalate armed conflict easier and considerably cheaper. ICT can be considered a strategic enabler and an efficient force multiplier that provides the attacker with greater freedom of action.\nThe article first, briefly, discusses the current status of Offense-Defense theory and suggests a fundamental conceptual amendment to allow realism to better incorporate cyber warfare into accounts of contemporary international security. It then proceeds to evaluate the cyber Offense-Defense balance to locate its strategic orientation. The cyber posture of four of the prominent actors in contemporary world affairs -- China, Russia, NATO, and the United States -- are examined in order to assess the effect of the cyber Offense-Defense balance on their security policies.\nIt is the conclusion of this article that for realism to maintain its relevance, it must transcend traditional territorial and kinetic traits of international security, or at least give more room for novel technological factors, and consider cyberspace as an alternative realm that states utilize to attack others. ICT and employment of cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if not a sufficient one, and realism must adjust its theoretical foundations and predictions accordingly. At a minimum, cyber warfare is an influential force multiplier or conflict enabler. At a maximum, it is a strategic game changer.11 But while the potential of cyber warfare to revolutionize international security and interstate conflict is dramatic, the scale of this transformation will be determined by political rather than technological considerations.\n## Cybernating Offense-Defense Theory Offense-Defense theory has generated heated debates ever since it was introduced by Robert Jervis and George Quester in the late 1970s.12 Jervis contended that the orientation of different military capabilities and weaponry systems may influence interstate security dilemmas and therefore the prevalence of war or peace. ‘When we say that the offense has the advantage, we simply mean that it is easier to destroy the other's army', he explains. ‘When the defense has the advantage, it is easier to protect and hold than it is to move forward, destroy and take.' Quester, applying the same logic, concluded that ‘likelihoods of war are thus clearly influenced by how effective the offensive weapon seems to be, as compared with the defensive'.13 Offense-Defense theory was heavily criticized for both its methodological foundation and empirical applicability.14 Thus, various attempts were made to salvage the theory and present an amended version that would bolster its standing as a leading realist theory.15 One of the most lethal criticisms had to do with the difficulty of differentiating between the offensive or defensive nature of military capabilities or technologies. In response, Charles Glaser and Chaim Kaufmann, for example, suggested that the Offense-Defense balance -- the driving engine of the theory -- should be considered as the ‘... ratio of the cost of the forces the attacker requires to take territory to the cost of the forces the defender has deployed'.16 Still, the traditional interpretation of Offense-Defense theory, as stipulated by both advocates and critics, is somewhat anachronistic and to some extent irrelevant to the information age. It presumes that war is conducted and concluded according to a kinetic basis and a territorial logic. Furthermore, the determinism of offensive and defensive capabilities, the security dilemma and armed conflict, is simplistic. It fosters a flawed ‘major war pathology' that does not necessarily exist today. One can plausibly imagine an armed conflict that is not necessarily aimed at unconditional surrender or territorial occupation, but tends to be much more limited, although it can turn into an all-out war of course, a kind of slippery slope interstate militarized dynamics.17 Second, and more importantly, since the conduct of contemporary warfare is dependent on ICT infrastructure, cyberspace becomes a contested domain in which cyberwar, or major technological conflicts, may take place or even be determined.18 As James Adams notes, ‘[a]round the world, information technology increasingly pervades weapons systems, defense infrastructures and national economies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new international battlefield'.19 Cyberwar may not solely determine the outcomes of future armed conflicts and interstate rivalries, but it can influence leaders' determination to prefer military options over political solutions. Since the early 1990s, policymakers have become deeply aware of ICT-based systems' vulnerability, their influence on states' national security posture, and the ability to conduct military operations.20 Former American Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn recently acknowledged that ICT > enables almost everything the US military does: logistical support and global command and control of forces, real-time provision of intelligence, and remote operations... The US government's digital infrastructure now gives the United States critical advantages over any adversary, but its reliance on computer networks also potentially enables adversaries to gain valuable intelligence about US capabilities and operations, to impede the United States' conventional military forces, and to disrupt the US economy.21 But is cyberspace defence or offence oriented? According to Lynn, the answer is straightforward: ‘In cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand'.22 This may be intuitively correct, and surely this position is shared by the vast majority of scholars and practitioners, but how can Offense-Defense theory provide a more founded answer to this question? This article suggests that Offense-Defense theory can effectively perform this task after updating its conceptual basis. Essentially, the balance between offence and defence is determined, in the traditional fashion, according to two key factors: mobility enhancement and firepower's degree of destructiveness.23 However, these determinants are not necessarily relevant to cyber warfare and thus must be redefined in order to address the technologically different security environment we are dealing with in the information age and the various expressions of cyber warfare.24 ### From Mobility to ‘Versatility' Unlike the customary kinetic and territorially based interpretation of the term mobility in Offense-Defense theory literature that relates to the possibility of relocating combatants at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,25 in cyberspace mobility actually relates to the capacity to technologically attack different types of ICT-based targets at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than thinking in terms of the physical allocation of armed forces across or between combat zones, in cyberwar we should talk of cyber versatility that corresponds to levels of war hierarchy.26 Strategic targets or critical infrastructures consist of vital or centre-of-gravity assets whose destruction may have a colossal effect on a state's national security and its capacity to operate normally.27 Such elements include a state's military constellations, defence industrial base, satellite communication, electrical power grid, internet connectivity, central banking system, stock market, ministries, and governmental agencies.28 On the operational level, where the focus is on related ICT-based systems, cyber warfare may foil the use of military and warning systems such as anti-aircraft missile systems, reconnaissance capabilities, or the hacking into an enemy's technological capabilities such as drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).29 On the tactical level, when the focus is on a particular and segmented ICT-based system, cyber warfare may interrupt battlefield communication and coordination, disrupt electronic signals such as radio and GPS signals, or eliminate them completely.30 ### From Firepower to ‘Byte Power' Unlike the customary territorially based interpretation of this feature in the Offense-Defense theory literature that primarily revolves around accuracy and destructiveness of certain weapons, in cyberspace firepower actually relates to the degree of technological damage that can be inflicted on the enemy's ICT-based infrastructure at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than talk of kinetic firepower, in cyber warfare the idea is to examine how much byte power a state can extract and direct towards an adversary's ICT-based targets.\nWhile the Offense-Defense theory literature typically maintains that the greater a weapon's firepower the greater its contribution to the defence,31 this assertion is challenged by prominent Offense-Defense theorists and it seems largely misguided in cyberspace. Glaser and Kaufman argue, for example, that ‘... there can be exceptions when specific firepower innovations are differentially useful against defender'.32 It seems that moving from the territorial and/or the kinetic to cyberspace allows such an exception, especially if we are dealing with highly accurate and low-signature cyber capabilities that allow the attacking and possible neutralization of an enemy's defence systems with virtual anonymity.33 Furthermore, and primarily as a complementary mechanism, selective or surgical cyberattacks may greatly improve the effectiveness of offensive conventional weapons by creating a cyber window of opportunity for conventional activities through which both combatants and equipment can penetrate more easily an otherwise unassailable target.34 To sum up this section, ICT-induced cyber capabilities tilt the Offense-Defense balance in favour of the offence, not in the prospects of gaining and maintaining control over territory and material resources as a manifestation of victory, but rather in the actual possibility to paralyse the enemy's military deployment and civilian preparedness and drastically limit its retaliatory potential. Since the use of cyber capabilities according to both indicators suggests that offence has the advantage, let us turn to evaluate the relevance of cyber warfare to the process of policymaking. For offence-dominant cyber capabilities to actually influence calculations and decisions in matters of war and peace, leaders and policymakers must be aware of these technologically advanced capabilities and acknowledge their strategic advantages. In the words of Keir Lieber, the influence of technological innovation ‘... is always filtered through the strategies that state decision makers employ in pursuit of their political goals. In simplest terms, politics -- more than technology -- is the master'.35 The aim is not, however, to meticulously describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures, i.e. the overall strategy designed to address different ICT-based challenges and threats by applying a multitude of proactive and passive measures. Rather, I present a succinct account to highlight key features and contemporary ramifications for war and peace. Given their offensive nature, the following section will try to assess whether the use of cyber capabilities actually prompted armed conflict, and under what conditions.\n## The Politics of Cyberwar and Peace Generally speaking, America, China, and Russia have long histories of attempting to combine political aims with advanced technology, while NATO primarily benefited from the American efforts. The Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), warmly adopted by the Americans in the late 1980s and successfully implemented during the Gulf War, was in fact an adaptation of the 1970s Soviet Military-Technical Revolution (MTR). As Elliot Cohen observes, the idea was to promote ‘... an imminent technical revolution that would give conventional weapons a level of effectiveness in the field comparable to that of small tactical nuclear weapons'.\nThe following accounts describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures to assess the influence of ICT-based capabilities on strategic thinking and behaviour. There is an important caveat to this analysis; cyber warfare suffers from a major problem of attributing attacks to specific state actors. Some of the cases discussed below include acts by non-state actors such as individuals, hacktivists, netizens, or more organized cyber militias and cyber gangs. Nevertheless, there is a growing consensus in the literature that these non-state actors mostly operate in tandem with national governments and follow their lead as proxies and their contribution should be considered an integral part of a state's overall cyber policy.\n### American Cyber Posture It seems that the most robust, sophisticated, and technically and institutionally up-to-date cyber posture is the American one, despite its paradoxical defensive nature. While the United States is the primary target for different forms of cyber warfare, especially cyber spying and phishing, it also possesses the highest potential to become a cyber superpower with the most vigorous state-run ICT-based posture. In the early 1990s, the Gulf War exhibited American technological superiority in terms of both hardware and software as countless stealth fighters bombarded Iraq without being detected by Iraqi anti-aircraft missile systems using state of the art precision-guided munitions (PGMs). American technological superiority was a decisive factor in defeating Iraq. As commander of US Central Command during the Gulf War, Norman Schwarzkopf argued that technological innovation worked ‘beyond our wildest expectations'.\nGiven America's growing reliance on ICT in the battlefield and in the supportive and logistical military formations, and repeated reports concerning a breach of computer networks such as in the case of the air force's Rome Air Development Center in March 1994, it became clear that this virtual Achilles heel must be protected. In 1995, the Clinton administration's national security strategy proclaimed that ‘the threat of intrusions to our military and commercial information systems poses a significant risk to national security and must be addressed'. In June 1997 the US government conducted Eligible Receiver, the very first information warfare (IW) exercise that exposed the vulnerability of American military and civilian critical infrastructures in case of a coordinated cyberattack.\nBut as American policymakers and strategists feared their vital technological structures, they also become increasingly interested in exploiting this new strategic domain in their favour. Indeed, while the Kosovo war was overwhelmingly won by conducting conventional massive air bombing against Serb targets, some observers asserted that the accuracy and efficiency of these aerial campaigns were the outcome of cyber warfare-like operations, especially in directing the bombers to their targets from the ground. Furthermore, while it is not exactly clear what additional cyber measures were used against Serb targets, it was reported that the United States and NATO conducted various sophisticated cyberattacks that included penetrations of Serbian ICT systems and overloading them with data or manipulating their databases. Hence the use of cyber capabilities at the operational level was not only disruptive in nature but also proactive and offensive in its attempt to frustrate Serbian defensive formation and retaliatory military options.\nDuring the War on Terror campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, cyber warfare did not play a significant role. In both cases, the United States had virtually no critical ICT assets to attack or disrupt and the focus was on traditional, if irregular, combat operations. Nevertheless, it was reported that a month before the Iraq War began, President Bush signed a secret directive ordering the development of an American strategy for large-scale pre-emptive cyberattacks against adversaries of the United States.\nIt was then reported that the United States was pre-emptively cutting off the Iraqi computer network and internet grid that connected civilian and government agencies before war began in March 2003. According to Richard Clarke, the Iraqi Defense Ministry's email system was hacked by the Americans in order to warn high-ranking officers about opposing the future invasion and to assure them that the objective was to overthrow Saddam Hussein and not to destroy Iraq's political, military, and socioeconomic structures. Another path that was explored but not pursued was hacking into the regime's financial institutions and foreign bank accounts in order to locate Saddam Hussein's hidden assets.\nAt about the same time, Chinese hackers apparently orchestrated a major cyberattack on American computer systems at NASA and Sandia National Laboratories. It was made clearer following these incidents and others that the United States must re-evaluate its cyber policy and possibly change its approach. Yet the discourse remained rather defensive, primarily focused on protecting American critical infrastructure and confidential databases. When George W. Bush published his administration's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003, its objective was ‘... to secure the portions of cyberspace that they own, operate, control, or with which they interact'. The military establishment, on the other hand, was much more assertive in its approach to cyber warfare, as the 2004 Military Strategy asserted: The Armed Forces must have the ability to operate across the air, land, sea, space and cyberspace domains of the battlespace... The non-linear nature of the current security environment requires multi-layered active and passive measures to counter numerous diverse conventional and asymmetric threats... They also include threats in cyberspace aimed at networks and data critical to US information-enabled systems. Such threats require a comprehensive concept of deterrence encompassing traditional adversaries, terrorist networks and rogue states able to employ any range of capabilities.52” The 2005 National Defense Strategy further proclaimed that alongside traditional and irregular security challenges the United States confronts, cyberwarfare may constitute a threat that under certain conditions “... can fundamentally alter long-established concepts of warfare. Some potential adversaries are seeking disruptive capabilities to exploit US vulnerabilities and offset the current advantages of the United States and its partners'.53 Consequently, the stated military applications of cyber capabilities were made more offensive than ever a year later when the 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations noted:“[T]he United States must have cyberspace superiority to ensure our freedom of action and deny the same to our adversaries through the integration of network defense, exploitation, and attack... Offensive capabilities in cyberspace offer the United States and our adversaries an opportunity to gain and maintain the initiative. DOD cyberspace operations are strongest when offensive and defensive capabilities are mutually supporting. This requires a long-range focus and dedicated resources to achieve this goal.54” The director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Keith Alexander, argued in 2007 that the United States should reformulate the operational and institutional foundations of its cyber posture in order to address the technologically induced security environment, since “while we have ample national level strategies, we have yet to translate these strategies into operational art through development of joint doctrine for cyberspace. Through the doctrine vetting process, we can develop a common understanding of what it means to conduct warfare within and through cyberspace.55” Indeed, in early 2008 President Bush issued a directive that allows American intelligence agencies, especially the NSA, to monitor all internet traffic of the federal government in order to protect vital assets from cyberattacks. What makes this directive a major turning point in American cyber warfare evolution is that under Bush's initiative, the NSA with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) could provide the Pentagon with evidence that a pre-emptive cyberattack is crucial in order to protect American critical infrastructure.56 In early 2009, soon after taking office, President Barack Obama announced his administration's cyber policy, which remained rather committed to the defensive notion of protecting and securing critical infrastructure in what was often referred to as cyber security.57 Yet in April it was reported that the White House was, in fact, in the final stages of establishing a new cyber agency under the Pentagon's authority which could develop offensive cyber weapons alongside defending American ICT critical infrastructure. Former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, was appointed as director of the Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and while he was rather cautious in attributing any offensive aspects to the new command, the Pentagon declared that the mission of this new agency was to:“[d]irect the operations and defence of specified Department of Defense information networks [involving some 90,000 military personnel] and prepare to, when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, [to] ensure US allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.”\nMore recently, it was reported that the Pentagon is formulating a particular strategy that will engage the threats emanating from cyber warfare under the premise that any such attack on behalf of a foreign country constitutes a declaration of war that may result in armed conflict. In effect, however, President Obama did not approve a pre-emptive cyber offensive against Libya before the United States led the military campaign against Muammar Qaddafi in March 2011. The idea was to use cyber warfare in order to hinder Libya's air defence systems, but the option was abandoned, according to some government officials, because the Obama administration feared it would act as a precedent for Russian or Chinese future offensive attacks. One Defense Department official said the cyber options ‘... were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya's air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn't pan out'. Another White House official argued that ‘[t]hese cybercapabilities are still like the Ferrari that you keep in the garage and only take out for the big race and not just for a run around town, unless nothing else can get you there'.\nIn the aftermath of the war in Libya, the White House attempted to provide the most comprehensive and inclusive cyber strategy to date. But despite the clear defensive tone of the document, especially when considering the ambiguity of the parts relating to cyber deterrence mechanisms, there was more than a hint of offensive reasoning:“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic -- as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.”\nThe debate concerning the defensive or offensive posture of American cyber strategy or its passive or proactive nature is still ongoing. Recently, General Robert Kehler, Commander of US Strategic Command that oversees CYBERCOM, commented that the optimal solution would involve both: ‘I think we are looking at what an offensive component would be: what does that look like? What kind of options would we want to be able to offer? I think that we have always said that there needs to be an offense and defense mix'. These questions remain unanswered.\n### Chinese Cyber Posture It is extremely difficult to fully account for the cyber posture of China and its development over the years. In China, defence-related transparency is a rare commodity. Yet it is widely known and established that the Chinese pursued a robust modernization in military technology and tactics from the late 1970s. Maoist ideology not only determined the political and societal structure of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its inception in 1949, it also served as China's military national defence strategy in that it revolved around the concept of ‘People's War' and the mobilization of the masses for a protracted armed conflict. After the death of Mao in 1976, and under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, a new conceptualization of Chinese warfare emerged that gradually became highly receptive to technological, industrial, and economic developments, making the entire defence apparatus much more open to engage the challenge of future armed conflict in the information age. From an operative vantage point, China gradually abandoned Mao's conception of active defence in favour of a pre-emptive military orientation that advocates a first strike mentality.\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, which strained Sino-American relations, highlighted historical anti-Western sentiments and created a shaky setting for the post-Cold War era. Consequently, by the mid 1990s China was caught paradoxically in an international constellation that was just as challenging as the Cold War international system. American intentions to redraw the global and regional landscape, and especially Washington's reactions to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, were badly received in Beijing. Consequently, the United States was increasingly considered to be a major source of danger to China's national interests and political order.\nAmerican military performance during the Gulf War highlighted the technological inferiority of the PLA and encouraged the Chinese leadership to accelerate and broaden existing plans to modernize and improve the army's capabilities for the purpose of potentially waging a limited or local war. Indeed, newly elected General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Jiang Zemin was confident that a comprehensive modernization of the Chinese armed forces amid what he considered American military superiority and interference in China's internal affairs was of great importance. Thus, he encouraged technological modernization according to American standards when he told members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in early 1993 that ‘[w]e must win high-tech, small-scale wars under modern conditions'. Similarly, the Chairman of the Commission on Science, Technology and National Defense Industry (COSTIND) General Ding Henggao warned that ‘[t]he one who possesses high-tech superiority will have the upper hand on the battlefield'.\nModernizing and increasing the professionalism of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was also matched with vigorous ICT-based innovation. As Major General Weng Pufang, former director of the Strategy Department of the Chinese Academy of Military Science, argued in a 1995 article he published in a Chinese military journal:“The thrust of China's military construction and development of weapons and equipment will no longer be toward strengthening the ‘firepower antipersonnel system' of the industrial age, but toward the strengthening of information technology, information weapons and information networking. Our sights must not be fixed on the firepower warfare of the industrial age, rather they must be trained on the information warfare of the information age.74” The PLA became highly interested in exploiting these technological innovations and restructured its ICT-based military units to comprise the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Department (GSD), currently entrusted with exploitation of foreign computer networks, whereas the Fourth Department of the GSD is responsible for attacking foreign computer networks.75 Indeed, after an agreement with Cuba was signed in February 1998, China built two cyber warfare stations, one eavesdropping telephone and internet communications in the United States and the other more concerned with monitoring American military satellite systems.76 But in addition to these military units, the Chinese government has reportedly outsourced some of its cyber warfare tasks to civilian groups that are systematically activated and thus enable greater international flexibility due to cyber warfare's attribution problem.77 In the early 2000s, Beijing was ostensibly involved in numerous successful attempts to hack into American databases and critical infrastructure such as nuclear and electric power plants, satellite systems, and a number of Department of Defense contractors that store confidential information and blueprints of future weapon systems.78 China also launched an ambitious anti-satellite weapons program aimed at levelling the odds against American espionage and to attack satellite systems that are perceived by Beijing as utterly anti-Chinese in nature.79 Hence, China's cyber posture is primarily a deterrent against American military superiority but it has deep and conscious long-term advantages that Beijing may cash in on in time of need. In fact, China's cyber posture will only benefit an offensive orientation compared with the current defensive traits of the American cyber posture if Beijing needs to prevent Washington from interfering in matters related to Taiwan, for example.80 China's 2000 Defense White Paper explicitly adhered to this transformative phase of the PLA's posture into an ICT-based modernized army:“Faced with the world's military developments and the characteristics of modern warfare, the Chinese armed forces will, in the course of modernizing their weaponry, devote themselves to transforming semi-mechanized and mechanized weapon systems to automatized and informationized systems as soon as possible, so that they can possess weapons as advanced as possible and assure the accomplishment of the sacred missions assigned to them by the nation.81” A report submitted to the American Congress in 2007 argued that China not only possesses the cyber capabilities required to conduct comprehensive offensive cyberattacks against the United States: ‘In 2005, the PLA began to incorporate offensive CYBER POSTURING AND THE OFFENSE-DEFENSE BALANCE Computer Network Operations (CNOs) into its exercises, primarily in first strikes against enemy networks'. Indeed, China's 2008 Defense White Paper proclaimed in the sections dealing with the technological dimensions of modern warfare that China is accelerating reform and innovation in its defense-related science, technology and industry... Defense-related science, technology and industry are striving to enhance the informationization of weaponry and equipment design and development, and to render product design more digitalized, modularized, standardized and reliable.[83] In sum, the Chinese consider cyber warfare and its auxiliary elements as a power multiplier, integral to their national security strategy. Thus far, China has refrained from presenting a comprehensive cyber strategy but in practice it has primarily involved strategic and tactical hacking into American and other Western countries' databases and internet systems for reasons of technological and operative military espionage. While there were numerous indications of China's involvement in penetrating critical ICT-based infrastructure in the United States, Beijing has not used its existing cyber assets thus far to directly attack American strategic military assets in order to neutralize them but instead has focused on cyber spying. This pattern may change under certain conditions, especially if Beijing wishes to diversify its policy alternatives in case of a Sino-American confrontation.[84] ## Russian Cyber Posture Whereas in the two previous cases the strategizing of ICT as military capabilities was ambiguous at best, and there was certainly no actual use of cyber warfare as part of armed conflict, the case of Russia in the first decade of the 21st century can be easily dubbed as an exemplary case for the opposite. To begin with, during most of the 1990s Russia was grappling with the devastating economic, social, and political effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign and defence policy was primarily focused on '... disarmament and limitation of the arms race - in terms of releasing as many resources as possible and creating the most favorable conditions for the implementation of our socioeconomic reforms'.[85] In December 1994, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signalled his intention to alter Russia's foreign and defence orientation when he decided to invade Chechnya, a conflict that '... demonstrated the full extent of the armed forces' decline. In virtually every respect, the Russian military failed the challenge it was supposed to easily master'.[86] By 1996, in face of failure in Chechnya and growing domestic opposition, Yeltsin moved to replace the moderate and pro-Western Kozyrev with Yevgeny Primakov who also served as Prime Minister between September 1998 and May 1999. Indicatively, in his first press conference Primakov asserted that 'Russia was and remains a great power. Her foreign policy should correspond to that status'.[87] The weaknesses of Russia's conventional and non-conventional military postures led many Russian military thinkers and officials to regard ICT-based capabilities as a way to compensate for strategic inferiority. During the mid 1990s, the Russian Army CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY and Defense Ministry began seriously examining the nexus between technology and the regular military structure.⁸⁸ Russia was openly using IW during the second Chechen war.⁸⁹ The first major indication of coordinated Russian cyber warfare (in addition to IW) took place in Estonia in 2007, after a monument commemorating the Red Army’s re-conquest of Estonia during the Second World War was moved despite the Kremlin’s explicit warning.⁹⁰ Rather than exclusively resorting to military force in order to resolve what Moscow considered explicit anti-Russian reactionary sentiments and policies, as they did during the Chechen military campaigns in 1994 and 1999 for example, this time Moscow pursued a much more sophisticated approach that included inducing political riots in Estonia and targeting Estonia’s ICT infrastructure such as the banking sector, parliament’s website and email system, emergency phone lines, hospitals, and universities.⁹¹ During a period of several weeks in May 2007, after the statue was relocated, official Estonian governmental websites and vital telecommunications infrastructure were attacked and rendered inactive, according to most accounts, by Russian perpetrators.⁹² Russian policymakers began to appreciate the role of ICT and cyber warfare as an auxiliary instrument of coercion and statecraft against what they considered uncooperative regimes in the post-Soviet rim. And the lessons learned during the Estonian affair were apparently applied as part of Russia’s involvement in the Georgian war in August 2008.⁹³ Essentially, in response to Georgia’s attack against South Ossetia, Russian forces invaded Georgia and practically subdued it within a matter of days. Yet even before the first bullet was fired, the Kremlin decided to employ a preemptive strategic disruptive cyber attack.⁹⁴ In mid July, several cyberattacks were waged against Georgian websites and two weeks later a second wave of cyberattacks on Georgian targets was detected. A few days into the war, the vast majority of Georgian government websites were not functioning; in effect, the Georgian government was, as one study asserted, ‘cyber-locked’, without viable access to the internet and to its state-run agencies including the National Bank of Georgia.⁹⁵ No less important, the Georgian government was unable to communicate with the citizens or conduct its own retaliatory IW against Russia.⁹⁶ Fortunately for Georgia, and unlike in the Estonian case, critical infrastructure such as the electrical power grid is far less modernized and consequently more difficult to damage by using ICT-based capabilities.⁹⁷ In February 2010, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev approved the new Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation where some key references to the use of cyber warfare as an instrumental offensive military capability can be clearly observed. For example, when dealing with the features of modern military conflicts, the document states that such one trait, from Russia’s perspective, is the ‘... early conduct [of] information warfare activities to achieve political objectives without the use of military force, and subsequently – in the interest of creating a favorable reaction of the international community – to use military force’. And when referring to Russian future acquisition plans for the armed forces, the doctrine highlights that a key task involves the ‘... development of the forces and means of information warfare’.⁹⁸ In early 2012 the Russian Ministry of Defense revealed the Kremlin's cyber strategy under the title Conceptual Views Regarding the Activity of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space. It refrains from referring to offensive cyber warfare, but it does address issues pertaining to control, prevention, and solution of cyber conflicts. The document acknowledges the right of Russia to employ counteroffensive cyber warfare: ‘The escalation of a conflict in the cyber-space and its turn into a crisis gives the right to an individual or collective self-defense and the use of any means necessary that do not contradict the universally accepted norms and the principles of international law'. Based on Russia's past behaviour and the recent proclamation of its cyber strategy, it appears that Moscow may be more than willing to use different forms of cyber warfare should political needs emerge.\n### NATO Cyber Posture Thus far, our empirical description has exclusively focused on state actors, but since NATO plays such a major role in the contemporary security environment it seems that examining the way it relates to cyber warfare will present a more accurate account for our purposes. Interestingly enough, despite NATO's transparency on the whole, there is very little access to the more operational and sometimes technical aspects of the Alliance's cyber strategy. Nevertheless, from the available materials we can identify NATO's defensive approach to cyber warfare and cyber security.\nOriginally, NATO was not only established to address the Soviet threat in Europe. Lord Ismay, NATO's first Secretary General, contended that its objectives were to keep ‘the Russians out, the Germans down, and the Americans in'. After the Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, NATO had to reinvent itself and identify new objectives in order to preserve its relevance and mere existence. The multiplicity of political and military goals combined with the willingness of its member states enabled NATO to successfully overcome this transitional period and undergo a process of remarkable institutional change that resulted in a renewed transatlantic mandate to develop new mechanisms and strategies in order to cope with the changing security environment.\nThe treatment of cyber warfare as part of NATO's evolving security concerns became decidedly evident in the early 2000s. Unlike the United States, China, or Russia, who were individually concerned with cyber warfare of various kinds and for different reasons as described earlier, throughout the 1990s NATO was primarily focused on its internal restructuring, the expansion eastwards to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and, of course, militarily operating in the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia.\nThe 1999 Strategic Concept declared that ‘[s]tate and non-state adversaries may try to exploit the Alliance's growing reliance on information systems through information operations designed to disrupt such systems. They may attempt to use strategies of this kind to counter NATO's superiority in traditional weaponry'. Yet the first explicit reference to cyber warfare was actually made in November 2002 during NATO's Prague summit, when it was declared that the member countries decided to ‘... strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber attacks'. One operative outcome was the establishment of NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which was charged with the task of protecting ICT infrastructure and networks from unauthorized intrusion for espionage purposes or attempts to infect them with viruses. But this was a rather technical organ lacking any long-term military planning capacity, a feature that did not change significantly even following NATO's summit in Riga in November 2006 which further called for developing cyber-deterrence capabilities and doctrines. Russian cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 explicated NATO's military, infrastructural, and political weaknesses in the face of this new form of security threat, but the response as articulated by NATO's defence ministers was remarkably protective, arguing that ‘[u]rgent work is needed to enhance the ability to protect information systems of critical importance'.\nIn early 2008 it was reported that NATO officials further debated the need to protect the Alliance's assets against future cyberattacks, claiming that ‘[c]yber defence is now mentioned at the highest level along with missile defence and energy security'. While the attacks against Estonia did not result in the application of the collective security clause of the treaty, it did trigger a prompt institutional response. In January the Policy on Cyber Defence was presented and approved. During the Bucharest summit in April, the Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA) and the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) were established. Whereas the CDMA was entrusted with overseeing NATO's cyber defence efforts and providing guidance and assistance to the member countries in case of cyber-related crises, the CCDCOE, located in Estonia, was designed ‘... to enhance the capability, cooperation and information sharing among NATO, NATO nations and partners in cyber defence by virtue of education, research and development, lessons learned and consultation'.\nBoth agencies represent a highly defensive reaction to NATO's security challenges involving cyber warfare. As the Bucharest summit declaration proclaimed, the official cyber policy ‘... emphasizes the need for NATO and nations to protect key information systems in accordance with their respective responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack'. Yet Russia's continued use of cyber warfare during the war in Georgia highlighted its escalatory nature and the possible negative implications on conventional military conflicts. In April 2009, as part of the Declaration on Alliance Security, NATO moved further to identify cyberattacks alongside terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as the key global threats to member states and the international community.\nBut the major breakthrough in NATO strategic thinking regarding cyber warfare, which went beyond the strictly technical aspect of network protection, occurred during mid 2010. A team of leading experts in matters of security, headed by former American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, was asked to prepare a preliminary report to be used as a basis for NATO's new Strategic Concept. According to this report, entitled NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement and submitted in May: The next significant attack on the Alliance may well come down a fibre [sic] optic cable. Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern. However, the risk of a large-scale attack on NATO's command and control systems or energy grids could readily warrant consultations under Article 4 and could possibly lead to collective defence measures under Article 5. Effective cyber defence requires the means to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from attacks.111” Still, the recommendations reflected the defensive posture that was already advocated and implemented thus far by NATO. Furthermore, and extremely relevant to the Alliance's strategic planners, the Albright Commission was reluctant to engage the question of whether cyberattacks against NATO member states would constitute a direct act of aggression that would trigger the collective security clause. Instead, it defined a rather ambiguous principle according to which such a decision must be made considering ‘... the nature, source, scope, and other aspects of the particular security challenge'.112 The same defensive reasoning can be observed in the ensuing final version of the Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon summit six months later. In the words of the document, NATO will: “develop further our ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyberattacks, including by using the NATO planning process to enhance and coordinate national cyber-defence capabilities, bringing all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection, and better integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and response with member nations.113” Yet again, the numerous references to cyber warfare as a security threat were extremely narrow to include at best espionage, hacking, or disruption and there was no discussion about the possibility to conduct pre-emptive or retaliatory cyber warfare.114 In fact, Stephane Abrial, commander of Allied Command Transformation (ACT) responsible for leading the Alliance's transformation of capabilities and forces, was against defining the Strategic Concept's notion of ‘in-depth cyberdefense' as a ‘military-only, or even a military-centric, strategy'. Instead, Abrial focuses on NATO's ‘permanent mission [which] involves countering the daily attempts made by hackers to break into our systems, which are by necessity interconnected, making a weakness in one country's systems a weakness in all'.115 Other key NATO officials, including General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continued to conceptualize cyber warfare in defensive terms, arguing that recent cyberattacks ‘... increased the urgency to strengthen cyber defences not only at NATO, but across the Alliance as a whole'. There is no public discourse involving NATO officials that suggests treating cyber capabilities as an offensive feature of the Alliance's cyber strategy. The most proactive proposal to date was the option to dispatch NATO's cyber Rapid Reaction Teams in order to assist member countries suffering from cyberattacks, or ‘incidents' as Rasmussen calls them, should they ask for such assistance.116 It appears that NATO is focused on prevention of attacks on its institutional assets and member countries rather than initiating cyberattacks against others. As the American representative to the CCDCOE concluded, when it comes to NATO, its major contribution to cyber defence will probably involve eroding the ‘... hacker's greatest advantages -- anonymity'. NATO's strategic thinking will continue to utilize its pooled capabilities in order to promote defensive solutions to cyber warfare of various kinds and it will continue to treat it as a threat rather than as an offensive feature to be proactively utilized.\n## Conclusions Cyber warfare has become the latest buzzword in security studies, but some analysts downplay its importance for both policymakers and military strategists, calling it a ‘distracting and nonsensical' term. Yet while other observers also treat it as a complimentary aspect of modern warfare, they nonetheless underline its unique features, as Lynn publicly did:“The cyberthreat does not involve the existential implications ushered in by the nuclear age, but there are important similarities. Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming US advantages in conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneous and exceedingly hard to trace.”\nThe article initially identified the conceptual factors that determine the offensive or defensive nature of certain military technologies. Then it adjusted these elements in order to fit the information age and its a-territorial nature. Instead of evaluating strategic orientation by traditional Offense-Defensive characteristics like mobility and firepower, the cyber Offense-Defense balance is better assessed for its technological versatility and byte power; the capacity to attack an enemy's assets on different levels (strategic, operative, and tactical), and the degree of destruction that can be inflicted on enemy assets at each of these levels.\nThe article then turned to evaluate the practical influence of cyber warfare on policy and behaviour. The American case, while perhaps being the less confrontational since there was no report of meaningful offensive American use of cyber capabilities against a foreign country or since the United States is able to avoid any direct attribution, was the most documented and comprehensive from an institutional/organizational perspective. The intellectual evolutionary process pursued by officials in the military and civil branches of government is still ongoing, and the United States is far from having a comprehensive cyber strategy. The creation of USCYBERCOM is a significant step, but it is certainly not enough since apparently there is still no highly structured and comprehensive ideational, institutional, and operational outline for American cyber warfare and cyber defence.\nThe case of China is similar in its ambiguity, but for different reasons. Unlike the United States, Beijing is rather secretive in treating its cyber posture just as it is generally reluctant to fully expose its military apparatus, causing American policymakers, military officials, and legislators to repeatedly criticize China's lack of transparency in matters related to its defence budget and the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s modernization. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that China not only has a very clear vision for its cyber posture as part of the country's wider military and technological modernization process, but it is also willing to use these capabilities in order to erode American military advantage. While Beijing is allegedly more interested in cyber espionage in order to obtain secret and up-to-date information about American capabilities and critical infrastructure, it will probably not shy away from using the same technology in order to curtail certain American assets, primarily non-combative ones (electric power plants etc.) and this may indicate that future Sino-American armed conflict will be augmented with vigorous cyber warfare.123 As a recent report submitted to Congress asserted, China's history of cyber warfare and its growing integration into the country's military strategy ‘suggests that the PLA may strike with Computer Network Operations (CNOs) and Electronic Warfare (EW) weapons in the opening phases of a conflict to degrade enemy information systems rather than attempt a traditional force-on-force attack directly where the PLA is at a disadvantage against more technologically advanced countries like the US'.124 The Russian case seemingly presents a better opportunity to observe the influence of cyber warfare on decisions of war and peace. From the empirical record it is evident that Russia explicitly used its cyber capabilities in both the Estonian and Georgian incidents, even if Moscow also used by-proxy entities for that purpose.125 The first incident was, of course, more of a diplomatic manoeuvre in order to curb Estonia's anti-Russian attitudes as the Kremlin perceived the matter. There was classical Soviet-era use of Russian ‘political activists' in order to encourage street unrest and orchestrated anti-government protests, but there was also the use of cyber warfare in order to paralyse then Estonian banking system and other key government agencies. Thus, one should treat this episode as an experiment in utilizing cyber capabilities in order to obtain certain political means. As the case of the Georgian war illustrated, this time cyber warfare was an integral, if not a decisive, part of the policymaking process and the military activities aimed at subduing the ‘defiant' Saakashvili administration. Clearly, the conventional dimension of the conflict was predominant, mainly due to the technological profile of Georgia's critical infrastructure, but the Russian use of cyberattacks hampered Georgian domestic vital communications between different branches of the government and completely prevented any Georgian IW counterattack.126 NATO's cyber posture reflects the Alliance's historical defensive raison d'être that was articulated during the Cold War and reaffirmed following its end. For NATO officials, cyber warfare relates primarily to attempts by foreign actors to penetrate the organization's computer and information networks in order to retrieve confidential data. They are deeply reluctant to widen their approach to define such attacks as a cause for triggering the collective security clause of the treaty. Hence when Estonia was under Russian cyberattack, the most that NATO was able to offer Tallinn was technical assistance in reactivating and protecting its ICT networks from future attacks. Furthermore, even amid the Albright Commission's call to devise and implement a comprehensive cyber strategy, the institutional response was minor and essentially focused on network protection rather than explicit cyber deterrence, let alone an offensive reorientation.\nCONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY The use of cyber capabilities makes a difference for policymakers since it allows them to minimize the risks of taking certain offensive actions and it is a relatively effective low-cost alternative, as the Israeli attack on Syria suggests, and it will become more common in the future. Cyber warfare, like all other forms of combat, is a political expression nonetheless in that there is a need for a conscious decision to apply it in order to achieve certain objectives. In the cases reviewed in this article, cyber capabilities were used selectively and in different intensities, as illustrated by the American reluctance to use pre-emptive cyber warfare against Libya. Hence future research should look at the way cyber warfare is prioritized over conventional/kinetic options in order to elucidate the conditions under which policymakers will prefer the former over the latter and vice versa. Furthermore, such studies should empirically appraise how integral cyber warfare has become at the strategic, operative, and tactical levels.\nOverall, cyber warfare is becoming an accepted military expedient since it allows leaders to achieve their political objectives with much less risk in the short term, even if in the long term it may actually lead to 'non-cyber' escalation.[127] Prussian strategist and military thinker Carl von Clausewitz wrote long ago that '... a prince or a general can best demonstrate his genius by managing a campaign exactly to suit his objectives and his resources, doing neither too much nor too little'.[128] Cyber warfare allows policymakers and the military to do exactly that, and with additional adjustments realism can help to better explain the process even if there is more work to be done in pursuit of this goal.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS An earlier version of this article was presented at the annual meeting of the Israeli Association for International Studies (IAIS), Herzliya, 25 December 2011.

This misses the larger possibilities for political/military chain reactions that cyber warfare may prompt, possibly leading to armed conflict. This article utilizes Offense-Defense theory to appraise the influence of cyber warfare on international security and the prospects for conflict. Offense-Defense theory, as applied here, better explains the relationship between technological innovation and international politics, and leads to different conclusions from other realist approaches. Redefining the Offense-Defense balance to accommodate cyberspace leads to an emphasis on the offensive advantages of cyber capabilities. The offensive and defensive cyber postures of China, Russia, the United States, and NATO are examined here to empirically assess the role of cyber warfare in security policy. Evidence shows that innovations in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) allow states to take greater risks and adopt more vigilant or offensive positions toward adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but make decisions to escalate easier and cheaper. A strategic enabler that provides attackers greater freedom of action, cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if it is not a sufficient one.\n## Introduction In September 2007, Israeli military cyber warriors reportedly hacked into the Syrian monitoring and anti-aircraft missile defences to allow Israeli fighter jets to bomb the suspected nuclear reactor near Deir el-Zor.¹ As described by one account: [T]he main attack was preceded by an engagement with a single Syrian radar site at Tall al-Abuad near the Turkish border. It was assaulted with what appears to be a combination of electronic attack and precision bombs to enable the Israeli force to enter and exit Syrian airspace. Almost immediately, the entire Syrian radar system went off the air for a period of time that included the raid.² This incident, along with others discussed here, suggests that we are in the course of a new era, similar to past transformations in international security, such as the airplane, the tank, or the nuclear bomb, innovations that culminated in radical departures in strategic thinking and behaviour. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) not only drives the internet, the iPhone, or the Global Positioning System (GPS). Nowadays, ICT has become an integral and possibly an essential military Contemporary Security Policy, Vol.34, No.1, 2013, pp.40-63 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2013.771031 © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis capability. The cyber sphere of action it created is replacing the conventional battlefield.3 Some observers argue that for realists cyber warfare is ‘old wine in a new bottle'; its added value is rather marginal.4 This downplays the broader implications of cyber warfare, stressing only technical aspects and focusing on information warfare (IW), one operative manifestation of cyber warfare, rather than the possibilities for political/military chain reaction that cyber warfare may prompt, ending in armed conflict.5 Consequently, this article is not concerned with specific cyber tactics like computer-based commercial espionage or phishing per se. Rather, this analysis stresses the integration of ICT applications aimed at disrupting, paralysing, and possibly destroying another state's assets, with a direct bearing on national security and critical infrastructure, and especially its capacity to conduct military operations.6 This article has two main objectives. First, despite the large number of studies dealing with cyber warfare, we are still lacking a realist theoretical conceptualization of its influence on international security in general and on the pervasiveness of war in particular.7 This analysis examines the relevance of realism as a technologically, rather than a territorially, based explanation for international security in the information age. Considering the fact that ‘[r]ealist theories... still provide a context and motivation for many of the most important theoretical debates in the field', as Jack Donnelly asserts, it is almost inconceivable that realism will not take a shot at explaining the dramatic technological shift in the security environment caused by cyber warfare.8 This article employs realist Offense-Defense theory to evaluate the expected effect of ICT on the prevalence of war, using the most suitable realist framework to explore the nexus between technological innovation and international politics, and especially questions of war and peace.9 In contrast to other scholars, who apply Offense-Defense theory to support cyber deterrence, this treatment stresses the need to dramatically modify Offense-Defense terminology to better address cyber warfare's unique and revolutionary features.10 Second, this article tests this Offense-Defense framework, empirically evaluating the role of cyber warfare in contemporary military strategic thinking and state behaviour. The evolving cyber postures of China, Russia, NATO, and the United States show to what extent cyber warfare concepts have gained traction among leaders, strategists, and military planners. Since we are dealing with ongoing technological developments, their policy implications far from determined, this study is more of a probe into a possible future rather than a final ruling. Nevertheless, from existing evidence it is possible to infer that ICT allows states to take greater risks and thus adopt more vigilant or offensive positions vis-à-vis their adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but their existence makes the decision to escalate armed conflict easier and considerably cheaper. ICT can be considered a strategic enabler and an efficient force multiplier that provides the attacker with greater freedom of action.\nThe article first, briefly, discusses the current status of Offense-Defense theory and suggests a fundamental conceptual amendment to allow realism to better incorporate cyber warfare into accounts of contemporary international security. It then proceeds to evaluate the cyber Offense-Defense balance to locate its strategic orientation. The cyber posture of four of the prominent actors in contemporary world affairs -- China, Russia, NATO, and the United States -- are examined in order to assess the effect of the cyber Offense-Defense balance on their security policies.\nIt is the conclusion of this article that for realism to maintain its relevance, it must transcend traditional territorial and kinetic traits of international security, or at least give more room for novel technological factors, and consider cyberspace as an alternative realm that states utilize to attack others. ICT and employment of cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if not a sufficient one, and realism must adjust its theoretical foundations and predictions accordingly. At a minimum, cyber warfare is an influential force multiplier or conflict enabler. At a maximum, it is a strategic game changer.11 But while the potential of cyber warfare to revolutionize international security and interstate conflict is dramatic, the scale of this transformation will be determined by political rather than technological considerations.\n## Cybernating Offense-Defense Theory Offense-Defense theory has generated heated debates ever since it was introduced by Robert Jervis and George Quester in the late 1970s.12 Jervis contended that the orientation of different military capabilities and weaponry systems may influence interstate security dilemmas and therefore the prevalence of war or peace. ‘When we say that the offense has the advantage, we simply mean that it is easier to destroy the other's army', he explains. ‘When the defense has the advantage, it is easier to protect and hold than it is to move forward, destroy and take.' Quester, applying the same logic, concluded that ‘likelihoods of war are thus clearly influenced by how effective the offensive weapon seems to be, as compared with the defensive'.13 Offense-Defense theory was heavily criticized for both its methodological foundation and empirical applicability.14 Thus, various attempts were made to salvage the theory and present an amended version that would bolster its standing as a leading realist theory.15 One of the most lethal criticisms had to do with the difficulty of differentiating between the offensive or defensive nature of military capabilities or technologies. In response, Charles Glaser and Chaim Kaufmann, for example, suggested that the Offense-Defense balance -- the driving engine of the theory -- should be considered as the ‘... ratio of the cost of the forces the attacker requires to take territory to the cost of the forces the defender has deployed'.16 Still, the traditional interpretation of Offense-Defense theory, as stipulated by both advocates and critics, is somewhat anachronistic and to some extent irrelevant to the information age. It presumes that war is conducted and concluded according to a kinetic basis and a territorial logic. Furthermore, the determinism of offensive and defensive capabilities, the security dilemma and armed conflict, is simplistic. It fosters a flawed ‘major war pathology' that does not necessarily exist today. One can plausibly imagine an armed conflict that is not necessarily aimed at unconditional surrender or territorial occupation, but tends to be much more limited, although it can turn into an all-out war of course, a kind of slippery slope interstate militarized dynamics.17 Second, and more importantly, since the conduct of contemporary warfare is dependent on ICT infrastructure, cyberspace becomes a contested domain in which cyberwar, or major technological conflicts, may take place or even be determined.18 As James Adams notes, ‘[a]round the world, information technology increasingly pervades weapons systems, defense infrastructures and national economies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new international battlefield'.19 Cyberwar may not solely determine the outcomes of future armed conflicts and interstate rivalries, but it can influence leaders' determination to prefer military options over political solutions. Since the early 1990s, policymakers have become deeply aware of ICT-based systems' vulnerability, their influence on states' national security posture, and the ability to conduct military operations.20 Former American Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn recently acknowledged that ICT > enables almost everything the US military does: logistical support and global command and control of forces, real-time provision of intelligence, and remote operations... The US government's digital infrastructure now gives the United States critical advantages over any adversary, but its reliance on computer networks also potentially enables adversaries to gain valuable intelligence about US capabilities and operations, to impede the United States' conventional military forces, and to disrupt the US economy.21 But is cyberspace defence or offence oriented? According to Lynn, the answer is straightforward: ‘In cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand'.22 This may be intuitively correct, and surely this position is shared by the vast majority of scholars and practitioners, but how can Offense-Defense theory provide a more founded answer to this question? This article suggests that Offense-Defense theory can effectively perform this task after updating its conceptual basis. Essentially, the balance between offence and defence is determined, in the traditional fashion, according to two key factors: mobility enhancement and firepower's degree of destructiveness.23 However, these determinants are not necessarily relevant to cyber warfare and thus must be redefined in order to address the technologically different security environment we are dealing with in the information age and the various expressions of cyber warfare.24 ### From Mobility to ‘Versatility' Unlike the customary kinetic and territorially based interpretation of the term mobility in Offense-Defense theory literature that relates to the possibility of relocating combatants at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,25 in cyberspace mobility actually relates to the capacity to technologically attack different types of ICT-based targets at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than thinking in terms of the physical allocation of armed forces across or between combat zones, in cyberwar we should talk of cyber versatility that corresponds to levels of war hierarchy.26 Strategic targets or critical infrastructures consist of vital or centre-of-gravity assets whose destruction may have a colossal effect on a state's national security and its capacity to operate normally.27 Such elements include a state's military constellations, defence industrial base, satellite communication, electrical power grid, internet connectivity, central banking system, stock market, ministries, and governmental agencies.28 On the operational level, where the focus is on related ICT-based systems, cyber warfare may foil the use of military and warning systems such as anti-aircraft missile systems, reconnaissance capabilities, or the hacking into an enemy's technological capabilities such as drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).29 On the tactical level, when the focus is on a particular and segmented ICT-based system, cyber warfare may interrupt battlefield communication and coordination, disrupt electronic signals such as radio and GPS signals, or eliminate them completely.30 ### From Firepower to ‘Byte Power' Unlike the customary territorially based interpretation of this feature in the Offense-Defense theory literature that primarily revolves around accuracy and destructiveness of certain weapons, in cyberspace firepower actually relates to the degree of technological damage that can be inflicted on the enemy's ICT-based infrastructure at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than talk of kinetic firepower, in cyber warfare the idea is to examine how much byte power a state can extract and direct towards an adversary's ICT-based targets.\nWhile the Offense-Defense theory literature typically maintains that the greater a weapon's firepower the greater its contribution to the defence,31 this assertion is challenged by prominent Offense-Defense theorists and it seems largely misguided in cyberspace. Glaser and Kaufman argue, for example, that ‘... there can be exceptions when specific firepower innovations are differentially useful against defender'.32 It seems that moving from the territorial and/or the kinetic to cyberspace allows such an exception, especially if we are dealing with highly accurate and low-signature cyber capabilities that allow the attacking and possible neutralization of an enemy's defence systems with virtual anonymity.33 Furthermore, and primarily as a complementary mechanism, selective or surgical cyberattacks may greatly improve the effectiveness of offensive conventional weapons by creating a cyber window of opportunity for conventional activities through which both combatants and equipment can penetrate more easily an otherwise unassailable target.34 To sum up this section, ICT-induced cyber capabilities tilt the Offense-Defense balance in favour of the offence, not in the prospects of gaining and maintaining control over territory and material resources as a manifestation of victory, but rather in the actual possibility to paralyse the enemy's military deployment and civilian preparedness and drastically limit its retaliatory potential. Since the use of cyber capabilities according to both indicators suggests that offence has the advantage, let us turn to evaluate the relevance of cyber warfare to the process of policymaking. For offence-dominant cyber capabilities to actually influence calculations and decisions in matters of war and peace, leaders and policymakers must be aware of these technologically advanced capabilities and acknowledge their strategic advantages. In the words of Keir Lieber, the influence of technological innovation ‘... is always filtered through the strategies that state decision makers employ in pursuit of their political goals. In simplest terms, politics -- more than technology -- is the master'.35 The aim is not, however, to meticulously describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures, i.e. the overall strategy designed to address different ICT-based challenges and threats by applying a multitude of proactive and passive measures. Rather, I present a succinct account to highlight key features and contemporary ramifications for war and peace. Given their offensive nature, the following section will try to assess whether the use of cyber capabilities actually prompted armed conflict, and under what conditions.\n## The Politics of Cyberwar and Peace Generally speaking, America, China, and Russia have long histories of attempting to combine political aims with advanced technology, while NATO primarily benefited from the American efforts. The Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), warmly adopted by the Americans in the late 1980s and successfully implemented during the Gulf War, was in fact an adaptation of the 1970s Soviet Military-Technical Revolution (MTR). As Elliot Cohen observes, the idea was to promote ‘... an imminent technical revolution that would give conventional weapons a level of effectiveness in the field comparable to that of small tactical nuclear weapons'.\nThe following accounts describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures to assess the influence of ICT-based capabilities on strategic thinking and behaviour. There is an important caveat to this analysis; cyber warfare suffers from a major problem of attributing attacks to specific state actors. Some of the cases discussed below include acts by non-state actors such as individuals, hacktivists, netizens, or more organized cyber militias and cyber gangs. Nevertheless, there is a growing consensus in the literature that these non-state actors mostly operate in tandem with national governments and follow their lead as proxies and their contribution should be considered an integral part of a state's overall cyber policy.\n### American Cyber Posture It seems that the most robust, sophisticated, and technically and institutionally up-to-date cyber posture is the American one, despite its paradoxical defensive nature. While the United States is the primary target for different forms of cyber warfare, especially cyber spying and phishing, it also possesses the highest potential to become a cyber superpower with the most vigorous state-run ICT-based posture. In the early 1990s, the Gulf War exhibited American technological superiority in terms of both hardware and software as countless stealth fighters bombarded Iraq without being detected by Iraqi anti-aircraft missile systems using state of the art precision-guided munitions (PGMs). American technological superiority was a decisive factor in defeating Iraq. As commander of US Central Command during the Gulf War, Norman Schwarzkopf argued that technological innovation worked ‘beyond our wildest expectations'.\nGiven America's growing reliance on ICT in the battlefield and in the supportive and logistical military formations, and repeated reports concerning a breach of computer networks such as in the case of the air force's Rome Air Development Center in March 1994, it became clear that this virtual Achilles heel must be protected. In 1995, the Clinton administration's national security strategy proclaimed that ‘the threat of intrusions to our military and commercial information systems poses a significant risk to national security and must be addressed'. In June 1997 the US government conducted Eligible Receiver, the very first information warfare (IW) exercise that exposed the vulnerability of American military and civilian critical infrastructures in case of a coordinated cyberattack.\nBut as American policymakers and strategists feared their vital technological structures, they also become increasingly interested in exploiting this new strategic domain in their favour. Indeed, while the Kosovo war was overwhelmingly won by conducting conventional massive air bombing against Serb targets, some observers asserted that the accuracy and efficiency of these aerial campaigns were the outcome of cyber warfare-like operations, especially in directing the bombers to their targets from the ground. Furthermore, while it is not exactly clear what additional cyber measures were used against Serb targets, it was reported that the United States and NATO conducted various sophisticated cyberattacks that included penetrations of Serbian ICT systems and overloading them with data or manipulating their databases. Hence the use of cyber capabilities at the operational level was not only disruptive in nature but also proactive and offensive in its attempt to frustrate Serbian defensive formation and retaliatory military options.\nDuring the War on Terror campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, cyber warfare did not play a significant role. In both cases, the United States had virtually no critical ICT assets to attack or disrupt and the focus was on traditional, if irregular, combat operations. Nevertheless, it was reported that a month before the Iraq War began, President Bush signed a secret directive ordering the development of an American strategy for large-scale pre-emptive cyberattacks against adversaries of the United States.\nIt was then reported that the United States was pre-emptively cutting off the Iraqi computer network and internet grid that connected civilian and government agencies before war began in March 2003. According to Richard Clarke, the Iraqi Defense Ministry's email system was hacked by the Americans in order to warn high-ranking officers about opposing the future invasion and to assure them that the objective was to overthrow Saddam Hussein and not to destroy Iraq's political, military, and socioeconomic structures. Another path that was explored but not pursued was hacking into the regime's financial institutions and foreign bank accounts in order to locate Saddam Hussein's hidden assets.\nAt about the same time, Chinese hackers apparently orchestrated a major cyberattack on American computer systems at NASA and Sandia National Laboratories. It was made clearer following these incidents and others that the United States must re-evaluate its cyber policy and possibly change its approach. Yet the discourse remained rather defensive, primarily focused on protecting American critical infrastructure and confidential databases. When George W. Bush published his administration's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003, its objective was ‘... to secure the portions of cyberspace that they own, operate, control, or with which they interact'. The military establishment, on the other hand, was much more assertive in its approach to cyber warfare, as the 2004 Military Strategy asserted: The Armed Forces must have the ability to operate across the air, land, sea, space and cyberspace domains of the battlespace... The non-linear nature of the current security environment requires multi-layered active and passive measures to counter numerous diverse conventional and asymmetric threats... They also include threats in cyberspace aimed at networks and data critical to US information-enabled systems. Such threats require a comprehensive concept of deterrence encompassing traditional adversaries, terrorist networks and rogue states able to employ any range of capabilities.52” The 2005 National Defense Strategy further proclaimed that alongside traditional and irregular security challenges the United States confronts, cyberwarfare may constitute a threat that under certain conditions “... can fundamentally alter long-established concepts of warfare. Some potential adversaries are seeking disruptive capabilities to exploit US vulnerabilities and offset the current advantages of the United States and its partners'.53 Consequently, the stated military applications of cyber capabilities were made more offensive than ever a year later when the 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations noted:“[T]he United States must have cyberspace superiority to ensure our freedom of action and deny the same to our adversaries through the integration of network defense, exploitation, and attack... Offensive capabilities in cyberspace offer the United States and our adversaries an opportunity to gain and maintain the initiative. DOD cyberspace operations are strongest when offensive and defensive capabilities are mutually supporting. This requires a long-range focus and dedicated resources to achieve this goal.54” The director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Keith Alexander, argued in 2007 that the United States should reformulate the operational and institutional foundations of its cyber posture in order to address the technologically induced security environment, since “while we have ample national level strategies, we have yet to translate these strategies into operational art through development of joint doctrine for cyberspace. Through the doctrine vetting process, we can develop a common understanding of what it means to conduct warfare within and through cyberspace.55” Indeed, in early 2008 President Bush issued a directive that allows American intelligence agencies, especially the NSA, to monitor all internet traffic of the federal government in order to protect vital assets from cyberattacks. What makes this directive a major turning point in American cyber warfare evolution is that under Bush's initiative, the NSA with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) could provide the Pentagon with evidence that a pre-emptive cyberattack is crucial in order to protect American critical infrastructure.56 In early 2009, soon after taking office, President Barack Obama announced his administration's cyber policy, which remained rather committed to the defensive notion of protecting and securing critical infrastructure in what was often referred to as cyber security.57 Yet in April it was reported that the White House was, in fact, in the final stages of establishing a new cyber agency under the Pentagon's authority which could develop offensive cyber weapons alongside defending American ICT critical infrastructure. Former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, was appointed as director of the Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and while he was rather cautious in attributing any offensive aspects to the new command, the Pentagon declared that the mission of this new agency was to:“[d]irect the operations and defence of specified Department of Defense information networks [involving some 90,000 military personnel] and prepare to, when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, [to] ensure US allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.”\nMore recently, it was reported that the Pentagon is formulating a particular strategy that will engage the threats emanating from cyber warfare under the premise that any such attack on behalf of a foreign country constitutes a declaration of war that may result in armed conflict. In effect, however, President Obama did not approve a pre-emptive cyber offensive against Libya before the United States led the military campaign against Muammar Qaddafi in March 2011. The idea was to use cyber warfare in order to hinder Libya's air defence systems, but the option was abandoned, according to some government officials, because the Obama administration feared it would act as a precedent for Russian or Chinese future offensive attacks. One Defense Department official said the cyber options ‘... were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya's air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn't pan out'. Another White House official argued that ‘[t]hese cybercapabilities are still like the Ferrari that you keep in the garage and only take out for the big race and not just for a run around town, unless nothing else can get you there'.\nIn the aftermath of the war in Libya, the White House attempted to provide the most comprehensive and inclusive cyber strategy to date. But despite the clear defensive tone of the document, especially when considering the ambiguity of the parts relating to cyber deterrence mechanisms, there was more than a hint of offensive reasoning:“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic -- as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.”\nThe debate concerning the defensive or offensive posture of American cyber strategy or its passive or proactive nature is still ongoing. Recently, General Robert Kehler, Commander of US Strategic Command that oversees CYBERCOM, commented that the optimal solution would involve both: ‘I think we are looking at what an offensive component would be: what does that look like? What kind of options would we want to be able to offer? I think that we have always said that there needs to be an offense and defense mix'. These questions remain unanswered.\n### Chinese Cyber Posture It is extremely difficult to fully account for the cyber posture of China and its development over the years. In China, defence-related transparency is a rare commodity. Yet it is widely known and established that the Chinese pursued a robust modernization in military technology and tactics from the late 1970s. Maoist ideology not only determined the political and societal structure of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its inception in 1949, it also served as China's military national defence strategy in that it revolved around the concept of ‘People's War' and the mobilization of the masses for a protracted armed conflict. After the death of Mao in 1976, and under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, a new conceptualization of Chinese warfare emerged that gradually became highly receptive to technological, industrial, and economic developments, making the entire defence apparatus much more open to engage the challenge of future armed conflict in the information age. From an operative vantage point, China gradually abandoned Mao's conception of active defence in favour of a pre-emptive military orientation that advocates a first strike mentality.\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, which strained Sino-American relations, highlighted historical anti-Western sentiments and created a shaky setting for the post-Cold War era. Consequently, by the mid 1990s China was caught paradoxically in an international constellation that was just as challenging as the Cold War international system. American intentions to redraw the global and regional landscape, and especially Washington's reactions to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, were badly received in Beijing. Consequently, the United States was increasingly considered to be a major source of danger to China's national interests and political order.\nAmerican military performance during the Gulf War highlighted the technological inferiority of the PLA and encouraged the Chinese leadership to accelerate and broaden existing plans to modernize and improve the army's capabilities for the purpose of potentially waging a limited or local war. Indeed, newly elected General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Jiang Zemin was confident that a comprehensive modernization of the Chinese armed forces amid what he considered American military superiority and interference in China's internal affairs was of great importance. Thus, he encouraged technological modernization according to American standards when he told members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in early 1993 that ‘[w]e must win high-tech, small-scale wars under modern conditions'. Similarly, the Chairman of the Commission on Science, Technology and National Defense Industry (COSTIND) General Ding Henggao warned that ‘[t]he one who possesses high-tech superiority will have the upper hand on the battlefield'.\nModernizing and increasing the professionalism of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was also matched with vigorous ICT-based innovation. As Major General Weng Pufang, former director of the Strategy Department of the Chinese Academy of Military Science, argued in a 1995 article he published in a Chinese military journal:“The thrust of China's military construction and development of weapons and equipment will no longer be toward strengthening the ‘firepower antipersonnel system' of the industrial age, but toward the strengthening of information technology, information weapons and information networking. Our sights must not be fixed on the firepower warfare of the industrial age, rather they must be trained on the information warfare of the information age.74” The PLA became highly interested in exploiting these technological innovations and restructured its ICT-based military units to comprise the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Department (GSD), currently entrusted with exploitation of foreign computer networks, whereas the Fourth Department of the GSD is responsible for attacking foreign computer networks.75 Indeed, after an agreement with Cuba was signed in February 1998, China built two cyber warfare stations, one eavesdropping telephone and internet communications in the United States and the other more concerned with monitoring American military satellite systems.76 But in addition to these military units, the Chinese government has reportedly outsourced some of its cyber warfare tasks to civilian groups that are systematically activated and thus enable greater international flexibility due to cyber warfare's attribution problem.77 In the early 2000s, Beijing was ostensibly involved in numerous successful attempts to hack into American databases and critical infrastructure such as nuclear and electric power plants, satellite systems, and a number of Department of Defense contractors that store confidential information and blueprints of future weapon systems.78 China also launched an ambitious anti-satellite weapons program aimed at levelling the odds against American espionage and to attack satellite systems that are perceived by Beijing as utterly anti-Chinese in nature.79 Hence, China's cyber posture is primarily a deterrent against American military superiority but it has deep and conscious long-term advantages that Beijing may cash in on in time of need. In fact, China's cyber posture will only benefit an offensive orientation compared with the current defensive traits of the American cyber posture if Beijing needs to prevent Washington from interfering in matters related to Taiwan, for example.80 China's 2000 Defense White Paper explicitly adhered to this transformative phase of the PLA's posture into an ICT-based modernized army:“Faced with the world's military developments and the characteristics of modern warfare, the Chinese armed forces will, in the course of modernizing their weaponry, devote themselves to transforming semi-mechanized and mechanized weapon systems to automatized and informationized systems as soon as possible, so that they can possess weapons as advanced as possible and assure the accomplishment of the sacred missions assigned to them by the nation.81” A report submitted to the American Congress in 2007 argued that China not only possesses the cyber capabilities required to conduct comprehensive offensive cyberattacks against the United States: ‘In 2005, the PLA began to incorporate offensive CYBER POSTURING AND THE OFFENSE-DEFENSE BALANCE Computer Network Operations (CNOs) into its exercises, primarily in first strikes against enemy networks'. Indeed, China's 2008 Defense White Paper proclaimed in the sections dealing with the technological dimensions of modern warfare that China is accelerating reform and innovation in its defense-related science, technology and industry... Defense-related science, technology and industry are striving to enhance the informationization of weaponry and equipment design and development, and to render product design more digitalized, modularized, standardized and reliable.[83] In sum, the Chinese consider cyber warfare and its auxiliary elements as a power multiplier, integral to their national security strategy. Thus far, China has refrained from presenting a comprehensive cyber strategy but in practice it has primarily involved strategic and tactical hacking into American and other Western countries' databases and internet systems for reasons of technological and operative military espionage. While there were numerous indications of China's involvement in penetrating critical ICT-based infrastructure in the United States, Beijing has not used its existing cyber assets thus far to directly attack American strategic military assets in order to neutralize them but instead has focused on cyber spying. This pattern may change under certain conditions, especially if Beijing wishes to diversify its policy alternatives in case of a Sino-American confrontation.[84] ## Russian Cyber Posture Whereas in the two previous cases the strategizing of ICT as military capabilities was ambiguous at best, and there was certainly no actual use of cyber warfare as part of armed conflict, the case of Russia in the first decade of the 21st century can be easily dubbed as an exemplary case for the opposite. To begin with, during most of the 1990s Russia was grappling with the devastating economic, social, and political effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign and defence policy was primarily focused on '... disarmament and limitation of the arms race - in terms of releasing as many resources as possible and creating the most favorable conditions for the implementation of our socioeconomic reforms'.[85] In December 1994, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signalled his intention to alter Russia's foreign and defence orientation when he decided to invade Chechnya, a conflict that '... demonstrated the full extent of the armed forces' decline. In virtually every respect, the Russian military failed the challenge it was supposed to easily master'.[86] By 1996, in face of failure in Chechnya and growing domestic opposition, Yeltsin moved to replace the moderate and pro-Western Kozyrev with Yevgeny Primakov who also served as Prime Minister between September 1998 and May 1999. Indicatively, in his first press conference Primakov asserted that 'Russia was and remains a great power. Her foreign policy should correspond to that status'.[87] The weaknesses of Russia's conventional and non-conventional military postures led many Russian military thinkers and officials to regard ICT-based capabilities as a way to compensate for strategic inferiority. During the mid 1990s, the Russian Army CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY and Defense Ministry began seriously examining the nexus between technology and the regular military structure.⁸⁸ Russia was openly using IW during the second Chechen war.⁸⁹ The first major indication of coordinated Russian cyber warfare (in addition to IW) took place in Estonia in 2007, after a monument commemorating the Red Army’s re-conquest of Estonia during the Second World War was moved despite the Kremlin’s explicit warning.⁹⁰ Rather than exclusively resorting to military force in order to resolve what Moscow considered explicit anti-Russian reactionary sentiments and policies, as they did during the Chechen military campaigns in 1994 and 1999 for example, this time Moscow pursued a much more sophisticated approach that included inducing political riots in Estonia and targeting Estonia’s ICT infrastructure such as the banking sector, parliament’s website and email system, emergency phone lines, hospitals, and universities.⁹¹ During a period of several weeks in May 2007, after the statue was relocated, official Estonian governmental websites and vital telecommunications infrastructure were attacked and rendered inactive, according to most accounts, by Russian perpetrators.⁹² Russian policymakers began to appreciate the role of ICT and cyber warfare as an auxiliary instrument of coercion and statecraft against what they considered uncooperative regimes in the post-Soviet rim. And the lessons learned during the Estonian affair were apparently applied as part of Russia’s involvement in the Georgian war in August 2008.⁹³ Essentially, in response to Georgia’s attack against South Ossetia, Russian forces invaded Georgia and practically subdued it within a matter of days. Yet even before the first bullet was fired, the Kremlin decided to employ a preemptive strategic disruptive cyber attack.⁹⁴ In mid July, several cyberattacks were waged against Georgian websites and two weeks later a second wave of cyberattacks on Georgian targets was detected. A few days into the war, the vast majority of Georgian government websites were not functioning; in effect, the Georgian government was, as one study asserted, ‘cyber-locked’, without viable access to the internet and to its state-run agencies including the National Bank of Georgia.⁹⁵ No less important, the Georgian government was unable to communicate with the citizens or conduct its own retaliatory IW against Russia.⁹⁶ Fortunately for Georgia, and unlike in the Estonian case, critical infrastructure such as the electrical power grid is far less modernized and consequently more difficult to damage by using ICT-based capabilities.⁹⁷ In February 2010, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev approved the new Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation where some key references to the use of cyber warfare as an instrumental offensive military capability can be clearly observed. For example, when dealing with the features of modern military conflicts, the document states that such one trait, from Russia’s perspective, is the ‘... early conduct [of] information warfare activities to achieve political objectives without the use of military force, and subsequently – in the interest of creating a favorable reaction of the international community – to use military force’. And when referring to Russian future acquisition plans for the armed forces, the doctrine highlights that a key task involves the ‘... development of the forces and means of information warfare’.⁹⁸ In early 2012 the Russian Ministry of Defense revealed the Kremlin's cyber strategy under the title Conceptual Views Regarding the Activity of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space. It refrains from referring to offensive cyber warfare, but it does address issues pertaining to control, prevention, and solution of cyber conflicts. The document acknowledges the right of Russia to employ counteroffensive cyber warfare: ‘The escalation of a conflict in the cyber-space and its turn into a crisis gives the right to an individual or collective self-defense and the use of any means necessary that do not contradict the universally accepted norms and the principles of international law'. Based on Russia's past behaviour and the recent proclamation of its cyber strategy, it appears that Moscow may be more than willing to use different forms of cyber warfare should political needs emerge.\n### NATO Cyber Posture Thus far, our empirical description has exclusively focused on state actors, but since NATO plays such a major role in the contemporary security environment it seems that examining the way it relates to cyber warfare will present a more accurate account for our purposes. Interestingly enough, despite NATO's transparency on the whole, there is very little access to the more operational and sometimes technical aspects of the Alliance's cyber strategy. Nevertheless, from the available materials we can identify NATO's defensive approach to cyber warfare and cyber security.\nOriginally, NATO was not only established to address the Soviet threat in Europe. Lord Ismay, NATO's first Secretary General, contended that its objectives were to keep ‘the Russians out, the Germans down, and the Americans in'. After the Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, NATO had to reinvent itself and identify new objectives in order to preserve its relevance and mere existence. The multiplicity of political and military goals combined with the willingness of its member states enabled NATO to successfully overcome this transitional period and undergo a process of remarkable institutional change that resulted in a renewed transatlantic mandate to develop new mechanisms and strategies in order to cope with the changing security environment.\nThe treatment of cyber warfare as part of NATO's evolving security concerns became decidedly evident in the early 2000s. Unlike the United States, China, or Russia, who were individually concerned with cyber warfare of various kinds and for different reasons as described earlier, throughout the 1990s NATO was primarily focused on its internal restructuring, the expansion eastwards to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and, of course, militarily operating in the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia.\nThe 1999 Strategic Concept declared that ‘[s]tate and non-state adversaries may try to exploit the Alliance's growing reliance on information systems through information operations designed to disrupt such systems. They may attempt to use strategies of this kind to counter NATO's superiority in traditional weaponry'. Yet the first explicit reference to cyber warfare was actually made in November 2002 during NATO's Prague summit, when it was declared that the member countries decided to ‘... strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber attacks'. One operative outcome was the establishment of NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which was charged with the task of protecting ICT infrastructure and networks from unauthorized intrusion for espionage purposes or attempts to infect them with viruses. But this was a rather technical organ lacking any long-term military planning capacity, a feature that did not change significantly even following NATO's summit in Riga in November 2006 which further called for developing cyber-deterrence capabilities and doctrines. Russian cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 explicated NATO's military, infrastructural, and political weaknesses in the face of this new form of security threat, but the response as articulated by NATO's defence ministers was remarkably protective, arguing that ‘[u]rgent work is needed to enhance the ability to protect information systems of critical importance'.\nIn early 2008 it was reported that NATO officials further debated the need to protect the Alliance's assets against future cyberattacks, claiming that ‘[c]yber defence is now mentioned at the highest level along with missile defence and energy security'. While the attacks against Estonia did not result in the application of the collective security clause of the treaty, it did trigger a prompt institutional response. In January the Policy on Cyber Defence was presented and approved. During the Bucharest summit in April, the Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA) and the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) were established. Whereas the CDMA was entrusted with overseeing NATO's cyber defence efforts and providing guidance and assistance to the member countries in case of cyber-related crises, the CCDCOE, located in Estonia, was designed ‘... to enhance the capability, cooperation and information sharing among NATO, NATO nations and partners in cyber defence by virtue of education, research and development, lessons learned and consultation'.\nBoth agencies represent a highly defensive reaction to NATO's security challenges involving cyber warfare. As the Bucharest summit declaration proclaimed, the official cyber policy ‘... emphasizes the need for NATO and nations to protect key information systems in accordance with their respective responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack'. Yet Russia's continued use of cyber warfare during the war in Georgia highlighted its escalatory nature and the possible negative implications on conventional military conflicts. In April 2009, as part of the Declaration on Alliance Security, NATO moved further to identify cyberattacks alongside terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as the key global threats to member states and the international community.\nBut the major breakthrough in NATO strategic thinking regarding cyber warfare, which went beyond the strictly technical aspect of network protection, occurred during mid 2010. A team of leading experts in matters of security, headed by former American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, was asked to prepare a preliminary report to be used as a basis for NATO's new Strategic Concept. According to this report, entitled NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement and submitted in May: The next significant attack on the Alliance may well come down a fibre [sic] optic cable. Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern. However, the risk of a large-scale attack on NATO's command and control systems or energy grids could readily warrant consultations under Article 4 and could possibly lead to collective defence measures under Article 5. Effective cyber defence requires the means to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from attacks.111” Still, the recommendations reflected the defensive posture that was already advocated and implemented thus far by NATO. Furthermore, and extremely relevant to the Alliance's strategic planners, the Albright Commission was reluctant to engage the question of whether cyberattacks against NATO member states would constitute a direct act of aggression that would trigger the collective security clause. Instead, it defined a rather ambiguous principle according to which such a decision must be made considering ‘... the nature, source, scope, and other aspects of the particular security challenge'.112 The same defensive reasoning can be observed in the ensuing final version of the Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon summit six months later. In the words of the document, NATO will: “develop further our ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyberattacks, including by using the NATO planning process to enhance and coordinate national cyber-defence capabilities, bringing all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection, and better integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and response with member nations.113” Yet again, the numerous references to cyber warfare as a security threat were extremely narrow to include at best espionage, hacking, or disruption and there was no discussion about the possibility to conduct pre-emptive or retaliatory cyber warfare.114 In fact, Stephane Abrial, commander of Allied Command Transformation (ACT) responsible for leading the Alliance's transformation of capabilities and forces, was against defining the Strategic Concept's notion of ‘in-depth cyberdefense' as a ‘military-only, or even a military-centric, strategy'. Instead, Abrial focuses on NATO's ‘permanent mission [which] involves countering the daily attempts made by hackers to break into our systems, which are by necessity interconnected, making a weakness in one country's systems a weakness in all'.115 Other key NATO officials, including General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continued to conceptualize cyber warfare in defensive terms, arguing that recent cyberattacks ‘... increased the urgency to strengthen cyber defences not only at NATO, but across the Alliance as a whole'. There is no public discourse involving NATO officials that suggests treating cyber capabilities as an offensive feature of the Alliance's cyber strategy. The most proactive proposal to date was the option to dispatch NATO's cyber Rapid Reaction Teams in order to assist member countries suffering from cyberattacks, or ‘incidents' as Rasmussen calls them, should they ask for such assistance.116 It appears that NATO is focused on prevention of attacks on its institutional assets and member countries rather than initiating cyberattacks against others. As the American representative to the CCDCOE concluded, when it comes to NATO, its major contribution to cyber defence will probably involve eroding the ‘... hacker's greatest advantages -- anonymity'. NATO's strategic thinking will continue to utilize its pooled capabilities in order to promote defensive solutions to cyber warfare of various kinds and it will continue to treat it as a threat rather than as an offensive feature to be proactively utilized.\n## Conclusions Cyber warfare has become the latest buzzword in security studies, but some analysts downplay its importance for both policymakers and military strategists, calling it a ‘distracting and nonsensical' term. Yet while other observers also treat it as a complimentary aspect of modern warfare, they nonetheless underline its unique features, as Lynn publicly did:“The cyberthreat does not involve the existential implications ushered in by the nuclear age, but there are important similarities. Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming US advantages in conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneous and exceedingly hard to trace.”\nThe article initially identified the conceptual factors that determine the offensive or defensive nature of certain military technologies. Then it adjusted these elements in order to fit the information age and its a-territorial nature. Instead of evaluating strategic orientation by traditional Offense-Defensive characteristics like mobility and firepower, the cyber Offense-Defense balance is better assessed for its technological versatility and byte power; the capacity to attack an enemy's assets on different levels (strategic, operative, and tactical), and the degree of destruction that can be inflicted on enemy assets at each of these levels.\nThe article then turned to evaluate the practical influence of cyber warfare on policy and behaviour. The American case, while perhaps being the less confrontational since there was no report of meaningful offensive American use of cyber capabilities against a foreign country or since the United States is able to avoid any direct attribution, was the most documented and comprehensive from an institutional/organizational perspective. The intellectual evolutionary process pursued by officials in the military and civil branches of government is still ongoing, and the United States is far from having a comprehensive cyber strategy. The creation of USCYBERCOM is a significant step, but it is certainly not enough since apparently there is still no highly structured and comprehensive ideational, institutional, and operational outline for American cyber warfare and cyber defence.\nThe case of China is similar in its ambiguity, but for different reasons. Unlike the United States, Beijing is rather secretive in treating its cyber posture just as it is generally reluctant to fully expose its military apparatus, causing American policymakers, military officials, and legislators to repeatedly criticize China's lack of transparency in matters related to its defence budget and the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s modernization. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that China not only has a very clear vision for its cyber posture as part of the country's wider military and technological modernization process, but it is also willing to use these capabilities in order to erode American military advantage. While Beijing is allegedly more interested in cyber espionage in order to obtain secret and up-to-date information about American capabilities and critical infrastructure, it will probably not shy away from using the same technology in order to curtail certain American assets, primarily non-combative ones (electric power plants etc.) and this may indicate that future Sino-American armed conflict will be augmented with vigorous cyber warfare.123 As a recent report submitted to Congress asserted, China's history of cyber warfare and its growing integration into the country's military strategy ‘suggests that the PLA may strike with Computer Network Operations (CNOs) and Electronic Warfare (EW) weapons in the opening phases of a conflict to degrade enemy information systems rather than attempt a traditional force-on-force attack directly where the PLA is at a disadvantage against more technologically advanced countries like the US'.124 The Russian case seemingly presents a better opportunity to observe the influence of cyber warfare on decisions of war and peace. From the empirical record it is evident that Russia explicitly used its cyber capabilities in both the Estonian and Georgian incidents, even if Moscow also used by-proxy entities for that purpose.125 The first incident was, of course, more of a diplomatic manoeuvre in order to curb Estonia's anti-Russian attitudes as the Kremlin perceived the matter. There was classical Soviet-era use of Russian ‘political activists' in order to encourage street unrest and orchestrated anti-government protests, but there was also the use of cyber warfare in order to paralyse then Estonian banking system and other key government agencies. Thus, one should treat this episode as an experiment in utilizing cyber capabilities in order to obtain certain political means. As the case of the Georgian war illustrated, this time cyber warfare was an integral, if not a decisive, part of the policymaking process and the military activities aimed at subduing the ‘defiant' Saakashvili administration. Clearly, the conventional dimension of the conflict was predominant, mainly due to the technological profile of Georgia's critical infrastructure, but the Russian use of cyberattacks hampered Georgian domestic vital communications between different branches of the government and completely prevented any Georgian IW counterattack.126 NATO's cyber posture reflects the Alliance's historical defensive raison d'être that was articulated during the Cold War and reaffirmed following its end. For NATO officials, cyber warfare relates primarily to attempts by foreign actors to penetrate the organization's computer and information networks in order to retrieve confidential data. They are deeply reluctant to widen their approach to define such attacks as a cause for triggering the collective security clause of the treaty. Hence when Estonia was under Russian cyberattack, the most that NATO was able to offer Tallinn was technical assistance in reactivating and protecting its ICT networks from future attacks. Furthermore, even amid the Albright Commission's call to devise and implement a comprehensive cyber strategy, the institutional response was minor and essentially focused on network protection rather than explicit cyber deterrence, let alone an offensive reorientation.\nCONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY The use of cyber capabilities makes a difference for policymakers since it allows them to minimize the risks of taking certain offensive actions and it is a relatively effective low-cost alternative, as the Israeli attack on Syria suggests, and it will become more common in the future. Cyber warfare, like all other forms of combat, is a political expression nonetheless in that there is a need for a conscious decision to apply it in order to achieve certain objectives. In the cases reviewed in this article, cyber capabilities were used selectively and in different intensities, as illustrated by the American reluctance to use pre-emptive cyber warfare against Libya. Hence future research should look at the way cyber warfare is prioritized over conventional/kinetic options in order to elucidate the conditions under which policymakers will prefer the former over the latter and vice versa. Furthermore, such studies should empirically appraise how integral cyber warfare has become at the strategic, operative, and tactical levels.\nOverall, cyber warfare is becoming an accepted military expedient since it allows leaders to achieve their political objectives with much less risk in the short term, even if in the long term it may actually lead to 'non-cyber' escalation.[127] Prussian strategist and military thinker Carl von Clausewitz wrote long ago that '... a prince or a general can best demonstrate his genius by managing a campaign exactly to suit his objectives and his resources, doing neither too much nor too little'.[128] Cyber warfare allows policymakers and the military to do exactly that, and with additional adjustments realism can help to better explain the process even if there is more work to be done in pursuit of this goal.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS An earlier version of this article was presented at the annual meeting of the Israeli Association for International Studies (IAIS), Herzliya, 25 December 2011.

This misses the larger possibilities for political/military chain reactions that cyber warfare may prompt, possibly leading to armed conflict. This article utilizes Offense-Defense theory to appraise the influence of cyber warfare on international security and the prospects for conflict. Offense-Defense theory, as applied here, better explains the relationship between technological innovation and international politics, and leads to different conclusions from other realist approaches. Redefining the Offense-Defense balance to accommodate cyberspace leads to an emphasis on the offensive advantages of cyber capabilities. The offensive and defensive cyber postures of China, Russia, the United States, and NATO are examined here to empirically assess the role of cyber warfare in security policy. Evidence shows that innovations in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) allow states to take greater risks and adopt more vigilant or offensive positions toward adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but make decisions to escalate easier and cheaper. A strategic enabler that provides attackers greater freedom of action, cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if it is not a sufficient one.\n## Introduction\nIn September 2007, Israeli military cyber warriors reportedly hacked into the Syrian monitoring and anti-aircraft missile defences to allow Israeli fighter jets to bomb the suspected nuclear reactor near Deir el-Zor.¹ As described by one account:\n[T]he main attack was preceded by an engagement with a single Syrian radar site at Tall al-Abuad near the Turkish border. It was assaulted with what appears to be a combination of electronic attack and precision bombs to enable the Israeli force to enter and exit Syrian airspace. Almost immediately, the entire Syrian radar system went off the air for a period of time that included the raid.²\nThis incident, along with others discussed here, suggests that we are in the course of a new era, similar to past transformations in international security, such as the airplane, the tank, or the nuclear bomb, innovations that culminated in radical departures in strategic thinking and behaviour. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) not only drives the internet, the iPhone, or the Global Positioning System (GPS). Nowadays, ICT has become an integral and possibly an essential military\nContemporary Security Policy, Vol.34, No.1, 2013, pp.40-63\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2013.771031 © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis\ncapability. The cyber sphere of action it created is replacing the conventional battlefield.3\nSome observers argue that for realists cyber warfare is ‘old wine in a new bottle'; its added value is rather marginal.4 This downplays the broader implications of cyber warfare, stressing only technical aspects and focusing on information warfare (IW), one operative manifestation of cyber warfare, rather than the possibilities for political/military chain reaction that cyber warfare may prompt, ending in armed conflict.5 Consequently, this article is not concerned with specific cyber tactics like computer-based commercial espionage or phishing per se. Rather, this analysis stresses the integration of ICT applications aimed at disrupting, paralysing, and possibly destroying another state's assets, with a direct bearing on national security and critical infrastructure, and especially its capacity to conduct military operations.6\nThis article has two main objectives. First, despite the large number of studies dealing with cyber warfare, we are still lacking a realist theoretical conceptualization of its influence on international security in general and on the pervasiveness of war in particular.7 This analysis examines the relevance of realism as a technologically, rather than a territorially, based explanation for international security in the information age. Considering the fact that ‘[r]ealist theories ... still provide a context and motivation for many of the most important theoretical debates in the field', as Jack Donnelly asserts, it is almost inconceivable that realism will not take a shot at explaining the dramatic technological shift in the security environment caused by cyber warfare.8 This article employs realist Offense-Defense theory to evaluate the expected effect of ICT on the prevalence of war, using the most suitable realist framework to explore the nexus between technological innovation and international politics, and especially questions of war and peace.9 In contrast to other scholars, who apply Offense-Defense theory to support cyber deterrence, this treatment stresses the need to dramatically modify Offense-Defense terminology to better address cyber warfare's unique and revolutionary features.10\nSecond, this article tests this Offense-Defense framework, empirically evaluating the role of cyber warfare in contemporary military strategic thinking and state behaviour. The evolving cyber postures of China, Russia, NATO, and the United States show to what extent cyber warfare concepts have gained traction among leaders, strategists, and military planners. Since we are dealing with ongoing technological developments, their policy implications far from determined, this study is more of a probe into a possible future rather than a final ruling. Nevertheless, from existing evidence it is possible to infer that ICT allows states to take greater risks and thus adopt more vigilant or offensive positions vis-à-vis their adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but their existence makes the decision to escalate armed conflict easier and considerably cheaper. ICT can be considered a strategic enabler and an efficient force multiplier that provides the attacker with greater freedom of action.\nThe article first, briefly, discusses the current status of Offense-Defense theory and suggests a fundamental conceptual amendment to allow realism to better incorporate cyber warfare into accounts of contemporary international security. It then proceeds to evaluate the cyber Offense-Defense balance to locate its strategic orientation. The cyber posture of four of the prominent actors in contemporary world\naffairs -- China, Russia, NATO, and the United States -- are examined in order to assess the effect of the cyber Offense-Defense balance on their security policies.\nIt is the conclusion of this article that for realism to maintain its relevance, it must transcend traditional territorial and kinetic traits of international security, or at least give more room for novel technological factors, and consider cyberspace as an alternative realm that states utilize to attack others. ICT and employment of cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if not a sufficient one, and realism must adjust its theoretical foundations and predictions accordingly. At a minimum, cyber warfare is an influential force multiplier or conflict enabler. At a maximum, it is a strategic game changer.11 But while the potential of cyber warfare to revolutionize international security and interstate conflict is dramatic, the scale of this transformation will be determined by political rather than technological considerations.\n## Cybernating Offense-Defense Theory\nOffense-Defense theory has generated heated debates ever since it was introduced by Robert Jervis and George Quester in the late 1970s.12 Jervis contended that the orientation of different military capabilities and weaponry systems may influence interstate security dilemmas and therefore the prevalence of war or peace. ‘When we say that the offense has the advantage, we simply mean that it is easier to destroy the other's army', he explains. ‘When the defense has the advantage, it is easier to protect and hold than it is to move forward, destroy and take.' Quester, applying the same logic, concluded that ‘likelihoods of war are thus clearly influenced by how effective the offensive weapon seems to be, as compared with the defensive'.13\nOffense-Defense theory was heavily criticized for both its methodological foundation and empirical applicability.14 Thus, various attempts were made to salvage the theory and present an amended version that would bolster its standing as a leading realist theory.15 One of the most lethal criticisms had to do with the difficulty of differentiating between the offensive or defensive nature of military capabilities or technologies. In response, Charles Glaser and Chaim Kaufmann, for example, suggested that the Offense-Defense balance -- the driving engine of the theory -- should be considered as the ‘... ratio of the cost of the forces the attacker requires to take territory to the cost of the forces the defender has deployed'.16\nStill, the traditional interpretation of Offense-Defense theory, as stipulated by both advocates and critics, is somewhat anachronistic and to some extent irrelevant to the information age. It presumes that war is conducted and concluded according to a kinetic basis and a territorial logic. Furthermore, the determinism of offensive and defensive capabilities, the security dilemma and armed conflict, is simplistic. It fosters a flawed ‘major war pathology' that does not necessarily exist today. One can plausibly imagine an armed conflict that is not necessarily aimed at unconditional surrender or territorial occupation, but tends to be much more limited, although it can turn into an all-out war of course, a kind of slippery slope interstate militarized dynamics.17 Second, and more importantly, since the conduct of contemporary warfare is dependent on ICT infrastructure, cyberspace becomes a contested\ndomain in which cyberwar, or major technological conflicts, may take place or even be determined.18 As James Adams notes, ‘[a]round the world, information technology increasingly pervades weapons systems, defense infrastructures and national economies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new international battlefield'.19\nCyberwar may not solely determine the outcomes of future armed conflicts and interstate rivalries, but it can influence leaders' determination to prefer military options over political solutions. Since the early 1990s, policymakers have become deeply aware of ICT-based systems' vulnerability, their influence on states' national security posture, and the ability to conduct military operations.20 Former American Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn recently acknowledged that ICT\n> enables almost everything the US military does: logistical support and global command and control of forces, real-time provision of intelligence, and remote operations ... The US government's digital infrastructure now gives the United States critical advantages over any adversary, but its reliance on computer networks also potentially enables adversaries to gain valuable intelligence about US capabilities and operations, to impede the United States' conventional military forces, and to disrupt the US economy.21\nBut is cyberspace defence or offence oriented? According to Lynn, the answer is straightforward: ‘In cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand'.22 This may be intuitively correct, and surely this position is shared by the vast majority of scholars and practitioners, but how can Offense-Defense theory provide a more founded answer to this question? This article suggests that Offense-Defense theory can effectively perform this task after updating its conceptual basis. Essentially, the balance between offence and defence is determined, in the traditional fashion, according to two key factors: mobility enhancement and firepower's degree of destructiveness.23 However, these determinants are not necessarily relevant to cyber warfare and thus must be redefined in order to address the technologically different security environment we are dealing with in the information age and the various expressions of cyber warfare.24\n### From Mobility to ‘Versatility'\nUnlike the customary kinetic and territorially based interpretation of the term mobility in Offense-Defense theory literature that relates to the possibility of relocating combatants at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,25 in cyberspace mobility actually relates to the capacity to technologically attack different types of ICT-based targets at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than thinking in terms of the physical allocation of armed forces across or between combat zones, in cyberwar we should talk of cyber versatility that corresponds to levels of war hierarchy.26\nStrategic targets or critical infrastructures consist of vital or centre-of-gravity assets whose destruction may have a colossal effect on a state's national security and its capacity to operate normally.27 Such elements include a state's military constellations, defence industrial base, satellite communication, electrical power grid, internet connectivity, central banking system, stock market, ministries, and\ngovernmental agencies.28 On the operational level, where the focus is on related ICT-based systems, cyber warfare may foil the use of military and warning systems such as anti-aircraft missile systems, reconnaissance capabilities, or the hacking into an enemy's technological capabilities such as drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).29 On the tactical level, when the focus is on a particular and segmented ICT-based system, cyber warfare may interrupt battlefield communication and coordination, disrupt electronic signals such as radio and GPS signals, or eliminate them completely.30\n### From Firepower to ‘Byte Power'\nUnlike the customary territorially based interpretation of this feature in the Offense-Defense theory literature that primarily revolves around accuracy and destructiveness of certain weapons, in cyberspace firepower actually relates to the degree of technological damage that can be inflicted on the enemy's ICT-based infrastructure at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than talk of kinetic firepower, in cyber warfare the idea is to examine how much byte power a state can extract and direct towards an adversary's ICT-based targets.\nWhile the Offense-Defense theory literature typically maintains that the greater a weapon's firepower the greater its contribution to the defence,31 this assertion is challenged by prominent Offense-Defense theorists and it seems largely misguided in cyberspace. Glaser and Kaufman argue, for example, that ‘... there can be exceptions when specific firepower innovations are differentially useful against defender'.32 It seems that moving from the territorial and/or the kinetic to cyberspace allows such an exception, especially if we are dealing with highly accurate and low-signature cyber capabilities that allow the attacking and possible neutralization of an enemy's defence systems with virtual anonymity.33 Furthermore, and primarily as a complementary mechanism, selective or surgical cyberattacks may greatly improve the effectiveness of offensive conventional weapons by creating a cyber window of opportunity for conventional activities through which both combatants and equipment can penetrate more easily an otherwise unassailable target.34\nTo sum up this section, ICT-induced cyber capabilities tilt the Offense-Defense balance in favour of the offence, not in the prospects of gaining and maintaining control over territory and material resources as a manifestation of victory, but rather in the actual possibility to paralyse the enemy's military deployment and civilian preparedness and drastically limit its retaliatory potential. Since the use of cyber capabilities according to both indicators suggests that offence has the advantage, let us turn to evaluate the relevance of cyber warfare to the process of policymaking. For offence-dominant cyber capabilities to actually influence calculations and decisions in matters of war and peace, leaders and policymakers must be aware of these technologically advanced capabilities and acknowledge their strategic advantages. In the words of Keir Lieber, the influence of technological innovation ‘... is always filtered through the strategies that state decision makers employ in pursuit of their political goals. In simplest terms, politics -- more than technology -- is the master'.35\nThe aim is not, however, to meticulously describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures, i.e. the overall strategy designed to\naddress different ICT-based challenges and threats by applying a multitude of proactive and passive measures. Rather, I present a succinct account to highlight key features and contemporary ramifications for war and peace. Given their offensive nature, the following section will try to assess whether the use of cyber capabilities actually prompted armed conflict, and under what conditions.\n## The Politics of Cyberwar and Peace\nGenerally speaking, America, China, and Russia have long histories of attempting to combine political aims with advanced technology, while NATO primarily benefited from the American efforts. The Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), warmly adopted by the Americans in the late 1980s and successfully implemented during the Gulf War, was in fact an adaptation of the 1970s Soviet Military-Technical Revolution (MTR). As Elliot Cohen observes, the idea was to promote ‘... an imminent technical revolution that would give conventional weapons a level of effectiveness in the field comparable to that of small tactical nuclear weapons'.\nThe following accounts describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures to assess the influence of ICT-based capabilities on strategic thinking and behaviour. There is an important caveat to this analysis; cyber warfare suffers from a major problem of attributing attacks to specific state actors. Some of the cases discussed below include acts by non-state actors such as individuals, hacktivists, netizens, or more organized cyber militias and cyber gangs. Nevertheless, there is a growing consensus in the literature that these non-state actors mostly operate in tandem with national governments and follow their lead as proxies and their contribution should be considered an integral part of a state's overall cyber policy.\n### American Cyber Posture\nIt seems that the most robust, sophisticated, and technically and institutionally up-to-date cyber posture is the American one, despite its paradoxical defensive nature. While the United States is the primary target for different forms of cyber warfare, especially cyber spying and phishing, it also possesses the highest potential to become a cyber superpower with the most vigorous state-run ICT-based posture. In the early 1990s, the Gulf War exhibited American technological superiority in terms of both hardware and software as countless stealth fighters bombarded Iraq without being detected by Iraqi anti-aircraft missile systems using state of the art precision-guided munitions (PGMs). American technological superiority was a decisive factor in defeating Iraq. As commander of US Central Command during the Gulf War, Norman Schwarzkopf argued that technological innovation worked ‘beyond our wildest expectations'.\nGiven America's growing reliance on ICT in the battlefield and in the supportive and logistical military formations, and repeated reports concerning a breach of computer networks such as in the case of the air force's Rome Air Development Center in March 1994, it became clear that this virtual Achilles heel must be protected. In 1995,\nthe Clinton administration's national security strategy proclaimed that ‘the threat of intrusions to our military and commercial information systems poses a significant risk to national security and must be addressed'. In June 1997 the US government conducted Eligible Receiver, the very first information warfare (IW) exercise that exposed the vulnerability of American military and civilian critical infrastructures in case of a coordinated cyberattack.\nBut as American policymakers and strategists feared their vital technological structures, they also become increasingly interested in exploiting this new strategic domain in their favour. Indeed, while the Kosovo war was overwhelmingly won by conducting conventional massive air bombing against Serb targets, some observers asserted that the accuracy and efficiency of these aerial campaigns were the outcome of cyber warfare-like operations, especially in directing the bombers to their targets from the ground. Furthermore, while it is not exactly clear what additional cyber measures were used against Serb targets, it was reported that the United States and NATO conducted various sophisticated cyberattacks that included penetrations of Serbian ICT systems and overloading them with data or manipulating their databases. Hence the use of cyber capabilities at the operational level was not only disruptive in nature but also proactive and offensive in its attempt to frustrate Serbian defensive formation and retaliatory military options.\nDuring the War on Terror campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, cyber warfare did not play a significant role. In both cases, the United States had virtually no critical ICT assets to attack or disrupt and the focus was on traditional, if irregular, combat operations. Nevertheless, it was reported that a month before the Iraq War began, President Bush signed a secret directive ordering the development of an American strategy for large-scale pre-emptive cyberattacks against adversaries of the United States.\nIt was then reported that the United States was pre-emptively cutting off the Iraqi computer network and internet grid that connected civilian and government agencies before war began in March 2003. According to Richard Clarke, the Iraqi Defense Ministry's email system was hacked by the Americans in order to warn high-ranking officers about opposing the future invasion and to assure them that the objective was to overthrow Saddam Hussein and not to destroy Iraq's political, military, and socioeconomic structures. Another path that was explored but not pursued was hacking into the regime's financial institutions and foreign bank accounts in order to locate Saddam Hussein's hidden assets.\nAt about the same time, Chinese hackers apparently orchestrated a major cyberattack on American computer systems at NASA and Sandia National Laboratories. It was made clearer following these incidents and others that the United States must re-evaluate its cyber policy and possibly change its approach. Yet the discourse remained rather defensive, primarily focused on protecting American critical infrastructure and confidential databases. When George W. Bush published his administration's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003, its objective was ‘... to secure the portions of cyberspace that they own, operate, control, or with which they interact'. The military establishment, on the other hand, was much more assertive in its approach to cyber warfare, as the 2004 Military Strategy asserted:\nThe Armed Forces must have the ability to operate across the air, land, sea, space and cyberspace domains of the battlespace ... The non-linear nature of the current security environment requires multi-layered active and passive measures to counter numerous diverse conventional and asymmetric threats ... They also include threats in cyberspace aimed at networks and data critical to US information-enabled systems. Such threats require a comprehensive concept of deterrence encompassing traditional adversaries, terrorist networks and rogue states able to employ any range of capabilities.52”\nThe 2005 National Defense Strategy further proclaimed that alongside traditional and irregular security challenges the United States confronts, cyberwarfare may constitute a threat that under certain conditions “... can fundamentally alter long-established concepts of warfare. Some potential adversaries are seeking disruptive capabilities to exploit US vulnerabilities and offset the current advantages of the United States and its partners'.53 Consequently, the stated military applications of cyber capabilities were made more offensive than ever a year later when the 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations noted:“[T]he United States must have cyberspace superiority to ensure our freedom of action and deny the same to our adversaries through the integration of network defense, exploitation, and attack ... Offensive capabilities in cyberspace offer the United States and our adversaries an opportunity to gain and maintain the initiative. DOD cyberspace operations are strongest when offensive and defensive capabilities are mutually supporting. This requires a long-range focus and dedicated resources to achieve this goal.54”\nThe director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Keith Alexander, argued in 2007 that the United States should reformulate the operational and institutional foundations of its cyber posture in order to address the technologically induced security environment, since“while we have ample national level strategies, we have yet to translate these strategies into operational art through development of joint doctrine for cyberspace. Through the doctrine vetting process, we can develop a common understanding of what it means to conduct warfare within and through cyberspace.55”\nIndeed, in early 2008 President Bush issued a directive that allows American intelligence agencies, especially the NSA, to monitor all internet traffic of the federal government in order to protect vital assets from cyberattacks. What makes this directive a major turning point in American cyber warfare evolution is that under Bush's initiative, the NSA with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) could provide the Pentagon with evidence that a pre-emptive cyberattack is crucial in order to protect American critical infrastructure.56\nIn early 2009, soon after taking office, President Barack Obama announced his administration's cyber policy, which remained rather committed to the defensive notion of protecting and securing critical infrastructure in what was often referred to as cyber security.57 Yet in April it was reported that the White House was, in\nfact, in the final stages of establishing a new cyber agency under the Pentagon's authority which could develop offensive cyber weapons alongside defending American ICT critical infrastructure. Former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, was appointed as director of the Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and while he was rather cautious in attributing any offensive aspects to the new command, the Pentagon declared that the mission of this new agency was to:“[d]irect the operations and defence of specified Department of Defense information networks [involving some 90,000 military personnel] and prepare to, when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, [to] ensure US allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.”\nMore recently, it was reported that the Pentagon is formulating a particular strategy that will engage the threats emanating from cyber warfare under the premise that any such attack on behalf of a foreign country constitutes a declaration of war that may result in armed conflict. In effect, however, President Obama did not approve a pre-emptive cyber offensive against Libya before the United States led the military campaign against Muammar Qaddafi in March 2011. The idea was to use cyber warfare in order to hinder Libya's air defence systems, but the option was abandoned, according to some government officials, because the Obama administration feared it would act as a precedent for Russian or Chinese future offensive attacks. One Defense Department official said the cyber options ‘... were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya's air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn't pan out'. Another White House official argued that ‘[t]hese cybercapabilities are still like the Ferrari that you keep in the garage and only take out for the big race and not just for a run around town, unless nothing else can get you there'.\nIn the aftermath of the war in Libya, the White House attempted to provide the most comprehensive and inclusive cyber strategy to date. But despite the clear defensive tone of the document, especially when considering the ambiguity of the parts relating to cyber deterrence mechanisms, there was more than a hint of offensive reasoning:“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic -- as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.”\nThe debate concerning the defensive or offensive posture of American cyber strategy or its passive or proactive nature is still ongoing. Recently, General Robert Kehler, Commander of US Strategic Command that oversees CYBERCOM, commented that the optimal solution would involve both: ‘I think we are looking at\nwhat an offensive component would be: what does that look like? What kind of options would we want to be able to offer? I think that we have always said that there needs to be an offense and defense mix'. These questions remain unanswered.\n### Chinese Cyber Posture\nIt is extremely difficult to fully account for the cyber posture of China and its development over the years. In China, defence-related transparency is a rare commodity. Yet it is widely known and established that the Chinese pursued a robust modernization in military technology and tactics from the late 1970s. Maoist ideology not only determined the political and societal structure of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its inception in 1949, it also served as China's military national defence strategy in that it revolved around the concept of ‘People's War' and the mobilization of the masses for a protracted armed conflict. After the death of Mao in 1976, and under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, a new conceptualization of Chinese warfare emerged that gradually became highly receptive to technological, industrial, and economic developments, making the entire defence apparatus much more open to engage the challenge of future armed conflict in the information age. From an operative vantage point, China gradually abandoned Mao's conception of active defence in favour of a pre-emptive military orientation that advocates a first strike mentality.\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, which strained Sino-American relations, highlighted historical anti-Western sentiments and created a shaky setting for the post-Cold War era. Consequently, by the mid 1990s China was caught paradoxically in an international constellation that was just as challenging as the Cold War international system. American intentions to redraw the global and regional landscape, and especially Washington's reactions to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, were badly received in Beijing. Consequently, the United States was increasingly considered to be a major source of danger to China's national interests and political order.\nAmerican military performance during the Gulf War highlighted the technological inferiority of the PLA and encouraged the Chinese leadership to accelerate and broaden existing plans to modernize and improve the army's capabilities for the purpose of potentially waging a limited or local war. Indeed, newly elected General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Jiang Zemin was confident that a comprehensive modernization of the Chinese armed forces amid what he considered American military superiority and interference in China's internal affairs was of great importance. Thus, he encouraged technological modernization according to American standards when he told members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in early 1993 that ‘[w]e must win high-tech, small-scale wars under modern conditions'. Similarly, the Chairman of the Commission on Science, Technology and National Defense Industry (COSTIND) General Ding Henggao warned that ‘[t]he one who possesses high-tech superiority will have the upper hand on the battlefield'.\nModernizing and increasing the professionalism of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was also matched with vigorous ICT-based innovation. As Major General\nWeng Pufang, former director of the Strategy Department of the Chinese Academy of Military Science, argued in a 1995 article he published in a Chinese military journal:“The thrust of China's military construction and development of weapons and equipment will no longer be toward strengthening the ‘firepower antipersonnel system' of the industrial age, but toward the strengthening of information technology, information weapons and information networking. Our sights must not be fixed on the firepower warfare of the industrial age, rather they must be trained on the information warfare of the information age.74”\nThe PLA became highly interested in exploiting these technological innovations and restructured its ICT-based military units to comprise the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Department (GSD), currently entrusted with exploitation of foreign computer networks, whereas the Fourth Department of the GSD is responsible for attacking foreign computer networks.75 Indeed, after an agreement with Cuba was signed in February 1998, China built two cyber warfare stations, one eavesdropping telephone and internet communications in the United States and the other more concerned with monitoring American military satellite systems.76 But in addition to these military units, the Chinese government has reportedly outsourced some of its cyber warfare tasks to civilian groups that are systematically activated and thus enable greater international flexibility due to cyber warfare's attribution problem.77\nIn the early 2000s, Beijing was ostensibly involved in numerous successful attempts to hack into American databases and critical infrastructure such as nuclear and electric power plants, satellite systems, and a number of Department of Defense contractors that store confidential information and blueprints of future weapon systems.78 China also launched an ambitious anti-satellite weapons program aimed at levelling the odds against American espionage and to attack satellite systems that are perceived by Beijing as utterly anti-Chinese in nature.79 Hence, China's cyber posture is primarily a deterrent against American military superiority but it has deep and conscious long-term advantages that Beijing may cash in on in time of need. In fact, China's cyber posture will only benefit an offensive orientation compared with the current defensive traits of the American cyber posture if Beijing needs to prevent Washington from interfering in matters related to Taiwan, for example.80 China's 2000 Defense White Paper explicitly adhered to this transformative phase of the PLA's posture into an ICT-based modernized army:“Faced with the world's military developments and the characteristics of modern warfare, the Chinese armed forces will, in the course of modernizing their weaponry, devote themselves to transforming semi-mechanized and mechanized weapon systems to automatized and informationized systems as soon as possible, so that they can possess weapons as advanced as possible and assure the accomplishment of the sacred missions assigned to them by the nation.81”\nA report submitted to the American Congress in 2007 argued that China not only possesses the cyber capabilities required to conduct comprehensive offensive cyberattacks against the United States: ‘In 2005, the PLA began to incorporate offensive\nCYBER POSTURING AND THE OFFENSE-DEFENSE BALANCE\nComputer Network Operations (CNOs) into its exercises, primarily in first strikes against enemy networks'. Indeed, China's 2008 Defense White Paper proclaimed in the sections dealing with the technological dimensions of modern warfare that\nChina is accelerating reform and innovation in its defense-related science, technology and industry ... Defense-related science, technology and industry are striving to enhance the informationization of weaponry and equipment design and development, and to render product design more digitalized, modularized, standardized and reliable.\nIn sum, the Chinese consider cyber warfare and its auxiliary elements as a power multiplier, integral to their national security strategy. Thus far, China has refrained from presenting a comprehensive cyber strategy but in practice it has primarily involved strategic and tactical hacking into American and other Western countries' databases and internet systems for reasons of technological and operative military espionage. While there were numerous indications of China's involvement in penetrating critical ICT-based infrastructure in the United States, Beijing has not used its existing cyber assets thus far to directly attack American strategic military assets in order to neutralize them but instead has focused on cyber spying. This pattern may change under certain conditions, especially if Beijing wishes to diversify its policy alternatives in case of a Sino-American confrontation.\n## Russian Cyber Posture\nWhereas in the two previous cases the strategizing of ICT as military capabilities was ambiguous at best, and there was certainly no actual use of cyber warfare as part of armed conflict, the case of Russia in the first decade of the 21st century can be easily dubbed as an exemplary case for the opposite. To begin with, during most of the 1990s Russia was grappling with the devastating economic, social, and political effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign and defence policy was primarily focused on '... disarmament and limitation of the arms race - in terms of releasing as many resources as possible and creating the most favorable conditions for the implementation of our socioeconomic reforms'.\nIn December 1994, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signalled his intention to alter Russia's foreign and defence orientation when he decided to invade Chechnya, a conflict that '... demonstrated the full extent of the armed forces' decline. In virtually every respect, the Russian military failed the challenge it was supposed to easily master'. By 1996, in face of failure in Chechnya and growing domestic opposition, Yeltsin moved to replace the moderate and pro-Western Kozyrev with Yevgeny Primakov who also served as Prime Minister between September 1998 and May 1999. Indicatively, in his first press conference Primakov asserted that 'Russia was and remains a great power. Her foreign policy should correspond to that status'.\nThe weaknesses of Russia's conventional and non-conventional military postures led many Russian military thinkers and officials to regard ICT-based capabilities as a way to compensate for strategic inferiority. During the mid 1990s, the Russian Army\nCONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY\nand Defense Ministry began seriously examining the nexus between technology and the regular military structure.⁸⁸ Russia was openly using IW during the second Chechen war.⁸⁹ The first major indication of coordinated Russian cyber warfare (in addition to IW) took place in Estonia in 2007, after a monument commemorating the Red Army’s re-conquest of Estonia during the Second World War was moved despite the Kremlin’s explicit warning.⁹⁰\nRather than exclusively resorting to military force in order to resolve what Moscow considered explicit anti-Russian reactionary sentiments and policies, as they did during the Chechen military campaigns in 1994 and 1999 for example, this time Moscow pursued a much more sophisticated approach that included inducing political riots in Estonia and targeting Estonia’s ICT infrastructure such as the banking sector, parliament’s website and email system, emergency phone lines, hospitals, and universities.⁹¹ During a period of several weeks in May 2007, after the statue was relocated, official Estonian governmental websites and vital telecommunications infrastructure were attacked and rendered inactive, according to most accounts, by Russian perpetrators.⁹²\nRussian policymakers began to appreciate the role of ICT and cyber warfare as an auxiliary instrument of coercion and statecraft against what they considered uncooperative regimes in the post-Soviet rim. And the lessons learned during the Estonian affair were apparently applied as part of Russia’s involvement in the Georgian war in August 2008.⁹³ Essentially, in response to Georgia’s attack against South Ossetia, Russian forces invaded Georgia and practically subdued it within a matter of days. Yet even before the first bullet was fired, the Kremlin decided to employ a preemptive strategic disruptive cyber attack.⁹⁴\nIn mid July, several cyberattacks were waged against Georgian websites and two weeks later a second wave of cyberattacks on Georgian targets was detected. A few days into the war, the vast majority of Georgian government websites were not functioning; in effect, the Georgian government was, as one study asserted, ‘cyber-locked’, without viable access to the internet and to its state-run agencies including the National Bank of Georgia.⁹⁵ No less important, the Georgian government was unable to communicate with the citizens or conduct its own retaliatory IW against Russia.⁹⁶ Fortunately for Georgia, and unlike in the Estonian case, critical infrastructure such as the electrical power grid is far less modernized and consequently more difficult to damage by using ICT-based capabilities.⁹⁷\nIn February 2010, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev approved the new Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation where some key references to the use of cyber warfare as an instrumental offensive military capability can be clearly observed. For example, when dealing with the features of modern military conflicts, the document states that such one trait, from Russia’s perspective, is the ‘... early conduct [of] information warfare activities to achieve political objectives without the use of military force, and subsequently – in the interest of creating a favorable reaction of the international community – to use military force’. And when referring to Russian future acquisition plans for the armed forces, the doctrine highlights that a key task involves the ‘... development of the forces and means of information warfare’.⁹⁸\nIn early 2012 the Russian Ministry of Defense revealed the Kremlin's cyber strategy under the title Conceptual Views Regarding the Activity of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space. It refrains from referring to offensive cyber warfare, but it does address issues pertaining to control, prevention, and solution of cyber conflicts. The document acknowledges the right of Russia to employ counteroffensive cyber warfare: ‘The escalation of a conflict in the cyber-space and its turn into a crisis gives the right to an individual or collective self-defense and the use of any means necessary that do not contradict the universally accepted norms and the principles of international law'. Based on Russia's past behaviour and the recent proclamation of its cyber strategy, it appears that Moscow may be more than willing to use different forms of cyber warfare should political needs emerge.\n### NATO Cyber Posture\nThus far, our empirical description has exclusively focused on state actors, but since NATO plays such a major role in the contemporary security environment it seems that examining the way it relates to cyber warfare will present a more accurate account for our purposes. Interestingly enough, despite NATO's transparency on the whole, there is very little access to the more operational and sometimes technical aspects of the Alliance's cyber strategy. Nevertheless, from the available materials we can identify NATO's defensive approach to cyber warfare and cyber security.\nOriginally, NATO was not only established to address the Soviet threat in Europe. Lord Ismay, NATO's first Secretary General, contended that its objectives were to keep ‘the Russians out, the Germans down, and the Americans in'. After the Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, NATO had to reinvent itself and identify new objectives in order to preserve its relevance and mere existence. The multiplicity of political and military goals combined with the willingness of its member states enabled NATO to successfully overcome this transitional period and undergo a process of remarkable institutional change that resulted in a renewed transatlantic mandate to develop new mechanisms and strategies in order to cope with the changing security environment.\nThe treatment of cyber warfare as part of NATO's evolving security concerns became decidedly evident in the early 2000s. Unlike the United States, China, or Russia, who were individually concerned with cyber warfare of various kinds and for different reasons as described earlier, throughout the 1990s NATO was primarily focused on its internal restructuring, the expansion eastwards to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and, of course, militarily operating in the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia.\nThe 1999 Strategic Concept declared that ‘[s]tate and non-state adversaries may try to exploit the Alliance's growing reliance on information systems through information operations designed to disrupt such systems. They may attempt to use strategies of this kind to counter NATO's superiority in traditional weaponry'. Yet the first explicit reference to cyber warfare was actually made in November 2002 during NATO's Prague summit, when it was declared that the member countries\ndecided to ‘... strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber attacks'. One operative outcome was the establishment of NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which was charged with the task of protecting ICT infrastructure and networks from unauthorized intrusion for espionage purposes or attempts to infect them with viruses. But this was a rather technical organ lacking any long-term military planning capacity, a feature that did not change significantly even following NATO's summit in Riga in November 2006 which further called for developing cyber-deterrence capabilities and doctrines. Russian cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 explicated NATO's military, infrastructural, and political weaknesses in the face of this new form of security threat, but the response as articulated by NATO's defence ministers was remarkably protective, arguing that ‘[u]rgent work is needed to enhance the ability to protect information systems of critical importance'.\nIn early 2008 it was reported that NATO officials further debated the need to protect the Alliance's assets against future cyberattacks, claiming that ‘[c]yber defence is now mentioned at the highest level along with missile defence and energy security'. While the attacks against Estonia did not result in the application of the collective security clause of the treaty, it did trigger a prompt institutional response. In January the Policy on Cyber Defence was presented and approved. During the Bucharest summit in April, the Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA) and the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) were established. Whereas the CDMA was entrusted with overseeing NATO's cyber defence efforts and providing guidance and assistance to the member countries in case of cyber-related crises, the CCDCOE, located in Estonia, was designed ‘... to enhance the capability, cooperation and information sharing among NATO, NATO nations and partners in cyber defence by virtue of education, research and development, lessons learned and consultation'.\nBoth agencies represent a highly defensive reaction to NATO's security challenges involving cyber warfare. As the Bucharest summit declaration proclaimed, the official cyber policy ‘... emphasizes the need for NATO and nations to protect key information systems in accordance with their respective responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack'. Yet Russia's continued use of cyber warfare during the war in Georgia highlighted its escalatory nature and the possible negative implications on conventional military conflicts. In April 2009, as part of the Declaration on Alliance Security, NATO moved further to identify cyberattacks alongside terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as the key global threats to member states and the international community.\nBut the major breakthrough in NATO strategic thinking regarding cyber warfare, which went beyond the strictly technical aspect of network protection, occurred during mid 2010. A team of leading experts in matters of security, headed by former American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, was asked to prepare a preliminary report to be used as a basis for NATO's new Strategic Concept. According to this report, entitled NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement and submitted in May:\nThe next significant attack on the Alliance may well come down a fibre [sic] optic cable. Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern. However, the risk of a large-scale attack on NATO's command and control systems or energy grids could readily warrant consultations under Article 4 and could possibly lead to collective defence measures under Article 5. Effective cyber defence requires the means to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from attacks.111”\nStill, the recommendations reflected the defensive posture that was already advocated and implemented thus far by NATO. Furthermore, and extremely relevant to the Alliance's strategic planners, the Albright Commission was reluctant to engage the question of whether cyberattacks against NATO member states would constitute a direct act of aggression that would trigger the collective security clause. Instead, it defined a rather ambiguous principle according to which such a decision must be made considering ‘... the nature, source, scope, and other aspects of the particular security challenge'.112 The same defensive reasoning can be observed in the ensuing final version of the Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon summit six months later. In the words of the document, NATO will: “develop further our ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyberattacks, including by using the NATO planning process to enhance and coordinate national cyber-defence capabilities, bringing all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection, and better integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and response with member nations.113”\nYet again, the numerous references to cyber warfare as a security threat were extremely narrow to include at best espionage, hacking, or disruption and there was no discussion about the possibility to conduct pre-emptive or retaliatory cyber warfare.114 In fact, Stephane Abrial, commander of Allied Command Transformation (ACT) responsible for leading the Alliance's transformation of capabilities and forces, was against defining the Strategic Concept's notion of ‘in-depth cyberdefense' as a ‘military-only, or even a military-centric, strategy'. Instead, Abrial focuses on NATO's ‘permanent mission [which] involves countering the daily attempts made by hackers to break into our systems, which are by necessity interconnected, making a weakness in one country's systems a weakness in all'.115 Other key NATO officials, including General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continued to conceptualize cyber warfare in defensive terms, arguing that recent cyberattacks ‘... increased the urgency to strengthen cyber defences not only at NATO, but across the Alliance as a whole'. There is no public discourse involving NATO officials that suggests treating cyber capabilities as an offensive feature of the Alliance's cyber strategy. The most proactive proposal to date was the option to dispatch NATO's cyber Rapid Reaction Teams in order to assist member countries suffering from cyberattacks, or ‘incidents' as Rasmussen calls them, should they ask for such assistance.116\nIt appears that NATO is focused on prevention of attacks on its institutional assets and member countries rather than initiating cyberattacks against others. As the\nAmerican representative to the CCDCOE concluded, when it comes to NATO, its major contribution to cyber defence will probably involve eroding the ‘... hacker's greatest advantages -- anonymity'. NATO's strategic thinking will continue to utilize its pooled capabilities in order to promote defensive solutions to cyber warfare of various kinds and it will continue to treat it as a threat rather than as an offensive feature to be proactively utilized.\n## Conclusions\nCyber warfare has become the latest buzzword in security studies, but some analysts downplay its importance for both policymakers and military strategists, calling it a ‘distracting and nonsensical' term. Yet while other observers also treat it as a complimentary aspect of modern warfare, they nonetheless underline its unique features, as Lynn publicly did:“The cyberthreat does not involve the existential implications ushered in by the nuclear age, but there are important similarities. Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming US advantages in conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneous and exceedingly hard to trace.”\nThe article initially identified the conceptual factors that determine the offensive or defensive nature of certain military technologies. Then it adjusted these elements in order to fit the information age and its a-territorial nature. Instead of evaluating strategic orientation by traditional Offense-Defensive characteristics like mobility and firepower, the cyber Offense-Defense balance is better assessed for its technological versatility and byte power; the capacity to attack an enemy's assets on different levels (strategic, operative, and tactical), and the degree of destruction that can be inflicted on enemy assets at each of these levels.\nThe article then turned to evaluate the practical influence of cyber warfare on policy and behaviour. The American case, while perhaps being the less confrontational since there was no report of meaningful offensive American use of cyber capabilities against a foreign country or since the United States is able to avoid any direct attribution, was the most documented and comprehensive from an institutional/organizational perspective. The intellectual evolutionary process pursued by officials in the military and civil branches of government is still ongoing, and the United States is far from having a comprehensive cyber strategy. The creation of USCYBERCOM is a significant step, but it is certainly not enough since apparently there is still no highly structured and comprehensive ideational, institutional, and operational outline for American cyber warfare and cyber defence.\nThe case of China is similar in its ambiguity, but for different reasons. Unlike the United States, Beijing is rather secretive in treating its cyber posture just as it is generally reluctant to fully expose its military apparatus, causing American policymakers, military officials, and legislators to repeatedly criticize China's lack of transparency in matters related to its defence budget and the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s modernization. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that China\nnot only has a very clear vision for its cyber posture as part of the country's wider military and technological modernization process, but it is also willing to use these capabilities in order to erode American military advantage. While Beijing is allegedly more interested in cyber espionage in order to obtain secret and up-to-date information about American capabilities and critical infrastructure, it will probably not shy away from using the same technology in order to curtail certain American assets, primarily non-combative ones (electric power plants etc.) and this may indicate that future Sino-American armed conflict will be augmented with vigorous cyber warfare.123 As a recent report submitted to Congress asserted, China's history of cyber warfare and its growing integration into the country's military strategy ‘suggests that the PLA may strike with Computer Network Operations (CNOs) and Electronic Warfare (EW) weapons in the opening phases of a conflict to degrade enemy information systems rather than attempt a traditional force-on-force attack directly where the PLA is at a disadvantage against more technologically advanced countries like the US'.124\nThe Russian case seemingly presents a better opportunity to observe the influence of cyber warfare on decisions of war and peace. From the empirical record it is evident that Russia explicitly used its cyber capabilities in both the Estonian and Georgian incidents, even if Moscow also used by-proxy entities for that purpose.125 The first incident was, of course, more of a diplomatic manoeuvre in order to curb Estonia's anti-Russian attitudes as the Kremlin perceived the matter. There was classical Soviet-era use of Russian ‘political activists' in order to encourage street unrest and orchestrated anti-government protests, but there was also the use of cyber warfare in order to paralyse then Estonian banking system and other key government agencies. Thus, one should treat this episode as an experiment in utilizing cyber capabilities in order to obtain certain political means. As the case of the Georgian war illustrated, this time cyber warfare was an integral, if not a decisive, part of the policymaking process and the military activities aimed at subduing the ‘defiant' Saakashvili administration. Clearly, the conventional dimension of the conflict was predominant, mainly due to the technological profile of Georgia's critical infrastructure, but the Russian use of cyberattacks hampered Georgian domestic vital communications between different branches of the government and completely prevented any Georgian IW counterattack.126\nNATO's cyber posture reflects the Alliance's historical defensive raison d'être that was articulated during the Cold War and reaffirmed following its end. For NATO officials, cyber warfare relates primarily to attempts by foreign actors to penetrate the organization's computer and information networks in order to retrieve confidential data. They are deeply reluctant to widen their approach to define such attacks as a cause for triggering the collective security clause of the treaty. Hence when Estonia was under Russian cyberattack, the most that NATO was able to offer Tallinn was technical assistance in reactivating and protecting its ICT networks from future attacks. Furthermore, even amid the Albright Commission's call to devise and implement a comprehensive cyber strategy, the institutional response was minor and essentially focused on network protection rather than explicit cyber deterrence, let alone an offensive reorientation.\nCONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY\nThe use of cyber capabilities makes a difference for policymakers since it allows them to minimize the risks of taking certain offensive actions and it is a relatively effective low-cost alternative, as the Israeli attack on Syria suggests, and it will become more common in the future. Cyber warfare, like all other forms of combat, is a political expression nonetheless in that there is a need for a conscious decision to apply it in order to achieve certain objectives. In the cases reviewed in this article, cyber capabilities were used selectively and in different intensities, as illustrated by the American reluctance to use pre-emptive cyber warfare against Libya. Hence future research should look at the way cyber warfare is prioritized over conventional/kinetic options in order to elucidate the conditions under which policymakers will prefer the former over the latter and vice versa. Furthermore, such studies should empirically appraise how integral cyber warfare has become at the strategic, operative, and tactical levels.\nOverall, cyber warfare is becoming an accepted military expedient since it allows leaders to achieve their political objectives with much less risk in the short term, even if in the long term it may actually lead to 'non-cyber' escalation. Prussian strategist and military thinker Carl von Clausewitz wrote long ago that '... a prince or a general can best demonstrate his genius by managing a campaign exactly to suit his objectives and his resources, doing neither too much nor too little'. Cyber warfare allows policymakers and the military to do exactly that, and with additional adjustments realism can help to better explain the process even if there is more work to be done in pursuit of this goal.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nAn earlier version of this article was presented at the annual meeting of the Israeli Association for International Studies (IAIS), Herzliya, 25 December 2011.

This misses the larger possibilities for political/military chain reactions that cyber warfare may prompt, possibly leading to armed conflict. This article utilizes Offense-Defense theory to appraise the influence of cyber warfare on international security and the prospects for conflict. Offense-Defense theory, as applied here, better explains the relationship between technological innovation and international politics, and leads to different conclusions from other realist approaches. Redefining the Offense-Defense balance to accommodate cyberspace leads to an emphasis on the offensive advantages of cyber capabilities. The offensive and defensive cyber postures of China, Russia, the United States, and NATO are examined here to empirically assess the role of cyber warfare in security policy. Evidence shows that innovations in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) allow states to take greater risks and adopt more vigilant or offensive positions toward adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but make decisions to escalate easier and cheaper. A strategic enabler that provides attackers greater freedom of action, cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if it is not a sufficient one.\n## Introduction In September 2007, Israeli military cyber warriors reportedly hacked into the Syrian monitoring and anti-aircraft missile defences to allow Israeli fighter jets to bomb the suspected nuclear reactor near Deir el-Zor.¹ As described by one account: [T]he main attack was preceded by an engagement with a single Syrian radar site at Tall al-Abuad near the Turkish border. It was assaulted with what appears to be a combination of electronic attack and precision bombs to enable the Israeli force to enter and exit Syrian airspace. Almost immediately, the entire Syrian radar system went off the air for a period of time that included the raid.² This incident, along with others discussed here, suggests that we are in the course of a new era, similar to past transformations in international security, such as the airplane, the tank, or the nuclear bomb, innovations that culminated in radical departures in strategic thinking and behaviour. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) not only drives the internet, the iPhone, or the Global Positioning System (GPS). Nowadays, ICT has become an integral and possibly an essential military Contemporary Security Policy, Vol.34, No.1, 2013, pp.40-63 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2013.771031 © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis capability. The cyber sphere of action it created is replacing the conventional battlefield.3 Some observers argue that for realists cyber warfare is ‘old wine in a new bottle'; its added value is rather marginal.4 This downplays the broader implications of cyber warfare, stressing only technical aspects and focusing on information warfare (IW), one operative manifestation of cyber warfare, rather than the possibilities for political/military chain reaction that cyber warfare may prompt, ending in armed conflict.5 Consequently, this article is not concerned with specific cyber tactics like computer-based commercial espionage or phishing per se. Rather, this analysis stresses the integration of ICT applications aimed at disrupting, paralysing, and possibly destroying another state's assets, with a direct bearing on national security and critical infrastructure, and especially its capacity to conduct military operations.6 This article has two main objectives. First, despite the large number of studies dealing with cyber warfare, we are still lacking a realist theoretical conceptualization of its influence on international security in general and on the pervasiveness of war in particular.7 This analysis examines the relevance of realism as a technologically, rather than a territorially, based explanation for international security in the information age. Considering the fact that ‘[r]ealist theories... still provide a context and motivation for many of the most important theoretical debates in the field', as Jack Donnelly asserts, it is almost inconceivable that realism will not take a shot at explaining the dramatic technological shift in the security environment caused by cyber warfare.8 This article employs realist Offense-Defense theory to evaluate the expected effect of ICT on the prevalence of war, using the most suitable realist framework to explore the nexus between technological innovation and international politics, and especially questions of war and peace.9 In contrast to other scholars, who apply Offense-Defense theory to support cyber deterrence, this treatment stresses the need to dramatically modify Offense-Defense terminology to better address cyber warfare's unique and revolutionary features.10 Second, this article tests this Offense-Defense framework, empirically evaluating the role of cyber warfare in contemporary military strategic thinking and state behaviour. The evolving cyber postures of China, Russia, NATO, and the United States show to what extent cyber warfare concepts have gained traction among leaders, strategists, and military planners. Since we are dealing with ongoing technological developments, their policy implications far from determined, this study is more of a probe into a possible future rather than a final ruling. Nevertheless, from existing evidence it is possible to infer that ICT allows states to take greater risks and thus adopt more vigilant or offensive positions vis-à-vis their adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but their existence makes the decision to escalate armed conflict easier and considerably cheaper. ICT can be considered a strategic enabler and an efficient force multiplier that provides the attacker with greater freedom of action.\nThe article first, briefly, discusses the current status of Offense-Defense theory and suggests a fundamental conceptual amendment to allow realism to better incorporate cyber warfare into accounts of contemporary international security. It then proceeds to evaluate the cyber Offense-Defense balance to locate its strategic orientation. The cyber posture of four of the prominent actors in contemporary world affairs -- China, Russia, NATO, and the United States -- are examined in order to assess the effect of the cyber Offense-Defense balance on their security policies.\nIt is the conclusion of this article that for realism to maintain its relevance, it must transcend traditional territorial and kinetic traits of international security, or at least give more room for novel technological factors, and consider cyberspace as an alternative realm that states utilize to attack others. ICT and employment of cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if not a sufficient one, and realism must adjust its theoretical foundations and predictions accordingly. At a minimum, cyber warfare is an influential force multiplier or conflict enabler. At a maximum, it is a strategic game changer.11 But while the potential of cyber warfare to revolutionize international security and interstate conflict is dramatic, the scale of this transformation will be determined by political rather than technological considerations.\n## Cybernating Offense-Defense Theory Offense-Defense theory has generated heated debates ever since it was introduced by Robert Jervis and George Quester in the late 1970s.12 Jervis contended that the orientation of different military capabilities and weaponry systems may influence interstate security dilemmas and therefore the prevalence of war or peace. ‘When we say that the offense has the advantage, we simply mean that it is easier to destroy the other's army', he explains. ‘When the defense has the advantage, it is easier to protect and hold than it is to move forward, destroy and take.' Quester, applying the same logic, concluded that ‘likelihoods of war are thus clearly influenced by how effective the offensive weapon seems to be, as compared with the defensive'.13 Offense-Defense theory was heavily criticized for both its methodological foundation and empirical applicability.14 Thus, various attempts were made to salvage the theory and present an amended version that would bolster its standing as a leading realist theory.15 One of the most lethal criticisms had to do with the difficulty of differentiating between the offensive or defensive nature of military capabilities or technologies. In response, Charles Glaser and Chaim Kaufmann, for example, suggested that the Offense-Defense balance -- the driving engine of the theory -- should be considered as the ‘... ratio of the cost of the forces the attacker requires to take territory to the cost of the forces the defender has deployed'.16 Still, the traditional interpretation of Offense-Defense theory, as stipulated by both advocates and critics, is somewhat anachronistic and to some extent irrelevant to the information age. It presumes that war is conducted and concluded according to a kinetic basis and a territorial logic. Furthermore, the determinism of offensive and defensive capabilities, the security dilemma and armed conflict, is simplistic. It fosters a flawed ‘major war pathology' that does not necessarily exist today. One can plausibly imagine an armed conflict that is not necessarily aimed at unconditional surrender or territorial occupation, but tends to be much more limited, although it can turn into an all-out war of course, a kind of slippery slope interstate militarized dynamics.17 Second, and more importantly, since the conduct of contemporary warfare is dependent on ICT infrastructure, cyberspace becomes a contested domain in which cyberwar, or major technological conflicts, may take place or even be determined.18 As James Adams notes, ‘[a]round the world, information technology increasingly pervades weapons systems, defense infrastructures and national economies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new international battlefield'.19 Cyberwar may not solely determine the outcomes of future armed conflicts and interstate rivalries, but it can influence leaders' determination to prefer military options over political solutions. Since the early 1990s, policymakers have become deeply aware of ICT-based systems' vulnerability, their influence on states' national security posture, and the ability to conduct military operations.20 Former American Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn recently acknowledged that ICT > enables almost everything the US military does: logistical support and global command and control of forces, real-time provision of intelligence, and remote operations... The US government's digital infrastructure now gives the United States critical advantages over any adversary, but its reliance on computer networks also potentially enables adversaries to gain valuable intelligence about US capabilities and operations, to impede the United States' conventional military forces, and to disrupt the US economy.21 But is cyberspace defence or offence oriented? According to Lynn, the answer is straightforward: ‘In cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand'.22 This may be intuitively correct, and surely this position is shared by the vast majority of scholars and practitioners, but how can Offense-Defense theory provide a more founded answer to this question? This article suggests that Offense-Defense theory can effectively perform this task after updating its conceptual basis. Essentially, the balance between offence and defence is determined, in the traditional fashion, according to two key factors: mobility enhancement and firepower's degree of destructiveness.23 However, these determinants are not necessarily relevant to cyber warfare and thus must be redefined in order to address the technologically different security environment we are dealing with in the information age and the various expressions of cyber warfare.24 ### From Mobility to ‘Versatility' Unlike the customary kinetic and territorially based interpretation of the term mobility in Offense-Defense theory literature that relates to the possibility of relocating combatants at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,25 in cyberspace mobility actually relates to the capacity to technologically attack different types of ICT-based targets at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than thinking in terms of the physical allocation of armed forces across or between combat zones, in cyberwar we should talk of cyber versatility that corresponds to levels of war hierarchy.26 Strategic targets or critical infrastructures consist of vital or centre-of-gravity assets whose destruction may have a colossal effect on a state's national security and its capacity to operate normally.27 Such elements include a state's military constellations, defence industrial base, satellite communication, electrical power grid, internet connectivity, central banking system, stock market, ministries, and governmental agencies.28 On the operational level, where the focus is on related ICT-based systems, cyber warfare may foil the use of military and warning systems such as anti-aircraft missile systems, reconnaissance capabilities, or the hacking into an enemy's technological capabilities such as drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).29 On the tactical level, when the focus is on a particular and segmented ICT-based system, cyber warfare may interrupt battlefield communication and coordination, disrupt electronic signals such as radio and GPS signals, or eliminate them completely.30 ### From Firepower to ‘Byte Power' Unlike the customary territorially based interpretation of this feature in the Offense-Defense theory literature that primarily revolves around accuracy and destructiveness of certain weapons, in cyberspace firepower actually relates to the degree of technological damage that can be inflicted on the enemy's ICT-based infrastructure at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than talk of kinetic firepower, in cyber warfare the idea is to examine how much byte power a state can extract and direct towards an adversary's ICT-based targets.\nWhile the Offense-Defense theory literature typically maintains that the greater a weapon's firepower the greater its contribution to the defence,31 this assertion is challenged by prominent Offense-Defense theorists and it seems largely misguided in cyberspace. Glaser and Kaufman argue, for example, that ‘... there can be exceptions when specific firepower innovations are differentially useful against defender'.32 It seems that moving from the territorial and/or the kinetic to cyberspace allows such an exception, especially if we are dealing with highly accurate and low-signature cyber capabilities that allow the attacking and possible neutralization of an enemy's defence systems with virtual anonymity.33 Furthermore, and primarily as a complementary mechanism, selective or surgical cyberattacks may greatly improve the effectiveness of offensive conventional weapons by creating a cyber window of opportunity for conventional activities through which both combatants and equipment can penetrate more easily an otherwise unassailable target.34 To sum up this section, ICT-induced cyber capabilities tilt the Offense-Defense balance in favour of the offence, not in the prospects of gaining and maintaining control over territory and material resources as a manifestation of victory, but rather in the actual possibility to paralyse the enemy's military deployment and civilian preparedness and drastically limit its retaliatory potential. Since the use of cyber capabilities according to both indicators suggests that offence has the advantage, let us turn to evaluate the relevance of cyber warfare to the process of policymaking. For offence-dominant cyber capabilities to actually influence calculations and decisions in matters of war and peace, leaders and policymakers must be aware of these technologically advanced capabilities and acknowledge their strategic advantages. In the words of Keir Lieber, the influence of technological innovation ‘... is always filtered through the strategies that state decision makers employ in pursuit of their political goals. In simplest terms, politics -- more than technology -- is the master'.35 The aim is not, however, to meticulously describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures, i.e. the overall strategy designed to address different ICT-based challenges and threats by applying a multitude of proactive and passive measures. Rather, I present a succinct account to highlight key features and contemporary ramifications for war and peace. Given their offensive nature, the following section will try to assess whether the use of cyber capabilities actually prompted armed conflict, and under what conditions.\n## The Politics of Cyberwar and Peace Generally speaking, America, China, and Russia have long histories of attempting to combine political aims with advanced technology, while NATO primarily benefited from the American efforts. The Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), warmly adopted by the Americans in the late 1980s and successfully implemented during the Gulf War, was in fact an adaptation of the 1970s Soviet Military-Technical Revolution (MTR). As Elliot Cohen observes, the idea was to promote ‘... an imminent technical revolution that would give conventional weapons a level of effectiveness in the field comparable to that of small tactical nuclear weapons'.\nThe following accounts describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures to assess the influence of ICT-based capabilities on strategic thinking and behaviour. There is an important caveat to this analysis; cyber warfare suffers from a major problem of attributing attacks to specific state actors. Some of the cases discussed below include acts by non-state actors such as individuals, hacktivists, netizens, or more organized cyber militias and cyber gangs. Nevertheless, there is a growing consensus in the literature that these non-state actors mostly operate in tandem with national governments and follow their lead as proxies and their contribution should be considered an integral part of a state's overall cyber policy.\n### American Cyber Posture It seems that the most robust, sophisticated, and technically and institutionally up-to-date cyber posture is the American one, despite its paradoxical defensive nature. While the United States is the primary target for different forms of cyber warfare, especially cyber spying and phishing, it also possesses the highest potential to become a cyber superpower with the most vigorous state-run ICT-based posture. In the early 1990s, the Gulf War exhibited American technological superiority in terms of both hardware and software as countless stealth fighters bombarded Iraq without being detected by Iraqi anti-aircraft missile systems using state of the art precision-guided munitions (PGMs). American technological superiority was a decisive factor in defeating Iraq. As commander of US Central Command during the Gulf War, Norman Schwarzkopf argued that technological innovation worked ‘beyond our wildest expectations'.\nGiven America's growing reliance on ICT in the battlefield and in the supportive and logistical military formations, and repeated reports concerning a breach of computer networks such as in the case of the air force's Rome Air Development Center in March 1994, it became clear that this virtual Achilles heel must be protected. In 1995, the Clinton administration's national security strategy proclaimed that ‘the threat of intrusions to our military and commercial information systems poses a significant risk to national security and must be addressed'. In June 1997 the US government conducted Eligible Receiver, the very first information warfare (IW) exercise that exposed the vulnerability of American military and civilian critical infrastructures in case of a coordinated cyberattack.\nBut as American policymakers and strategists feared their vital technological structures, they also become increasingly interested in exploiting this new strategic domain in their favour. Indeed, while the Kosovo war was overwhelmingly won by conducting conventional massive air bombing against Serb targets, some observers asserted that the accuracy and efficiency of these aerial campaigns were the outcome of cyber warfare-like operations, especially in directing the bombers to their targets from the ground. Furthermore, while it is not exactly clear what additional cyber measures were used against Serb targets, it was reported that the United States and NATO conducted various sophisticated cyberattacks that included penetrations of Serbian ICT systems and overloading them with data or manipulating their databases. Hence the use of cyber capabilities at the operational level was not only disruptive in nature but also proactive and offensive in its attempt to frustrate Serbian defensive formation and retaliatory military options.\nDuring the War on Terror campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, cyber warfare did not play a significant role. In both cases, the United States had virtually no critical ICT assets to attack or disrupt and the focus was on traditional, if irregular, combat operations. Nevertheless, it was reported that a month before the Iraq War began, President Bush signed a secret directive ordering the development of an American strategy for large-scale pre-emptive cyberattacks against adversaries of the United States.\nIt was then reported that the United States was pre-emptively cutting off the Iraqi computer network and internet grid that connected civilian and government agencies before war began in March 2003. According to Richard Clarke, the Iraqi Defense Ministry's email system was hacked by the Americans in order to warn high-ranking officers about opposing the future invasion and to assure them that the objective was to overthrow Saddam Hussein and not to destroy Iraq's political, military, and socioeconomic structures. Another path that was explored but not pursued was hacking into the regime's financial institutions and foreign bank accounts in order to locate Saddam Hussein's hidden assets.\nAt about the same time, Chinese hackers apparently orchestrated a major cyberattack on American computer systems at NASA and Sandia National Laboratories. It was made clearer following these incidents and others that the United States must re-evaluate its cyber policy and possibly change its approach. Yet the discourse remained rather defensive, primarily focused on protecting American critical infrastructure and confidential databases. When George W. Bush published his administration's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003, its objective was ‘... to secure the portions of cyberspace that they own, operate, control, or with which they interact'. The military establishment, on the other hand, was much more assertive in its approach to cyber warfare, as the 2004 Military Strategy asserted: The Armed Forces must have the ability to operate across the air, land, sea, space and cyberspace domains of the battlespace... The non-linear nature of the current security environment requires multi-layered active and passive measures to counter numerous diverse conventional and asymmetric threats... They also include threats in cyberspace aimed at networks and data critical to US information-enabled systems. Such threats require a comprehensive concept of deterrence encompassing traditional adversaries, terrorist networks and rogue states able to employ any range of capabilities.52” The 2005 National Defense Strategy further proclaimed that alongside traditional and irregular security challenges the United States confronts, cyberwarfare may constitute a threat that under certain conditions “... can fundamentally alter long-established concepts of warfare. Some potential adversaries are seeking disruptive capabilities to exploit US vulnerabilities and offset the current advantages of the United States and its partners'.53 Consequently, the stated military applications of cyber capabilities were made more offensive than ever a year later when the 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations noted:“[T]he United States must have cyberspace superiority to ensure our freedom of action and deny the same to our adversaries through the integration of network defense, exploitation, and attack... Offensive capabilities in cyberspace offer the United States and our adversaries an opportunity to gain and maintain the initiative. DOD cyberspace operations are strongest when offensive and defensive capabilities are mutually supporting. This requires a long-range focus and dedicated resources to achieve this goal.54” The director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Keith Alexander, argued in 2007 that the United States should reformulate the operational and institutional foundations of its cyber posture in order to address the technologically induced security environment, since “while we have ample national level strategies, we have yet to translate these strategies into operational art through development of joint doctrine for cyberspace. Through the doctrine vetting process, we can develop a common understanding of what it means to conduct warfare within and through cyberspace.55” Indeed, in early 2008 President Bush issued a directive that allows American intelligence agencies, especially the NSA, to monitor all internet traffic of the federal government in order to protect vital assets from cyberattacks. What makes this directive a major turning point in American cyber warfare evolution is that under Bush's initiative, the NSA with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) could provide the Pentagon with evidence that a pre-emptive cyberattack is crucial in order to protect American critical infrastructure.56 In early 2009, soon after taking office, President Barack Obama announced his administration's cyber policy, which remained rather committed to the defensive notion of protecting and securing critical infrastructure in what was often referred to as cyber security.57 Yet in April it was reported that the White House was, in fact, in the final stages of establishing a new cyber agency under the Pentagon's authority which could develop offensive cyber weapons alongside defending American ICT critical infrastructure. Former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, was appointed as director of the Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and while he was rather cautious in attributing any offensive aspects to the new command, the Pentagon declared that the mission of this new agency was to:“[d]irect the operations and defence of specified Department of Defense information networks [involving some 90,000 military personnel] and prepare to, when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, [to] ensure US allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.”\nMore recently, it was reported that the Pentagon is formulating a particular strategy that will engage the threats emanating from cyber warfare under the premise that any such attack on behalf of a foreign country constitutes a declaration of war that may result in armed conflict. In effect, however, President Obama did not approve a pre-emptive cyber offensive against Libya before the United States led the military campaign against Muammar Qaddafi in March 2011. The idea was to use cyber warfare in order to hinder Libya's air defence systems, but the option was abandoned, according to some government officials, because the Obama administration feared it would act as a precedent for Russian or Chinese future offensive attacks. One Defense Department official said the cyber options ‘... were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya's air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn't pan out'. Another White House official argued that ‘[t]hese cybercapabilities are still like the Ferrari that you keep in the garage and only take out for the big race and not just for a run around town, unless nothing else can get you there'.\nIn the aftermath of the war in Libya, the White House attempted to provide the most comprehensive and inclusive cyber strategy to date. But despite the clear defensive tone of the document, especially when considering the ambiguity of the parts relating to cyber deterrence mechanisms, there was more than a hint of offensive reasoning:“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic -- as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.”\nThe debate concerning the defensive or offensive posture of American cyber strategy or its passive or proactive nature is still ongoing. Recently, General Robert Kehler, Commander of US Strategic Command that oversees CYBERCOM, commented that the optimal solution would involve both: ‘I think we are looking at what an offensive component would be: what does that look like? What kind of options would we want to be able to offer? I think that we have always said that there needs to be an offense and defense mix'. These questions remain unanswered.\n### Chinese Cyber Posture It is extremely difficult to fully account for the cyber posture of China and its development over the years. In China, defence-related transparency is a rare commodity. Yet it is widely known and established that the Chinese pursued a robust modernization in military technology and tactics from the late 1970s. Maoist ideology not only determined the political and societal structure of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its inception in 1949, it also served as China's military national defence strategy in that it revolved around the concept of ‘People's War' and the mobilization of the masses for a protracted armed conflict. After the death of Mao in 1976, and under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, a new conceptualization of Chinese warfare emerged that gradually became highly receptive to technological, industrial, and economic developments, making the entire defence apparatus much more open to engage the challenge of future armed conflict in the information age. From an operative vantage point, China gradually abandoned Mao's conception of active defence in favour of a pre-emptive military orientation that advocates a first strike mentality.\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, which strained Sino-American relations, highlighted historical anti-Western sentiments and created a shaky setting for the post-Cold War era. Consequently, by the mid 1990s China was caught paradoxically in an international constellation that was just as challenging as the Cold War international system. American intentions to redraw the global and regional landscape, and especially Washington's reactions to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, were badly received in Beijing. Consequently, the United States was increasingly considered to be a major source of danger to China's national interests and political order.\nAmerican military performance during the Gulf War highlighted the technological inferiority of the PLA and encouraged the Chinese leadership to accelerate and broaden existing plans to modernize and improve the army's capabilities for the purpose of potentially waging a limited or local war. Indeed, newly elected General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Jiang Zemin was confident that a comprehensive modernization of the Chinese armed forces amid what he considered American military superiority and interference in China's internal affairs was of great importance. Thus, he encouraged technological modernization according to American standards when he told members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in early 1993 that ‘[w]e must win high-tech, small-scale wars under modern conditions'. Similarly, the Chairman of the Commission on Science, Technology and National Defense Industry (COSTIND) General Ding Henggao warned that ‘[t]he one who possesses high-tech superiority will have the upper hand on the battlefield'.\nModernizing and increasing the professionalism of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was also matched with vigorous ICT-based innovation. As Major General Weng Pufang, former director of the Strategy Department of the Chinese Academy of Military Science, argued in a 1995 article he published in a Chinese military journal:“The thrust of China's military construction and development of weapons and equipment will no longer be toward strengthening the ‘firepower antipersonnel system' of the industrial age, but toward the strengthening of information technology, information weapons and information networking. Our sights must not be fixed on the firepower warfare of the industrial age, rather they must be trained on the information warfare of the information age.74” The PLA became highly interested in exploiting these technological innovations and restructured its ICT-based military units to comprise the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Department (GSD), currently entrusted with exploitation of foreign computer networks, whereas the Fourth Department of the GSD is responsible for attacking foreign computer networks.75 Indeed, after an agreement with Cuba was signed in February 1998, China built two cyber warfare stations, one eavesdropping telephone and internet communications in the United States and the other more concerned with monitoring American military satellite systems.76 But in addition to these military units, the Chinese government has reportedly outsourced some of its cyber warfare tasks to civilian groups that are systematically activated and thus enable greater international flexibility due to cyber warfare's attribution problem.77 In the early 2000s, Beijing was ostensibly involved in numerous successful attempts to hack into American databases and critical infrastructure such as nuclear and electric power plants, satellite systems, and a number of Department of Defense contractors that store confidential information and blueprints of future weapon systems.78 China also launched an ambitious anti-satellite weapons program aimed at levelling the odds against American espionage and to attack satellite systems that are perceived by Beijing as utterly anti-Chinese in nature.79 Hence, China's cyber posture is primarily a deterrent against American military superiority but it has deep and conscious long-term advantages that Beijing may cash in on in time of need. In fact, China's cyber posture will only benefit an offensive orientation compared with the current defensive traits of the American cyber posture if Beijing needs to prevent Washington from interfering in matters related to Taiwan, for example.80 China's 2000 Defense White Paper explicitly adhered to this transformative phase of the PLA's posture into an ICT-based modernized army:“Faced with the world's military developments and the characteristics of modern warfare, the Chinese armed forces will, in the course of modernizing their weaponry, devote themselves to transforming semi-mechanized and mechanized weapon systems to automatized and informationized systems as soon as possible, so that they can possess weapons as advanced as possible and assure the accomplishment of the sacred missions assigned to them by the nation.81” A report submitted to the American Congress in 2007 argued that China not only possesses the cyber capabilities required to conduct comprehensive offensive cyberattacks against the United States: ‘In 2005, the PLA began to incorporate offensive CYBER POSTURING AND THE OFFENSE-DEFENSE BALANCE Computer Network Operations (CNOs) into its exercises, primarily in first strikes against enemy networks'. Indeed, China's 2008 Defense White Paper proclaimed in the sections dealing with the technological dimensions of modern warfare that China is accelerating reform and innovation in its defense-related science, technology and industry... Defense-related science, technology and industry are striving to enhance the informationization of weaponry and equipment design and development, and to render product design more digitalized, modularized, standardized and reliable.[83] In sum, the Chinese consider cyber warfare and its auxiliary elements as a power multiplier, integral to their national security strategy. Thus far, China has refrained from presenting a comprehensive cyber strategy but in practice it has primarily involved strategic and tactical hacking into American and other Western countries' databases and internet systems for reasons of technological and operative military espionage. While there were numerous indications of China's involvement in penetrating critical ICT-based infrastructure in the United States, Beijing has not used its existing cyber assets thus far to directly attack American strategic military assets in order to neutralize them but instead has focused on cyber spying. This pattern may change under certain conditions, especially if Beijing wishes to diversify its policy alternatives in case of a Sino-American confrontation.[84] ## Russian Cyber Posture Whereas in the two previous cases the strategizing of ICT as military capabilities was ambiguous at best, and there was certainly no actual use of cyber warfare as part of armed conflict, the case of Russia in the first decade of the 21st century can be easily dubbed as an exemplary case for the opposite. To begin with, during most of the 1990s Russia was grappling with the devastating economic, social, and political effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign and defence policy was primarily focused on '... disarmament and limitation of the arms race - in terms of releasing as many resources as possible and creating the most favorable conditions for the implementation of our socioeconomic reforms'.[85] In December 1994, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signalled his intention to alter Russia's foreign and defence orientation when he decided to invade Chechnya, a conflict that '... demonstrated the full extent of the armed forces' decline. In virtually every respect, the Russian military failed the challenge it was supposed to easily master'.[86] By 1996, in face of failure in Chechnya and growing domestic opposition, Yeltsin moved to replace the moderate and pro-Western Kozyrev with Yevgeny Primakov who also served as Prime Minister between September 1998 and May 1999. Indicatively, in his first press conference Primakov asserted that 'Russia was and remains a great power. Her foreign policy should correspond to that status'.[87] The weaknesses of Russia's conventional and non-conventional military postures led many Russian military thinkers and officials to regard ICT-based capabilities as a way to compensate for strategic inferiority. During the mid 1990s, the Russian Army CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY and Defense Ministry began seriously examining the nexus between technology and the regular military structure.⁸⁸ Russia was openly using IW during the second Chechen war.⁸⁹ The first major indication of coordinated Russian cyber warfare (in addition to IW) took place in Estonia in 2007, after a monument commemorating the Red Army’s re-conquest of Estonia during the Second World War was moved despite the Kremlin’s explicit warning.⁹⁰ Rather than exclusively resorting to military force in order to resolve what Moscow considered explicit anti-Russian reactionary sentiments and policies, as they did during the Chechen military campaigns in 1994 and 1999 for example, this time Moscow pursued a much more sophisticated approach that included inducing political riots in Estonia and targeting Estonia’s ICT infrastructure such as the banking sector, parliament’s website and email system, emergency phone lines, hospitals, and universities.⁹¹ During a period of several weeks in May 2007, after the statue was relocated, official Estonian governmental websites and vital telecommunications infrastructure were attacked and rendered inactive, according to most accounts, by Russian perpetrators.⁹² Russian policymakers began to appreciate the role of ICT and cyber warfare as an auxiliary instrument of coercion and statecraft against what they considered uncooperative regimes in the post-Soviet rim. And the lessons learned during the Estonian affair were apparently applied as part of Russia’s involvement in the Georgian war in August 2008.⁹³ Essentially, in response to Georgia’s attack against South Ossetia, Russian forces invaded Georgia and practically subdued it within a matter of days. Yet even before the first bullet was fired, the Kremlin decided to employ a preemptive strategic disruptive cyber attack.⁹⁴ In mid July, several cyberattacks were waged against Georgian websites and two weeks later a second wave of cyberattacks on Georgian targets was detected. A few days into the war, the vast majority of Georgian government websites were not functioning; in effect, the Georgian government was, as one study asserted, ‘cyber-locked’, without viable access to the internet and to its state-run agencies including the National Bank of Georgia.⁹⁵ No less important, the Georgian government was unable to communicate with the citizens or conduct its own retaliatory IW against Russia.⁹⁶ Fortunately for Georgia, and unlike in the Estonian case, critical infrastructure such as the electrical power grid is far less modernized and consequently more difficult to damage by using ICT-based capabilities.⁹⁷ In February 2010, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev approved the new Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation where some key references to the use of cyber warfare as an instrumental offensive military capability can be clearly observed. For example, when dealing with the features of modern military conflicts, the document states that such one trait, from Russia’s perspective, is the ‘... early conduct [of] information warfare activities to achieve political objectives without the use of military force, and subsequently – in the interest of creating a favorable reaction of the international community – to use military force’. And when referring to Russian future acquisition plans for the armed forces, the doctrine highlights that a key task involves the ‘... development of the forces and means of information warfare’.⁹⁸ In early 2012 the Russian Ministry of Defense revealed the Kremlin's cyber strategy under the title Conceptual Views Regarding the Activity of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space. It refrains from referring to offensive cyber warfare, but it does address issues pertaining to control, prevention, and solution of cyber conflicts. The document acknowledges the right of Russia to employ counteroffensive cyber warfare: ‘The escalation of a conflict in the cyber-space and its turn into a crisis gives the right to an individual or collective self-defense and the use of any means necessary that do not contradict the universally accepted norms and the principles of international law'. Based on Russia's past behaviour and the recent proclamation of its cyber strategy, it appears that Moscow may be more than willing to use different forms of cyber warfare should political needs emerge.\n### NATO Cyber Posture Thus far, our empirical description has exclusively focused on state actors, but since NATO plays such a major role in the contemporary security environment it seems that examining the way it relates to cyber warfare will present a more accurate account for our purposes. Interestingly enough, despite NATO's transparency on the whole, there is very little access to the more operational and sometimes technical aspects of the Alliance's cyber strategy. Nevertheless, from the available materials we can identify NATO's defensive approach to cyber warfare and cyber security.\nOriginally, NATO was not only established to address the Soviet threat in Europe. Lord Ismay, NATO's first Secretary General, contended that its objectives were to keep ‘the Russians out, the Germans down, and the Americans in'. After the Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, NATO had to reinvent itself and identify new objectives in order to preserve its relevance and mere existence. The multiplicity of political and military goals combined with the willingness of its member states enabled NATO to successfully overcome this transitional period and undergo a process of remarkable institutional change that resulted in a renewed transatlantic mandate to develop new mechanisms and strategies in order to cope with the changing security environment.\nThe treatment of cyber warfare as part of NATO's evolving security concerns became decidedly evident in the early 2000s. Unlike the United States, China, or Russia, who were individually concerned with cyber warfare of various kinds and for different reasons as described earlier, throughout the 1990s NATO was primarily focused on its internal restructuring, the expansion eastwards to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and, of course, militarily operating in the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia.\nThe 1999 Strategic Concept declared that ‘[s]tate and non-state adversaries may try to exploit the Alliance's growing reliance on information systems through information operations designed to disrupt such systems. They may attempt to use strategies of this kind to counter NATO's superiority in traditional weaponry'. Yet the first explicit reference to cyber warfare was actually made in November 2002 during NATO's Prague summit, when it was declared that the member countries decided to ‘... strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber attacks'. One operative outcome was the establishment of NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which was charged with the task of protecting ICT infrastructure and networks from unauthorized intrusion for espionage purposes or attempts to infect them with viruses. But this was a rather technical organ lacking any long-term military planning capacity, a feature that did not change significantly even following NATO's summit in Riga in November 2006 which further called for developing cyber-deterrence capabilities and doctrines. Russian cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 explicated NATO's military, infrastructural, and political weaknesses in the face of this new form of security threat, but the response as articulated by NATO's defence ministers was remarkably protective, arguing that ‘[u]rgent work is needed to enhance the ability to protect information systems of critical importance'.\nIn early 2008 it was reported that NATO officials further debated the need to protect the Alliance's assets against future cyberattacks, claiming that ‘[c]yber defence is now mentioned at the highest level along with missile defence and energy security'. While the attacks against Estonia did not result in the application of the collective security clause of the treaty, it did trigger a prompt institutional response. In January the Policy on Cyber Defence was presented and approved. During the Bucharest summit in April, the Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA) and the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) were established. Whereas the CDMA was entrusted with overseeing NATO's cyber defence efforts and providing guidance and assistance to the member countries in case of cyber-related crises, the CCDCOE, located in Estonia, was designed ‘... to enhance the capability, cooperation and information sharing among NATO, NATO nations and partners in cyber defence by virtue of education, research and development, lessons learned and consultation'.\nBoth agencies represent a highly defensive reaction to NATO's security challenges involving cyber warfare. As the Bucharest summit declaration proclaimed, the official cyber policy ‘... emphasizes the need for NATO and nations to protect key information systems in accordance with their respective responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack'. Yet Russia's continued use of cyber warfare during the war in Georgia highlighted its escalatory nature and the possible negative implications on conventional military conflicts. In April 2009, as part of the Declaration on Alliance Security, NATO moved further to identify cyberattacks alongside terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as the key global threats to member states and the international community.\nBut the major breakthrough in NATO strategic thinking regarding cyber warfare, which went beyond the strictly technical aspect of network protection, occurred during mid 2010. A team of leading experts in matters of security, headed by former American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, was asked to prepare a preliminary report to be used as a basis for NATO's new Strategic Concept. According to this report, entitled NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement and submitted in May: The next significant attack on the Alliance may well come down a fibre [sic] optic cable. Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern. However, the risk of a large-scale attack on NATO's command and control systems or energy grids could readily warrant consultations under Article 4 and could possibly lead to collective defence measures under Article 5. Effective cyber defence requires the means to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from attacks.111” Still, the recommendations reflected the defensive posture that was already advocated and implemented thus far by NATO. Furthermore, and extremely relevant to the Alliance's strategic planners, the Albright Commission was reluctant to engage the question of whether cyberattacks against NATO member states would constitute a direct act of aggression that would trigger the collective security clause. Instead, it defined a rather ambiguous principle according to which such a decision must be made considering ‘... the nature, source, scope, and other aspects of the particular security challenge'.112 The same defensive reasoning can be observed in the ensuing final version of the Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon summit six months later. In the words of the document, NATO will: “develop further our ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyberattacks, including by using the NATO planning process to enhance and coordinate national cyber-defence capabilities, bringing all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection, and better integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and response with member nations.113” Yet again, the numerous references to cyber warfare as a security threat were extremely narrow to include at best espionage, hacking, or disruption and there was no discussion about the possibility to conduct pre-emptive or retaliatory cyber warfare.114 In fact, Stephane Abrial, commander of Allied Command Transformation (ACT) responsible for leading the Alliance's transformation of capabilities and forces, was against defining the Strategic Concept's notion of ‘in-depth cyberdefense' as a ‘military-only, or even a military-centric, strategy'. Instead, Abrial focuses on NATO's ‘permanent mission [which] involves countering the daily attempts made by hackers to break into our systems, which are by necessity interconnected, making a weakness in one country's systems a weakness in all'.115 Other key NATO officials, including General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continued to conceptualize cyber warfare in defensive terms, arguing that recent cyberattacks ‘... increased the urgency to strengthen cyber defences not only at NATO, but across the Alliance as a whole'. There is no public discourse involving NATO officials that suggests treating cyber capabilities as an offensive feature of the Alliance's cyber strategy. The most proactive proposal to date was the option to dispatch NATO's cyber Rapid Reaction Teams in order to assist member countries suffering from cyberattacks, or ‘incidents' as Rasmussen calls them, should they ask for such assistance.116 It appears that NATO is focused on prevention of attacks on its institutional assets and member countries rather than initiating cyberattacks against others. As the American representative to the CCDCOE concluded, when it comes to NATO, its major contribution to cyber defence will probably involve eroding the ‘... hacker's greatest advantages -- anonymity'. NATO's strategic thinking will continue to utilize its pooled capabilities in order to promote defensive solutions to cyber warfare of various kinds and it will continue to treat it as a threat rather than as an offensive feature to be proactively utilized.\n## Conclusions Cyber warfare has become the latest buzzword in security studies, but some analysts downplay its importance for both policymakers and military strategists, calling it a ‘distracting and nonsensical' term. Yet while other observers also treat it as a complimentary aspect of modern warfare, they nonetheless underline its unique features, as Lynn publicly did:“The cyberthreat does not involve the existential implications ushered in by the nuclear age, but there are important similarities. Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming US advantages in conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneous and exceedingly hard to trace.”\nThe article initially identified the conceptual factors that determine the offensive or defensive nature of certain military technologies. Then it adjusted these elements in order to fit the information age and its a-territorial nature. Instead of evaluating strategic orientation by traditional Offense-Defensive characteristics like mobility and firepower, the cyber Offense-Defense balance is better assessed for its technological versatility and byte power; the capacity to attack an enemy's assets on different levels (strategic, operative, and tactical), and the degree of destruction that can be inflicted on enemy assets at each of these levels.\nThe article then turned to evaluate the practical influence of cyber warfare on policy and behaviour. The American case, while perhaps being the less confrontational since there was no report of meaningful offensive American use of cyber capabilities against a foreign country or since the United States is able to avoid any direct attribution, was the most documented and comprehensive from an institutional/organizational perspective. The intellectual evolutionary process pursued by officials in the military and civil branches of government is still ongoing, and the United States is far from having a comprehensive cyber strategy. The creation of USCYBERCOM is a significant step, but it is certainly not enough since apparently there is still no highly structured and comprehensive ideational, institutional, and operational outline for American cyber warfare and cyber defence.\nThe case of China is similar in its ambiguity, but for different reasons. Unlike the United States, Beijing is rather secretive in treating its cyber posture just as it is generally reluctant to fully expose its military apparatus, causing American policymakers, military officials, and legislators to repeatedly criticize China's lack of transparency in matters related to its defence budget and the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s modernization. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that China not only has a very clear vision for its cyber posture as part of the country's wider military and technological modernization process, but it is also willing to use these capabilities in order to erode American military advantage. While Beijing is allegedly more interested in cyber espionage in order to obtain secret and up-to-date information about American capabilities and critical infrastructure, it will probably not shy away from using the same technology in order to curtail certain American assets, primarily non-combative ones (electric power plants etc.) and this may indicate that future Sino-American armed conflict will be augmented with vigorous cyber warfare.123 As a recent report submitted to Congress asserted, China's history of cyber warfare and its growing integration into the country's military strategy ‘suggests that the PLA may strike with Computer Network Operations (CNOs) and Electronic Warfare (EW) weapons in the opening phases of a conflict to degrade enemy information systems rather than attempt a traditional force-on-force attack directly where the PLA is at a disadvantage against more technologically advanced countries like the US'.124 The Russian case seemingly presents a better opportunity to observe the influence of cyber warfare on decisions of war and peace. From the empirical record it is evident that Russia explicitly used its cyber capabilities in both the Estonian and Georgian incidents, even if Moscow also used by-proxy entities for that purpose.125 The first incident was, of course, more of a diplomatic manoeuvre in order to curb Estonia's anti-Russian attitudes as the Kremlin perceived the matter. There was classical Soviet-era use of Russian ‘political activists' in order to encourage street unrest and orchestrated anti-government protests, but there was also the use of cyber warfare in order to paralyse then Estonian banking system and other key government agencies. Thus, one should treat this episode as an experiment in utilizing cyber capabilities in order to obtain certain political means. As the case of the Georgian war illustrated, this time cyber warfare was an integral, if not a decisive, part of the policymaking process and the military activities aimed at subduing the ‘defiant' Saakashvili administration. Clearly, the conventional dimension of the conflict was predominant, mainly due to the technological profile of Georgia's critical infrastructure, but the Russian use of cyberattacks hampered Georgian domestic vital communications between different branches of the government and completely prevented any Georgian IW counterattack.126 NATO's cyber posture reflects the Alliance's historical defensive raison d'être that was articulated during the Cold War and reaffirmed following its end. For NATO officials, cyber warfare relates primarily to attempts by foreign actors to penetrate the organization's computer and information networks in order to retrieve confidential data. They are deeply reluctant to widen their approach to define such attacks as a cause for triggering the collective security clause of the treaty. Hence when Estonia was under Russian cyberattack, the most that NATO was able to offer Tallinn was technical assistance in reactivating and protecting its ICT networks from future attacks. Furthermore, even amid the Albright Commission's call to devise and implement a comprehensive cyber strategy, the institutional response was minor and essentially focused on network protection rather than explicit cyber deterrence, let alone an offensive reorientation.\nCONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY The use of cyber capabilities makes a difference for policymakers since it allows them to minimize the risks of taking certain offensive actions and it is a relatively effective low-cost alternative, as the Israeli attack on Syria suggests, and it will become more common in the future. Cyber warfare, like all other forms of combat, is a political expression nonetheless in that there is a need for a conscious decision to apply it in order to achieve certain objectives. In the cases reviewed in this article, cyber capabilities were used selectively and in different intensities, as illustrated by the American reluctance to use pre-emptive cyber warfare against Libya. Hence future research should look at the way cyber warfare is prioritized over conventional/kinetic options in order to elucidate the conditions under which policymakers will prefer the former over the latter and vice versa. Furthermore, such studies should empirically appraise how integral cyber warfare has become at the strategic, operative, and tactical levels.\nOverall, cyber warfare is becoming an accepted military expedient since it allows leaders to achieve their political objectives with much less risk in the short term, even if in the long term it may actually lead to 'non-cyber' escalation.[127] Prussian strategist and military thinker Carl von Clausewitz wrote long ago that '... a prince or a general can best demonstrate his genius by managing a campaign exactly to suit his objectives and his resources, doing neither too much nor too little'.[128] Cyber warfare allows policymakers and the military to do exactly that, and with additional adjustments realism can help to better explain the process even if there is more work to be done in pursuit of this goal.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS An earlier version of this article was presented at the annual meeting of the Israeli Association for International Studies (IAIS), Herzliya, 25 December 2011.

It was assaulted with what appears to be a combination of electronic attack and precision bombs to enable the Israeli force to enter and exit Syrian airspace. Almost immediately, the entire Syrian radar system went off the air for a period of time that included the raid.² This incident, along with others discussed here, suggests that we are in the course of a new era, similar to past transformations in international security, such as the airplane, the tank, or the nuclear bomb, innovations that culminated in radical departures in strategic thinking and behaviour. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) not only drives the internet, the iPhone, or the Global Positioning System (GPS). Nowadays, ICT has become an integral and possibly an essential military Contemporary Security Policy, Vol.34, No.1, 2013, pp.40-63 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2013.771031 © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis capability. The cyber sphere of action it created is replacing the conventional battlefield.3 Some observers argue that for realists cyber warfare is ‘old wine in a new bottle'; its added value is rather marginal.4 This downplays the broader implications of cyber warfare, stressing only technical aspects and focusing on information warfare (IW), one operative manifestation of cyber warfare, rather than the possibilities for political/military chain reaction that cyber warfare may prompt, ending in armed conflict.5 Consequently, this article is not concerned with specific cyber tactics like computer-based commercial espionage or phishing per se. Rather, this analysis stresses the integration of ICT applications aimed at disrupting, paralysing, and possibly destroying another state's assets, with a direct bearing on national security and critical infrastructure, and especially its capacity to conduct military operations.6 This article has two main objectives. First, despite the large number of studies dealing with cyber warfare, we are still lacking a realist theoretical conceptualization of its influence on international security in general and on the pervasiveness of war in particular.7 This analysis examines the relevance of realism as a technologically, rather than a territorially, based explanation for international security in the information age. Considering the fact that ‘[r]ealist theories... still provide a context and motivation for many of the most important theoretical debates in the field', as Jack Donnelly asserts, it is almost inconceivable that realism will not take a shot at explaining the dramatic technological shift in the security environment caused by cyber warfare.8 This article employs realist Offense-Defense theory to evaluate the expected effect of ICT on the prevalence of war, using the most suitable realist framework to explore the nexus between technological innovation and international politics, and especially questions of war and peace.9 In contrast to other scholars, who apply Offense-Defense theory to support cyber deterrence, this treatment stresses the need to dramatically modify Offense-Defense terminology to better address cyber warfare's unique and revolutionary features.10 Second, this article tests this Offense-Defense framework, empirically evaluating the role of cyber warfare in contemporary military strategic thinking and state behaviour. The evolving cyber postures of China, Russia, NATO, and the United States show to what extent cyber warfare concepts have gained traction among leaders, strategists, and military planners. Since we are dealing with ongoing technological developments, their policy implications far from determined, this study is more of a probe into a possible future rather than a final ruling. Nevertheless, from existing evidence it is possible to infer that ICT allows states to take greater risks and thus adopt more vigilant or offensive positions vis-à-vis their adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but their existence makes the decision to escalate armed conflict easier and considerably cheaper. ICT can be considered a strategic enabler and an efficient force multiplier that provides the attacker with greater freedom of action.\n\nThe article first, briefly, discusses the current status of Offense-Defense theory and suggests a fundamental conceptual amendment to allow realism to better incorporate cyber warfare into accounts of contemporary international security. It then proceeds to evaluate the cyber Offense-Defense balance to locate its strategic orientation. The cyber posture of four of the prominent actors in contemporary world affairs -- China, Russia, NATO, and the United States -- are examined in order to assess the effect of the cyber Offense-Defense balance on their security policies.\nIt is the conclusion of this article that for realism to maintain its relevance, it must transcend traditional territorial and kinetic traits of international security, or at least give more room for novel technological factors, and consider cyberspace as an alternative realm that states utilize to attack others. ICT and employment of cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if not a sufficient one, and realism must adjust its theoretical foundations and predictions accordingly. At a minimum, cyber warfare is an influential force multiplier or conflict enabler. At a maximum, it is a strategic game changer.11 But while the potential of cyber warfare to revolutionize international security and interstate conflict is dramatic, the scale of this transformation will be determined by political rather than technological considerations.\n\n---\n\n## ## The Politics of Cyberwar and Peace Generally speaking, America, China, and Russia have long histories of attempting to combine political aims with advanced technology, while NATO primarily benefited from the American efforts. The Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), warmly adopted by the Americans in the late 1980s and successfully implemented during the Gulf War, was in fact an adaptation of the 1970s Soviet Military-Technical Revolution (MTR). As Elliot Cohen observes, the idea was to promote ‘... an imminent technical revolution that would give conventional weapons a level of effectiveness in the field comparable to that of small tactical nuclear weapons'.\n\nThe following accounts describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures to assess the influence of ICT-based capabilities on strategic thinking and behaviour. There is an important caveat to this analysis; cyber warfare suffers from a major problem of attributing attacks to specific state actors. Some of the cases discussed below include acts by non-state actors such as individuals, hacktivists, netizens, or more organized cyber militias and cyber gangs. Nevertheless, there is a growing consensus in the literature that these non-state actors mostly operate in tandem with national governments and follow their lead as proxies and their contribution should be considered an integral part of a state's overall cyber policy.\nGiven America's growing reliance on ICT in the battlefield and in the supportive and logistical military formations, and repeated reports concerning a breach of computer networks such as in the case of the air force's Rome Air Development Center in March 1994, it became clear that this virtual Achilles heel must be protected. In 1995, the Clinton administration's national security strategy proclaimed that ‘the threat of intrusions to our military and commercial information systems poses a significant risk to national security and must be addressed'. In June 1997 the US government conducted Eligible Receiver, the very first information warfare (IW) exercise that exposed the vulnerability of American military and civilian critical infrastructures in case of a coordinated cyberattack.\nBut as American policymakers and strategists feared their vital technological structures, they also become increasingly interested in exploiting this new strategic domain in their favour. Indeed, while the Kosovo war was overwhelmingly won by conducting conventional massive air bombing against Serb targets, some observers asserted that the accuracy and efficiency of these aerial campaigns were the outcome of cyber warfare-like operations, especially in directing the bombers to their targets from the ground. Furthermore, while it is not exactly clear what additional cyber measures were used against Serb targets, it was reported that the United States and NATO conducted various sophisticated cyberattacks that included penetrations of Serbian ICT systems and overloading them with data or manipulating their databases. Hence the use of cyber capabilities at the operational level was not only disruptive in nature but also proactive and offensive in its attempt to frustrate Serbian defensive formation and retaliatory military options.\nDuring the War on Terror campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, cyber warfare did not play a significant role. In both cases, the United States had virtually no critical ICT assets to attack or disrupt and the focus was on traditional, if irregular, combat operations. Nevertheless, it was reported that a month before the Iraq War began, President Bush signed a secret directive ordering the development of an American strategy for large-scale pre-emptive cyberattacks against adversaries of the United States.\nIt was then reported that the United States was pre-emptively cutting off the Iraqi computer network and internet grid that connected civilian and government agencies before war began in March 2003. According to Richard Clarke, the Iraqi Defense Ministry's email system was hacked by the Americans in order to warn high-ranking officers about opposing the future invasion and to assure them that the objective was to overthrow Saddam Hussein and not to destroy Iraq's political, military, and socioeconomic structures. Another path that was explored but not pursued was hacking into the regime's financial institutions and foreign bank accounts in order to locate Saddam Hussein's hidden assets.\nAt about the same time, Chinese hackers apparently orchestrated a major cyberattack on American computer systems at NASA and Sandia National Laboratories. It was made clearer following these incidents and others that the United States must re-evaluate its cyber policy and possibly change its approach. Yet the discourse remained rather defensive, primarily focused on protecting American critical infrastructure and confidential databases. When George W. Bush published his administration's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003, its objective was ‘... to secure the portions of cyberspace that they own, operate, control, or with which they interact'. The military establishment, on the other hand, was much more assertive in its approach to cyber warfare, as the 2004 Military Strategy asserted: The Armed Forces must have the ability to operate across the air, land, sea, space and cyberspace domains of the battlespace... The non-linear nature of the current security environment requires multi-layered active and passive measures to counter numerous diverse conventional and asymmetric threats... They also include threats in cyberspace aimed at networks and data critical to US information-enabled systems. Such threats require a comprehensive concept of deterrence encompassing traditional adversaries, terrorist networks and rogue states able to employ any range of capabilities.52” The 2005 National Defense Strategy further proclaimed that alongside traditional and irregular security challenges the United States confronts, cyberwarfare may constitute a threat that under certain conditions “... can fundamentally alter long-established concepts of warfare. Some potential adversaries are seeking disruptive capabilities to exploit US vulnerabilities and offset the current advantages of the United States and its partners'.53 Consequently, the stated military applications of cyber capabilities were made more offensive than ever a year later when the 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations noted:“[T]he United States must have cyberspace superiority to ensure our freedom of action and deny the same to our adversaries through the integration of network defense, exploitation, and attack... Offensive capabilities in cyberspace offer the United States and our adversaries an opportunity to gain and maintain the initiative. DOD cyberspace operations are strongest when offensive and defensive capabilities are mutually supporting. This requires a long-range focus and dedicated resources to achieve this goal.54” The director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Keith Alexander, argued in 2007 that the United States should reformulate the operational and institutional foundations of its cyber posture in order to address the technologically induced security environment, since “while we have ample national level strategies, we have yet to translate these strategies into operational art through development of joint doctrine for cyberspace. Through the doctrine vetting process, we can develop a common understanding of what it means to conduct warfare within and through cyberspace.55” Indeed, in early 2008 President Bush issued a directive that allows American intelligence agencies, especially the NSA, to monitor all internet traffic of the federal government in order to protect vital assets from cyberattacks. What makes this directive a major turning point in American cyber warfare evolution is that under Bush's initiative, the NSA with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) could provide the Pentagon with evidence that a pre-emptive cyberattack is crucial in order to protect American critical infrastructure.56 In early 2009, soon after taking office, President Barack Obama announced his administration's cyber policy, which remained rather committed to the defensive notion of protecting and securing critical infrastructure in what was often referred to as cyber security.57 Yet in April it was reported that the White House was, in fact, in the final stages of establishing a new cyber agency under the Pentagon's authority which could develop offensive cyber weapons alongside defending American ICT critical infrastructure. Former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, was appointed as director of the Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and while he was rather cautious in attributing any offensive aspects to the new command, the Pentagon declared that the mission of this new agency was to:“[d]irect the operations and defence of specified Department of Defense information networks [involving some 90,000 military personnel] and prepare to, when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, [to] ensure US allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.”\nMore recently, it was reported that the Pentagon is formulating a particular strategy that will engage the threats emanating from cyber warfare under the premise that any such attack on behalf of a foreign country constitutes a declaration of war that may result in armed conflict. In effect, however, President Obama did not approve a pre-emptive cyber offensive against Libya before the United States led the military campaign against Muammar Qaddafi in March 2011. The idea was to use cyber warfare in order to hinder Libya's air defence systems, but the option was abandoned, according to some government officials, because the Obama administration feared it would act as a precedent for Russian or Chinese future offensive attacks. One Defense Department official said the cyber options ‘... were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya's air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn't pan out'. Another White House official argued that ‘[t]hese cybercapabilities are still like the Ferrari that you keep in the garage and only take out for the big race and not just for a run around town, unless nothing else can get you there'.\nIn the aftermath of the war in Libya, the White House attempted to provide the most comprehensive and inclusive cyber strategy to date. But despite the clear defensive tone of the document, especially when considering the ambiguity of the parts relating to cyber deterrence mechanisms, there was more than a hint of offensive reasoning:“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic -- as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.”\nThe debate concerning the defensive or offensive posture of American cyber strategy or its passive or proactive nature is still ongoing. Recently, General Robert Kehler, Commander of US Strategic Command that oversees CYBERCOM, commented that the optimal solution would involve both: ‘I think we are looking at what an offensive component would be: what does that look like? What kind of options would we want to be able to offer? I think that we have always said that there needs to be an offense and defense mix'. These questions remain unanswered.\n### Chinese Cyber Posture It is extremely difficult to fully account for the cyber posture of China and its development over the years. In China, defence-related transparency is a rare commodity. Yet it is widely known and established that the Chinese pursued a robust modernization in military technology and tactics from the late 1970s. Maoist ideology not only determined the political and societal structure of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its inception in 1949, it also served as China's military national defence strategy in that it revolved around the concept of ‘People's War' and the mobilization of the masses for a protracted armed conflict. After the death of Mao in 1976, and under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, a new conceptualization of Chinese warfare emerged that gradually became highly receptive to technological, industrial, and economic developments, making the entire defence apparatus much more open to engage the challenge of future armed conflict in the information age. From an operative vantage point, China gradually abandoned Mao's conception of active defence in favour of a pre-emptive military orientation that advocates a first strike mentality.\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, which strained Sino-American relations, highlighted historical anti-Western sentiments and created a shaky setting for the post-Cold War era. Consequently, by the mid 1990s China was caught paradoxically in an international constellation that was just as challenging as the Cold War international system. American intentions to redraw the global and regional landscape, and especially Washington's reactions to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, were badly received in Beijing. Consequently, the United States was increasingly considered to be a major source of danger to China's national interests and political order.\nAmerican military performance during the Gulf War highlighted the technological inferiority of the PLA and encouraged the Chinese leadership to accelerate and broaden existing plans to modernize and improve the army's capabilities for the purpose of potentially waging a limited or local war. Indeed, newly elected General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Jiang Zemin was confident that a comprehensive modernization of the Chinese armed forces amid what he considered American military superiority and interference in China's internal affairs was of great importance. Thus, he encouraged technological modernization according to American standards when he told members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in early 1993 that ‘[w]e must win high-tech, small-scale wars under modern conditions'. Similarly, the Chairman of the Commission on Science, Technology and National Defense Industry (COSTIND) General Ding Henggao warned that ‘[t]he one who possesses high-tech superiority will have the upper hand on the battlefield'.\nModernizing and increasing the professionalism of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was also matched with vigorous ICT-based innovation. As Major General Weng Pufang, former director of the Strategy Department of the Chinese Academy of Military Science, argued in a 1995 article he published in a Chinese military journal:“The thrust of China's military construction and development of weapons and equipment will no longer be toward strengthening the ‘firepower antipersonnel system' of the industrial age, but toward the strengthening of information technology, information weapons and information networking. Our sights must not be fixed on the firepower warfare of the industrial age, rather they must be trained on the information warfare of the information age.74” The PLA became highly interested in exploiting these technological innovations and restructured its ICT-based military units to comprise the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Department (GSD), currently entrusted with exploitation of foreign computer networks, whereas the Fourth Department of the GSD is responsible for attacking foreign computer networks.75 Indeed, after an agreement with Cuba was signed in February 1998, China built two cyber warfare stations, one eavesdropping telephone and internet communications in the United States and the other more concerned with monitoring American military satellite systems.76 But in addition to these military units, the Chinese government has reportedly outsourced some of its cyber warfare tasks to civilian groups that are systematically activated and thus enable greater international flexibility due to cyber warfare's attribution problem.77 In the early 2000s, Beijing was ostensibly involved in numerous successful attempts to hack into American databases and critical infrastructure such as nuclear and electric power plants, satellite systems, and a number of Department of Defense contractors that store confidential information and blueprints of future weapon systems.78 China also launched an ambitious anti-satellite weapons program aimed at levelling the odds against American espionage and to attack satellite systems that are perceived by Beijing as utterly anti-Chinese in nature.79 Hence, China's cyber posture is primarily a deterrent against American military superiority but it has deep and conscious long-term advantages that Beijing may cash in on in time of need. In fact, China's cyber posture will only benefit an offensive orientation compared with the current defensive traits of the American cyber posture if Beijing needs to prevent Washington from interfering in matters related to Taiwan, for example.80 China's 2000 Defense White Paper explicitly adhered to this transformative phase of the PLA's posture into an ICT-based modernized army:“Faced with the world's military developments and the characteristics of modern warfare, the Chinese armed forces will, in the course of modernizing their weaponry, devote themselves to transforming semi-mechanized and mechanized weapon systems to automatized and informationized systems as soon as possible, so that they can possess weapons as advanced as possible and assure the accomplishment of the sacred missions assigned to them by the nation.81” A report submitted to the American Congress in 2007 argued that China not only possesses the cyber capabilities required to conduct comprehensive offensive cyberattacks against the United States: ‘In 2005, the PLA began to incorporate offensive CYBER POSTURING AND THE OFFENSE-DEFENSE BALANCE Computer Network Operations (CNOs) into its exercises, primarily in first strikes against enemy networks'. Indeed, China's 2008 Defense White Paper proclaimed in the sections dealing with the technological dimensions of modern warfare that China is accelerating reform and innovation in its defense-related science, technology and industry... Defense-related science, technology and industry are striving to enhance the informationization of weaponry and equipment design and development, and to render product design more digitalized, modularized, standardized and reliable.[83] In sum, the Chinese consider cyber warfare and its auxiliary elements as a power multiplier, integral to their national security strategy. Thus far, China has refrained from presenting a comprehensive cyber strategy but in practice it has primarily involved strategic and tactical hacking into American and other Western countries' databases and internet systems for reasons of technological and operative military espionage. While there were numerous indications of China's involvement in penetrating critical ICT-based infrastructure in the United States, Beijing has not used its existing cyber assets thus far to directly attack American strategic military assets in order to neutralize them but instead has focused on cyber spying. This pattern may change under certain conditions, especially if Beijing wishes to diversify its policy alternatives in case of a Sino-American confrontation.[84] ## Russian Cyber Posture Whereas in the two previous cases the strategizing of ICT as military capabilities was ambiguous at best, and there was certainly no actual use of cyber warfare as part of armed conflict, the case of Russia in the first decade of the 21st century can be easily dubbed as an exemplary case for the opposite. To begin with, during most of the 1990s Russia was grappling with the devastating economic, social, and political effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign and defence policy was primarily focused on '... disarmament and limitation of the arms race - in terms of releasing as many resources as possible and creating the most favorable conditions for the implementation of our socioeconomic reforms'.[85] In December 1994, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signalled his intention to alter Russia's foreign and defence orientation when he decided to invade Chechnya, a conflict that '... demonstrated the full extent of the armed forces' decline. In virtually every respect, the Russian military failed the challenge it was supposed to easily master'.[86] By 1996, in face of failure in Chechnya and growing domestic opposition, Yeltsin moved to replace the moderate and pro-Western Kozyrev with Yevgeny Primakov who also served as Prime Minister between September 1998 and May 1999. Indicatively, in his first press conference Primakov asserted that 'Russia was and remains a great power. Her foreign policy should correspond to that status'.[87] The weaknesses of Russia's conventional and non-conventional military postures led many Russian military thinkers and officials to regard ICT-based capabilities as a way to compensate for strategic inferiority. During the mid 1990s, the Russian Army CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY and Defense Ministry began seriously examining the nexus between technology and the regular military structure.⁸⁸ Russia was openly using IW during the second Chechen war.⁸⁹ The first major indication of coordinated Russian cyber warfare (in addition to IW) took place in Estonia in 2007, after a monument commemorating the Red Army’s re-conquest of Estonia during the Second World War was moved despite the Kremlin’s explicit warning.⁹⁰ Rather than exclusively resorting to military force in order to resolve what Moscow considered explicit anti-Russian reactionary sentiments and policies, as they did during the Chechen military campaigns in 1994 and 1999 for example, this time Moscow pursued a much more sophisticated approach that included inducing political riots in Estonia and targeting Estonia’s ICT infrastructure such as the banking sector, parliament’s website and email system, emergency phone lines, hospitals, and universities.⁹¹ During a period of several weeks in May 2007, after the statue was relocated, official Estonian governmental websites and vital telecommunications infrastructure were attacked and rendered inactive, according to most accounts, by Russian perpetrators.⁹² Russian policymakers began to appreciate the role of ICT and cyber warfare as an auxiliary instrument of coercion and statecraft against what they considered uncooperative regimes in the post-Soviet rim. And the lessons learned during the Estonian affair were apparently applied as part of Russia’s involvement in the Georgian war in August 2008.⁹³ Essentially, in response to Georgia’s attack against South Ossetia, Russian forces invaded Georgia and practically subdued it within a matter of days. Yet even before the first bullet was fired, the Kremlin decided to employ a preemptive strategic disruptive cyber attack.⁹⁴ In mid July, several cyberattacks were waged against Georgian websites and two weeks later a second wave of cyberattacks on Georgian targets was detected. A few days into the war, the vast majority of Georgian government websites were not functioning; in effect, the Georgian government was, as one study asserted, ‘cyber-locked’, without viable access to the internet and to its state-run agencies including the National Bank of Georgia.⁹⁵ No less important, the Georgian government was unable to communicate with the citizens or conduct its own retaliatory IW against Russia.⁹⁶ Fortunately for Georgia, and unlike in the Estonian case, critical infrastructure such as the electrical power grid is far less modernized and consequently more difficult to damage by using ICT-based capabilities.⁹⁷ In February 2010, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev approved the new Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation where some key references to the use of cyber warfare as an instrumental offensive military capability can be clearly observed. For example, when dealing with the features of modern military conflicts, the document states that such one trait, from Russia’s perspective, is the ‘... early conduct [of] information warfare activities to achieve political objectives without the use of military force, and subsequently – in the interest of creating a favorable reaction of the international community – to use military force’. And when referring to Russian future acquisition plans for the armed forces, the doctrine highlights that a key task involves the ‘... development of the forces and means of information warfare’.⁹⁸ In early 2012 the Russian Ministry of Defense revealed the Kremlin's cyber strategy under the title Conceptual Views Regarding the Activity of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space. It refrains from referring to offensive cyber warfare, but it does address issues pertaining to control, prevention, and solution of cyber conflicts. The document acknowledges the right of Russia to employ counteroffensive cyber warfare: ‘The escalation of a conflict in the cyber-space and its turn into a crisis gives the right to an individual or collective self-defense and the use of any means necessary that do not contradict the universally accepted norms and the principles of international law'. Based on Russia's past behaviour and the recent proclamation of its cyber strategy, it appears that Moscow may be more than willing to use different forms of cyber warfare should political needs emerge.\n### NATO Cyber Posture Thus far, our empirical description has exclusively focused on state actors, but since NATO plays such a major role in the contemporary security environment it seems that examining the way it relates to cyber warfare will present a more accurate account for our purposes. Interestingly enough, despite NATO's transparency on the whole, there is very little access to the more operational and sometimes technical aspects of the Alliance's cyber strategy. Nevertheless, from the available materials we can identify NATO's defensive approach to cyber warfare and cyber security.\nOriginally, NATO was not only established to address the Soviet threat in Europe. Lord Ismay, NATO's first Secretary General, contended that its objectives were to keep ‘the Russians out, the Germans down, and the Americans in'. After the Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, NATO had to reinvent itself and identify new objectives in order to preserve its relevance and mere existence. The multiplicity of political and military goals combined with the willingness of its member states enabled NATO to successfully overcome this transitional period and undergo a process of remarkable institutional change that resulted in a renewed transatlantic mandate to develop new mechanisms and strategies in order to cope with the changing security environment.\nThe treatment of cyber warfare as part of NATO's evolving security concerns became decidedly evident in the early 2000s. Unlike the United States, China, or Russia, who were individually concerned with cyber warfare of various kinds and for different reasons as described earlier, throughout the 1990s NATO was primarily focused on its internal restructuring, the expansion eastwards to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and, of course, militarily operating in the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia.\nThe 1999 Strategic Concept declared that ‘[s]tate and non-state adversaries may try to exploit the Alliance's growing reliance on information systems through information operations designed to disrupt such systems. They may attempt to use strategies of this kind to counter NATO's superiority in traditional weaponry'. Yet the first explicit reference to cyber warfare was actually made in November 2002 during NATO's Prague summit, when it was declared that the member countries decided to ‘... strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber attacks'. One operative outcome was the establishment of NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which was charged with the task of protecting ICT infrastructure and networks from unauthorized intrusion for espionage purposes or attempts to infect them with viruses. But this was a rather technical organ lacking any long-term military planning capacity, a feature that did not change significantly even following NATO's summit in Riga in November 2006 which further called for developing cyber-deterrence capabilities and doctrines. Russian cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 explicated NATO's military, infrastructural, and political weaknesses in the face of this new form of security threat, but the response as articulated by NATO's defence ministers was remarkably protective, arguing that ‘[u]rgent work is needed to enhance the ability to protect information systems of critical importance'.\nIn early 2008 it was reported that NATO officials further debated the need to protect the Alliance's assets against future cyberattacks, claiming that ‘[c]yber defence is now mentioned at the highest level along with missile defence and energy security'. While the attacks against Estonia did not result in the application of the collective security clause of the treaty, it did trigger a prompt institutional response. In January the Policy on Cyber Defence was presented and approved. During the Bucharest summit in April, the Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA) and the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) were established. Whereas the CDMA was entrusted with overseeing NATO's cyber defence efforts and providing guidance and assistance to the member countries in case of cyber-related crises, the CCDCOE, located in Estonia, was designed ‘... to enhance the capability, cooperation and information sharing among NATO, NATO nations and partners in cyber defence by virtue of education, research and development, lessons learned and consultation'.\nBoth agencies represent a highly defensive reaction to NATO's security challenges involving cyber warfare. As the Bucharest summit declaration proclaimed, the official cyber policy ‘... emphasizes the need for NATO and nations to protect key information systems in accordance with their respective responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack'. Yet Russia's continued use of cyber warfare during the war in Georgia highlighted its escalatory nature and the possible negative implications on conventional military conflicts. In April 2009, as part of the Declaration on Alliance Security, NATO moved further to identify cyberattacks alongside terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as the key global threats to member states and the international community.\nBut the major breakthrough in NATO strategic thinking regarding cyber warfare, which went beyond the strictly technical aspect of network protection, occurred during mid 2010. A team of leading experts in matters of security, headed by former American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, was asked to prepare a preliminary report to be used as a basis for NATO's new Strategic Concept. According to this report, entitled NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement and submitted in May: The next significant attack on the Alliance may well come down a fibre [sic] optic cable. Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern. However, the risk of a large-scale attack on NATO's command and control systems or energy grids could readily warrant consultations under Article 4 and could possibly lead to collective defence measures under Article 5. Effective cyber defence requires the means to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from attacks.111” Still, the recommendations reflected the defensive posture that was already advocated and implemented thus far by NATO. Furthermore, and extremely relevant to the Alliance's strategic planners, the Albright Commission was reluctant to engage the question of whether cyberattacks against NATO member states would constitute a direct act of aggression that would trigger the collective security clause. Instead, it defined a rather ambiguous principle according to which such a decision must be made considering ‘... the nature, source, scope, and other aspects of the particular security challenge'.112 The same defensive reasoning can be observed in the ensuing final version of the Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon summit six months later. In the words of the document, NATO will: “develop further our ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyberattacks, including by using the NATO planning process to enhance and coordinate national cyber-defence capabilities, bringing all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection, and better integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and response with member nations.113” Yet again, the numerous references to cyber warfare as a security threat were extremely narrow to include at best espionage, hacking, or disruption and there was no discussion about the possibility to conduct pre-emptive or retaliatory cyber warfare.114 In fact, Stephane Abrial, commander of Allied Command Transformation (ACT) responsible for leading the Alliance's transformation of capabilities and forces, was against defining the Strategic Concept's notion of ‘in-depth cyberdefense' as a ‘military-only, or even a military-centric, strategy'. Instead, Abrial focuses on NATO's ‘permanent mission [which] involves countering the daily attempts made by hackers to break into our systems, which are by necessity interconnected, making a weakness in one country's systems a weakness in all'.115 Other key NATO officials, including General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continued to conceptualize cyber warfare in defensive terms, arguing that recent cyberattacks ‘... increased the urgency to strengthen cyber defences not only at NATO, but across the Alliance as a whole'. There is no public discourse involving NATO officials that suggests treating cyber capabilities as an offensive feature of the Alliance's cyber strategy. The most proactive proposal to date was the option to dispatch NATO's cyber Rapid Reaction Teams in order to assist member countries suffering from cyberattacks, or ‘incidents' as Rasmussen calls them, should they ask for such assistance.116 It appears that NATO is focused on prevention of attacks on its institutional assets and member countries rather than initiating cyberattacks against others. As the American representative to the CCDCOE concluded, when it comes to NATO, its major contribution to cyber defence will probably involve eroding the ‘... hacker's greatest advantages -- anonymity'. NATO's strategic thinking will continue to utilize its pooled capabilities in order to promote defensive solutions to cyber warfare of various kinds and it will continue to treat it as a threat rather than as an offensive feature to be proactively utilized.",

    "# Cyber Posturing and the Offense-Defense Balance\n\nILAI SALTZMAN\n\nFor some realists, cyber warfare is 'old wine in new bottles', with marginal added value. This misses the larger possibilities for political/military chain reactions that cyber warfare may prompt, possibly leading to armed conflict. This article utilizes Offense-Defense theory to appraise the influence of cyber warfare on international security and the prospects for conflict. Offense-Defense theory, as applied here, better explains the relationship between technological innovation and international politics, and leads to different conclusions from other realist approaches. Redefining the Offense-Defense balance to accommodate cyberspace leads to an emphasis on the offensive advantages of cyber capabilities. The offensive and defensive cyber postures of China, Russia, the United States, and NATO are examined here to empirically assess the role of cyber warfare in security policy. Evidence shows that innovations in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) allow states to take greater risks and adopt more vigilant or offensive positions toward adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but make decisions to escalate easier and cheaper. A strategic enabler that provides attackers greater freedom of action, cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if it is not a sufficient one.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn September 2007, Israeli military cyber warriors reportedly hacked into the Syrian monitoring and anti-aircraft missile defences to allow Israeli fighter jets to bomb the suspected nuclear reactor near Deir el-Zor.¹ As described by one account:\n\n[T]he main attack was preceded by an engagement with a single Syrian radar site at Tall al-Abuad near the Turkish border. It was assaulted with what appears to be a combination of electronic attack and precision bombs to enable the Israeli force to enter and exit Syrian airspace. Almost immediately, the entire Syrian radar system went off the air for a period of time that included the raid.²\n\nThis incident, along with others discussed here, suggests that we are in the course of a new era, similar to past transformations in international security, such as the airplane, the tank, or the nuclear bomb, innovations that culminated in radical departures in strategic thinking and behaviour. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) not only drives the internet, the iPhone, or the Global Positioning System (GPS). Nowadays, ICT has become an integral and possibly an essential military\n\nContemporary Security Policy, Vol.34, No.1, 2013, pp.40-63\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2013.771031 © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis",
    "capability. The cyber sphere of action it created is replacing the conventional battlefield.3\n\nSome observers argue that for realists cyber warfare is ‘old wine in a new bottle'; its added value is rather marginal.4 This downplays the broader implications of cyber warfare, stressing only technical aspects and focusing on information warfare (IW), one operative manifestation of cyber warfare, rather than the possibilities for political/military chain reaction that cyber warfare may prompt, ending in armed conflict.5 Consequently, this article is not concerned with specific cyber tactics like computer-based commercial espionage or phishing per se. Rather, this analysis stresses the integration of ICT applications aimed at disrupting, paralysing, and possibly destroying another state's assets, with a direct bearing on national security and critical infrastructure, and especially its capacity to conduct military operations.6\n\nThis article has two main objectives. First, despite the large number of studies dealing with cyber warfare, we are still lacking a realist theoretical conceptualization of its influence on international security in general and on the pervasiveness of war in particular.7 This analysis examines the relevance of realism as a technologically, rather than a territorially, based explanation for international security in the information age. Considering the fact that ‘[r]ealist theories ... still provide a context and motivation for many of the most important theoretical debates in the field', as Jack Donnelly asserts, it is almost inconceivable that realism will not take a shot at explaining the dramatic technological shift in the security environment caused by cyber warfare.8 This article employs realist Offense-Defense theory to evaluate the expected effect of ICT on the prevalence of war, using the most suitable realist framework to explore the nexus between technological innovation and international politics, and especially questions of war and peace.9 In contrast to other scholars, who apply Offense-Defense theory to support cyber deterrence, this treatment stresses the need to dramatically modify Offense-Defense terminology to better address cyber warfare's unique and revolutionary features.10\n\nSecond, this article tests this Offense-Defense framework, empirically evaluating the role of cyber warfare in contemporary military strategic thinking and state behaviour. The evolving cyber postures of China, Russia, NATO, and the United States show to what extent cyber warfare concepts have gained traction among leaders, strategists, and military planners. Since we are dealing with ongoing technological developments, their policy implications far from determined, this study is more of a probe into a possible future rather than a final ruling. Nevertheless, from existing evidence it is possible to infer that ICT allows states to take greater risks and thus adopt more vigilant or offensive positions vis-à-vis their adversaries. Cyber capabilities do not cause armed conflict, but their existence makes the decision to escalate armed conflict easier and considerably cheaper. ICT can be considered a strategic enabler and an efficient force multiplier that provides the attacker with greater freedom of action.\n\nThe article first, briefly, discusses the current status of Offense-Defense theory and suggests a fundamental conceptual amendment to allow realism to better incorporate cyber warfare into accounts of contemporary international security. It then proceeds to evaluate the cyber Offense-Defense balance to locate its strategic orientation. The cyber posture of four of the prominent actors in contemporary world",
    "affairs -- China, Russia, NATO, and the United States -- are examined in order to assess the effect of the cyber Offense-Defense balance on their security policies.\n\nIt is the conclusion of this article that for realism to maintain its relevance, it must transcend traditional territorial and kinetic traits of international security, or at least give more room for novel technological factors, and consider cyberspace as an alternative realm that states utilize to attack others. ICT and employment of cyber warfare is becoming a necessary condition for the conduct of war, even if not a sufficient one, and realism must adjust its theoretical foundations and predictions accordingly. At a minimum, cyber warfare is an influential force multiplier or conflict enabler. At a maximum, it is a strategic game changer.11 But while the potential of cyber warfare to revolutionize international security and interstate conflict is dramatic, the scale of this transformation will be determined by political rather than technological considerations.\n\n## Cybernating Offense-Defense Theory\n\nOffense-Defense theory has generated heated debates ever since it was introduced by Robert Jervis and George Quester in the late 1970s.12 Jervis contended that the orientation of different military capabilities and weaponry systems may influence interstate security dilemmas and therefore the prevalence of war or peace. ‘When we say that the offense has the advantage, we simply mean that it is easier to destroy the other's army', he explains. ‘When the defense has the advantage, it is easier to protect and hold than it is to move forward, destroy and take.' Quester, applying the same logic, concluded that ‘likelihoods of war are thus clearly influenced by how effective the offensive weapon seems to be, as compared with the defensive'.13\n\nOffense-Defense theory was heavily criticized for both its methodological foundation and empirical applicability.14 Thus, various attempts were made to salvage the theory and present an amended version that would bolster its standing as a leading realist theory.15 One of the most lethal criticisms had to do with the difficulty of differentiating between the offensive or defensive nature of military capabilities or technologies. In response, Charles Glaser and Chaim Kaufmann, for example, suggested that the Offense-Defense balance -- the driving engine of the theory -- should be considered as the ‘... ratio of the cost of the forces the attacker requires to take territory to the cost of the forces the defender has deployed'.16\n\nStill, the traditional interpretation of Offense-Defense theory, as stipulated by both advocates and critics, is somewhat anachronistic and to some extent irrelevant to the information age. It presumes that war is conducted and concluded according to a kinetic basis and a territorial logic. Furthermore, the determinism of offensive and defensive capabilities, the security dilemma and armed conflict, is simplistic. It fosters a flawed ‘major war pathology' that does not necessarily exist today. One can plausibly imagine an armed conflict that is not necessarily aimed at unconditional surrender or territorial occupation, but tends to be much more limited, although it can turn into an all-out war of course, a kind of slippery slope interstate militarized dynamics.17 Second, and more importantly, since the conduct of contemporary warfare is dependent on ICT infrastructure, cyberspace becomes a contested",
    "domain in which cyberwar, or major technological conflicts, may take place or even be determined.18 As James Adams notes, ‘[a]round the world, information technology increasingly pervades weapons systems, defense infrastructures and national economies. As a result, cyberspace has become a new international battlefield'.19\n\nCyberwar may not solely determine the outcomes of future armed conflicts and interstate rivalries, but it can influence leaders' determination to prefer military options over political solutions. Since the early 1990s, policymakers have become deeply aware of ICT-based systems' vulnerability, their influence on states' national security posture, and the ability to conduct military operations.20 Former American Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn recently acknowledged that ICT\n\n> enables almost everything the US military does: logistical support and global command and control of forces, real-time provision of intelligence, and remote operations ... The US government's digital infrastructure now gives the United States critical advantages over any adversary, but its reliance on computer networks also potentially enables adversaries to gain valuable intelligence about US capabilities and operations, to impede the United States' conventional military forces, and to disrupt the US economy.21\n\nBut is cyberspace defence or offence oriented? According to Lynn, the answer is straightforward: ‘In cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand'.22 This may be intuitively correct, and surely this position is shared by the vast majority of scholars and practitioners, but how can Offense-Defense theory provide a more founded answer to this question? This article suggests that Offense-Defense theory can effectively perform this task after updating its conceptual basis. Essentially, the balance between offence and defence is determined, in the traditional fashion, according to two key factors: mobility enhancement and firepower's degree of destructiveness.23 However, these determinants are not necessarily relevant to cyber warfare and thus must be redefined in order to address the technologically different security environment we are dealing with in the information age and the various expressions of cyber warfare.24\n\n### From Mobility to ‘Versatility'\n\nUnlike the customary kinetic and territorially based interpretation of the term mobility in Offense-Defense theory literature that relates to the possibility of relocating combatants at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,25 in cyberspace mobility actually relates to the capacity to technologically attack different types of ICT-based targets at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than thinking in terms of the physical allocation of armed forces across or between combat zones, in cyberwar we should talk of cyber versatility that corresponds to levels of war hierarchy.26\n\nStrategic targets or critical infrastructures consist of vital or centre-of-gravity assets whose destruction may have a colossal effect on a state's national security and its capacity to operate normally.27 Such elements include a state's military constellations, defence industrial base, satellite communication, electrical power grid, internet connectivity, central banking system, stock market, ministries, and",
    "governmental agencies.28 On the operational level, where the focus is on related ICT-based systems, cyber warfare may foil the use of military and warning systems such as anti-aircraft missile systems, reconnaissance capabilities, or the hacking into an enemy's technological capabilities such as drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).29 On the tactical level, when the focus is on a particular and segmented ICT-based system, cyber warfare may interrupt battlefield communication and coordination, disrupt electronic signals such as radio and GPS signals, or eliminate them completely.30\n\n### From Firepower to ‘Byte Power'\n\nUnlike the customary territorially based interpretation of this feature in the Offense-Defense theory literature that primarily revolves around accuracy and destructiveness of certain weapons, in cyberspace firepower actually relates to the degree of technological damage that can be inflicted on the enemy's ICT-based infrastructure at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Rather than talk of kinetic firepower, in cyber warfare the idea is to examine how much byte power a state can extract and direct towards an adversary's ICT-based targets.\n\nWhile the Offense-Defense theory literature typically maintains that the greater a weapon's firepower the greater its contribution to the defence,31 this assertion is challenged by prominent Offense-Defense theorists and it seems largely misguided in cyberspace. Glaser and Kaufman argue, for example, that ‘... there can be exceptions when specific firepower innovations are differentially useful against defender'.32 It seems that moving from the territorial and/or the kinetic to cyberspace allows such an exception, especially if we are dealing with highly accurate and low-signature cyber capabilities that allow the attacking and possible neutralization of an enemy's defence systems with virtual anonymity.33 Furthermore, and primarily as a complementary mechanism, selective or surgical cyberattacks may greatly improve the effectiveness of offensive conventional weapons by creating a cyber window of opportunity for conventional activities through which both combatants and equipment can penetrate more easily an otherwise unassailable target.34\n\nTo sum up this section, ICT-induced cyber capabilities tilt the Offense-Defense balance in favour of the offence, not in the prospects of gaining and maintaining control over territory and material resources as a manifestation of victory, but rather in the actual possibility to paralyse the enemy's military deployment and civilian preparedness and drastically limit its retaliatory potential. Since the use of cyber capabilities according to both indicators suggests that offence has the advantage, let us turn to evaluate the relevance of cyber warfare to the process of policymaking. For offence-dominant cyber capabilities to actually influence calculations and decisions in matters of war and peace, leaders and policymakers must be aware of these technologically advanced capabilities and acknowledge their strategic advantages. In the words of Keir Lieber, the influence of technological innovation ‘... is always filtered through the strategies that state decision makers employ in pursuit of their political goals. In simplest terms, politics -- more than technology -- is the master'.35\n\nThe aim is not, however, to meticulously describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures, i.e. the overall strategy designed to",
    "address different ICT-based challenges and threats by applying a multitude of proactive and passive measures. Rather, I present a succinct account to highlight key features and contemporary ramifications for war and peace. Given their offensive nature, the following section will try to assess whether the use of cyber capabilities actually prompted armed conflict, and under what conditions.\n\n## The Politics of Cyberwar and Peace\n\nGenerally speaking, America, China, and Russia have long histories of attempting to combine political aims with advanced technology, while NATO primarily benefited from the American efforts. The Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), warmly adopted by the Americans in the late 1980s and successfully implemented during the Gulf War, was in fact an adaptation of the 1970s Soviet Military-Technical Revolution (MTR). As Elliot Cohen observes, the idea was to promote ‘... an imminent technical revolution that would give conventional weapons a level of effectiveness in the field comparable to that of small tactical nuclear weapons'.\n\nThe following accounts describe the evolution of American, Chinese, NATO, and Russian cyber postures to assess the influence of ICT-based capabilities on strategic thinking and behaviour. There is an important caveat to this analysis; cyber warfare suffers from a major problem of attributing attacks to specific state actors. Some of the cases discussed below include acts by non-state actors such as individuals, hacktivists, netizens, or more organized cyber militias and cyber gangs. Nevertheless, there is a growing consensus in the literature that these non-state actors mostly operate in tandem with national governments and follow their lead as proxies and their contribution should be considered an integral part of a state's overall cyber policy.\n\n### American Cyber Posture\n\nIt seems that the most robust, sophisticated, and technically and institutionally up-to-date cyber posture is the American one, despite its paradoxical defensive nature. While the United States is the primary target for different forms of cyber warfare, especially cyber spying and phishing, it also possesses the highest potential to become a cyber superpower with the most vigorous state-run ICT-based posture. In the early 1990s, the Gulf War exhibited American technological superiority in terms of both hardware and software as countless stealth fighters bombarded Iraq without being detected by Iraqi anti-aircraft missile systems using state of the art precision-guided munitions (PGMs). American technological superiority was a decisive factor in defeating Iraq. As commander of US Central Command during the Gulf War, Norman Schwarzkopf argued that technological innovation worked ‘beyond our wildest expectations'.\n\nGiven America's growing reliance on ICT in the battlefield and in the supportive and logistical military formations, and repeated reports concerning a breach of computer networks such as in the case of the air force's Rome Air Development Center in March 1994, it became clear that this virtual Achilles heel must be protected. In 1995,",
    "the Clinton administration's national security strategy proclaimed that ‘the threat of intrusions to our military and commercial information systems poses a significant risk to national security and must be addressed'. In June 1997 the US government conducted Eligible Receiver, the very first information warfare (IW) exercise that exposed the vulnerability of American military and civilian critical infrastructures in case of a coordinated cyberattack.\n\nBut as American policymakers and strategists feared their vital technological structures, they also become increasingly interested in exploiting this new strategic domain in their favour. Indeed, while the Kosovo war was overwhelmingly won by conducting conventional massive air bombing against Serb targets, some observers asserted that the accuracy and efficiency of these aerial campaigns were the outcome of cyber warfare-like operations, especially in directing the bombers to their targets from the ground. Furthermore, while it is not exactly clear what additional cyber measures were used against Serb targets, it was reported that the United States and NATO conducted various sophisticated cyberattacks that included penetrations of Serbian ICT systems and overloading them with data or manipulating their databases. Hence the use of cyber capabilities at the operational level was not only disruptive in nature but also proactive and offensive in its attempt to frustrate Serbian defensive formation and retaliatory military options.\n\nDuring the War on Terror campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, cyber warfare did not play a significant role. In both cases, the United States had virtually no critical ICT assets to attack or disrupt and the focus was on traditional, if irregular, combat operations. Nevertheless, it was reported that a month before the Iraq War began, President Bush signed a secret directive ordering the development of an American strategy for large-scale pre-emptive cyberattacks against adversaries of the United States.\n\nIt was then reported that the United States was pre-emptively cutting off the Iraqi computer network and internet grid that connected civilian and government agencies before war began in March 2003. According to Richard Clarke, the Iraqi Defense Ministry's email system was hacked by the Americans in order to warn high-ranking officers about opposing the future invasion and to assure them that the objective was to overthrow Saddam Hussein and not to destroy Iraq's political, military, and socioeconomic structures. Another path that was explored but not pursued was hacking into the regime's financial institutions and foreign bank accounts in order to locate Saddam Hussein's hidden assets.\n\nAt about the same time, Chinese hackers apparently orchestrated a major cyberattack on American computer systems at NASA and Sandia National Laboratories. It was made clearer following these incidents and others that the United States must re-evaluate its cyber policy and possibly change its approach. Yet the discourse remained rather defensive, primarily focused on protecting American critical infrastructure and confidential databases. When George W. Bush published his administration's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace in 2003, its objective was ‘... to secure the portions of cyberspace that they own, operate, control, or with which they interact'. The military establishment, on the other hand, was much more assertive in its approach to cyber warfare, as the 2004 Military Strategy asserted:",
    "The Armed Forces must have the ability to operate across the air, land, sea, space and cyberspace domains of the battlespace ... The non-linear nature of the current security environment requires multi-layered active and passive measures to counter numerous diverse conventional and asymmetric threats ... They also include threats in cyberspace aimed at networks and data critical to US information-enabled systems. Such threats require a comprehensive concept of deterrence encompassing traditional adversaries, terrorist networks and rogue states able to employ any range of capabilities.52”\n\nThe 2005 National Defense Strategy further proclaimed that alongside traditional and irregular security challenges the United States confronts, cyberwarfare may constitute a threat that under certain conditions “... can fundamentally alter long-established concepts of warfare. Some potential adversaries are seeking disruptive capabilities to exploit US vulnerabilities and offset the current advantages of the United States and its partners'.53 Consequently, the stated military applications of cyber capabilities were made more offensive than ever a year later when the 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations noted:“[T]he United States must have cyberspace superiority to ensure our freedom of action and deny the same to our adversaries through the integration of network defense, exploitation, and attack ... Offensive capabilities in cyberspace offer the United States and our adversaries an opportunity to gain and maintain the initiative. DOD cyberspace operations are strongest when offensive and defensive capabilities are mutually supporting. This requires a long-range focus and dedicated resources to achieve this goal.54”\n\nThe director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Keith Alexander, argued in 2007 that the United States should reformulate the operational and institutional foundations of its cyber posture in order to address the technologically induced security environment, since“while we have ample national level strategies, we have yet to translate these strategies into operational art through development of joint doctrine for cyberspace. Through the doctrine vetting process, we can develop a common understanding of what it means to conduct warfare within and through cyberspace.55”\n\nIndeed, in early 2008 President Bush issued a directive that allows American intelligence agencies, especially the NSA, to monitor all internet traffic of the federal government in order to protect vital assets from cyberattacks. What makes this directive a major turning point in American cyber warfare evolution is that under Bush's initiative, the NSA with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) could provide the Pentagon with evidence that a pre-emptive cyberattack is crucial in order to protect American critical infrastructure.56\n\nIn early 2009, soon after taking office, President Barack Obama announced his administration's cyber policy, which remained rather committed to the defensive notion of protecting and securing critical infrastructure in what was often referred to as cyber security.57 Yet in April it was reported that the White House was, in",
    "fact, in the final stages of establishing a new cyber agency under the Pentagon's authority which could develop offensive cyber weapons alongside defending American ICT critical infrastructure. Former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, was appointed as director of the Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and while he was rather cautious in attributing any offensive aspects to the new command, the Pentagon declared that the mission of this new agency was to:“[d]irect the operations and defence of specified Department of Defense information networks [involving some 90,000 military personnel] and prepare to, when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, [to] ensure US allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.”\n\nMore recently, it was reported that the Pentagon is formulating a particular strategy that will engage the threats emanating from cyber warfare under the premise that any such attack on behalf of a foreign country constitutes a declaration of war that may result in armed conflict. In effect, however, President Obama did not approve a pre-emptive cyber offensive against Libya before the United States led the military campaign against Muammar Qaddafi in March 2011. The idea was to use cyber warfare in order to hinder Libya's air defence systems, but the option was abandoned, according to some government officials, because the Obama administration feared it would act as a precedent for Russian or Chinese future offensive attacks. One Defense Department official said the cyber options ‘... were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya's air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn't pan out'. Another White House official argued that ‘[t]hese cybercapabilities are still like the Ferrari that you keep in the garage and only take out for the big race and not just for a run around town, unless nothing else can get you there'.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war in Libya, the White House attempted to provide the most comprehensive and inclusive cyber strategy to date. But despite the clear defensive tone of the document, especially when considering the ambiguity of the parts relating to cyber deterrence mechanisms, there was more than a hint of offensive reasoning:“When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic -- as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests.”\n\nThe debate concerning the defensive or offensive posture of American cyber strategy or its passive or proactive nature is still ongoing. Recently, General Robert Kehler, Commander of US Strategic Command that oversees CYBERCOM, commented that the optimal solution would involve both: ‘I think we are looking at",
    "what an offensive component would be: what does that look like? What kind of options would we want to be able to offer? I think that we have always said that there needs to be an offense and defense mix'. These questions remain unanswered.\n\n### Chinese Cyber Posture\n\nIt is extremely difficult to fully account for the cyber posture of China and its development over the years. In China, defence-related transparency is a rare commodity. Yet it is widely known and established that the Chinese pursued a robust modernization in military technology and tactics from the late 1970s. Maoist ideology not only determined the political and societal structure of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its inception in 1949, it also served as China's military national defence strategy in that it revolved around the concept of ‘People's War' and the mobilization of the masses for a protracted armed conflict. After the death of Mao in 1976, and under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, a new conceptualization of Chinese warfare emerged that gradually became highly receptive to technological, industrial, and economic developments, making the entire defence apparatus much more open to engage the challenge of future armed conflict in the information age. From an operative vantage point, China gradually abandoned Mao's conception of active defence in favour of a pre-emptive military orientation that advocates a first strike mentality.\n\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, which strained Sino-American relations, highlighted historical anti-Western sentiments and created a shaky setting for the post-Cold War era. Consequently, by the mid 1990s China was caught paradoxically in an international constellation that was just as challenging as the Cold War international system. American intentions to redraw the global and regional landscape, and especially Washington's reactions to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, were badly received in Beijing. Consequently, the United States was increasingly considered to be a major source of danger to China's national interests and political order.\n\nAmerican military performance during the Gulf War highlighted the technological inferiority of the PLA and encouraged the Chinese leadership to accelerate and broaden existing plans to modernize and improve the army's capabilities for the purpose of potentially waging a limited or local war. Indeed, newly elected General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Jiang Zemin was confident that a comprehensive modernization of the Chinese armed forces amid what he considered American military superiority and interference in China's internal affairs was of great importance. Thus, he encouraged technological modernization according to American standards when he told members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in early 1993 that ‘[w]e must win high-tech, small-scale wars under modern conditions'. Similarly, the Chairman of the Commission on Science, Technology and National Defense Industry (COSTIND) General Ding Henggao warned that ‘[t]he one who possesses high-tech superiority will have the upper hand on the battlefield'.\n\nModernizing and increasing the professionalism of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was also matched with vigorous ICT-based innovation. As Major General",
    "Weng Pufang, former director of the Strategy Department of the Chinese Academy of Military Science, argued in a 1995 article he published in a Chinese military journal:“The thrust of China's military construction and development of weapons and equipment will no longer be toward strengthening the ‘firepower antipersonnel system' of the industrial age, but toward the strengthening of information technology, information weapons and information networking. Our sights must not be fixed on the firepower warfare of the industrial age, rather they must be trained on the information warfare of the information age.74”\n\nThe PLA became highly interested in exploiting these technological innovations and restructured its ICT-based military units to comprise the Third Department of the PLA General Staff Department (GSD), currently entrusted with exploitation of foreign computer networks, whereas the Fourth Department of the GSD is responsible for attacking foreign computer networks.75 Indeed, after an agreement with Cuba was signed in February 1998, China built two cyber warfare stations, one eavesdropping telephone and internet communications in the United States and the other more concerned with monitoring American military satellite systems.76 But in addition to these military units, the Chinese government has reportedly outsourced some of its cyber warfare tasks to civilian groups that are systematically activated and thus enable greater international flexibility due to cyber warfare's attribution problem.77\n\nIn the early 2000s, Beijing was ostensibly involved in numerous successful attempts to hack into American databases and critical infrastructure such as nuclear and electric power plants, satellite systems, and a number of Department of Defense contractors that store confidential information and blueprints of future weapon systems.78 China also launched an ambitious anti-satellite weapons program aimed at levelling the odds against American espionage and to attack satellite systems that are perceived by Beijing as utterly anti-Chinese in nature.79 Hence, China's cyber posture is primarily a deterrent against American military superiority but it has deep and conscious long-term advantages that Beijing may cash in on in time of need. In fact, China's cyber posture will only benefit an offensive orientation compared with the current defensive traits of the American cyber posture if Beijing needs to prevent Washington from interfering in matters related to Taiwan, for example.80 China's 2000 Defense White Paper explicitly adhered to this transformative phase of the PLA's posture into an ICT-based modernized army:“Faced with the world's military developments and the characteristics of modern warfare, the Chinese armed forces will, in the course of modernizing their weaponry, devote themselves to transforming semi-mechanized and mechanized weapon systems to automatized and informationized systems as soon as possible, so that they can possess weapons as advanced as possible and assure the accomplishment of the sacred missions assigned to them by the nation.81”\n\nA report submitted to the American Congress in 2007 argued that China not only possesses the cyber capabilities required to conduct comprehensive offensive cyberattacks against the United States: ‘In 2005, the PLA began to incorporate offensive",
    "CYBER POSTURING AND THE OFFENSE-DEFENSE BALANCE\n\nComputer Network Operations (CNOs) into its exercises, primarily in first strikes against enemy networks'. Indeed, China's 2008 Defense White Paper proclaimed in the sections dealing with the technological dimensions of modern warfare that\n\nChina is accelerating reform and innovation in its defense-related science, technology and industry ... Defense-related science, technology and industry are striving to enhance the informationization of weaponry and equipment design and development, and to render product design more digitalized, modularized, standardized and reliable.[83]\n\nIn sum, the Chinese consider cyber warfare and its auxiliary elements as a power multiplier, integral to their national security strategy. Thus far, China has refrained from presenting a comprehensive cyber strategy but in practice it has primarily involved strategic and tactical hacking into American and other Western countries' databases and internet systems for reasons of technological and operative military espionage. While there were numerous indications of China's involvement in penetrating critical ICT-based infrastructure in the United States, Beijing has not used its existing cyber assets thus far to directly attack American strategic military assets in order to neutralize them but instead has focused on cyber spying. This pattern may change under certain conditions, especially if Beijing wishes to diversify its policy alternatives in case of a Sino-American confrontation.[84]\n\n## Russian Cyber Posture\n\nWhereas in the two previous cases the strategizing of ICT as military capabilities was ambiguous at best, and there was certainly no actual use of cyber warfare as part of armed conflict, the case of Russia in the first decade of the 21st century can be easily dubbed as an exemplary case for the opposite. To begin with, during most of the 1990s Russia was grappling with the devastating economic, social, and political effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign and defence policy was primarily focused on '... disarmament and limitation of the arms race - in terms of releasing as many resources as possible and creating the most favorable conditions for the implementation of our socioeconomic reforms'.[85]\n\nIn December 1994, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signalled his intention to alter Russia's foreign and defence orientation when he decided to invade Chechnya, a conflict that '... demonstrated the full extent of the armed forces' decline. In virtually every respect, the Russian military failed the challenge it was supposed to easily master'.[86] By 1996, in face of failure in Chechnya and growing domestic opposition, Yeltsin moved to replace the moderate and pro-Western Kozyrev with Yevgeny Primakov who also served as Prime Minister between September 1998 and May 1999. Indicatively, in his first press conference Primakov asserted that 'Russia was and remains a great power. Her foreign policy should correspond to that status'.[87]\n\nThe weaknesses of Russia's conventional and non-conventional military postures led many Russian military thinkers and officials to regard ICT-based capabilities as a way to compensate for strategic inferiority. During the mid 1990s, the Russian Army",
    "CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY\n\nand Defense Ministry began seriously examining the nexus between technology and the regular military structure.⁸⁸ Russia was openly using IW during the second Chechen war.⁸⁹ The first major indication of coordinated Russian cyber warfare (in addition to IW) took place in Estonia in 2007, after a monument commemorating the Red Army’s re-conquest of Estonia during the Second World War was moved despite the Kremlin’s explicit warning.⁹⁰\n\nRather than exclusively resorting to military force in order to resolve what Moscow considered explicit anti-Russian reactionary sentiments and policies, as they did during the Chechen military campaigns in 1994 and 1999 for example, this time Moscow pursued a much more sophisticated approach that included inducing political riots in Estonia and targeting Estonia’s ICT infrastructure such as the banking sector, parliament’s website and email system, emergency phone lines, hospitals, and universities.⁹¹ During a period of several weeks in May 2007, after the statue was relocated, official Estonian governmental websites and vital telecommunications infrastructure were attacked and rendered inactive, according to most accounts, by Russian perpetrators.⁹²\n\nRussian policymakers began to appreciate the role of ICT and cyber warfare as an auxiliary instrument of coercion and statecraft against what they considered uncooperative regimes in the post-Soviet rim. And the lessons learned during the Estonian affair were apparently applied as part of Russia’s involvement in the Georgian war in August 2008.⁹³ Essentially, in response to Georgia’s attack against South Ossetia, Russian forces invaded Georgia and practically subdued it within a matter of days. Yet even before the first bullet was fired, the Kremlin decided to employ a preemptive strategic disruptive cyber attack.⁹⁴\n\nIn mid July, several cyberattacks were waged against Georgian websites and two weeks later a second wave of cyberattacks on Georgian targets was detected. A few days into the war, the vast majority of Georgian government websites were not functioning; in effect, the Georgian government was, as one study asserted, ‘cyber-locked’, without viable access to the internet and to its state-run agencies including the National Bank of Georgia.⁹⁵ No less important, the Georgian government was unable to communicate with the citizens or conduct its own retaliatory IW against Russia.⁹⁶ Fortunately for Georgia, and unlike in the Estonian case, critical infrastructure such as the electrical power grid is far less modernized and consequently more difficult to damage by using ICT-based capabilities.⁹⁷\n\nIn February 2010, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev approved the new Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation where some key references to the use of cyber warfare as an instrumental offensive military capability can be clearly observed. For example, when dealing with the features of modern military conflicts, the document states that such one trait, from Russia’s perspective, is the ‘... early conduct [of] information warfare activities to achieve political objectives without the use of military force, and subsequently – in the interest of creating a favorable reaction of the international community – to use military force’. And when referring to Russian future acquisition plans for the armed forces, the doctrine highlights that a key task involves the ‘... development of the forces and means of information warfare’.⁹⁸",
    "In early 2012 the Russian Ministry of Defense revealed the Kremlin's cyber strategy under the title Conceptual Views Regarding the Activity of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the Information Space. It refrains from referring to offensive cyber warfare, but it does address issues pertaining to control, prevention, and solution of cyber conflicts. The document acknowledges the right of Russia to employ counteroffensive cyber warfare: ‘The escalation of a conflict in the cyber-space and its turn into a crisis gives the right to an individual or collective self-defense and the use of any means necessary that do not contradict the universally accepted norms and the principles of international law'. Based on Russia's past behaviour and the recent proclamation of its cyber strategy, it appears that Moscow may be more than willing to use different forms of cyber warfare should political needs emerge.\n\n### NATO Cyber Posture\n\nThus far, our empirical description has exclusively focused on state actors, but since NATO plays such a major role in the contemporary security environment it seems that examining the way it relates to cyber warfare will present a more accurate account for our purposes. Interestingly enough, despite NATO's transparency on the whole, there is very little access to the more operational and sometimes technical aspects of the Alliance's cyber strategy. Nevertheless, from the available materials we can identify NATO's defensive approach to cyber warfare and cyber security.\n\nOriginally, NATO was not only established to address the Soviet threat in Europe. Lord Ismay, NATO's first Secretary General, contended that its objectives were to keep ‘the Russians out, the Germans down, and the Americans in'. After the Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, NATO had to reinvent itself and identify new objectives in order to preserve its relevance and mere existence. The multiplicity of political and military goals combined with the willingness of its member states enabled NATO to successfully overcome this transitional period and undergo a process of remarkable institutional change that resulted in a renewed transatlantic mandate to develop new mechanisms and strategies in order to cope with the changing security environment.\n\nThe treatment of cyber warfare as part of NATO's evolving security concerns became decidedly evident in the early 2000s. Unlike the United States, China, or Russia, who were individually concerned with cyber warfare of various kinds and for different reasons as described earlier, throughout the 1990s NATO was primarily focused on its internal restructuring, the expansion eastwards to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and, of course, militarily operating in the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe 1999 Strategic Concept declared that ‘[s]tate and non-state adversaries may try to exploit the Alliance's growing reliance on information systems through information operations designed to disrupt such systems. They may attempt to use strategies of this kind to counter NATO's superiority in traditional weaponry'. Yet the first explicit reference to cyber warfare was actually made in November 2002 during NATO's Prague summit, when it was declared that the member countries",
    "decided to ‘... strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber attacks'. One operative outcome was the establishment of NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which was charged with the task of protecting ICT infrastructure and networks from unauthorized intrusion for espionage purposes or attempts to infect them with viruses. But this was a rather technical organ lacking any long-term military planning capacity, a feature that did not change significantly even following NATO's summit in Riga in November 2006 which further called for developing cyber-deterrence capabilities and doctrines. Russian cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 explicated NATO's military, infrastructural, and political weaknesses in the face of this new form of security threat, but the response as articulated by NATO's defence ministers was remarkably protective, arguing that ‘[u]rgent work is needed to enhance the ability to protect information systems of critical importance'.\n\nIn early 2008 it was reported that NATO officials further debated the need to protect the Alliance's assets against future cyberattacks, claiming that ‘[c]yber defence is now mentioned at the highest level along with missile defence and energy security'. While the attacks against Estonia did not result in the application of the collective security clause of the treaty, it did trigger a prompt institutional response. In January the Policy on Cyber Defence was presented and approved. During the Bucharest summit in April, the Cyber Defense Management Authority (CDMA) and the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) were established. Whereas the CDMA was entrusted with overseeing NATO's cyber defence efforts and providing guidance and assistance to the member countries in case of cyber-related crises, the CCDCOE, located in Estonia, was designed ‘... to enhance the capability, cooperation and information sharing among NATO, NATO nations and partners in cyber defence by virtue of education, research and development, lessons learned and consultation'.\n\nBoth agencies represent a highly defensive reaction to NATO's security challenges involving cyber warfare. As the Bucharest summit declaration proclaimed, the official cyber policy ‘... emphasizes the need for NATO and nations to protect key information systems in accordance with their respective responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack'. Yet Russia's continued use of cyber warfare during the war in Georgia highlighted its escalatory nature and the possible negative implications on conventional military conflicts. In April 2009, as part of the Declaration on Alliance Security, NATO moved further to identify cyberattacks alongside terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as the key global threats to member states and the international community.\n\nBut the major breakthrough in NATO strategic thinking regarding cyber warfare, which went beyond the strictly technical aspect of network protection, occurred during mid 2010. A team of leading experts in matters of security, headed by former American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, was asked to prepare a preliminary report to be used as a basis for NATO's new Strategic Concept. According to this report, entitled NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement and submitted in May:",
    "The next significant attack on the Alliance may well come down a fibre [sic] optic cable. Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern. However, the risk of a large-scale attack on NATO's command and control systems or energy grids could readily warrant consultations under Article 4 and could possibly lead to collective defence measures under Article 5. Effective cyber defence requires the means to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from attacks.111”\n\nStill, the recommendations reflected the defensive posture that was already advocated and implemented thus far by NATO. Furthermore, and extremely relevant to the Alliance's strategic planners, the Albright Commission was reluctant to engage the question of whether cyberattacks against NATO member states would constitute a direct act of aggression that would trigger the collective security clause. Instead, it defined a rather ambiguous principle according to which such a decision must be made considering ‘... the nature, source, scope, and other aspects of the particular security challenge'.112 The same defensive reasoning can be observed in the ensuing final version of the Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon summit six months later. In the words of the document, NATO will: “develop further our ability to prevent, detect, defend against and recover from cyberattacks, including by using the NATO planning process to enhance and coordinate national cyber-defence capabilities, bringing all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection, and better integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and response with member nations.113”\n\nYet again, the numerous references to cyber warfare as a security threat were extremely narrow to include at best espionage, hacking, or disruption and there was no discussion about the possibility to conduct pre-emptive or retaliatory cyber warfare.114 In fact, Stephane Abrial, commander of Allied Command Transformation (ACT) responsible for leading the Alliance's transformation of capabilities and forces, was against defining the Strategic Concept's notion of ‘in-depth cyberdefense' as a ‘military-only, or even a military-centric, strategy'. Instead, Abrial focuses on NATO's ‘permanent mission [which] involves countering the daily attempts made by hackers to break into our systems, which are by necessity interconnected, making a weakness in one country's systems a weakness in all'.115 Other key NATO officials, including General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continued to conceptualize cyber warfare in defensive terms, arguing that recent cyberattacks ‘... increased the urgency to strengthen cyber defences not only at NATO, but across the Alliance as a whole'. There is no public discourse involving NATO officials that suggests treating cyber capabilities as an offensive feature of the Alliance's cyber strategy. The most proactive proposal to date was the option to dispatch NATO's cyber Rapid Reaction Teams in order to assist member countries suffering from cyberattacks, or ‘incidents' as Rasmussen calls them, should they ask for such assistance.116\n\nIt appears that NATO is focused on prevention of attacks on its institutional assets and member countries rather than initiating cyberattacks against others. As the",
    "American representative to the CCDCOE concluded, when it comes to NATO, its major contribution to cyber defence will probably involve eroding the ‘... hacker's greatest advantages -- anonymity'. NATO's strategic thinking will continue to utilize its pooled capabilities in order to promote defensive solutions to cyber warfare of various kinds and it will continue to treat it as a threat rather than as an offensive feature to be proactively utilized.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nCyber warfare has become the latest buzzword in security studies, but some analysts downplay its importance for both policymakers and military strategists, calling it a ‘distracting and nonsensical' term. Yet while other observers also treat it as a complimentary aspect of modern warfare, they nonetheless underline its unique features, as Lynn publicly did:“The cyberthreat does not involve the existential implications ushered in by the nuclear age, but there are important similarities. Cyberattacks offer a means for potential adversaries to overcome overwhelming US advantages in conventional military power and to do so in ways that are instantaneous and exceedingly hard to trace.”\n\nThe article initially identified the conceptual factors that determine the offensive or defensive nature of certain military technologies. Then it adjusted these elements in order to fit the information age and its a-territorial nature. Instead of evaluating strategic orientation by traditional Offense-Defensive characteristics like mobility and firepower, the cyber Offense-Defense balance is better assessed for its technological versatility and byte power; the capacity to attack an enemy's assets on different levels (strategic, operative, and tactical), and the degree of destruction that can be inflicted on enemy assets at each of these levels.\n\nThe article then turned to evaluate the practical influence of cyber warfare on policy and behaviour. The American case, while perhaps being the less confrontational since there was no report of meaningful offensive American use of cyber capabilities against a foreign country or since the United States is able to avoid any direct attribution, was the most documented and comprehensive from an institutional/organizational perspective. The intellectual evolutionary process pursued by officials in the military and civil branches of government is still ongoing, and the United States is far from having a comprehensive cyber strategy. The creation of USCYBERCOM is a significant step, but it is certainly not enough since apparently there is still no highly structured and comprehensive ideational, institutional, and operational outline for American cyber warfare and cyber defence.\n\nThe case of China is similar in its ambiguity, but for different reasons. Unlike the United States, Beijing is rather secretive in treating its cyber posture just as it is generally reluctant to fully expose its military apparatus, causing American policymakers, military officials, and legislators to repeatedly criticize China's lack of transparency in matters related to its defence budget and the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s modernization. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that China",
    "not only has a very clear vision for its cyber posture as part of the country's wider military and technological modernization process, but it is also willing to use these capabilities in order to erode American military advantage. While Beijing is allegedly more interested in cyber espionage in order to obtain secret and up-to-date information about American capabilities and critical infrastructure, it will probably not shy away from using the same technology in order to curtail certain American assets, primarily non-combative ones (electric power plants etc.) and this may indicate that future Sino-American armed conflict will be augmented with vigorous cyber warfare.123 As a recent report submitted to Congress asserted, China's history of cyber warfare and its growing integration into the country's military strategy ‘suggests that the PLA may strike with Computer Network Operations (CNOs) and Electronic Warfare (EW) weapons in the opening phases of a conflict to degrade enemy information systems rather than attempt a traditional force-on-force attack directly where the PLA is at a disadvantage against more technologically advanced countries like the US'.124\n\nThe Russian case seemingly presents a better opportunity to observe the influence of cyber warfare on decisions of war and peace. From the empirical record it is evident that Russia explicitly used its cyber capabilities in both the Estonian and Georgian incidents, even if Moscow also used by-proxy entities for that purpose.125 The first incident was, of course, more of a diplomatic manoeuvre in order to curb Estonia's anti-Russian attitudes as the Kremlin perceived the matter. There was classical Soviet-era use of Russian ‘political activists' in order to encourage street unrest and orchestrated anti-government protests, but there was also the use of cyber warfare in order to paralyse then Estonian banking system and other key government agencies. Thus, one should treat this episode as an experiment in utilizing cyber capabilities in order to obtain certain political means. As the case of the Georgian war illustrated, this time cyber warfare was an integral, if not a decisive, part of the policymaking process and the military activities aimed at subduing the ‘defiant' Saakashvili administration. Clearly, the conventional dimension of the conflict was predominant, mainly due to the technological profile of Georgia's critical infrastructure, but the Russian use of cyberattacks hampered Georgian domestic vital communications between different branches of the government and completely prevented any Georgian IW counterattack.126\n\nNATO's cyber posture reflects the Alliance's historical defensive raison d'être that was articulated during the Cold War and reaffirmed following its end. For NATO officials, cyber warfare relates primarily to attempts by foreign actors to penetrate the organization's computer and information networks in order to retrieve confidential data. They are deeply reluctant to widen their approach to define such attacks as a cause for triggering the collective security clause of the treaty. Hence when Estonia was under Russian cyberattack, the most that NATO was able to offer Tallinn was technical assistance in reactivating and protecting its ICT networks from future attacks. Furthermore, even amid the Albright Commission's call to devise and implement a comprehensive cyber strategy, the institutional response was minor and essentially focused on network protection rather than explicit cyber deterrence, let alone an offensive reorientation.",
    "CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY\n\nThe use of cyber capabilities makes a difference for policymakers since it allows them to minimize the risks of taking certain offensive actions and it is a relatively effective low-cost alternative, as the Israeli attack on Syria suggests, and it will become more common in the future. Cyber warfare, like all other forms of combat, is a political expression nonetheless in that there is a need for a conscious decision to apply it in order to achieve certain objectives. In the cases reviewed in this article, cyber capabilities were used selectively and in different intensities, as illustrated by the American reluctance to use pre-emptive cyber warfare against Libya. Hence future research should look at the way cyber warfare is prioritized over conventional/kinetic options in order to elucidate the conditions under which policymakers will prefer the former over the latter and vice versa. Furthermore, such studies should empirically appraise how integral cyber warfare has become at the strategic, operative, and tactical levels.\n\nOverall, cyber warfare is becoming an accepted military expedient since it allows leaders to achieve their political objectives with much less risk in the short term, even if in the long term it may actually lead to 'non-cyber' escalation.[127] Prussian strategist and military thinker Carl von Clausewitz wrote long ago that '... a prince or a general can best demonstrate his genius by managing a campaign exactly to suit his objectives and his resources, doing neither too much nor too little'.[128] Cyber warfare allows policymakers and the military to do exactly that, and with additional adjustments realism can help to better explain the process even if there is more work to be done in pursuit of this goal.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nAn earlier version of this article was presented at the annual meeting of the Israeli Association for International Studies (IAIS), Herzliya, 25 December 2011.
