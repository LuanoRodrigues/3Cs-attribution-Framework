However, less is known regarding how democracies operate in cyberspace as it pertains to cyberaggression. Thus, this study examines the offensive strategies of democratic states that initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states from 2005 through 2020. In examining the cyberattacks initiated by democracies during this period, we aim to better understand the motives behind democratically initiated cyberattacks, the regime types that are likely to be targeted in the attacks, and the types of cyberattacks that democracies are likely to deploy. In conducting this analysis, we find that democracies rarely attack other democratic states in cyberspace and democracies are likely to deploy more aggressive and hostile attacks when targeting authoritarian regimes. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. These findings have important implications for considering how democratic institutions affect international relations and cybersecurity.\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nIn October 2020 the US Cyber Command launched a series of cyberattacks that sabotaged the Russian network referred to as TrickBot, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using ransomware termed Ryuk (Nakashima 2020). When questioned about the events, US General and Commander of the US Cyber Command Paul Nakasone acknowledged the United States' efforts as \"persistent engagement\" with the goal being to maintain the integrity of the 2020 US election by preventing bot interference. A secondary goal was likely to prevent other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020). In examining the 2020 TrickBot cyberattack, several questions emerge regarding why democracies carry out cyberattacks and how democratic institutions affect the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies.\n\nA large amount of literature in international relations has considered the factors that affect the conflict behavior of democratic states regarding traditional forms of military conflict. However, to date, minimal research has examined how democracies behave in cyberspace regarding cyber conflict. This is problematic given the important role many researchers contend that cyber conflict plays in international security (Al-Ahmad 2013; Khan 2018). Thus, we contend that it is important to examine cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies to better understand their motivations, tactics, and the regimes that are most likely to be targeted in democratically initiated attacks. Doing so could help bridge the gap between research on democracies and traditional military conflict and cyber conflict. In addition, given the important role cyberaggression is likely to play in affecting global security in the future, attempting to understand the behavior of democracies in cyberspace is a critical area for security studies.\n\nPrevious research has found that democracies are less likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes (Hunter et al. 2022). This scholarship has discovered that when democracies do initiate cyberattacks, they are significantly more likely to target authoritarian regimes. In addition, this research finds that democracies do cyberattack other democracies, but it is rare. However, two questions that are not addressed in the research are (1) if democracies initiate cyberattacks to a lesser degree than authoritarian states, what are the motivating factors behind the attacks; and (2) what type of cyberattacks are democracies likely to deploy against other states based on the regime type of the targeted states? In answering these questions, we analyze data from the Coun\n\na Corresponding author: lahunter@augusta.edu",

We incorporate literature from the democratic peace theory and research on regime type and kinetic conflict in attempting to explain why democracies carry out cyberattacks and to understand the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies. We contend that democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted state. Democracies often deploy more aggressive and hostile cyberattacks against authoritarian regimes compared with cyberattacks that are carried out against other democracies. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. More specifically, we argue that shared democratic norms, institutions, and values between democracies lead democracies to be more likely to target authoritarian states in cyberattacks and to deploy more aggressive cyberattacks against authoritarian states compared with democracies. Overall, this study seeks to expand our understanding of democratic states' behavior in cyberspace by examining the motivating factors behind democratically initiated cyberattacks and the types of cyberattacks democracies deploy based on the regime type of targeted states.\n\nThe layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows. First, we discuss the definitions of the main cyber terms used in the paper. Next, we examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyber conflict. We then analyze previous scholarship regarding how regime type affects traditional forms of military conflict and cyber conflict. Next, we examine data from the CFR-COTD (CFR 2021a) and conduct case study analyses in which we analyze the motivations, strategies, and targets of cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states by examining the full universe of known and verified cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. Lastly, we discuss our findings and implications for international security.\n\n# CYBER DEFINITIONS\n\nTo properly examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we need to define key cyber terms discussed in the study. The first term is \"cyber.\" Cyber refers to a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers\" (NIST 2024). The next term is \"cyber warfare/conflict.\" We use both \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" because some scholarship utilizes the term \"cyber warfare\" and other research uses the term \"cyber conflict\" when discussing the same type of cyber aggression. While the focus of this paper is on cyberattacks, it is important to define \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" as the terms are referenced in the paper concerning previous scholarship on cyber. \"Cyber warfare/cyber conflict\" is defined as \"the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's computers or information networks through,\n\nfor example, computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks\" (RAND 2024). The last term we define is \"cyberattack.\" The US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 2024) provides two definitions of \"cyberattack.\" The first is \"Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.\" The second is \"An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise's use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.\" The US Federal Emergency Management Agency defines \"cyberattack\" as \"malicious attempts to access or damage a computer system\" (FEMA 2024). The National Cyber Security Centre in the United Kingdom defines a cyberattack as malicious attempts to damage, disrupt or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks or devices, via cyber means (NCCC 2021). We define a cyberattack based on the criteria set forward in the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) in which a nation-state carries out a cyber operation against another nation-state in the form of denial of service, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, or doxing (CFR 2021a). We do not argue that this definition is superior to others. Rather, we contend that it is appropriate based on the aim and scope of the study. We expand on the definition and operationalization of the term \"cyberattack\" in the research design section of the paper. We now turn to examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyberattacks.\n\n# FACTORS AFFECTING THE INITIATION OF CYBERATTACKS\n\nMany scholars view cyberattacks as an extension of or an alternative to kinetic conflict (Borghard and Lonergan 2019, 122; Hjortdal 2011, 1). The reasons states deploy cyberattacks as opposed to kinetic attacks vary depending on the state. One perspective for why states initiate cyberattacks is that some states may not possess the power to compete with other states from a kinetic, military standpoint. Some scholars and military leaders consider cyberattacks to be an equalizer between states in some instances because less powerful states may be able to initiate cyberattacks while they lack the capabilities to launch successful kinetic attacks. Based on this perspective, weaker states may choose to deploy cyberattacks against more powerful adversaries. However, this theory has yet to be supported by empirical studies. Research on how power asymmetries affect cyberattacks is limited. One study that examines the effect state power has on cyber conflict finds that more powerful states (measured in terms of economic and military power) are more likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with less powerful states (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). The authors find that on average states that initiate cyberattacks have twice the amount of power compared with the states that are targeted in cyberattacks. Additional studies have found that factors such as international trade (Akoto 2021), previous episodes of kinetic conflict (Osawa\n\nGlobal Perspectives",

            "markdown": "2017), and whether states are rivals (Valeriano and Maness 2014) can influence the likelihood of cyberattacks.\n\nValeriano (2018) contends that cyberattacks are a form of covert coercion that normally seeks to send ambiguous signals or resolve to rival states. Valeriano finds that cyberattacks tend to transpire in coordination with traditional political activities (such as economic coercion or military threats or provocation) and they usually fail to produce political concessions from the targeted states (2018). Another reason states may deploy cyberattacks is possible anonymity, which enables users to remain undetected in many cases (2015, 19). Thus, even if hostile cyber action is detected, it can be difficult to accurately identify the state that is responsible for the attack. Additionally, cyberattacks can serve a variety of purposes. Cyberattacks can be used for espionage purposes to gain valuable information to aid an aggressor's future operations. Cyberattacks can also be employed to sabotage and destroy targets within the victim state and limit the victim states' capabilities (both cyber and kinetic). Thus, cyberattacks may serve as both enhancers and alternatives to kinetic conflict and can be used for multiple purposes.\n\nHaving the factors associated with the initiation of cyberattacks in previous scholarship, we now turn to examining how regime type affects the nature, target, and motivation of democratically initiated cyberattacks. Within this discussion, we consider previous research on how regime type affects the conflict behavior of democracies in the kinetic realm and what implications this scholarship has for democracies and the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Thus, we seek to understand how regime type affects the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies.\n\n## REGIME TYPE AND THE NATURE OF CYBERATTACKS INITIATED BY DEMOCRACIES\n\nA few important works examine the strategic use of cyber operations by democratic states (Goldman and Warner 2020; Kallberg 2016). Kallberg (2016) highlights the challenges in applying traditional military theory to cyber conflict. Kallberg contends that a theory of cyber conflict should address unique aspects of cyber that include anonymity, object permanence, measurable results, and rapid execution. More specifically, how does the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affect their usage compared with kinetic conflict in which most kinetic attacks are not anonymous? Relatedly, Goldman and Warner (2020) posit that democracies' interests (such as those of the United States) are often at risk due to continuous low-level cyber operations deployed by adversarial states. Over time, these operations can weaken the economic, political, and military power of democratic states. To address the threats, they contend that democracies should pursue an “integrated cybersecurity strategy” that combines national power and military cyber operations and focuses on deterrence, persistence (constant cyber operations that dismantle adversarial cyber activities), and anticipatory resilience (learning from past cyber operations, hardening cyber systems, preparing for future attacks, and limiting the impact of cyberattacks). Solar (2020) examines how emerging democracies in Latin America are approaching cyber threats, the role of the military in providing cyber security, and the implications for democratic governance. Solar finds that militaries in many emerging democracies are taking the lead in controlling cyberinfrastructure for cyber security purposes. Solar contends that this could be problematic in some instances if military involvement in cyber security undermines democratic governance by threatening a secure and open internet. Solar argues that emerging democracies should advance a balanced approach that includes military involvement in cybersecurity along with interactive policy communities with multiple stakeholders (including the defense sector) to review and manage cybersecurity policies. Solar contends that civil oversight of cybersecurity infrastructure is important to protect democratic values and principles (Solar 2020).\n\nIn trying to understand the behavior of democratic states regarding the initiation of cyberattacks, it is important to discuss multiple perspectives on how regime type can possibly impact cyberattacks. One potential perspective is that democracies could be more prone to launch cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes because cyberattacks could be an alternative to kinetic conflict. One of the rationales for this position is that many cyberattacks are anonymous and attribution is often difficult (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018). According to Tsagourias (2012), multiple characteristics of cyberattacks make attribution difficult. Rid and Buchanon contend that attribution should be viewed as an art and not an exact science because it is a complex, political, and multilayered process (2015). They posit that effective attribution is dependent upon resources, time, and the sophistication of the attacker. Additionally, states are more likely to devote significant resources to attribution when cyberattacks are more severe. Thus, attribution should be viewed as a gradual process, and nation-states should be considered the most capable actors to accurately attribute cyberattacks due to their significant resources. Also, according to Rid and Buchanon, states with greater technological sophistication and human talent should be able to initiate cyberattacks more easily and covertly and attribute cyberattacks more effectively while responding to cyberattacks from adversaries (2015). Therefore, from this perspective, in many instances, initiating a cyberattack could be a less risky tactic than kinetic conflict due to the difficulty in attributing attacks, and democratic states could perceive cyberattacks as a more appropriate strategy than kinetic operations. In addition, some scholars contend that cyberattacks can be executed with reduced costs and lower risks than kinetic conflict due to the lack of need for combat personnel and based on the previously discussed difficulty in attributing cyberattacks (Tsagourias 2012).\n\nAnother perspective is that democracies should be less likely to initiate cyberattacks not based on the pacifying effects of democratic institutions but according to the notion that democracies are likely to be wealthier than nondemocracies (on average) and have greater technological capacity and dependency (compared with authoritarian states),",

            "markdown": "and states with greater technological dependency should be more conservative regarding the initiation of offensive cyber operations (McConnell 2009). However, an alternate perspective is that states with greater wealth and resources are more likely to initiate cyberattacks, based on previous research, which finds that more powerful states are more prone to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). Additionally, other scholars contend that states with greater technological connectivity are more capable regarding cyber offense and defense as it becomes easier for these states to initiate covert cyberattacks and attribute cyberattacks to adversaries (Rid and Buchanan 2015). As Rid and Buchanon remark: “A third common assumption is that the most industrialized and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage. Attribution again reverses this logic: the larger a government's technical prowess, and the larger the pool of talent and skills at its disposal, the higher will be that state's ability to hide its own covert operations, uncover others, and respond accordingly” (2015, 31).\n\nLastly, a separate perspective is that the conflict-reducing effects of democratic institutions extend not only to kinetic conflict but to cyberattacks as well. This line of reasoning posits that democracies may be more peaceful in cyberspace compared with authoritarian regimes due to the presence of democratic norms, democratic institutions, and democracies' involvement in international institutions. Previous research provides some support for this position in that democracies are found to be less likely to initiate cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes when controlling for several political and economic factors (Hunter et al. 2022). Thus, there is evidence that regime type affects the conflict propensity of states regarding cyber behavior and democracies are less likely to deploy cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes. In addition, this scholarship has found that democracies rarely attack one another in the cyber realm. However, if democracies are less likely to initiate cyberattacks and are less prone to cyberattack other democracies, what motivates democracies to initiate cyberattacks? More specifically, what are the motivations for cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states?\n\nResearch on the behavior of democracies regarding kinetic conflict finds that democracies do not initiate wars with one another (often referred to as the dyadic democratic peace), although there are many instances of democracies warring with authoritarian regimes (Russett 1993). While this is one of the strongest empirical findings in international relations (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003), researchers debate the rationale for the findings, and some scholars refute the claim that democracies are less likely to war with one another (Barkawi and Laffey 1999; Rosato 2003). In responding to the claims that democratic peace findings are questionable, Imai and Lo (2021) test the democratic peace theory in a cross-national analysis and “show that overturning the negative association between democracy and conflict would require a confounder that is forty-seven times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in other dyads. To put this number in context, the relationship between democracy and peace is at least five times as robust as that between smoking and lung cancer. To explain away the democratic peace, therefore, scholars would have to find far more powerful confounders than those already identified in the literature” (901). In addition, while many scholars contend that democracies rarely or have never gone to war with one another, democracies have engaged in minor conflicts and disputes (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021). Thus, previous scholarship finds that democracies have engaged in lower-level disputes with one another, although rarely have the disputes escalated to war (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021; Mousseau 1997, 1998). One potential explanation for this finding is that when democracies interact with one another, they are more likely to resort to diplomacy due to shared institutions, norms, and values (Anderson and Souva 2010; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; and Rey and Barkdull 2005). A large amount of literature is devoted to explaining the reasons for these findings, and the explanations vary but include the design of democratic institutions, shared norms and values, and democracies' membership and involvement in international institutions. While this research is voluminous, one clear takeaway is that democracies interact with authoritarian and democratic states in significantly different ways, and democracies are more likely to engage with other democracies more peacefully compared with their interactions with non-democracies.\n\nWhile previous research has demonstrated that democracies are less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks (Hunter et al. 2022), research to date has not examined the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies. If we extend the literature on how democracies interact with other democracies and authoritarian regimes in the kinetic realm to cyberspace, the logical extension is that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies, and in the event of a cyberattack, the cyberattacks directed against other democracies should be less aggressive and hostile (i.e. overtly conflictual and potentially damaging) compared with the cyberattacks launched against authoritarian states. The rationale is that democracies are more likely to resort to compromise and diplomacy when interacting with other democracies compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes (Mousseau 1997, 1998). More specifically, democracies should view other democracies as more friendly and less hostile due to shared values, institutions, and norms, and when issues or disagreements emerge between democracies, they should be more likely to resolve the issues diplomatically rather than through acts of cyberaggression. Therefore, in extending the research on democratic state behavior regarding kinetic conflict to the cyber realm, democracies should pursue more aggressive strategies when interacting with authoritarian regimes and less aggressive strategies when engaging other democracies. Thus, based on our previous discussions, we argue that democracies should be less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks. This leads us to our first proposition.",

The Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a) disaggregates cyberattacks according to the following types: sabotage, denial of service, data destruction, and espionage. While the amount of damage and intensity of each attack type can vary by attack, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are usually viewed as more aggressive hostile acts compared with cyberattacks that involve only espionage (Schmitt 2012). The reason is that cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, or data destruction often produce actual and immediate damage (kinetic and/or cyber) and are more likely to be reported and discovered by the media and citizens within states. Thus, these cyber actions are often viewed as more hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks. However, we do not argue that espionage attacks are insignificant actions. Cyberespionage attacks are regarded as serious forms of cyberattacks by many researchers because vital information can be gained through acts of cyberespionage that can produce significant real-world effects and implications for national security (Deoliveira 2019). Additionally, espionage attacks can be deployed to gain valuable information on adversary states that can be later used in kinetic attacks or additional cyberattacks (ENISA 2020). However, in the aggregate, while espionage attacks clearly qualify as cyberattacks, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are frequently viewed as more aggressive and hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks.\n\nIn extending the literature on kinetic conflict to cyberspace, we argue that when democracies initiate cyberattacks, they should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states compared with instances in which they target other democracies. The rationale for this argument is based on research on kinetic conflict that finds that when disagreements occur between democracies, they are less likely to escalate to higher levels of intensity due to shared norms, values, and institutions (Anderson and Souva 2010; Imai and Lo 2021; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; Rey and Barkdull 2005). This stands in contrast to episodes when democracies have disputes with authoritarian regimes, in which there is a greater likelihood of hostile engagement due to\n\nthe lack of shared norms, values, and institutions. Thus, based on the discussion, our second proposition is:\n\nProposition 2: Democracies should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks (i.e., sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service) when targeting authoritarian regimes and less hostile cyberattacks (i.e., cyberespionage) when targeting other democratic states.\n\n# RESEARCH DESIGN\n\nTo examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we collected data on cyberattacks that were initiated by democracies against other states from 2005 through 2020. The cases included in the study are those in which democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states during the period and attribution for the attack is verified. Thus, every verifiable instance of a democracy initiating a known state-sponsored cyberattack against another state or states during the period is included in the study (as defined and operationalized by the Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a)). We do not analyze cyberattacks executed by nonstate actors. The reason is that we aim to analyze the motives, rationale, and targets of democratically initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks, and examining nonstate hacking/criminal/terrorist groups would not produce relevant information for the purposes of our study. The data on cyberattacks are collected from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a). The Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) provides data on known state-sponsored cyberattacks that transpired during this period in which the initiator and the target are nation-states or are directly affiliated with a nation-state. The state-sponsored cyberattacks that are included in the dataset are events where threat actors commit denial-of-service attacks, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, and doxing (CFR 2021a). The reasoning for the dataset's focus on state-sponsored attacks is as follows: \"The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests. Furthermore, state-sponsored incidents generally have the most accurate and comprehensive reporting. Reporting on nonstate actors, such as hacktivist groups, tends to be murkier and makes for less reliable data\" (CFR 2021a). The CFR data are collected based on several open-source outlets that include but are not limited to\n\nGlobal Perspectives",

One limitation regarding the data, which is relevant to all cyber conflict datasets, is that not every cyberattack that transpired during the period is included because of limited information pertaining to some of these cyberattacks. More specifically, some cyberattacks are not reported, and many cyberattacks remain anonymous due to difficulty in accurately attributing attacks and the purposeful effort by some states to mask their cyber activity. Second, the CFR relies on publicly available data. As the CFR stipulates, \"State intelligence agencies and private cybersecurity firms are likely to have the most complete data about state-sponsored actors, but may not make what they know public to protect national security or trade secrets\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, the cyber events that are included in the CFR (COTD) are verified incidents where information is known and verified regarding the states that carried out the attacks and the states that were victims of the attacks based on open-source data.\n\nWe utilize the four categorizations from the COTD regarding the attack type. The four categories are espionage, sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service. The four categories are examined because these are the four cyberattack types utilized by the COTD (CFR 2021a). Additionally, previous cyber research has discussed and analyzed these attack types (Banks 2017; CISA 2019; Maurer and Morgus 2014), and they are considered standard attack types in the cyber literature. Denial-of-service attacks prevent appropriate users from accessing information systems, devices, and network resources due to a malicious cyber actor (CISA 2019). Attackers can target a variety of resources and can deny service in different ways. Ultimately, denial-of-service attacks overwhelm the computer network by sending more data than it is capable of processing, resulting in a temporary paralysis of the computer network (CFR 2021a). Cyber sabotage is an attack carried out against the integrity of an IT system (Maurer and Morgus 2014, 58). This attack \"causes a disruption to a physical process\" (CFR 2021a). Data destruction is the process of destroying data on electronic or physical mediums (Ministry of Justice 2021). In some cases, this is done intentionally for security purposes. Cyber data destruction results in a computer or computer networks becoming unusable due to the use of malicious software (CFR 2021a). Cyberespionage refers to a state covertly collecting information for intelligence purposes (Australian Cyber Security Center 2021). More specifically, cyberespionage involves penetration of computer systems or networks to obtain information on or going\n\nthrough these systems, without the information holder's consent (Banks 2017, 513; CFR 2021a). In addition to analyzing the attack types of democratically initiated cyberattacks, we also examine the sectors targeted within victim states based on the COTD's classification as follows: government, private sector, civil society, and the military.\n\n## FINDINGS\n\nIn total, there were 27 cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. The overall breakdown of the 27 attacks that were initiated by democracies between 2005 and 2020 is as follows and is presented in table 1. There were 13 cases (48 percent) where democracies attacked only authoritarian states. There were 12 cases (44 percent) where democracies attacked both democracies and authoritarian states simultaneously. There were 2 cases (7 percent) in which democracies attacked only other democracies. Thus, in examining these statistics, we see that when democracies launch cyberattacks, they are likely to target authoritarian regimes specifically, or a combination of democratic and authoritarian regimes in simultaneous attacks. Also, democracies do occasionally target democracies (where an authoritarian regime is not attacked simultaneously), but it is rare. In 7 percent of cases does a democracy attack only another democracy. Thus, the primary targets for democracies appear to be either solely authoritarian states or a simultaneous combination of authoritarian and democratic states. This finding provides support for proposition 1, which stipulates that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies.\n\nTable 2 displays the specific sector targeted in a cyberattack based on the regime type that is targeted. In respect to the attack type based on the sector that is targeted when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 6 government, 3 private, 1 civil society, and 3 military. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 7 government, 1 private, 0 civil society, and 4 military. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 0 government, 0 private, 1 civil society, and 1 military. Thus, in examining table 2, we find that government sectors are more likely to be targeted in attacks when only authoritarian states are targeted and in attacks where both authoritarian and democratic states are targeted simultaneously. Civil society and military sectors are most frequently targeted when only democratic regimes are the victims of democratically initiated cyberattacks.\n\nGlobal Perspectives",

In respect to the attack type when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 3 espionage, 5 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and 4 denial-of-service attacks. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 10 espionage, 1 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and no denial-of-service attacks. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 2 espionage, and no attacks regarding sabotage, data destruction, and denial-of-service attacks.\n\nIn examining the results in table 3, we find that a few patterns emerge. First, democracies are more likely to commit acts of sabotage when only authoritarian states are targeted versus attacks that include both democratic and authoritarian states or solely democratic states. One hundred percent of the sabotage attacks committed by democracies were committed against only authoritarian states. Second, denial-of-service attacks are more likely to be committed against only authoritarian states. Democracies did not initiate any denial-of-service attacks in attacks that included simultaneous attacks against democracies and authoritarian states. Also, democracies did not deploy any denial-of-service attacks against only democratic states. Once again, one hundred percent of denial-of-service attacks were deployed against only authoritarian states. Regarding data destruction, democracies were equally likely to initiate data destruction attacks against authoritarian states and in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously. Lastly, democracies were more likely to deploy espionage attacks in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously, and 100 percent of the attacks directed against only democratic states were acts of cyberespionage.\n\nWhen we interpret the results in table 3, it appears that democracies initiate more aggressive and hostile attacks against authoritarian states compared with democratic targets, which provides support for proposition 2. This is not to argue that espionage cannot be destructive. Espionage\n\nattacks can be costly because they may provide valuable information to a potential adversary that can damage a victim state. However, the types of attacks launched against authoritarian states are more overtly aggressive and hostile because sabotage and denial-of-service attacks often produce significant and immediate damage against a victim state. In addition, these attacks are often immediately known, whereas espionage attacks may be undetected for some time. Thus, the finding that a larger number of sabotage and denial-of-service attacks are initiated against nondemocracies indicates that democracies are more aggressive in deploying their offensive cyber weaponry against authoritarian states compared with when they target other democracies.\n\nTable 4 displays data regarding whether cyberattacks included in the analysis are carried out in retaliation to a kinetic attack or a cyberattack. Thus, the variable relation refers to whether the cyberattack occurred in response to a kinetic or a cyber hostility that originated from the targeted state. General Retaliation refers to retaliation for a kinetic or cyber hostility originating from the targeted state. Thus, both kinetic and cyber actions are included in the category General Retaliation. Kinetic Retaliation refers to retaliation due to a kinetic hostility committed by the targeted state. Lastly, Cyber Retaliation refers to retaliation for a cyber hostility committed by the targeted state. In examining table 4, we find that the only acts of General Retaliation occurred when democracies attacked only nondemocracies. Out of the 3 total retaliation attacks, 2 were in response to kinetic actions and 1 was in response to a previous cyberattack. When retaliation attacks are initiated by democracies, they are directed at specific authoritarian states. There are no cases of democracies retaliating against other democracies.\n\nTable 5 displays the number of cyberattacks, and the number of cyberattacks by attack type, initiated by the democratic states included in the analysis. In reviewing table 5, it is important to note that many cyber events involved multiple initiator states. Six of the 26 cases (23 percent) involved multiple initiator states.

The remaining democratic states in the analysis initiated 1 cyberattack. The findings regarding the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom and the number of cyberattacks deployed reinforce previous scholarship, which finds that more powerful states are more likely to initiate cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). In the next section, we explore the motives, circumstances, and tactics behind these attacks to better understand why democracies may initiate certain types of cyberattacks against authoritarian states versus democracies.\n\n# CASE STUDY ANALYSIS\n\nTo more fully understand the nature of state-sponsored cyberattacks initiated by democracies, we analyze qualitative case information pertaining to each cyberattack in respect to the potential motives and tactics associated with the attacks. We utilize publicly available data to obtain this information. In addition, more information is known regarding some events compared with others, and in some cases, there is limited data on the motives and tactics of the attack. As the CFR-COTD states: \"Furthermore, some reporting from the media or cybersecurity companies can be vague or incomplete, making it difficult to confirm incidents for which data is only available from a single source\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, we attempt to provide descriptions of\n\nthe motives, tactics, and state actors involved in each democratically initiated cyberattack while acknowledging that limited publicly available information and sources exist for some cases. The full list of cases and the key aspects of each case including the cyberattack name, the initiator(s) of the attack, the target(s) of the attack, the type of attack, and the suspected motivation for each attack can be found in table 6. Additionally, given the space constraints of the paper, a more detailed description of each case can be found in the appendix.\n\nBefore proceeding to the case study analysis, one important point is that additional economic, social, and political motives outside our analysis may have impacted the democratically initiated cyberattacks that are included in the study. Given that 27 cases (cyber events) are discussed in the study, the limited sources for some cases, and the space constraints of the paper, additional possible motives cannot be fully explored for each case. Thus, it is important to note that additional economic, social, and political motives and explanations may exist for each case.\n\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND SABOTAGE\n\nIn considering cyberattacks initiated by democracies against only authoritarian states in which the attack type was sabotage, many of the attacks were carried out by the United States. In April 2017, the United States is believed to have sabotaged North Korea's nuclear program by sabotag-\n\nGlobal Perspectives",

The United States' efforts are believed to have been motivated by an attempt to prevent the North Korean military from expanding its missile technology systems to protect South Korea and to maximize security on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAnother attack in this category that was executed by the United States that targeted an authoritarian state's missile systems occurred in June 2019 when the US Cyber Command hacked Iranian rocket and missile launch systems in what Iran deemed an unsuccessful effort to disable the systems. This sabotage operation carried out by the United States came during a time of heightened tensions between the two states and served as a response to recent aggression by the Iranian government when it downed a US drone and attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz (Council\n\non Foreign Relations 2021b). The response by the United States signaled its willingness to deploy cyber capabilities in response to kinetic actions.\n\nIn a series of attacks launched by the United States against Russia in 2018, the US Cyber Command sabotaged the Russian Internet Research Agency in an attempt to maintain the integrity of the US 2018 elections (Buchanan 2019). Although some information regarding the attack remains unknown, the operation was likely intended to prevent Russian disinformation that could have been disseminated by the Internet Research Agency (Buchanan 2019). In a separate attack directed at Russia, and mentioned in the introduction of the paper, in October 2020 the US Cyber Command sabotaged computers on the TrickBot network, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using Ryuk ransomware (Nakashima 2020).

A related goal was to thwart other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020).\n\nIsrael was responsible for the other sabotage attack in the category of democracies initiating sabotage attacks against nondemocracies. In May 2020 Israel conducted a cyberattack targeting Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port near the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran reported only caused damage to private systems (Joffre 2020). This attack was an attempt to sabotage port operations in response to Iran’s failed cyberattack on Israel’s water treatment and sewage facilities that had transpired less than a month prior (TOI 2020). In response to the attack, Iran stated that it was attempting to prevent future cyberattacks by developing its intranet system known as the National Information Network to limit its reliance on the international cyber community (Joffre 2020).\n\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS\n\nRegarding denial-of-service attacks when the target is a nondemocracy, the first case involves Taiwan and China. On October 23, 2007, a secret agent working for Taiwan’s military intelligence allegedly planted “Trojan” programs in the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, National Defense Research Institutes, Military Industrial Labs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all of which are part of China’s intelligence infrastructure. The motivation behind the attack was to obtain classified intelligence information (Chung 2007). The attack is considered a denial-of-service attack because it temporarily affected the cyber operations of the Chinese targets.\n\nAnother denial-of-service attack involves Israel and Syria. In September 2007 Israel sabotaged Syrian military capabilities by disrupting its radar and air defense systems to enable an Israeli air strike (Melman 2007). This incident led Iran to have less confidence in the Syrian air defense capabilities. Additionally, this could be considered a hybrid attack due to the cyber nature of the attack combined with kinetic jammers in a plane being used to sabotage Syria’s radar and air defense capabilities (Melman 2007).\n\nThe two remaining attacks in the category involve the United States and North Korea and the United States and Russia. In September 2017 the US Cyber Command targeted North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (a.k.a. North Korean Intelligence Agency) to deny service to North Korea’s cyber capabilities (Council on Foreign Relations 2017). This effort was based on directives from the US executive branch and was achieved through the United States overloading North Korea’s internet system with an abundance of traffic, resulting in the stoppage of internet access (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017). The United States used this event as a signal to pressure other states to sever ties with North Korea (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017).\n\nIn another attack carried out by the United States against Russia, in November 2018 the US Cyber Command sabotaged a Russian troll farm to maintain the integrity of the US midterm election by preventing the dissemination of disinformation (Kube and Dilanian 2019). The US efforts against the Russian government, and more specifically the Internet Research Agency, once again aimed to prevent disinformation by taking the troll farm offline during the day of the 2018 midterm elections and the few days following it (Chiacu and Hosenball 2019).\n\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DATA DESTRUCTION\n\nThe lone event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using data destruction attacks involves the United States and Iran. In late September 2019, the US government conducted cyberattacks against Iran resulting in the destruction of data and physical hardware (Ali and Stewart 2019). This attack was in response to increased tensions between the United States and Iran due to Iran’s alleged attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities a few weeks prior (Council on Foreign Relations 2021b). The goal of the attack was to prevent Tehran’s ability to spread propaganda regarding its attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.\n\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\n\nThe first event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using espionage attacks involves multiple democracies initiating espionage attacks in a coordinated event. In late 2018 Five Eyes (an intelligence alliance between the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) used malware to spy on Yandex (the Russian version of Google) user accounts (Bing, Stubbs, and Menn 2019). The malware known as Regin was used by Five Eyes in a previous operation. The attack was carried out to gain technical information related to account authentication credentials that would enable access to and monitoring privileges over various Yandex user accounts and messages. The specific accounts of interest were likely key members of the Russian government and the Russian military that had personal Yandex accounts.\n\nThe next event involves the Netherlands and Russia. As reported in 2018, the Netherlands conducted espionage operations through the use of malware by targeting and compromising “the Dukes,” an arm of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (Poulsen 2019). This was likely done to gain a better understanding of the Dukes’ targeting methods and operations and to assist the US intelligence community in determining who was responsible for the 2016 compromise of the Democratic National Committee. Russia’s encroachment on European politics posed a potential future threat to the Netherlands, which likely led to the combined efforts with the US intelligence community to execute the attack in this instance, although direct coordination with US forces remains unconfirmed (Poulsen 2019).\n\nThe last event in the category involves South Korea and North Korea. As reported in March 2020, South Korea’s\n\nGlobal Perspectives",

While the identities of the specific individuals targeted were not released, it is believed that the attack was executed to gain information such as emails and documents from North Korean government officials and key professionals. The goal was likely to gather as much intelligence as possible on North Korea's military capabilities and nuclear missile program.\n\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES\n\nIn considering the 13 cyberattacks launched by democracies against authoritarian states, the most common form of attack was sabotage (38 percent), followed by denial of service (31 percent), espionage (23 percent), and data destruction (8 percent). It appears that democracies are more likely to carry out attacks that result in actual damage (cyber or kinetic) when targeting nondemocratic states. Many of the attacks appear to be aimed at damaging an authoritarian state's military capabilities, retaliating for previous kinetic actions directed against a democracy or its allies, attempting to prevent interference in domestic politics by a foreign adversary, disrupting operations by potential rival states, and collecting intelligence from potential authoritarian adversaries.\n\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SABOTAGE\n\nThe lone event in this category is the well-known Stuxnet attack. Stuxnet was first detected in June 2010 but may have been in operation as early as 2009 (Fildes 2010). It is believed that the United States and Israel were responsible for the classified creation of Stuxnet during an operation codenamed “Olympic Games” (Schwartz 2012). The two states are alleged to have used Stuxnet to target a variety of states including Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Taiwan (Council on Foreign Relations 2010). The most notable incident of the use of Stuxnet was against Iran to severely degrade its nuclear program without the use of ground forces or airstrikes to enhance the national security of both the United States and Israel (Fildes 2010). While the United States and Israel have not claimed responsibility for the cyberattack, strategic political motivations and technological capabilities indicate the two states are the likely sponsors of the event. Additionally, several researchers have contended that the United States and Israel were responsible for the attack (Baezner and Robin 2017; Lindsay 2013; Nakashima and Warrick 2012), making Stuxnet one of the most highly publicized cyberattacks initiated by democratic states against both democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously.\n\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND DATA DESTRUCTION\n\nThe one event in this category involves a high-profile attack carried out by the United States and Israel directed at multiple states, both democratic and authoritarian. A malware called Flame is believed to have been in operation from August 2010 until May 2012 in multiple countries including Iran, Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Hungary, Austria, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and France (Lee 2012). The malware is extremely complex and could change the future of cyber conflict, according to some observers (Villasenor 2016). The malware is believed to have been sponsored by the United States and Israel with the intent of both destroying data and gaining intelligence. The United States has denied allegations of involvement in the attacks (Paganini 2012). The most likely motives behind the attacks were to conduct cyber operations against adversary states and to gather intelligence to gain strategic advantages against potential enemies. In addition, the likely motives for the sponsoring states in conducting the operations against other democracies were to gain access to financial accounts for persons of interest and to test their capabilities before use against adversaries to ensure that the sponsor states did not lose the element of surprise.\n\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ESPIONAGE\n\nThere are a total of 10 cases that fall within the category of democracies attacking democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously using espionage attacks. Thus, due to space constraints and the large number of events, we do not include descriptions of each attack here. The descriptions can be found in the appendix. Regarding the broad overview of the attacks, some attacks involved multiple sponsor states, and the attacking democracies include the United States (4 attacks), Israel (3 attacks), the United Kingdom, France, India, Spain, and Pakistan. The motivations behind the attacks varied for each event. The motivations included the desire to obtain sensitive military and financial intelligence from specific states and obtain information on individuals of interest. Other motivations included the desire to obtain classified information to gain influence over ongoing high-stakes international negotiations. Attacks were also carried out to test specific cyber offensive capabilities to lay the groundwork for future attacks. Attacks were also executed to acquire information that would lead to cyber advantages over other states and to gain intelligence on rival states.\n\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY\n\nIn considering the 12 cyberattacks launched by democracies against democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously, the most common form of attack was espionage (83 percent), followed by data destruction (8 percent) and sabotage (8 percent). Democracies appear significantly more",

Many of the espionage attacks were aimed at collecting intelligence for economic, military, and strategic purposes. Also, attacks appear to be deployed to test offensive cyber capabilities and to damage nondemocratic adversaries' military capabilities (in the case of Stuxnet, where the United States and Israel targeted Iran's nuclear facilities).\n\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\n\nThere were only two cases in which democracies attacked only other democracies. In both cases, the attack type was espionage. The first event involved Pakistan. Throughout 2020 APT 36, a hacker group from Pakistan, targeted multiple Indian officials in espionage operations including those in defense organizations through operation \"honey trap\" (Mantri 2020). This operation was a continuation of recent tensions between Pakistan and India and was used to spread misinformation regarding the coronavirus while also gaining access to Indian government servers (Threat Intelligence Team 2021; Gill 2020), impacting the Indian economy, and gaining an advantage in the realm of command and control (C2) security capabilities.\n\nThe other attack was initiated by Indonesia. In January 2016 a spyware program linked to the Indonesian government was found to be using a server in Sydney, Australia (Barbaschow 2016). The spyware, FinFisher, has been known to be utilized for surveillance purposes (Main and Duffy 2016). FinFisher was likely deployed by Indonesia due to previous allegations that the Australian government had intercepted communications from the Indonesian president in 2009 (Barbaschow 2016). Although the FinFisher spyware was likely used to spy on members of the Australian government, it is also probable that Indonesia was using the Australian server to obscure their spyware from other states to allow it to operate without detection for a longer period.\n\n# DISCUSSION\n\nIn examining the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies, several trends emerge. Firstly, democracies are significantly more likely to target authoritarian states in their attacks. This finding supports previous research that posits that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies. Thus, our findings support the notion that democracies target authoritarian states to a greater degree than nondemocracies. From 2005 through 2020, there were only two known cases in which democracies cyberattacked other democracies (when only democratic states were targeted). The motivations behind cyberattacks directed at democracies are often to collect governmental and economic intelligence through espionage attacks. Secondly, democracies deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states. Democracies are more likely to deploy sabotage, denial-of-service, and data destruction\n\nattacks when cyberattacking authoritarian states and espionage attacks when targeting other democracies. Thirdly, the motivations behind cyberattacks directed at authoritarian states are to inflict damage on the defensive capabilities of authoritarian states, prevent authoritarian states from interfering with domestic politics in democracies, collect governmental and defense intelligence, and disrupt military operations of rival, authoritarian states. These findings provide support for the literature on democratic peace and kinetic conflict extending into cyberspace. As with kinetic conflict, democracies appear to engage with other democracies less aggressively in cyberspace compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes. Thus, the conflict-inhibiting effects of shared norms, values, and institutions that frequently exist between democracies in the kinetic realm appear to extend into cyberspace when considering cyberattacks.\n\nKalberg (2016) posits that when applying military theories to the cyber realm, it is important to account for the anonymous nature of cyberattacks. Thus, future research should examine the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks compared with kinetic conflict. Future research should examine how the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affects the initiation of cyberattacks by democratic and authoritarian states and how anonymity in the cyber realm conditions state leaders' decisions to employ cyberattacks instead of kinetic attacks. Answering these questions could shed additional light on the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks based on regime type.\n\nWhile our research shows that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies and democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted states, several limitations of the study should be discussed. First, as previously mentioned, many cyberattacks are unreported, unverified, and unattributed. Thus, our analysis of democratically initiated cyberattacks captures data only on known, verified, and attributed cyberattacks. Many additional attacks likely occurred during the period that are not accounted for in publicly available data sources. Second, we have attempted to analyze and explain the motivations behind democratically initiated cyberattacks based on open-source data. Additional political, economic, and social motivations likely exist for some of the cases included in the study, and this information could be obtained from classified sources. Lastly, many of the democratically initiated cyberattacks during the period were attributed to the United States. While fourteen democratic states initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020, 55 percent of the cases involved the United States. Thus, the United States has a larger effect on the findings compared to other states.\n\nIn expanding upon this study, future research could include additional cyber data as it becomes available to conduct large $N$, cross-national quantitative analysis. Future research could also consider the role of nonstate actors and emerging technologies in affecting the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Additionally, future research should continue to consider how regime type affects cyber conflict and examine the nature of cyberattacks deployed by\n\nGlobal Perspectives",

This research could analyze whether authoritarian states launch more aggressive cyberattacks based on whether the targeted states are democratic or authoritarian. Also, future research could analyze the motivations behind cyberattacks that are deployed by authoritarian states. This research could shed additional light on how regime type and domestic institutions affect the behavior of states in cyberspace.\n\nIn considering the implications of the study for global security, based on the findings from this study and other cyber scholarship (Hunter et al. 2022), democracies appear more likely to cyberattack authoritarian states and authoritarian states appear more prone to cyberattack democracies. This is not to argue that cyberattacks do not occur between states with similar regime types. Rather, based on the findings from this study and others, cyberattacks are most likely to occur between democratic and authoritarian states. Therefore, in considering cyber defenses, government leaders should be mindful that impactful cyberattacks are most likely to emerge from states with regime types disparate from their own. Additionally, modern and future warfare is likely to entail a mixture of cyber, cognitive, and kinetic forms of conflict (i.e., hybrid warfare) (Danyk and Briggs 2023). Therefore, governments should configure their cyber defenses in a manner that accounts for where cyberattacks are most likely to originate from, and considering the regime type of states could assist in their threat assessments. Lastly, initiating cyberattacks can be a risky strategy at times due to the possibility of cyber or kinetic retaliation from targeted states. Also, the deployment of cyberattacks frequently results in the inability to use the specific form of offensive cyber weaponry in future operations as targeted states are often able to understand the composition of the cyberattack and successfully defend against it in future attacks (Pedersen and Jacobsen 2024). Thus, democracies should be mindful of the potential risks and rewards associated with initiating cyberattacks when conducting cost-benefit analyses regarding the decision to utilize offensive cyber operations.\n\n## COMPETING INTERESTS\n\nThe authors have no competing interests to disclose.\n\n## BIOGRAPHIES\n\nLance Y.

However, less is known regarding how democracies operate in cyberspace as it pertains to cyberaggression. Thus, this study examines the offensive strategies of democratic states that initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states from 2005 through 2020. In examining the cyberattacks initiated by democracies during this period, we aim to better understand the motives behind democratically initiated cyberattacks, the regime types that are likely to be targeted in the attacks, and the types of cyberattacks that democracies are likely to deploy. In conducting this analysis, we find that democracies rarely attack other democratic states in cyberspace and democracies are likely to deploy more aggressive and hostile attacks when targeting authoritarian regimes. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. These findings have important implications for considering how democratic institutions affect international relations and cybersecurity.\n# INTRODUCTION\nIn October 2020 the US Cyber Command launched a series of cyberattacks that sabotaged the Russian network referred to as TrickBot, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using ransomware termed Ryuk (Nakashima 2020). When questioned about the events, US General and Commander of the US Cyber Command Paul Nakasone acknowledged the United States' efforts as \"persistent engagement\" with the goal being to maintain the integrity of the 2020 US election by preventing bot interference. A secondary goal was likely to prevent other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020). In examining the 2020 TrickBot cyberattack, several questions emerge regarding why democracies carry out cyberattacks and how democratic institutions affect the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies.\nA large amount of literature in international relations has considered the factors that affect the conflict behavior of democratic states regarding traditional forms of military conflict. However, to date, minimal research has examined how democracies behave in cyberspace regarding cyber conflict. This is problematic given the important role many researchers contend that cyber conflict plays in international security (Al-Ahmad 2013; Khan 2018). Thus, we contend that it is important to examine cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies to better understand their motivations, tactics, and the regimes that are most likely to be targeted in democratically initiated attacks. Doing so could help bridge the gap between research on democracies and traditional military conflict and cyber conflict. In addition, given the important role cyberaggression is likely to play in affecting global security in the future, attempting to understand the behavior of democracies in cyberspace is a critical area for security studies.\nPrevious research has found that democracies are less likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes (Hunter et al. 2022). This scholarship has discovered that when democracies do initiate cyberattacks, they are significantly more likely to target authoritarian regimes. In addition, this research finds that democracies do cyberattack other democracies, but it is rare. However, two questions that are not addressed in the research are (1) if democracies initiate cyberattacks to a lesser degree than authoritarian states, what are the motivating factors behind the attacks; and (2) what type of cyberattacks are democracies likely to deploy against other states based on the regime type of the targeted states? In answering these questions, we analyze data from the Coun\na Corresponding author: lahunter@augusta.edu\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\ncil on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a) and conduct case study analyses of all known democratically initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020. We incorporate literature from the democratic peace theory and research on regime type and kinetic conflict in attempting to explain why democracies carry out cyberattacks and to understand the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies. We contend that democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted state. Democracies often deploy more aggressive and hostile cyberattacks against authoritarian regimes compared with cyberattacks that are carried out against other democracies. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. More specifically, we argue that shared democratic norms, institutions, and values between democracies lead democracies to be more likely to target authoritarian states in cyberattacks and to deploy more aggressive cyberattacks against authoritarian states compared with democracies. Overall, this study seeks to expand our understanding of democratic states' behavior in cyberspace by examining the motivating factors behind democratically initiated cyberattacks and the types of cyberattacks democracies deploy based on the regime type of targeted states.\nThe layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows. First, we discuss the definitions of the main cyber terms used in the paper. Next, we examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyber conflict. We then analyze previous scholarship regarding how regime type affects traditional forms of military conflict and cyber conflict. Next, we examine data from the CFR-COTD (CFR 2021a) and conduct case study analyses in which we analyze the motivations, strategies, and targets of cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states by examining the full universe of known and verified cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. Lastly, we discuss our findings and implications for international security.\n# CYBER DEFINITIONS\nTo properly examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we need to define key cyber terms discussed in the study. The first term is \"cyber.\" Cyber refers to a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers\" (NIST 2024). The next term is \"cyber warfare/conflict.\" We use both \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" because some scholarship utilizes the term \"cyber warfare\" and other research uses the term \"cyber conflict\" when discussing the same type of cyber aggression. While the focus of this paper is on cyberattacks, it is important to define \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" as the terms are referenced in the paper concerning previous scholarship on cyber. \"Cyber warfare/cyber conflict\" is defined as \"the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's computers or information networks through,\nfor example, computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks\" (RAND 2024). The last term we define is \"cyberattack.\" The US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 2024) provides two definitions of \"cyberattack.\" The first is \"Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.\" The second is \"An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise's use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.\" The US Federal Emergency Management Agency defines \"cyberattack\" as \"malicious attempts to access or damage a computer system\" (FEMA 2024). The National Cyber Security Centre in the United Kingdom defines a cyberattack as malicious attempts to damage, disrupt or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks or devices, via cyber means (NCCC 2021). We define a cyberattack based on the criteria set forward in the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) in which a nation-state carries out a cyber operation against another nation-state in the form of denial of service, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, or doxing (CFR 2021a). We do not argue that this definition is superior to others. Rather, we contend that it is appropriate based on the aim and scope of the study. We expand on the definition and operationalization of the term \"cyberattack\" in the research design section of the paper. We now turn to examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyberattacks.\n# FACTORS AFFECTING THE INITIATION OF CYBERATTACKS\nMany scholars view cyberattacks as an extension of or an alternative to kinetic conflict (Borghard and Lonergan 2019, 122; Hjortdal 2011, 1). The reasons states deploy cyberattacks as opposed to kinetic attacks vary depending on the state. One perspective for why states initiate cyberattacks is that some states may not possess the power to compete with other states from a kinetic, military standpoint. Some scholars and military leaders consider cyberattacks to be an equalizer between states in some instances because less powerful states may be able to initiate cyberattacks while they lack the capabilities to launch successful kinetic attacks. Based on this perspective, weaker states may choose to deploy cyberattacks against more powerful adversaries. However, this theory has yet to be supported by empirical studies. Research on how power asymmetries affect cyberattacks is limited. One study that examines the effect state power has on cyber conflict finds that more powerful states (measured in terms of economic and military power) are more likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with less powerful states (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). The authors find that on average states that initiate cyberattacks have twice the amount of power compared with the states that are targeted in cyberattacks. Additional studies have found that factors such as international trade (Akoto 2021), previous episodes of kinetic conflict (Osawa\nGlobal Perspectives\n2017), and whether states are rivals (Valeriano and Maness 2014) can influence the likelihood of cyberattacks.\nValeriano (2018) contends that cyberattacks are a form of covert coercion that normally seeks to send ambiguous signals or resolve to rival states. Valeriano finds that cyberattacks tend to transpire in coordination with traditional political activities (such as economic coercion or military threats or provocation) and they usually fail to produce political concessions from the targeted states (2018). Another reason states may deploy cyberattacks is possible anonymity, which enables users to remain undetected in many cases (2015, 19). Thus, even if hostile cyber action is detected, it can be difficult to accurately identify the state that is responsible for the attack. Additionally, cyberattacks can serve a variety of purposes. Cyberattacks can be used for espionage purposes to gain valuable information to aid an aggressor's future operations. Cyberattacks can also be employed to sabotage and destroy targets within the victim state and limit the victim states' capabilities (both cyber and kinetic). Thus, cyberattacks may serve as both enhancers and alternatives to kinetic conflict and can be used for multiple purposes.\nHaving the factors associated with the initiation of cyberattacks in previous scholarship, we now turn to examining how regime type affects the nature, target, and motivation of democratically initiated cyberattacks. Within this discussion, we consider previous research on how regime type affects the conflict behavior of democracies in the kinetic realm and what implications this scholarship has for democracies and the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Thus, we seek to understand how regime type affects the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies.\n## REGIME TYPE AND THE NATURE OF CYBERATTACKS INITIATED BY DEMOCRACIES\nA few important works examine the strategic use of cyber operations by democratic states (Goldman and Warner 2020; Kallberg 2016). Kallberg (2016) highlights the challenges in applying traditional military theory to cyber conflict. Kallberg contends that a theory of cyber conflict should address unique aspects of cyber that include anonymity, object permanence, measurable results, and rapid execution. More specifically, how does the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affect their usage compared with kinetic conflict in which most kinetic attacks are not anonymous? Relatedly, Goldman and Warner (2020) posit that democracies' interests (such as those of the United States) are often at risk due to continuous low-level cyber operations deployed by adversarial states. Over time, these operations can weaken the economic, political, and military power of democratic states. To address the threats, they contend that democracies should pursue an “integrated cybersecurity strategy” that combines national power and military cyber operations and focuses on deterrence, persistence (constant cyber operations that dismantle adversarial cyber activities), and anticipatory resilience (learning from past cyber operations, hardening cyber systems, preparing for future attacks, and limiting the impact of cyberattacks). Solar (2020) examines how emerging democracies in Latin America are approaching cyber threats, the role of the military in providing cyber security, and the implications for democratic governance. Solar finds that militaries in many emerging democracies are taking the lead in controlling cyberinfrastructure for cyber security purposes. Solar contends that this could be problematic in some instances if military involvement in cyber security undermines democratic governance by threatening a secure and open internet. Solar argues that emerging democracies should advance a balanced approach that includes military involvement in cybersecurity along with interactive policy communities with multiple stakeholders (including the defense sector) to review and manage cybersecurity policies. Solar contends that civil oversight of cybersecurity infrastructure is important to protect democratic values and principles (Solar 2020).\nIn trying to understand the behavior of democratic states regarding the initiation of cyberattacks, it is important to discuss multiple perspectives on how regime type can possibly impact cyberattacks. One potential perspective is that democracies could be more prone to launch cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes because cyberattacks could be an alternative to kinetic conflict. One of the rationales for this position is that many cyberattacks are anonymous and attribution is often difficult (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018). According to Tsagourias (2012), multiple characteristics of cyberattacks make attribution difficult. Rid and Buchanon contend that attribution should be viewed as an art and not an exact science because it is a complex, political, and multilayered process (2015). They posit that effective attribution is dependent upon resources, time, and the sophistication of the attacker. Additionally, states are more likely to devote significant resources to attribution when cyberattacks are more severe. Thus, attribution should be viewed as a gradual process, and nation-states should be considered the most capable actors to accurately attribute cyberattacks due to their significant resources. Also, according to Rid and Buchanon, states with greater technological sophistication and human talent should be able to initiate cyberattacks more easily and covertly and attribute cyberattacks more effectively while responding to cyberattacks from adversaries (2015). Therefore, from this perspective, in many instances, initiating a cyberattack could be a less risky tactic than kinetic conflict due to the difficulty in attributing attacks, and democratic states could perceive cyberattacks as a more appropriate strategy than kinetic operations. In addition, some scholars contend that cyberattacks can be executed with reduced costs and lower risks than kinetic conflict due to the lack of need for combat personnel and based on the previously discussed difficulty in attributing cyberattacks (Tsagourias 2012).\nAnother perspective is that democracies should be less likely to initiate cyberattacks not based on the pacifying effects of democratic institutions but according to the notion that democracies are likely to be wealthier than nondemocracies (on average) and have greater technological capacity and dependency (compared with authoritarian states),\nand states with greater technological dependency should be more conservative regarding the initiation of offensive cyber operations (McConnell 2009). However, an alternate perspective is that states with greater wealth and resources are more likely to initiate cyberattacks, based on previous research, which finds that more powerful states are more prone to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). Additionally, other scholars contend that states with greater technological connectivity are more capable regarding cyber offense and defense as it becomes easier for these states to initiate covert cyberattacks and attribute cyberattacks to adversaries (Rid and Buchanan 2015). As Rid and Buchanon remark: “A third common assumption is that the most industrialized and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage. Attribution again reverses this logic: the larger a government's technical prowess, and the larger the pool of talent and skills at its disposal, the higher will be that state's ability to hide its own covert operations, uncover others, and respond accordingly” (2015, 31).\nLastly, a separate perspective is that the conflict-reducing effects of democratic institutions extend not only to kinetic conflict but to cyberattacks as well. This line of reasoning posits that democracies may be more peaceful in cyberspace compared with authoritarian regimes due to the presence of democratic norms, democratic institutions, and democracies' involvement in international institutions. Previous research provides some support for this position in that democracies are found to be less likely to initiate cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes when controlling for several political and economic factors (Hunter et al. 2022). Thus, there is evidence that regime type affects the conflict propensity of states regarding cyber behavior and democracies are less likely to deploy cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes. In addition, this scholarship has found that democracies rarely attack one another in the cyber realm. However, if democracies are less likely to initiate cyberattacks and are less prone to cyberattack other democracies, what motivates democracies to initiate cyberattacks? More specifically, what are the motivations for cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states?\nResearch on the behavior of democracies regarding kinetic conflict finds that democracies do not initiate wars with one another (often referred to as the dyadic democratic peace), although there are many instances of democracies warring with authoritarian regimes (Russett 1993). While this is one of the strongest empirical findings in international relations (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003), researchers debate the rationale for the findings, and some scholars refute the claim that democracies are less likely to war with one another (Barkawi and Laffey 1999; Rosato 2003). In responding to the claims that democratic peace findings are questionable, Imai and Lo (2021) test the democratic peace theory in a cross-national analysis and “show that overturning the negative association between democracy and conflict would require a confounder that is forty-seven times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in other dyads. To put this number in context, the relationship between democracy and peace is at least five times as robust as that between smoking and lung cancer. To explain away the democratic peace, therefore, scholars would have to find far more powerful confounders than those already identified in the literature” (901). In addition, while many scholars contend that democracies rarely or have never gone to war with one another, democracies have engaged in minor conflicts and disputes (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021). Thus, previous scholarship finds that democracies have engaged in lower-level disputes with one another, although rarely have the disputes escalated to war (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021; Mousseau 1997, 1998). One potential explanation for this finding is that when democracies interact with one another, they are more likely to resort to diplomacy due to shared institutions, norms, and values (Anderson and Souva 2010; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; and Rey and Barkdull 2005). A large amount of literature is devoted to explaining the reasons for these findings, and the explanations vary but include the design of democratic institutions, shared norms and values, and democracies' membership and involvement in international institutions. While this research is voluminous, one clear takeaway is that democracies interact with authoritarian and democratic states in significantly different ways, and democracies are more likely to engage with other democracies more peacefully compared with their interactions with non-democracies.\nWhile previous research has demonstrated that democracies are less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks (Hunter et al. 2022), research to date has not examined the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies. If we extend the literature on how democracies interact with other democracies and authoritarian regimes in the kinetic realm to cyberspace, the logical extension is that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies, and in the event of a cyberattack, the cyberattacks directed against other democracies should be less aggressive and hostile (i.e. overtly conflictual and potentially damaging) compared with the cyberattacks launched against authoritarian states. The rationale is that democracies are more likely to resort to compromise and diplomacy when interacting with other democracies compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes (Mousseau 1997, 1998). More specifically, democracies should view other democracies as more friendly and less hostile due to shared values, institutions, and norms, and when issues or disagreements emerge between democracies, they should be more likely to resolve the issues diplomatically rather than through acts of cyberaggression. Therefore, in extending the research on democratic state behavior regarding kinetic conflict to the cyber realm, democracies should pursue more aggressive strategies when interacting with authoritarian regimes and less aggressive strategies when engaging other democracies. Thus, based on our previous discussions, we argue that democracies should be less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks. This leads us to our first proposition.\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nProposition 1: When democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks, democracies should be less likely to target democracies and more likely to target authoritarian states.\nThere are many different forms of cyberattacks. The Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a) disaggregates cyberattacks according to the following types: sabotage, denial of service, data destruction, and espionage. While the amount of damage and intensity of each attack type can vary by attack, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are usually viewed as more aggressive hostile acts compared with cyberattacks that involve only espionage (Schmitt 2012). The reason is that cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, or data destruction often produce actual and immediate damage (kinetic and/or cyber) and are more likely to be reported and discovered by the media and citizens within states. Thus, these cyber actions are often viewed as more hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks. However, we do not argue that espionage attacks are insignificant actions. Cyberespionage attacks are regarded as serious forms of cyberattacks by many researchers because vital information can be gained through acts of cyberespionage that can produce significant real-world effects and implications for national security (Deoliveira 2019). Additionally, espionage attacks can be deployed to gain valuable information on adversary states that can be later used in kinetic attacks or additional cyberattacks (ENISA 2020). However, in the aggregate, while espionage attacks clearly qualify as cyberattacks, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are frequently viewed as more aggressive and hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks.\nIn extending the literature on kinetic conflict to cyberspace, we argue that when democracies initiate cyberattacks, they should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states compared with instances in which they target other democracies. The rationale for this argument is based on research on kinetic conflict that finds that when disagreements occur between democracies, they are less likely to escalate to higher levels of intensity due to shared norms, values, and institutions (Anderson and Souva 2010; Imai and Lo 2021; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; Rey and Barkdull 2005). This stands in contrast to episodes when democracies have disputes with authoritarian regimes, in which there is a greater likelihood of hostile engagement due to\nthe lack of shared norms, values, and institutions. Thus, based on the discussion, our second proposition is:\nProposition 2: Democracies should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks (i.e., sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service) when targeting authoritarian regimes and less hostile cyberattacks (i.e., cyberespionage) when targeting other democratic states.\n# RESEARCH DESIGN\nTo examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we collected data on cyberattacks that were initiated by democracies against other states from 2005 through 2020. The cases included in the study are those in which democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states during the period and attribution for the attack is verified. Thus, every verifiable instance of a democracy initiating a known state-sponsored cyberattack against another state or states during the period is included in the study (as defined and operationalized by the Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a)). We do not analyze cyberattacks executed by nonstate actors. The reason is that we aim to analyze the motives, rationale, and targets of democratically initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks, and examining nonstate hacking/criminal/terrorist groups would not produce relevant information for the purposes of our study. The data on cyberattacks are collected from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a). The Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) provides data on known state-sponsored cyberattacks that transpired during this period in which the initiator and the target are nation-states or are directly affiliated with a nation-state. The state-sponsored cyberattacks that are included in the dataset are events where threat actors commit denial-of-service attacks, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, and doxing (CFR 2021a). The reasoning for the dataset's focus on state-sponsored attacks is as follows: \"The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests. Furthermore, state-sponsored incidents generally have the most accurate and comprehensive reporting. Reporting on nonstate actors, such as hacktivist groups, tends to be murkier and makes for less reliable data\" (CFR 2021a). The CFR data are collected based on several open-source outlets that include but are not limited to\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 1. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks and Target Type\n|  Target Type | Frequency | Percentage  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 13 | 48%  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 12 | 44%  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 2 | 7%  |\ngovernment press documents, cybersecurity corporations, existing repositories, and media reports and publications concerning state-sponsored attacks (CFR 2021a).\nIn discussing cyber data, several limitations should be acknowledged. One limitation regarding the data, which is relevant to all cyber conflict datasets, is that not every cyberattack that transpired during the period is included because of limited information pertaining to some of these cyberattacks. More specifically, some cyberattacks are not reported, and many cyberattacks remain anonymous due to difficulty in accurately attributing attacks and the purposeful effort by some states to mask their cyber activity. Second, the CFR relies on publicly available data. As the CFR stipulates, \"State intelligence agencies and private cybersecurity firms are likely to have the most complete data about state-sponsored actors, but may not make what they know public to protect national security or trade secrets\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, the cyber events that are included in the CFR (COTD) are verified incidents where information is known and verified regarding the states that carried out the attacks and the states that were victims of the attacks based on open-source data.\nWe utilize the four categorizations from the COTD regarding the attack type. The four categories are espionage, sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service. The four categories are examined because these are the four cyberattack types utilized by the COTD (CFR 2021a). Additionally, previous cyber research has discussed and analyzed these attack types (Banks 2017; CISA 2019; Maurer and Morgus 2014), and they are considered standard attack types in the cyber literature. Denial-of-service attacks prevent appropriate users from accessing information systems, devices, and network resources due to a malicious cyber actor (CISA 2019). Attackers can target a variety of resources and can deny service in different ways. Ultimately, denial-of-service attacks overwhelm the computer network by sending more data than it is capable of processing, resulting in a temporary paralysis of the computer network (CFR 2021a). Cyber sabotage is an attack carried out against the integrity of an IT system (Maurer and Morgus 2014, 58). This attack \"causes a disruption to a physical process\" (CFR 2021a). Data destruction is the process of destroying data on electronic or physical mediums (Ministry of Justice 2021). In some cases, this is done intentionally for security purposes. Cyber data destruction results in a computer or computer networks becoming unusable due to the use of malicious software (CFR 2021a). Cyberespionage refers to a state covertly collecting information for intelligence purposes (Australian Cyber Security Center 2021). More specifically, cyberespionage involves penetration of computer systems or networks to obtain information on or going\nthrough these systems, without the information holder's consent (Banks 2017, 513; CFR 2021a). In addition to analyzing the attack types of democratically initiated cyberattacks, we also examine the sectors targeted within victim states based on the COTD's classification as follows: government, private sector, civil society, and the military.\n## FINDINGS\nIn total, there were 27 cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. The overall breakdown of the 27 attacks that were initiated by democracies between 2005 and 2020 is as follows and is presented in table 1. There were 13 cases (48 percent) where democracies attacked only authoritarian states. There were 12 cases (44 percent) where democracies attacked both democracies and authoritarian states simultaneously. There were 2 cases (7 percent) in which democracies attacked only other democracies. Thus, in examining these statistics, we see that when democracies launch cyberattacks, they are likely to target authoritarian regimes specifically, or a combination of democratic and authoritarian regimes in simultaneous attacks. Also, democracies do occasionally target democracies (where an authoritarian regime is not attacked simultaneously), but it is rare. In 7 percent of cases does a democracy attack only another democracy. Thus, the primary targets for democracies appear to be either solely authoritarian states or a simultaneous combination of authoritarian and democratic states. This finding provides support for proposition 1, which stipulates that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies.\nTable 2 displays the specific sector targeted in a cyberattack based on the regime type that is targeted. In respect to the attack type based on the sector that is targeted when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 6 government, 3 private, 1 civil society, and 3 military. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 7 government, 1 private, 0 civil society, and 4 military. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 0 government, 0 private, 1 civil society, and 1 military. Thus, in examining table 2, we find that government sectors are more likely to be targeted in attacks when only authoritarian states are targeted and in attacks where both authoritarian and democratic states are targeted simultaneously. Civil society and military sectors are most frequently targeted when only democratic regimes are the victims of democratically initiated cyberattacks.\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 2. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks, Target Type, and Targeted Sectors\n|  Target Type | Government | Private | Civil Society | Military  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 6 | 3 | 1 | 3  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 7 | 1 | 0 | 4  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1  |\nTable 3. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks, Target Type, and Attack Type\n|  Target Type | Espionage | Sabotage | Data Destruction | Denial of Service  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 3 | 5 | 1 | 4  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 10 | 1 | 1 | 0  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  |\nTable 3 displays the attack type when considering the regime type targeted. In respect to the attack type when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 3 espionage, 5 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and 4 denial-of-service attacks. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 10 espionage, 1 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and no denial-of-service attacks. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 2 espionage, and no attacks regarding sabotage, data destruction, and denial-of-service attacks.\nIn examining the results in table 3, we find that a few patterns emerge. First, democracies are more likely to commit acts of sabotage when only authoritarian states are targeted versus attacks that include both democratic and authoritarian states or solely democratic states. One hundred percent of the sabotage attacks committed by democracies were committed against only authoritarian states. Second, denial-of-service attacks are more likely to be committed against only authoritarian states. Democracies did not initiate any denial-of-service attacks in attacks that included simultaneous attacks against democracies and authoritarian states. Also, democracies did not deploy any denial-of-service attacks against only democratic states. Once again, one hundred percent of denial-of-service attacks were deployed against only authoritarian states. Regarding data destruction, democracies were equally likely to initiate data destruction attacks against authoritarian states and in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously. Lastly, democracies were more likely to deploy espionage attacks in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously, and 100 percent of the attacks directed against only democratic states were acts of cyberespionage.\nWhen we interpret the results in table 3, it appears that democracies initiate more aggressive and hostile attacks against authoritarian states compared with democratic targets, which provides support for proposition 2. This is not to argue that espionage cannot be destructive. Espionage\nattacks can be costly because they may provide valuable information to a potential adversary that can damage a victim state. However, the types of attacks launched against authoritarian states are more overtly aggressive and hostile because sabotage and denial-of-service attacks often produce significant and immediate damage against a victim state. In addition, these attacks are often immediately known, whereas espionage attacks may be undetected for some time. Thus, the finding that a larger number of sabotage and denial-of-service attacks are initiated against nondemocracies indicates that democracies are more aggressive in deploying their offensive cyber weaponry against authoritarian states compared with when they target other democracies.\nTable 4 displays data regarding whether cyberattacks included in the analysis are carried out in retaliation to a kinetic attack or a cyberattack. Thus, the variable relation refers to whether the cyberattack occurred in response to a kinetic or a cyber hostility that originated from the targeted state. General Retaliation refers to retaliation for a kinetic or cyber hostility originating from the targeted state. Thus, both kinetic and cyber actions are included in the category General Retaliation. Kinetic Retaliation refers to retaliation due to a kinetic hostility committed by the targeted state. Lastly, Cyber Retaliation refers to retaliation for a cyber hostility committed by the targeted state. In examining table 4, we find that the only acts of General Retaliation occurred when democracies attacked only nondemocracies. Out of the 3 total retaliation attacks, 2 were in response to kinetic actions and 1 was in response to a previous cyberattack. When retaliation attacks are initiated by democracies, they are directed at specific authoritarian states. There are no cases of democracies retaliating against other democracies.\nTable 5 displays the number of cyberattacks, and the number of cyberattacks by attack type, initiated by the democratic states included in the analysis. In reviewing table 5, it is important to note that many cyber events involved multiple initiator states. Six of the 26 cases (23 percent) involved multiple initiator states. In examining table 5, we\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 4.

The remaining democratic states in the analysis initiated 1 cyberattack. The findings regarding the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom and the number of cyberattacks deployed reinforce previous scholarship, which finds that more powerful states are more likely to initiate cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). In the next section, we explore the motives, circumstances, and tactics behind these attacks to better understand why democracies may initiate certain types of cyberattacks against authoritarian states versus democracies.\n# CASE STUDY ANALYSIS\nTo more fully understand the nature of state-sponsored cyberattacks initiated by democracies, we analyze qualitative case information pertaining to each cyberattack in respect to the potential motives and tactics associated with the attacks. We utilize publicly available data to obtain this information. In addition, more information is known regarding some events compared with others, and in some cases, there is limited data on the motives and tactics of the attack. As the CFR-COTD states: \"Furthermore, some reporting from the media or cybersecurity companies can be vague or incomplete, making it difficult to confirm incidents for which data is only available from a single source\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, we attempt to provide descriptions of\nthe motives, tactics, and state actors involved in each democratically initiated cyberattack while acknowledging that limited publicly available information and sources exist for some cases. The full list of cases and the key aspects of each case including the cyberattack name, the initiator(s) of the attack, the target(s) of the attack, the type of attack, and the suspected motivation for each attack can be found in table 6. Additionally, given the space constraints of the paper, a more detailed description of each case can be found in the appendix.\nBefore proceeding to the case study analysis, one important point is that additional economic, social, and political motives outside our analysis may have impacted the democratically initiated cyberattacks that are included in the study. Given that 27 cases (cyber events) are discussed in the study, the limited sources for some cases, and the space constraints of the paper, additional possible motives cannot be fully explored for each case. Thus, it is important to note that additional economic, social, and political motives and explanations may exist for each case.\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND SABOTAGE\nIn considering cyberattacks initiated by democracies against only authoritarian states in which the attack type was sabotage, many of the attacks were carried out by the United States. In April 2017, the United States is believed to have sabotaged North Korea's nuclear program by sabotag-\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 6.

The United States' efforts are believed to have been motivated by an attempt to prevent the North Korean military from expanding its missile technology systems to protect South Korea and to maximize security on the Korean Peninsula.\nAnother attack in this category that was executed by the United States that targeted an authoritarian state's missile systems occurred in June 2019 when the US Cyber Command hacked Iranian rocket and missile launch systems in what Iran deemed an unsuccessful effort to disable the systems. This sabotage operation carried out by the United States came during a time of heightened tensions between the two states and served as a response to recent aggression by the Iranian government when it downed a US drone and attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz (Council\non Foreign Relations 2021b). The response by the United States signaled its willingness to deploy cyber capabilities in response to kinetic actions.\nIn a series of attacks launched by the United States against Russia in 2018, the US Cyber Command sabotaged the Russian Internet Research Agency in an attempt to maintain the integrity of the US 2018 elections (Buchanan 2019). Although some information regarding the attack remains unknown, the operation was likely intended to prevent Russian disinformation that could have been disseminated by the Internet Research Agency (Buchanan 2019). In a separate attack directed at Russia, and mentioned in the introduction of the paper, in October 2020 the US Cyber Command sabotaged computers on the TrickBot network, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using Ryuk ransomware (Nakashima 2020). US General and Commander of the US\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nCyber Command Paul Nakasone stated that the cyber operation was carried out as “persistent engagement” with the aim of preserving the integrity of the 2020 US election by eliminating bot interference. A related goal was to thwart other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020).\nIsrael was responsible for the other sabotage attack in the category of democracies initiating sabotage attacks against nondemocracies. In May 2020 Israel conducted a cyberattack targeting Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port near the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran reported only caused damage to private systems (Joffre 2020). This attack was an attempt to sabotage port operations in response to Iran’s failed cyberattack on Israel’s water treatment and sewage facilities that had transpired less than a month prior (TOI 2020). In response to the attack, Iran stated that it was attempting to prevent future cyberattacks by developing its intranet system known as the National Information Network to limit its reliance on the international cyber community (Joffre 2020).\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS\nRegarding denial-of-service attacks when the target is a nondemocracy, the first case involves Taiwan and China. On October 23, 2007, a secret agent working for Taiwan’s military intelligence allegedly planted “Trojan” programs in the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, National Defense Research Institutes, Military Industrial Labs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all of which are part of China’s intelligence infrastructure. The motivation behind the attack was to obtain classified intelligence information (Chung 2007). The attack is considered a denial-of-service attack because it temporarily affected the cyber operations of the Chinese targets.\nAnother denial-of-service attack involves Israel and Syria. In September 2007 Israel sabotaged Syrian military capabilities by disrupting its radar and air defense systems to enable an Israeli air strike (Melman 2007). This incident led Iran to have less confidence in the Syrian air defense capabilities. Additionally, this could be considered a hybrid attack due to the cyber nature of the attack combined with kinetic jammers in a plane being used to sabotage Syria’s radar and air defense capabilities (Melman 2007).\nThe two remaining attacks in the category involve the United States and North Korea and the United States and Russia. In September 2017 the US Cyber Command targeted North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (a.k.a. North Korean Intelligence Agency) to deny service to North Korea’s cyber capabilities (Council on Foreign Relations 2017). This effort was based on directives from the US executive branch and was achieved through the United States overloading North Korea’s internet system with an abundance of traffic, resulting in the stoppage of internet access (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017). The United States used this event as a signal to pressure other states to sever ties with North Korea (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017).\nIn another attack carried out by the United States against Russia, in November 2018 the US Cyber Command sabotaged a Russian troll farm to maintain the integrity of the US midterm election by preventing the dissemination of disinformation (Kube and Dilanian 2019). The US efforts against the Russian government, and more specifically the Internet Research Agency, once again aimed to prevent disinformation by taking the troll farm offline during the day of the 2018 midterm elections and the few days following it (Chiacu and Hosenball 2019).\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe lone event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using data destruction attacks involves the United States and Iran. In late September 2019, the US government conducted cyberattacks against Iran resulting in the destruction of data and physical hardware (Ali and Stewart 2019). This attack was in response to increased tensions between the United States and Iran due to Iran’s alleged attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities a few weeks prior (Council on Foreign Relations 2021b). The goal of the attack was to prevent Tehran’s ability to spread propaganda regarding its attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThe first event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using espionage attacks involves multiple democracies initiating espionage attacks in a coordinated event. In late 2018 Five Eyes (an intelligence alliance between the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) used malware to spy on Yandex (the Russian version of Google) user accounts (Bing, Stubbs, and Menn 2019). The malware known as Regin was used by Five Eyes in a previous operation. The attack was carried out to gain technical information related to account authentication credentials that would enable access to and monitoring privileges over various Yandex user accounts and messages. The specific accounts of interest were likely key members of the Russian government and the Russian military that had personal Yandex accounts.\nThe next event involves the Netherlands and Russia. As reported in 2018, the Netherlands conducted espionage operations through the use of malware by targeting and compromising “the Dukes,” an arm of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (Poulsen 2019). This was likely done to gain a better understanding of the Dukes’ targeting methods and operations and to assist the US intelligence community in determining who was responsible for the 2016 compromise of the Democratic National Committee. Russia’s encroachment on European politics posed a potential future threat to the Netherlands, which likely led to the combined efforts with the US intelligence community to execute the attack in this instance, although direct coordination with US forces remains unconfirmed (Poulsen 2019).\nThe last event in the category involves South Korea and North Korea. As reported in March 2020, South Korea’s\nGlobal Perspectives\nDark Hotel group displayed significant resources and technical capabilities while conducting espionage operations against North Korea through the use of five zero-day exploits in 2019 (Greenberg 2020). While the identities of the specific individuals targeted were not released, it is believed that the attack was executed to gain information such as emails and documents from North Korean government officials and key professionals. The goal was likely to gather as much intelligence as possible on North Korea's military capabilities and nuclear missile program.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES\nIn considering the 13 cyberattacks launched by democracies against authoritarian states, the most common form of attack was sabotage (38 percent), followed by denial of service (31 percent), espionage (23 percent), and data destruction (8 percent). It appears that democracies are more likely to carry out attacks that result in actual damage (cyber or kinetic) when targeting nondemocratic states. Many of the attacks appear to be aimed at damaging an authoritarian state's military capabilities, retaliating for previous kinetic actions directed against a democracy or its allies, attempting to prevent interference in domestic politics by a foreign adversary, disrupting operations by potential rival states, and collecting intelligence from potential authoritarian adversaries.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SABOTAGE\nThe lone event in this category is the well-known Stuxnet attack. Stuxnet was first detected in June 2010 but may have been in operation as early as 2009 (Fildes 2010). It is believed that the United States and Israel were responsible for the classified creation of Stuxnet during an operation codenamed “Olympic Games” (Schwartz 2012). The two states are alleged to have used Stuxnet to target a variety of states including Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Taiwan (Council on Foreign Relations 2010). The most notable incident of the use of Stuxnet was against Iran to severely degrade its nuclear program without the use of ground forces or airstrikes to enhance the national security of both the United States and Israel (Fildes 2010). While the United States and Israel have not claimed responsibility for the cyberattack, strategic political motivations and technological capabilities indicate the two states are the likely sponsors of the event. Additionally, several researchers have contended that the United States and Israel were responsible for the attack (Baezner and Robin 2017; Lindsay 2013; Nakashima and Warrick 2012), making Stuxnet one of the most highly publicized cyberattacks initiated by democratic states against both democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe one event in this category involves a high-profile attack carried out by the United States and Israel directed at multiple states, both democratic and authoritarian. A malware called Flame is believed to have been in operation from August 2010 until May 2012 in multiple countries including Iran, Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Hungary, Austria, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and France (Lee 2012). The malware is extremely complex and could change the future of cyber conflict, according to some observers (Villasenor 2016). The malware is believed to have been sponsored by the United States and Israel with the intent of both destroying data and gaining intelligence. The United States has denied allegations of involvement in the attacks (Paganini 2012). The most likely motives behind the attacks were to conduct cyber operations against adversary states and to gather intelligence to gain strategic advantages against potential enemies. In addition, the likely motives for the sponsoring states in conducting the operations against other democracies were to gain access to financial accounts for persons of interest and to test their capabilities before use against adversaries to ensure that the sponsor states did not lose the element of surprise.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ESPIONAGE\nThere are a total of 10 cases that fall within the category of democracies attacking democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously using espionage attacks. Thus, due to space constraints and the large number of events, we do not include descriptions of each attack here. The descriptions can be found in the appendix. Regarding the broad overview of the attacks, some attacks involved multiple sponsor states, and the attacking democracies include the United States (4 attacks), Israel (3 attacks), the United Kingdom, France, India, Spain, and Pakistan. The motivations behind the attacks varied for each event. The motivations included the desire to obtain sensitive military and financial intelligence from specific states and obtain information on individuals of interest. Other motivations included the desire to obtain classified information to gain influence over ongoing high-stakes international negotiations. Attacks were also carried out to test specific cyber offensive capabilities to lay the groundwork for future attacks. Attacks were also executed to acquire information that would lead to cyber advantages over other states and to gain intelligence on rival states.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY\nIn considering the 12 cyberattacks launched by democracies against democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously, the most common form of attack was espionage (83 percent), followed by data destruction (8 percent) and sabotage (8 percent). Democracies appear significantly more\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nlikely to carry out espionage attacks, rather than attacks that result in direct kinetic or cyber damage, when the targets are both democratic and authoritarian states. Many of the espionage attacks were aimed at collecting intelligence for economic, military, and strategic purposes. Also, attacks appear to be deployed to test offensive cyber capabilities and to damage nondemocratic adversaries' military capabilities (in the case of Stuxnet, where the United States and Israel targeted Iran's nuclear facilities).\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThere were only two cases in which democracies attacked only other democracies. In both cases, the attack type was espionage. The first event involved Pakistan. Throughout 2020 APT 36, a hacker group from Pakistan, targeted multiple Indian officials in espionage operations including those in defense organizations through operation \"honey trap\" (Mantri 2020). This operation was a continuation of recent tensions between Pakistan and India and was used to spread misinformation regarding the coronavirus while also gaining access to Indian government servers (Threat Intelligence Team 2021; Gill 2020), impacting the Indian economy, and gaining an advantage in the realm of command and control (C2) security capabilities.\nThe other attack was initiated by Indonesia. In January 2016 a spyware program linked to the Indonesian government was found to be using a server in Sydney, Australia (Barbaschow 2016). The spyware, FinFisher, has been known to be utilized for surveillance purposes (Main and Duffy 2016). FinFisher was likely deployed by Indonesia due to previous allegations that the Australian government had intercepted communications from the Indonesian president in 2009 (Barbaschow 2016). Although the FinFisher spyware was likely used to spy on members of the Australian government, it is also probable that Indonesia was using the Australian server to obscure their spyware from other states to allow it to operate without detection for a longer period.\n# DISCUSSION\nIn examining the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies, several trends emerge. Firstly, democracies are significantly more likely to target authoritarian states in their attacks. This finding supports previous research that posits that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies. Thus, our findings support the notion that democracies target authoritarian states to a greater degree than nondemocracies. From 2005 through 2020, there were only two known cases in which democracies cyberattacked other democracies (when only democratic states were targeted). The motivations behind cyberattacks directed at democracies are often to collect governmental and economic intelligence through espionage attacks. Secondly, democracies deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states. Democracies are more likely to deploy sabotage, denial-of-service, and data destruction\nattacks when cyberattacking authoritarian states and espionage attacks when targeting other democracies. Thirdly, the motivations behind cyberattacks directed at authoritarian states are to inflict damage on the defensive capabilities of authoritarian states, prevent authoritarian states from interfering with domestic politics in democracies, collect governmental and defense intelligence, and disrupt military operations of rival, authoritarian states. These findings provide support for the literature on democratic peace and kinetic conflict extending into cyberspace. As with kinetic conflict, democracies appear to engage with other democracies less aggressively in cyberspace compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes. Thus, the conflict-inhibiting effects of shared norms, values, and institutions that frequently exist between democracies in the kinetic realm appear to extend into cyberspace when considering cyberattacks.\nKalberg (2016) posits that when applying military theories to the cyber realm, it is important to account for the anonymous nature of cyberattacks. Thus, future research should examine the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks compared with kinetic conflict. Future research should examine how the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affects the initiation of cyberattacks by democratic and authoritarian states and how anonymity in the cyber realm conditions state leaders' decisions to employ cyberattacks instead of kinetic attacks. Answering these questions could shed additional light on the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks based on regime type.\nWhile our research shows that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies and democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted states, several limitations of the study should be discussed. First, as previously mentioned, many cyberattacks are unreported, unverified, and unattributed. Thus, our analysis of democratically initiated cyberattacks captures data only on known, verified, and attributed cyberattacks. Many additional attacks likely occurred during the period that are not accounted for in publicly available data sources. Second, we have attempted to analyze and explain the motivations behind democratically initiated cyberattacks based on open-source data. Additional political, economic, and social motivations likely exist for some of the cases included in the study, and this information could be obtained from classified sources. Lastly, many of the democratically initiated cyberattacks during the period were attributed to the United States. While fourteen democratic states initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020, 55 percent of the cases involved the United States. Thus, the United States has a larger effect on the findings compared to other states.\nIn expanding upon this study, future research could include additional cyber data as it becomes available to conduct large $N$, cross-national quantitative analysis. Future research could also consider the role of nonstate actors and emerging technologies in affecting the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Additionally, future research should continue to consider how regime type affects cyber conflict and examine the nature of cyberattacks deployed by\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nauthoritarian regimes. This research could analyze whether authoritarian states launch more aggressive cyberattacks based on whether the targeted states are democratic or authoritarian. Also, future research could analyze the motivations behind cyberattacks that are deployed by authoritarian states. This research could shed additional light on how regime type and domestic institutions affect the behavior of states in cyberspace.\nIn considering the implications of the study for global security, based on the findings from this study and other cyber scholarship (Hunter et al. 2022), democracies appear more likely to cyberattack authoritarian states and authoritarian states appear more prone to cyberattack democracies. This is not to argue that cyberattacks do not occur between states with similar regime types. Rather, based on the findings from this study and others, cyberattacks are most likely to occur between democratic and authoritarian states. Therefore, in considering cyber defenses, government leaders should be mindful that impactful cyberattacks are most likely to emerge from states with regime types disparate from their own. Additionally, modern and future warfare is likely to entail a mixture of cyber, cognitive, and kinetic forms of conflict (i.e., hybrid warfare) (Danyk and Briggs 2023). Therefore, governments should configure their cyber defenses in a manner that accounts for where cyberattacks are most likely to originate from, and considering the regime type of states could assist in their threat assessments. Lastly, initiating cyberattacks can be a risky strategy at times due to the possibility of cyber or kinetic retaliation from targeted states. Also, the deployment of cyberattacks frequently results in the inability to use the specific form of offensive cyber weaponry in future operations as targeted states are often able to understand the composition of the cyberattack and successfully defend against it in future attacks (Pedersen and Jacobsen 2024). Thus, democracies should be mindful of the potential risks and rewards associated with initiating cyberattacks when conducting cost-benefit analyses regarding the decision to utilize offensive cyber operations.\n## COMPETING INTERESTS\nThe authors have no competing interests to disclose.\n## BIOGRAPHIES\nLance Y.

Thus, this study examines the offensive strategies of democratic states that initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states from 2005 through 2020. In examining the cyberattacks initiated by democracies during this period, we aim to better understand the motives behind democratically initiated cyberattacks, the regime types that are likely to be targeted in the attacks, and the types of cyberattacks that democracies are likely to deploy. In conducting this analysis, we find that democracies rarely attack other democratic states in cyberspace and democracies are likely to deploy more aggressive and hostile attacks when targeting authoritarian regimes. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. These findings have important implications for considering how democratic institutions affect international relations and cybersecurity.\n# INTRODUCTION\nIn October 2020 the US Cyber Command launched a series of cyberattacks that sabotaged the Russian network referred to as TrickBot, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using ransomware termed Ryuk (Nakashima 2020). When questioned about the events, US General and Commander of the US Cyber Command Paul Nakasone acknowledged the United States' efforts as \"persistent engagement\" with the goal being to maintain the integrity of the 2020 US election by preventing bot interference. A secondary goal was likely to prevent other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020). In examining the 2020 TrickBot cyberattack, several questions emerge regarding why democracies carry out cyberattacks and how democratic institutions affect the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies.\nA large amount of literature in international relations has considered the factors that affect the conflict behavior of democratic states regarding traditional forms of military conflict. However, to date, minimal research has examined how democracies behave in cyberspace regarding cyber conflict. This is problematic given the important role many researchers contend that cyber conflict plays in international security (Al-Ahmad 2013; Khan 2018). Thus, we contend that it is important to examine cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies to better understand their motivations, tactics, and the regimes that are most likely to be targeted in democratically initiated attacks. Doing so could help bridge the gap between research on democracies and traditional military conflict and cyber conflict. In addition, given the important role cyberaggression is likely to play in affecting global security in the future, attempting to understand the behavior of democracies in cyberspace is a critical area for security studies.\nPrevious research has found that democracies are less likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes (Hunter et al. 2022). This scholarship has discovered that when democracies do initiate cyberattacks, they are significantly more likely to target authoritarian regimes. In addition, this research finds that democracies do cyberattack other democracies, but it is rare. However, two questions that are not addressed in the research are (1) if democracies initiate cyberattacks to a lesser degree than authoritarian states, what are the motivating factors behind the attacks; and (2) what type of cyberattacks are democracies likely to deploy against other states based on the regime type of the targeted states? In answering these questions, we analyze data from the Coun\na Corresponding author: lahunter@augusta.edu\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\ncil on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a) and conduct case study analyses of all known democratically initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020. We incorporate literature from the democratic peace theory and research on regime type and kinetic conflict in attempting to explain why democracies carry out cyberattacks and to understand the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies. We contend that democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted state. Democracies often deploy more aggressive and hostile cyberattacks against authoritarian regimes compared with cyberattacks that are carried out against other democracies. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. More specifically, we argue that shared democratic norms, institutions, and values between democracies lead democracies to be more likely to target authoritarian states in cyberattacks and to deploy more aggressive cyberattacks against authoritarian states compared with democracies. Overall, this study seeks to expand our understanding of democratic states' behavior in cyberspace by examining the motivating factors behind democratically initiated cyberattacks and the types of cyberattacks democracies deploy based on the regime type of targeted states.\nThe layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows. First, we discuss the definitions of the main cyber terms used in the paper. Next, we examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyber conflict. We then analyze previous scholarship regarding how regime type affects traditional forms of military conflict and cyber conflict. Next, we examine data from the CFR-COTD (CFR 2021a) and conduct case study analyses in which we analyze the motivations, strategies, and targets of cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states by examining the full universe of known and verified cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. Lastly, we discuss our findings and implications for international security.\n# CYBER DEFINITIONS\nTo properly examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we need to define key cyber terms discussed in the study. The first term is \"cyber.\" Cyber refers to a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers\" (NIST 2024). The next term is \"cyber warfare/conflict.\" We use both \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" because some scholarship utilizes the term \"cyber warfare\" and other research uses the term \"cyber conflict\" when discussing the same type of cyber aggression. While the focus of this paper is on cyberattacks, it is important to define \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" as the terms are referenced in the paper concerning previous scholarship on cyber. \"Cyber warfare/cyber conflict\" is defined as \"the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's computers or information networks through,\nfor example, computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks\" (RAND 2024). The last term we define is \"cyberattack.\" The US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 2024) provides two definitions of \"cyberattack.\" The first is \"Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.\" The second is \"An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise's use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.\" The US Federal Emergency Management Agency defines \"cyberattack\" as \"malicious attempts to access or damage a computer system\" (FEMA 2024). The National Cyber Security Centre in the United Kingdom defines a cyberattack as malicious attempts to damage, disrupt or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks or devices, via cyber means (NCCC 2021). We define a cyberattack based on the criteria set forward in the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) in which a nation-state carries out a cyber operation against another nation-state in the form of denial of service, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, or doxing (CFR 2021a). We do not argue that this definition is superior to others. Rather, we contend that it is appropriate based on the aim and scope of the study. We expand on the definition and operationalization of the term \"cyberattack\" in the research design section of the paper. We now turn to examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyberattacks.\n# FACTORS AFFECTING THE INITIATION OF CYBERATTACKS\nMany scholars view cyberattacks as an extension of or an alternative to kinetic conflict (Borghard and Lonergan 2019, 122; Hjortdal 2011, 1). The reasons states deploy cyberattacks as opposed to kinetic attacks vary depending on the state. One perspective for why states initiate cyberattacks is that some states may not possess the power to compete with other states from a kinetic, military standpoint. Some scholars and military leaders consider cyberattacks to be an equalizer between states in some instances because less powerful states may be able to initiate cyberattacks while they lack the capabilities to launch successful kinetic attacks. Based on this perspective, weaker states may choose to deploy cyberattacks against more powerful adversaries. However, this theory has yet to be supported by empirical studies. Research on how power asymmetries affect cyberattacks is limited. One study that examines the effect state power has on cyber conflict finds that more powerful states (measured in terms of economic and military power) are more likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with less powerful states (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). The authors find that on average states that initiate cyberattacks have twice the amount of power compared with the states that are targeted in cyberattacks. Additional studies have found that factors such as international trade (Akoto 2021), previous episodes of kinetic conflict (Osawa\nGlobal Perspectives\n2017), and whether states are rivals (Valeriano and Maness 2014) can influence the likelihood of cyberattacks.\nValeriano (2018) contends that cyberattacks are a form of covert coercion that normally seeks to send ambiguous signals or resolve to rival states. Valeriano finds that cyberattacks tend to transpire in coordination with traditional political activities (such as economic coercion or military threats or provocation) and they usually fail to produce political concessions from the targeted states (2018). Another reason states may deploy cyberattacks is possible anonymity, which enables users to remain undetected in many cases (2015, 19). Thus, even if hostile cyber action is detected, it can be difficult to accurately identify the state that is responsible for the attack. Additionally, cyberattacks can serve a variety of purposes. Cyberattacks can be used for espionage purposes to gain valuable information to aid an aggressor's future operations. Cyberattacks can also be employed to sabotage and destroy targets within the victim state and limit the victim states' capabilities (both cyber and kinetic). Thus, cyberattacks may serve as both enhancers and alternatives to kinetic conflict and can be used for multiple purposes.\nHaving the factors associated with the initiation of cyberattacks in previous scholarship, we now turn to examining how regime type affects the nature, target, and motivation of democratically initiated cyberattacks. Within this discussion, we consider previous research on how regime type affects the conflict behavior of democracies in the kinetic realm and what implications this scholarship has for democracies and the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Thus, we seek to understand how regime type affects the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies.\n## REGIME TYPE AND THE NATURE OF CYBERATTACKS INITIATED BY DEMOCRACIES\nA few important works examine the strategic use of cyber operations by democratic states (Goldman and Warner 2020; Kallberg 2016). Kallberg (2016) highlights the challenges in applying traditional military theory to cyber conflict. Kallberg contends that a theory of cyber conflict should address unique aspects of cyber that include anonymity, object permanence, measurable results, and rapid execution. More specifically, how does the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affect their usage compared with kinetic conflict in which most kinetic attacks are not anonymous? Relatedly, Goldman and Warner (2020) posit that democracies' interests (such as those of the United States) are often at risk due to continuous low-level cyber operations deployed by adversarial states. Over time, these operations can weaken the economic, political, and military power of democratic states. To address the threats, they contend that democracies should pursue an “integrated cybersecurity strategy” that combines national power and military cyber operations and focuses on deterrence, persistence (constant cyber operations that dismantle adversarial cyber activities), and anticipatory resilience (learning from past cyber operations, hardening cyber systems, preparing for future attacks, and limiting the impact of cyberattacks). Solar (2020) examines how emerging democracies in Latin America are approaching cyber threats, the role of the military in providing cyber security, and the implications for democratic governance. Solar finds that militaries in many emerging democracies are taking the lead in controlling cyberinfrastructure for cyber security purposes. Solar contends that this could be problematic in some instances if military involvement in cyber security undermines democratic governance by threatening a secure and open internet. Solar argues that emerging democracies should advance a balanced approach that includes military involvement in cybersecurity along with interactive policy communities with multiple stakeholders (including the defense sector) to review and manage cybersecurity policies. Solar contends that civil oversight of cybersecurity infrastructure is important to protect democratic values and principles (Solar 2020).\nIn trying to understand the behavior of democratic states regarding the initiation of cyberattacks, it is important to discuss multiple perspectives on how regime type can possibly impact cyberattacks. One potential perspective is that democracies could be more prone to launch cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes because cyberattacks could be an alternative to kinetic conflict. One of the rationales for this position is that many cyberattacks are anonymous and attribution is often difficult (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018). According to Tsagourias (2012), multiple characteristics of cyberattacks make attribution difficult. Rid and Buchanon contend that attribution should be viewed as an art and not an exact science because it is a complex, political, and multilayered process (2015). They posit that effective attribution is dependent upon resources, time, and the sophistication of the attacker. Additionally, states are more likely to devote significant resources to attribution when cyberattacks are more severe. Thus, attribution should be viewed as a gradual process, and nation-states should be considered the most capable actors to accurately attribute cyberattacks due to their significant resources. Also, according to Rid and Buchanon, states with greater technological sophistication and human talent should be able to initiate cyberattacks more easily and covertly and attribute cyberattacks more effectively while responding to cyberattacks from adversaries (2015). Therefore, from this perspective, in many instances, initiating a cyberattack could be a less risky tactic than kinetic conflict due to the difficulty in attributing attacks, and democratic states could perceive cyberattacks as a more appropriate strategy than kinetic operations. In addition, some scholars contend that cyberattacks can be executed with reduced costs and lower risks than kinetic conflict due to the lack of need for combat personnel and based on the previously discussed difficulty in attributing cyberattacks (Tsagourias 2012).\nAnother perspective is that democracies should be less likely to initiate cyberattacks not based on the pacifying effects of democratic institutions but according to the notion that democracies are likely to be wealthier than nondemocracies (on average) and have greater technological capacity and dependency (compared with authoritarian states),\nand states with greater technological dependency should be more conservative regarding the initiation of offensive cyber operations (McConnell 2009). However, an alternate perspective is that states with greater wealth and resources are more likely to initiate cyberattacks, based on previous research, which finds that more powerful states are more prone to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). Additionally, other scholars contend that states with greater technological connectivity are more capable regarding cyber offense and defense as it becomes easier for these states to initiate covert cyberattacks and attribute cyberattacks to adversaries (Rid and Buchanan 2015). As Rid and Buchanon remark: “A third common assumption is that the most industrialized and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage. Attribution again reverses this logic: the larger a government's technical prowess, and the larger the pool of talent and skills at its disposal, the higher will be that state's ability to hide its own covert operations, uncover others, and respond accordingly” (2015, 31).\nLastly, a separate perspective is that the conflict-reducing effects of democratic institutions extend not only to kinetic conflict but to cyberattacks as well. This line of reasoning posits that democracies may be more peaceful in cyberspace compared with authoritarian regimes due to the presence of democratic norms, democratic institutions, and democracies' involvement in international institutions. Previous research provides some support for this position in that democracies are found to be less likely to initiate cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes when controlling for several political and economic factors (Hunter et al. 2022). Thus, there is evidence that regime type affects the conflict propensity of states regarding cyber behavior and democracies are less likely to deploy cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes. In addition, this scholarship has found that democracies rarely attack one another in the cyber realm. However, if democracies are less likely to initiate cyberattacks and are less prone to cyberattack other democracies, what motivates democracies to initiate cyberattacks? More specifically, what are the motivations for cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states?\nResearch on the behavior of democracies regarding kinetic conflict finds that democracies do not initiate wars with one another (often referred to as the dyadic democratic peace), although there are many instances of democracies warring with authoritarian regimes (Russett 1993). While this is one of the strongest empirical findings in international relations (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003), researchers debate the rationale for the findings, and some scholars refute the claim that democracies are less likely to war with one another (Barkawi and Laffey 1999; Rosato 2003). In responding to the claims that democratic peace findings are questionable, Imai and Lo (2021) test the democratic peace theory in a cross-national analysis and “show that overturning the negative association between democracy and conflict would require a confounder that is forty-seven times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in other dyads. To put this number in context, the relationship between democracy and peace is at least five times as robust as that between smoking and lung cancer. To explain away the democratic peace, therefore, scholars would have to find far more powerful confounders than those already identified in the literature” (901). In addition, while many scholars contend that democracies rarely or have never gone to war with one another, democracies have engaged in minor conflicts and disputes (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021). Thus, previous scholarship finds that democracies have engaged in lower-level disputes with one another, although rarely have the disputes escalated to war (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021; Mousseau 1997, 1998). One potential explanation for this finding is that when democracies interact with one another, they are more likely to resort to diplomacy due to shared institutions, norms, and values (Anderson and Souva 2010; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; and Rey and Barkdull 2005). A large amount of literature is devoted to explaining the reasons for these findings, and the explanations vary but include the design of democratic institutions, shared norms and values, and democracies' membership and involvement in international institutions. While this research is voluminous, one clear takeaway is that democracies interact with authoritarian and democratic states in significantly different ways, and democracies are more likely to engage with other democracies more peacefully compared with their interactions with non-democracies.\nWhile previous research has demonstrated that democracies are less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks (Hunter et al. 2022), research to date has not examined the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies. If we extend the literature on how democracies interact with other democracies and authoritarian regimes in the kinetic realm to cyberspace, the logical extension is that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies, and in the event of a cyberattack, the cyberattacks directed against other democracies should be less aggressive and hostile (i.e. overtly conflictual and potentially damaging) compared with the cyberattacks launched against authoritarian states. The rationale is that democracies are more likely to resort to compromise and diplomacy when interacting with other democracies compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes (Mousseau 1997, 1998). More specifically, democracies should view other democracies as more friendly and less hostile due to shared values, institutions, and norms, and when issues or disagreements emerge between democracies, they should be more likely to resolve the issues diplomatically rather than through acts of cyberaggression. Therefore, in extending the research on democratic state behavior regarding kinetic conflict to the cyber realm, democracies should pursue more aggressive strategies when interacting with authoritarian regimes and less aggressive strategies when engaging other democracies. Thus, based on our previous discussions, we argue that democracies should be less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks. This leads us to our first proposition.\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nProposition 1: When democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks, democracies should be less likely to target democracies and more likely to target authoritarian states.\nThere are many different forms of cyberattacks. The Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a) disaggregates cyberattacks according to the following types: sabotage, denial of service, data destruction, and espionage. While the amount of damage and intensity of each attack type can vary by attack, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are usually viewed as more aggressive hostile acts compared with cyberattacks that involve only espionage (Schmitt 2012). The reason is that cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, or data destruction often produce actual and immediate damage (kinetic and/or cyber) and are more likely to be reported and discovered by the media and citizens within states. Thus, these cyber actions are often viewed as more hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks. However, we do not argue that espionage attacks are insignificant actions. Cyberespionage attacks are regarded as serious forms of cyberattacks by many researchers because vital information can be gained through acts of cyberespionage that can produce significant real-world effects and implications for national security (Deoliveira 2019). Additionally, espionage attacks can be deployed to gain valuable information on adversary states that can be later used in kinetic attacks or additional cyberattacks (ENISA 2020). However, in the aggregate, while espionage attacks clearly qualify as cyberattacks, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are frequently viewed as more aggressive and hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks.\nIn extending the literature on kinetic conflict to cyberspace, we argue that when democracies initiate cyberattacks, they should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states compared with instances in which they target other democracies. The rationale for this argument is based on research on kinetic conflict that finds that when disagreements occur between democracies, they are less likely to escalate to higher levels of intensity due to shared norms, values, and institutions (Anderson and Souva 2010; Imai and Lo 2021; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; Rey and Barkdull 2005). This stands in contrast to episodes when democracies have disputes with authoritarian regimes, in which there is a greater likelihood of hostile engagement due to\nthe lack of shared norms, values, and institutions. Thus, based on the discussion, our second proposition is:\nProposition 2: Democracies should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks (i.e., sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service) when targeting authoritarian regimes and less hostile cyberattacks (i.e., cyberespionage) when targeting other democratic states.\n# RESEARCH DESIGN\nTo examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we collected data on cyberattacks that were initiated by democracies against other states from 2005 through 2020. The cases included in the study are those in which democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states during the period and attribution for the attack is verified. Thus, every verifiable instance of a democracy initiating a known state-sponsored cyberattack against another state or states during the period is included in the study (as defined and operationalized by the Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a)). We do not analyze cyberattacks executed by nonstate actors. The reason is that we aim to analyze the motives, rationale, and targets of democratically initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks, and examining nonstate hacking/criminal/terrorist groups would not produce relevant information for the purposes of our study. The data on cyberattacks are collected from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a). The Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) provides data on known state-sponsored cyberattacks that transpired during this period in which the initiator and the target are nation-states or are directly affiliated with a nation-state. The state-sponsored cyberattacks that are included in the dataset are events where threat actors commit denial-of-service attacks, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, and doxing (CFR 2021a). The reasoning for the dataset's focus on state-sponsored attacks is as follows: \"The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests. Furthermore, state-sponsored incidents generally have the most accurate and comprehensive reporting. Reporting on nonstate actors, such as hacktivist groups, tends to be murkier and makes for less reliable data\" (CFR 2021a). The CFR data are collected based on several open-source outlets that include but are not limited to\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 1. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks and Target Type\n|  Target Type | Frequency | Percentage  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 13 | 48%  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 12 | 44%  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 2 | 7%  |\ngovernment press documents, cybersecurity corporations, existing repositories, and media reports and publications concerning state-sponsored attacks (CFR 2021a).\nIn discussing cyber data, several limitations should be acknowledged. One limitation regarding the data, which is relevant to all cyber conflict datasets, is that not every cyberattack that transpired during the period is included because of limited information pertaining to some of these cyberattacks. More specifically, some cyberattacks are not reported, and many cyberattacks remain anonymous due to difficulty in accurately attributing attacks and the purposeful effort by some states to mask their cyber activity. Second, the CFR relies on publicly available data. As the CFR stipulates, \"State intelligence agencies and private cybersecurity firms are likely to have the most complete data about state-sponsored actors, but may not make what they know public to protect national security or trade secrets\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, the cyber events that are included in the CFR (COTD) are verified incidents where information is known and verified regarding the states that carried out the attacks and the states that were victims of the attacks based on open-source data.\nWe utilize the four categorizations from the COTD regarding the attack type. The four categories are espionage, sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service. The four categories are examined because these are the four cyberattack types utilized by the COTD (CFR 2021a). Additionally, previous cyber research has discussed and analyzed these attack types (Banks 2017; CISA 2019; Maurer and Morgus 2014), and they are considered standard attack types in the cyber literature. Denial-of-service attacks prevent appropriate users from accessing information systems, devices, and network resources due to a malicious cyber actor (CISA 2019). Attackers can target a variety of resources and can deny service in different ways. Ultimately, denial-of-service attacks overwhelm the computer network by sending more data than it is capable of processing, resulting in a temporary paralysis of the computer network (CFR 2021a). Cyber sabotage is an attack carried out against the integrity of an IT system (Maurer and Morgus 2014, 58). This attack \"causes a disruption to a physical process\" (CFR 2021a). Data destruction is the process of destroying data on electronic or physical mediums (Ministry of Justice 2021). In some cases, this is done intentionally for security purposes. Cyber data destruction results in a computer or computer networks becoming unusable due to the use of malicious software (CFR 2021a). Cyberespionage refers to a state covertly collecting information for intelligence purposes (Australian Cyber Security Center 2021). More specifically, cyberespionage involves penetration of computer systems or networks to obtain information on or going\nthrough these systems, without the information holder's consent (Banks 2017, 513; CFR 2021a). In addition to analyzing the attack types of democratically initiated cyberattacks, we also examine the sectors targeted within victim states based on the COTD's classification as follows: government, private sector, civil society, and the military.\n## FINDINGS\nIn total, there were 27 cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. The overall breakdown of the 27 attacks that were initiated by democracies between 2005 and 2020 is as follows and is presented in table 1. There were 13 cases (48 percent) where democracies attacked only authoritarian states. There were 12 cases (44 percent) where democracies attacked both democracies and authoritarian states simultaneously. There were 2 cases (7 percent) in which democracies attacked only other democracies. Thus, in examining these statistics, we see that when democracies launch cyberattacks, they are likely to target authoritarian regimes specifically, or a combination of democratic and authoritarian regimes in simultaneous attacks. Also, democracies do occasionally target democracies (where an authoritarian regime is not attacked simultaneously), but it is rare. In 7 percent of cases does a democracy attack only another democracy. Thus, the primary targets for democracies appear to be either solely authoritarian states or a simultaneous combination of authoritarian and democratic states. This finding provides support for proposition 1, which stipulates that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies.\nTable 2 displays the specific sector targeted in a cyberattack based on the regime type that is targeted. In respect to the attack type based on the sector that is targeted when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 6 government, 3 private, 1 civil society, and 3 military. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 7 government, 1 private, 0 civil society, and 4 military. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 0 government, 0 private, 1 civil society, and 1 military. Thus, in examining table 2, we find that government sectors are more likely to be targeted in attacks when only authoritarian states are targeted and in attacks where both authoritarian and democratic states are targeted simultaneously. Civil society and military sectors are most frequently targeted when only democratic regimes are the victims of democratically initiated cyberattacks.\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 2.

In respect to the attack type when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 3 espionage, 5 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and 4 denial-of-service attacks. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 10 espionage, 1 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and no denial-of-service attacks. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 2 espionage, and no attacks regarding sabotage, data destruction, and denial-of-service attacks.\nIn examining the results in table 3, we find that a few patterns emerge. First, democracies are more likely to commit acts of sabotage when only authoritarian states are targeted versus attacks that include both democratic and authoritarian states or solely democratic states. One hundred percent of the sabotage attacks committed by democracies were committed against only authoritarian states. Second, denial-of-service attacks are more likely to be committed against only authoritarian states. Democracies did not initiate any denial-of-service attacks in attacks that included simultaneous attacks against democracies and authoritarian states. Also, democracies did not deploy any denial-of-service attacks against only democratic states. Once again, one hundred percent of denial-of-service attacks were deployed against only authoritarian states. Regarding data destruction, democracies were equally likely to initiate data destruction attacks against authoritarian states and in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously. Lastly, democracies were more likely to deploy espionage attacks in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously, and 100 percent of the attacks directed against only democratic states were acts of cyberespionage.\nWhen we interpret the results in table 3, it appears that democracies initiate more aggressive and hostile attacks against authoritarian states compared with democratic targets, which provides support for proposition 2. This is not to argue that espionage cannot be destructive. Espionage\nattacks can be costly because they may provide valuable information to a potential adversary that can damage a victim state. However, the types of attacks launched against authoritarian states are more overtly aggressive and hostile because sabotage and denial-of-service attacks often produce significant and immediate damage against a victim state. In addition, these attacks are often immediately known, whereas espionage attacks may be undetected for some time. Thus, the finding that a larger number of sabotage and denial-of-service attacks are initiated against nondemocracies indicates that democracies are more aggressive in deploying their offensive cyber weaponry against authoritarian states compared with when they target other democracies.\nTable 4 displays data regarding whether cyberattacks included in the analysis are carried out in retaliation to a kinetic attack or a cyberattack. Thus, the variable relation refers to whether the cyberattack occurred in response to a kinetic or a cyber hostility that originated from the targeted state. General Retaliation refers to retaliation for a kinetic or cyber hostility originating from the targeted state. Thus, both kinetic and cyber actions are included in the category General Retaliation. Kinetic Retaliation refers to retaliation due to a kinetic hostility committed by the targeted state. Lastly, Cyber Retaliation refers to retaliation for a cyber hostility committed by the targeted state. In examining table 4, we find that the only acts of General Retaliation occurred when democracies attacked only nondemocracies. Out of the 3 total retaliation attacks, 2 were in response to kinetic actions and 1 was in response to a previous cyberattack. When retaliation attacks are initiated by democracies, they are directed at specific authoritarian states. There are no cases of democracies retaliating against other democracies.\nTable 5 displays the number of cyberattacks, and the number of cyberattacks by attack type, initiated by the democratic states included in the analysis. In reviewing table 5, it is important to note that many cyber events involved multiple initiator states. Six of the 26 cases (23 percent) involved multiple initiator states. In examining table 5, we\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 4.

The remaining democratic states in the analysis initiated 1 cyberattack. The findings regarding the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom and the number of cyberattacks deployed reinforce previous scholarship, which finds that more powerful states are more likely to initiate cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). In the next section, we explore the motives, circumstances, and tactics behind these attacks to better understand why democracies may initiate certain types of cyberattacks against authoritarian states versus democracies.\n# CASE STUDY ANALYSIS\nTo more fully understand the nature of state-sponsored cyberattacks initiated by democracies, we analyze qualitative case information pertaining to each cyberattack in respect to the potential motives and tactics associated with the attacks. We utilize publicly available data to obtain this information. In addition, more information is known regarding some events compared with others, and in some cases, there is limited data on the motives and tactics of the attack. As the CFR-COTD states: \"Furthermore, some reporting from the media or cybersecurity companies can be vague or incomplete, making it difficult to confirm incidents for which data is only available from a single source\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, we attempt to provide descriptions of\nthe motives, tactics, and state actors involved in each democratically initiated cyberattack while acknowledging that limited publicly available information and sources exist for some cases. The full list of cases and the key aspects of each case including the cyberattack name, the initiator(s) of the attack, the target(s) of the attack, the type of attack, and the suspected motivation for each attack can be found in table 6. Additionally, given the space constraints of the paper, a more detailed description of each case can be found in the appendix.\nBefore proceeding to the case study analysis, one important point is that additional economic, social, and political motives outside our analysis may have impacted the democratically initiated cyberattacks that are included in the study. Given that 27 cases (cyber events) are discussed in the study, the limited sources for some cases, and the space constraints of the paper, additional possible motives cannot be fully explored for each case. Thus, it is important to note that additional economic, social, and political motives and explanations may exist for each case.\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND SABOTAGE\nIn considering cyberattacks initiated by democracies against only authoritarian states in which the attack type was sabotage, many of the attacks were carried out by the United States. In April 2017, the United States is believed to have sabotaged North Korea's nuclear program by sabotag-\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 6.

The United States' efforts are believed to have been motivated by an attempt to prevent the North Korean military from expanding its missile technology systems to protect South Korea and to maximize security on the Korean Peninsula.\nAnother attack in this category that was executed by the United States that targeted an authoritarian state's missile systems occurred in June 2019 when the US Cyber Command hacked Iranian rocket and missile launch systems in what Iran deemed an unsuccessful effort to disable the systems. This sabotage operation carried out by the United States came during a time of heightened tensions between the two states and served as a response to recent aggression by the Iranian government when it downed a US drone and attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz (Council\non Foreign Relations 2021b). The response by the United States signaled its willingness to deploy cyber capabilities in response to kinetic actions.\nIn a series of attacks launched by the United States against Russia in 2018, the US Cyber Command sabotaged the Russian Internet Research Agency in an attempt to maintain the integrity of the US 2018 elections (Buchanan 2019). Although some information regarding the attack remains unknown, the operation was likely intended to prevent Russian disinformation that could have been disseminated by the Internet Research Agency (Buchanan 2019). In a separate attack directed at Russia, and mentioned in the introduction of the paper, in October 2020 the US Cyber Command sabotaged computers on the TrickBot network, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using Ryuk ransomware (Nakashima 2020). US General and Commander of the US\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nCyber Command Paul Nakasone stated that the cyber operation was carried out as “persistent engagement” with the aim of preserving the integrity of the 2020 US election by eliminating bot interference. A related goal was to thwart other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020).\nIsrael was responsible for the other sabotage attack in the category of democracies initiating sabotage attacks against nondemocracies. In May 2020 Israel conducted a cyberattack targeting Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port near the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran reported only caused damage to private systems (Joffre 2020). This attack was an attempt to sabotage port operations in response to Iran’s failed cyberattack on Israel’s water treatment and sewage facilities that had transpired less than a month prior (TOI 2020). In response to the attack, Iran stated that it was attempting to prevent future cyberattacks by developing its intranet system known as the National Information Network to limit its reliance on the international cyber community (Joffre 2020).\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS\nRegarding denial-of-service attacks when the target is a nondemocracy, the first case involves Taiwan and China. On October 23, 2007, a secret agent working for Taiwan’s military intelligence allegedly planted “Trojan” programs in the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, National Defense Research Institutes, Military Industrial Labs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all of which are part of China’s intelligence infrastructure. The motivation behind the attack was to obtain classified intelligence information (Chung 2007). The attack is considered a denial-of-service attack because it temporarily affected the cyber operations of the Chinese targets.\nAnother denial-of-service attack involves Israel and Syria. In September 2007 Israel sabotaged Syrian military capabilities by disrupting its radar and air defense systems to enable an Israeli air strike (Melman 2007). This incident led Iran to have less confidence in the Syrian air defense capabilities. Additionally, this could be considered a hybrid attack due to the cyber nature of the attack combined with kinetic jammers in a plane being used to sabotage Syria’s radar and air defense capabilities (Melman 2007).\nThe two remaining attacks in the category involve the United States and North Korea and the United States and Russia. In September 2017 the US Cyber Command targeted North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (a.k.a. North Korean Intelligence Agency) to deny service to North Korea’s cyber capabilities (Council on Foreign Relations 2017). This effort was based on directives from the US executive branch and was achieved through the United States overloading North Korea’s internet system with an abundance of traffic, resulting in the stoppage of internet access (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017). The United States used this event as a signal to pressure other states to sever ties with North Korea (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017).\nIn another attack carried out by the United States against Russia, in November 2018 the US Cyber Command sabotaged a Russian troll farm to maintain the integrity of the US midterm election by preventing the dissemination of disinformation (Kube and Dilanian 2019). The US efforts against the Russian government, and more specifically the Internet Research Agency, once again aimed to prevent disinformation by taking the troll farm offline during the day of the 2018 midterm elections and the few days following it (Chiacu and Hosenball 2019).\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe lone event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using data destruction attacks involves the United States and Iran. In late September 2019, the US government conducted cyberattacks against Iran resulting in the destruction of data and physical hardware (Ali and Stewart 2019). This attack was in response to increased tensions between the United States and Iran due to Iran’s alleged attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities a few weeks prior (Council on Foreign Relations 2021b). The goal of the attack was to prevent Tehran’s ability to spread propaganda regarding its attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThe first event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using espionage attacks involves multiple democracies initiating espionage attacks in a coordinated event. In late 2018 Five Eyes (an intelligence alliance between the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) used malware to spy on Yandex (the Russian version of Google) user accounts (Bing, Stubbs, and Menn 2019). The malware known as Regin was used by Five Eyes in a previous operation. The attack was carried out to gain technical information related to account authentication credentials that would enable access to and monitoring privileges over various Yandex user accounts and messages. The specific accounts of interest were likely key members of the Russian government and the Russian military that had personal Yandex accounts.\nThe next event involves the Netherlands and Russia. As reported in 2018, the Netherlands conducted espionage operations through the use of malware by targeting and compromising “the Dukes,” an arm of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (Poulsen 2019). This was likely done to gain a better understanding of the Dukes’ targeting methods and operations and to assist the US intelligence community in determining who was responsible for the 2016 compromise of the Democratic National Committee. Russia’s encroachment on European politics posed a potential future threat to the Netherlands, which likely led to the combined efforts with the US intelligence community to execute the attack in this instance, although direct coordination with US forces remains unconfirmed (Poulsen 2019).\nThe last event in the category involves South Korea and North Korea. As reported in March 2020, South Korea’s\nGlobal Perspectives\nDark Hotel group displayed significant resources and technical capabilities while conducting espionage operations against North Korea through the use of five zero-day exploits in 2019 (Greenberg 2020). While the identities of the specific individuals targeted were not released, it is believed that the attack was executed to gain information such as emails and documents from North Korean government officials and key professionals. The goal was likely to gather as much intelligence as possible on North Korea's military capabilities and nuclear missile program.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES\nIn considering the 13 cyberattacks launched by democracies against authoritarian states, the most common form of attack was sabotage (38 percent), followed by denial of service (31 percent), espionage (23 percent), and data destruction (8 percent). It appears that democracies are more likely to carry out attacks that result in actual damage (cyber or kinetic) when targeting nondemocratic states. Many of the attacks appear to be aimed at damaging an authoritarian state's military capabilities, retaliating for previous kinetic actions directed against a democracy or its allies, attempting to prevent interference in domestic politics by a foreign adversary, disrupting operations by potential rival states, and collecting intelligence from potential authoritarian adversaries.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SABOTAGE\nThe lone event in this category is the well-known Stuxnet attack. Stuxnet was first detected in June 2010 but may have been in operation as early as 2009 (Fildes 2010). It is believed that the United States and Israel were responsible for the classified creation of Stuxnet during an operation codenamed “Olympic Games” (Schwartz 2012). The two states are alleged to have used Stuxnet to target a variety of states including Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Taiwan (Council on Foreign Relations 2010). The most notable incident of the use of Stuxnet was against Iran to severely degrade its nuclear program without the use of ground forces or airstrikes to enhance the national security of both the United States and Israel (Fildes 2010). While the United States and Israel have not claimed responsibility for the cyberattack, strategic political motivations and technological capabilities indicate the two states are the likely sponsors of the event. Additionally, several researchers have contended that the United States and Israel were responsible for the attack (Baezner and Robin 2017; Lindsay 2013; Nakashima and Warrick 2012), making Stuxnet one of the most highly publicized cyberattacks initiated by democratic states against both democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe one event in this category involves a high-profile attack carried out by the United States and Israel directed at multiple states, both democratic and authoritarian. A malware called Flame is believed to have been in operation from August 2010 until May 2012 in multiple countries including Iran, Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Hungary, Austria, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and France (Lee 2012). The malware is extremely complex and could change the future of cyber conflict, according to some observers (Villasenor 2016). The malware is believed to have been sponsored by the United States and Israel with the intent of both destroying data and gaining intelligence. The United States has denied allegations of involvement in the attacks (Paganini 2012). The most likely motives behind the attacks were to conduct cyber operations against adversary states and to gather intelligence to gain strategic advantages against potential enemies. In addition, the likely motives for the sponsoring states in conducting the operations against other democracies were to gain access to financial accounts for persons of interest and to test their capabilities before use against adversaries to ensure that the sponsor states did not lose the element of surprise.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ESPIONAGE\nThere are a total of 10 cases that fall within the category of democracies attacking democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously using espionage attacks. Thus, due to space constraints and the large number of events, we do not include descriptions of each attack here. The descriptions can be found in the appendix. Regarding the broad overview of the attacks, some attacks involved multiple sponsor states, and the attacking democracies include the United States (4 attacks), Israel (3 attacks), the United Kingdom, France, India, Spain, and Pakistan. The motivations behind the attacks varied for each event. The motivations included the desire to obtain sensitive military and financial intelligence from specific states and obtain information on individuals of interest. Other motivations included the desire to obtain classified information to gain influence over ongoing high-stakes international negotiations. Attacks were also carried out to test specific cyber offensive capabilities to lay the groundwork for future attacks. Attacks were also executed to acquire information that would lead to cyber advantages over other states and to gain intelligence on rival states.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY\nIn considering the 12 cyberattacks launched by democracies against democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously, the most common form of attack was espionage (83 percent), followed by data destruction (8 percent) and sabotage (8 percent). Democracies appear significantly more\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nlikely to carry out espionage attacks, rather than attacks that result in direct kinetic or cyber damage, when the targets are both democratic and authoritarian states. Many of the espionage attacks were aimed at collecting intelligence for economic, military, and strategic purposes. Also, attacks appear to be deployed to test offensive cyber capabilities and to damage nondemocratic adversaries' military capabilities (in the case of Stuxnet, where the United States and Israel targeted Iran's nuclear facilities).\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThere were only two cases in which democracies attacked only other democracies. In both cases, the attack type was espionage. The first event involved Pakistan. Throughout 2020 APT 36, a hacker group from Pakistan, targeted multiple Indian officials in espionage operations including those in defense organizations through operation \"honey trap\" (Mantri 2020). This operation was a continuation of recent tensions between Pakistan and India and was used to spread misinformation regarding the coronavirus while also gaining access to Indian government servers (Threat Intelligence Team 2021; Gill 2020), impacting the Indian economy, and gaining an advantage in the realm of command and control (C2) security capabilities.\nThe other attack was initiated by Indonesia. In January 2016 a spyware program linked to the Indonesian government was found to be using a server in Sydney, Australia (Barbaschow 2016). The spyware, FinFisher, has been known to be utilized for surveillance purposes (Main and Duffy 2016). FinFisher was likely deployed by Indonesia due to previous allegations that the Australian government had intercepted communications from the Indonesian president in 2009 (Barbaschow 2016). Although the FinFisher spyware was likely used to spy on members of the Australian government, it is also probable that Indonesia was using the Australian server to obscure their spyware from other states to allow it to operate without detection for a longer period.\n# DISCUSSION\nIn examining the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies, several trends emerge. Firstly, democracies are significantly more likely to target authoritarian states in their attacks. This finding supports previous research that posits that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies. Thus, our findings support the notion that democracies target authoritarian states to a greater degree than nondemocracies. From 2005 through 2020, there were only two known cases in which democracies cyberattacked other democracies (when only democratic states were targeted). The motivations behind cyberattacks directed at democracies are often to collect governmental and economic intelligence through espionage attacks. Secondly, democracies deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states. Democracies are more likely to deploy sabotage, denial-of-service, and data destruction\nattacks when cyberattacking authoritarian states and espionage attacks when targeting other democracies. Thirdly, the motivations behind cyberattacks directed at authoritarian states are to inflict damage on the defensive capabilities of authoritarian states, prevent authoritarian states from interfering with domestic politics in democracies, collect governmental and defense intelligence, and disrupt military operations of rival, authoritarian states. These findings provide support for the literature on democratic peace and kinetic conflict extending into cyberspace. As with kinetic conflict, democracies appear to engage with other democracies less aggressively in cyberspace compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes. Thus, the conflict-inhibiting effects of shared norms, values, and institutions that frequently exist between democracies in the kinetic realm appear to extend into cyberspace when considering cyberattacks.\nKalberg (2016) posits that when applying military theories to the cyber realm, it is important to account for the anonymous nature of cyberattacks. Thus, future research should examine the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks compared with kinetic conflict. Future research should examine how the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affects the initiation of cyberattacks by democratic and authoritarian states and how anonymity in the cyber realm conditions state leaders' decisions to employ cyberattacks instead of kinetic attacks. Answering these questions could shed additional light on the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks based on regime type.\nWhile our research shows that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies and democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted states, several limitations of the study should be discussed. First, as previously mentioned, many cyberattacks are unreported, unverified, and unattributed. Thus, our analysis of democratically initiated cyberattacks captures data only on known, verified, and attributed cyberattacks. Many additional attacks likely occurred during the period that are not accounted for in publicly available data sources. Second, we have attempted to analyze and explain the motivations behind democratically initiated cyberattacks based on open-source data. Additional political, economic, and social motivations likely exist for some of the cases included in the study, and this information could be obtained from classified sources. Lastly, many of the democratically initiated cyberattacks during the period were attributed to the United States. While fourteen democratic states initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020, 55 percent of the cases involved the United States. Thus, the United States has a larger effect on the findings compared to other states.\nIn expanding upon this study, future research could include additional cyber data as it becomes available to conduct large $N$, cross-national quantitative analysis. Future research could also consider the role of nonstate actors and emerging technologies in affecting the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Additionally, future research should continue to consider how regime type affects cyber conflict and examine the nature of cyberattacks deployed by\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nauthoritarian regimes. This research could analyze whether authoritarian states launch more aggressive cyberattacks based on whether the targeted states are democratic or authoritarian. Also, future research could analyze the motivations behind cyberattacks that are deployed by authoritarian states. This research could shed additional light on how regime type and domestic institutions affect the behavior of states in cyberspace.\nIn considering the implications of the study for global security, based on the findings from this study and other cyber scholarship (Hunter et al. 2022), democracies appear more likely to cyberattack authoritarian states and authoritarian states appear more prone to cyberattack democracies. This is not to argue that cyberattacks do not occur between states with similar regime types. Rather, based on the findings from this study and others, cyberattacks are most likely to occur between democratic and authoritarian states. Therefore, in considering cyber defenses, government leaders should be mindful that impactful cyberattacks are most likely to emerge from states with regime types disparate from their own. Additionally, modern and future warfare is likely to entail a mixture of cyber, cognitive, and kinetic forms of conflict (i.e., hybrid warfare) (Danyk and Briggs 2023). Therefore, governments should configure their cyber defenses in a manner that accounts for where cyberattacks are most likely to originate from, and considering the regime type of states could assist in their threat assessments. Lastly, initiating cyberattacks can be a risky strategy at times due to the possibility of cyber or kinetic retaliation from targeted states. Also, the deployment of cyberattacks frequently results in the inability to use the specific form of offensive cyber weaponry in future operations as targeted states are often able to understand the composition of the cyberattack and successfully defend against it in future attacks (Pedersen and Jacobsen 2024). Thus, democracies should be mindful of the potential risks and rewards associated with initiating cyberattacks when conducting cost-benefit analyses regarding the decision to utilize offensive cyber operations.\n## COMPETING INTERESTS\nThe authors have no competing interests to disclose.\n## BIOGRAPHIES\nLance Y.

However, less is known regarding how democracies operate in cyberspace as it pertains to cyberaggression. Thus, this study examines the offensive strategies of democratic states that initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states from 2005 through 2020. In examining the cyberattacks initiated by democracies during this period, we aim to better understand the motives behind democratically initiated cyberattacks, the regime types that are likely to be targeted in the attacks, and the types of cyberattacks that democracies are likely to deploy. In conducting this analysis, we find that democracies rarely attack other democratic states in cyberspace and democracies are likely to deploy more aggressive and hostile attacks when targeting authoritarian regimes. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. These findings have important implications for considering how democratic institutions affect international relations and cybersecurity.\n# INTRODUCTION\nIn October 2020 the US Cyber Command launched a series of cyberattacks that sabotaged the Russian network referred to as TrickBot, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using ransomware termed Ryuk (Nakashima 2020). When questioned about the events, US General and Commander of the US Cyber Command Paul Nakasone acknowledged the United States' efforts as \"persistent engagement\" with the goal being to maintain the integrity of the 2020 US election by preventing bot interference. A secondary goal was likely to prevent other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020). In examining the 2020 TrickBot cyberattack, several questions emerge regarding why democracies carry out cyberattacks and how democratic institutions affect the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies.\nA large amount of literature in international relations has considered the factors that affect the conflict behavior of democratic states regarding traditional forms of military conflict. However, to date, minimal research has examined how democracies behave in cyberspace regarding cyber conflict. This is problematic given the important role many researchers contend that cyber conflict plays in international security (Al-Ahmad 2013; Khan 2018). Thus, we contend that it is important to examine cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies to better understand their motivations, tactics, and the regimes that are most likely to be targeted in democratically initiated attacks. Doing so could help bridge the gap between research on democracies and traditional military conflict and cyber conflict. In addition, given the important role cyberaggression is likely to play in affecting global security in the future, attempting to understand the behavior of democracies in cyberspace is a critical area for security studies.\nPrevious research has found that democracies are less likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes (Hunter et al. 2022). This scholarship has discovered that when democracies do initiate cyberattacks, they are significantly more likely to target authoritarian regimes. In addition, this research finds that democracies do cyberattack other democracies, but it is rare. However, two questions that are not addressed in the research are (1) if democracies initiate cyberattacks to a lesser degree than authoritarian states, what are the motivating factors behind the attacks; and (2) what type of cyberattacks are democracies likely to deploy against other states based on the regime type of the targeted states? In answering these questions, we analyze data from the Coun\na Corresponding author: lahunter@augusta.edu\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\ncil on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a) and conduct case study analyses of all known democratically initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020. We incorporate literature from the democratic peace theory and research on regime type and kinetic conflict in attempting to explain why democracies carry out cyberattacks and to understand the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies. We contend that democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted state. Democracies often deploy more aggressive and hostile cyberattacks against authoritarian regimes compared with cyberattacks that are carried out against other democracies. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. More specifically, we argue that shared democratic norms, institutions, and values between democracies lead democracies to be more likely to target authoritarian states in cyberattacks and to deploy more aggressive cyberattacks against authoritarian states compared with democracies. Overall, this study seeks to expand our understanding of democratic states' behavior in cyberspace by examining the motivating factors behind democratically initiated cyberattacks and the types of cyberattacks democracies deploy based on the regime type of targeted states.\nThe layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows. First, we discuss the definitions of the main cyber terms used in the paper. Next, we examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyber conflict. We then analyze previous scholarship regarding how regime type affects traditional forms of military conflict and cyber conflict. Next, we examine data from the CFR-COTD (CFR 2021a) and conduct case study analyses in which we analyze the motivations, strategies, and targets of cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states by examining the full universe of known and verified cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. Lastly, we discuss our findings and implications for international security.\n# CYBER DEFINITIONS\nTo properly examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we need to define key cyber terms discussed in the study. The first term is \"cyber.\" Cyber refers to a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers\" (NIST 2024). The next term is \"cyber warfare/conflict.\" We use both \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" because some scholarship utilizes the term \"cyber warfare\" and other research uses the term \"cyber conflict\" when discussing the same type of cyber aggression. While the focus of this paper is on cyberattacks, it is important to define \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" as the terms are referenced in the paper concerning previous scholarship on cyber. \"Cyber warfare/cyber conflict\" is defined as \"the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's computers or information networks through,\nfor example, computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks\" (RAND 2024). The last term we define is \"cyberattack.\" The US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 2024) provides two definitions of \"cyberattack.\" The first is \"Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.\" The second is \"An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise's use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.\" The US Federal Emergency Management Agency defines \"cyberattack\" as \"malicious attempts to access or damage a computer system\" (FEMA 2024). The National Cyber Security Centre in the United Kingdom defines a cyberattack as malicious attempts to damage, disrupt or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks or devices, via cyber means (NCCC 2021). We define a cyberattack based on the criteria set forward in the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) in which a nation-state carries out a cyber operation against another nation-state in the form of denial of service, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, or doxing (CFR 2021a). We do not argue that this definition is superior to others. Rather, we contend that it is appropriate based on the aim and scope of the study. We expand on the definition and operationalization of the term \"cyberattack\" in the research design section of the paper. We now turn to examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyberattacks.\n# FACTORS AFFECTING THE INITIATION OF CYBERATTACKS\nMany scholars view cyberattacks as an extension of or an alternative to kinetic conflict (Borghard and Lonergan 2019, 122; Hjortdal 2011, 1). The reasons states deploy cyberattacks as opposed to kinetic attacks vary depending on the state. One perspective for why states initiate cyberattacks is that some states may not possess the power to compete with other states from a kinetic, military standpoint. Some scholars and military leaders consider cyberattacks to be an equalizer between states in some instances because less powerful states may be able to initiate cyberattacks while they lack the capabilities to launch successful kinetic attacks. Based on this perspective, weaker states may choose to deploy cyberattacks against more powerful adversaries. However, this theory has yet to be supported by empirical studies. Research on how power asymmetries affect cyberattacks is limited. One study that examines the effect state power has on cyber conflict finds that more powerful states (measured in terms of economic and military power) are more likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with less powerful states (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). The authors find that on average states that initiate cyberattacks have twice the amount of power compared with the states that are targeted in cyberattacks. Additional studies have found that factors such as international trade (Akoto 2021), previous episodes of kinetic conflict (Osawa\nGlobal Perspectives\n2017), and whether states are rivals (Valeriano and Maness 2014) can influence the likelihood of cyberattacks.\nValeriano (2018) contends that cyberattacks are a form of covert coercion that normally seeks to send ambiguous signals or resolve to rival states. Valeriano finds that cyberattacks tend to transpire in coordination with traditional political activities (such as economic coercion or military threats or provocation) and they usually fail to produce political concessions from the targeted states (2018). Another reason states may deploy cyberattacks is possible anonymity, which enables users to remain undetected in many cases (2015, 19). Thus, even if hostile cyber action is detected, it can be difficult to accurately identify the state that is responsible for the attack. Additionally, cyberattacks can serve a variety of purposes. Cyberattacks can be used for espionage purposes to gain valuable information to aid an aggressor's future operations. Cyberattacks can also be employed to sabotage and destroy targets within the victim state and limit the victim states' capabilities (both cyber and kinetic). Thus, cyberattacks may serve as both enhancers and alternatives to kinetic conflict and can be used for multiple purposes.\nHaving the factors associated with the initiation of cyberattacks in previous scholarship, we now turn to examining how regime type affects the nature, target, and motivation of democratically initiated cyberattacks. Within this discussion, we consider previous research on how regime type affects the conflict behavior of democracies in the kinetic realm and what implications this scholarship has for democracies and the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Thus, we seek to understand how regime type affects the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies.\n## REGIME TYPE AND THE NATURE OF CYBERATTACKS INITIATED BY DEMOCRACIES\nA few important works examine the strategic use of cyber operations by democratic states (Goldman and Warner 2020; Kallberg 2016). Kallberg (2016) highlights the challenges in applying traditional military theory to cyber conflict. Kallberg contends that a theory of cyber conflict should address unique aspects of cyber that include anonymity, object permanence, measurable results, and rapid execution. More specifically, how does the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affect their usage compared with kinetic conflict in which most kinetic attacks are not anonymous? Relatedly, Goldman and Warner (2020) posit that democracies' interests (such as those of the United States) are often at risk due to continuous low-level cyber operations deployed by adversarial states. Over time, these operations can weaken the economic, political, and military power of democratic states. To address the threats, they contend that democracies should pursue an “integrated cybersecurity strategy” that combines national power and military cyber operations and focuses on deterrence, persistence (constant cyber operations that dismantle adversarial cyber activities), and anticipatory resilience (learning from past cyber operations, hardening cyber systems, preparing for future attacks, and limiting the impact of cyberattacks). Solar (2020) examines how emerging democracies in Latin America are approaching cyber threats, the role of the military in providing cyber security, and the implications for democratic governance. Solar finds that militaries in many emerging democracies are taking the lead in controlling cyberinfrastructure for cyber security purposes. Solar contends that this could be problematic in some instances if military involvement in cyber security undermines democratic governance by threatening a secure and open internet. Solar argues that emerging democracies should advance a balanced approach that includes military involvement in cybersecurity along with interactive policy communities with multiple stakeholders (including the defense sector) to review and manage cybersecurity policies. Solar contends that civil oversight of cybersecurity infrastructure is important to protect democratic values and principles (Solar 2020).\nIn trying to understand the behavior of democratic states regarding the initiation of cyberattacks, it is important to discuss multiple perspectives on how regime type can possibly impact cyberattacks. One potential perspective is that democracies could be more prone to launch cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes because cyberattacks could be an alternative to kinetic conflict. One of the rationales for this position is that many cyberattacks are anonymous and attribution is often difficult (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018). According to Tsagourias (2012), multiple characteristics of cyberattacks make attribution difficult. Rid and Buchanon contend that attribution should be viewed as an art and not an exact science because it is a complex, political, and multilayered process (2015). They posit that effective attribution is dependent upon resources, time, and the sophistication of the attacker. Additionally, states are more likely to devote significant resources to attribution when cyberattacks are more severe. Thus, attribution should be viewed as a gradual process, and nation-states should be considered the most capable actors to accurately attribute cyberattacks due to their significant resources. Also, according to Rid and Buchanon, states with greater technological sophistication and human talent should be able to initiate cyberattacks more easily and covertly and attribute cyberattacks more effectively while responding to cyberattacks from adversaries (2015). Therefore, from this perspective, in many instances, initiating a cyberattack could be a less risky tactic than kinetic conflict due to the difficulty in attributing attacks, and democratic states could perceive cyberattacks as a more appropriate strategy than kinetic operations. In addition, some scholars contend that cyberattacks can be executed with reduced costs and lower risks than kinetic conflict due to the lack of need for combat personnel and based on the previously discussed difficulty in attributing cyberattacks (Tsagourias 2012).\nAnother perspective is that democracies should be less likely to initiate cyberattacks not based on the pacifying effects of democratic institutions but according to the notion that democracies are likely to be wealthier than nondemocracies (on average) and have greater technological capacity and dependency (compared with authoritarian states),\nand states with greater technological dependency should be more conservative regarding the initiation of offensive cyber operations (McConnell 2009). However, an alternate perspective is that states with greater wealth and resources are more likely to initiate cyberattacks, based on previous research, which finds that more powerful states are more prone to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). Additionally, other scholars contend that states with greater technological connectivity are more capable regarding cyber offense and defense as it becomes easier for these states to initiate covert cyberattacks and attribute cyberattacks to adversaries (Rid and Buchanan 2015). As Rid and Buchanon remark: “A third common assumption is that the most industrialized and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage. Attribution again reverses this logic: the larger a government's technical prowess, and the larger the pool of talent and skills at its disposal, the higher will be that state's ability to hide its own covert operations, uncover others, and respond accordingly” (2015, 31).\nLastly, a separate perspective is that the conflict-reducing effects of democratic institutions extend not only to kinetic conflict but to cyberattacks as well. This line of reasoning posits that democracies may be more peaceful in cyberspace compared with authoritarian regimes due to the presence of democratic norms, democratic institutions, and democracies' involvement in international institutions. Previous research provides some support for this position in that democracies are found to be less likely to initiate cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes when controlling for several political and economic factors (Hunter et al. 2022). Thus, there is evidence that regime type affects the conflict propensity of states regarding cyber behavior and democracies are less likely to deploy cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes. In addition, this scholarship has found that democracies rarely attack one another in the cyber realm. However, if democracies are less likely to initiate cyberattacks and are less prone to cyberattack other democracies, what motivates democracies to initiate cyberattacks? More specifically, what are the motivations for cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states?\nResearch on the behavior of democracies regarding kinetic conflict finds that democracies do not initiate wars with one another (often referred to as the dyadic democratic peace), although there are many instances of democracies warring with authoritarian regimes (Russett 1993). While this is one of the strongest empirical findings in international relations (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003), researchers debate the rationale for the findings, and some scholars refute the claim that democracies are less likely to war with one another (Barkawi and Laffey 1999; Rosato 2003). In responding to the claims that democratic peace findings are questionable, Imai and Lo (2021) test the democratic peace theory in a cross-national analysis and “show that overturning the negative association between democracy and conflict would require a confounder that is forty-seven times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in other dyads. To put this number in context, the relationship between democracy and peace is at least five times as robust as that between smoking and lung cancer. To explain away the democratic peace, therefore, scholars would have to find far more powerful confounders than those already identified in the literature” (901). In addition, while many scholars contend that democracies rarely or have never gone to war with one another, democracies have engaged in minor conflicts and disputes (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021). Thus, previous scholarship finds that democracies have engaged in lower-level disputes with one another, although rarely have the disputes escalated to war (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021; Mousseau 1997, 1998). One potential explanation for this finding is that when democracies interact with one another, they are more likely to resort to diplomacy due to shared institutions, norms, and values (Anderson and Souva 2010; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; and Rey and Barkdull 2005). A large amount of literature is devoted to explaining the reasons for these findings, and the explanations vary but include the design of democratic institutions, shared norms and values, and democracies' membership and involvement in international institutions. While this research is voluminous, one clear takeaway is that democracies interact with authoritarian and democratic states in significantly different ways, and democracies are more likely to engage with other democracies more peacefully compared with their interactions with non-democracies.\nWhile previous research has demonstrated that democracies are less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks (Hunter et al. 2022), research to date has not examined the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies. If we extend the literature on how democracies interact with other democracies and authoritarian regimes in the kinetic realm to cyberspace, the logical extension is that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies, and in the event of a cyberattack, the cyberattacks directed against other democracies should be less aggressive and hostile (i.e. overtly conflictual and potentially damaging) compared with the cyberattacks launched against authoritarian states. The rationale is that democracies are more likely to resort to compromise and diplomacy when interacting with other democracies compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes (Mousseau 1997, 1998). More specifically, democracies should view other democracies as more friendly and less hostile due to shared values, institutions, and norms, and when issues or disagreements emerge between democracies, they should be more likely to resolve the issues diplomatically rather than through acts of cyberaggression. Therefore, in extending the research on democratic state behavior regarding kinetic conflict to the cyber realm, democracies should pursue more aggressive strategies when interacting with authoritarian regimes and less aggressive strategies when engaging other democracies. Thus, based on our previous discussions, we argue that democracies should be less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks. This leads us to our first proposition.\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nProposition 1: When democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks, democracies should be less likely to target democracies and more likely to target authoritarian states.\nThere are many different forms of cyberattacks. The Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a) disaggregates cyberattacks according to the following types: sabotage, denial of service, data destruction, and espionage. While the amount of damage and intensity of each attack type can vary by attack, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are usually viewed as more aggressive hostile acts compared with cyberattacks that involve only espionage (Schmitt 2012). The reason is that cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, or data destruction often produce actual and immediate damage (kinetic and/or cyber) and are more likely to be reported and discovered by the media and citizens within states. Thus, these cyber actions are often viewed as more hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks. However, we do not argue that espionage attacks are insignificant actions. Cyberespionage attacks are regarded as serious forms of cyberattacks by many researchers because vital information can be gained through acts of cyberespionage that can produce significant real-world effects and implications for national security (Deoliveira 2019). Additionally, espionage attacks can be deployed to gain valuable information on adversary states that can be later used in kinetic attacks or additional cyberattacks (ENISA 2020). However, in the aggregate, while espionage attacks clearly qualify as cyberattacks, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are frequently viewed as more aggressive and hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks.\nIn extending the literature on kinetic conflict to cyberspace, we argue that when democracies initiate cyberattacks, they should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states compared with instances in which they target other democracies. The rationale for this argument is based on research on kinetic conflict that finds that when disagreements occur between democracies, they are less likely to escalate to higher levels of intensity due to shared norms, values, and institutions (Anderson and Souva 2010; Imai and Lo 2021; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; Rey and Barkdull 2005). This stands in contrast to episodes when democracies have disputes with authoritarian regimes, in which there is a greater likelihood of hostile engagement due to\nthe lack of shared norms, values, and institutions. Thus, based on the discussion, our second proposition is:\nProposition 2: Democracies should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks (i.e., sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service) when targeting authoritarian regimes and less hostile cyberattacks (i.e., cyberespionage) when targeting other democratic states.\n# RESEARCH DESIGN\nTo examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we collected data on cyberattacks that were initiated by democracies against other states from 2005 through 2020. The cases included in the study are those in which democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states during the period and attribution for the attack is verified. Thus, every verifiable instance of a democracy initiating a known state-sponsored cyberattack against another state or states during the period is included in the study (as defined and operationalized by the Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a)). We do not analyze cyberattacks executed by nonstate actors. The reason is that we aim to analyze the motives, rationale, and targets of democratically initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks, and examining nonstate hacking/criminal/terrorist groups would not produce relevant information for the purposes of our study. The data on cyberattacks are collected from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a). The Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) provides data on known state-sponsored cyberattacks that transpired during this period in which the initiator and the target are nation-states or are directly affiliated with a nation-state. The state-sponsored cyberattacks that are included in the dataset are events where threat actors commit denial-of-service attacks, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, and doxing (CFR 2021a). The reasoning for the dataset's focus on state-sponsored attacks is as follows: \"The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests. Furthermore, state-sponsored incidents generally have the most accurate and comprehensive reporting. Reporting on nonstate actors, such as hacktivist groups, tends to be murkier and makes for less reliable data\" (CFR 2021a). The CFR data are collected based on several open-source outlets that include but are not limited to\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 1. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks and Target Type\n|  Target Type | Frequency | Percentage  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 13 | 48%  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 12 | 44%  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 2 | 7%  |\ngovernment press documents, cybersecurity corporations, existing repositories, and media reports and publications concerning state-sponsored attacks (CFR 2021a).\nIn discussing cyber data, several limitations should be acknowledged. One limitation regarding the data, which is relevant to all cyber conflict datasets, is that not every cyberattack that transpired during the period is included because of limited information pertaining to some of these cyberattacks. More specifically, some cyberattacks are not reported, and many cyberattacks remain anonymous due to difficulty in accurately attributing attacks and the purposeful effort by some states to mask their cyber activity. Second, the CFR relies on publicly available data. As the CFR stipulates, \"State intelligence agencies and private cybersecurity firms are likely to have the most complete data about state-sponsored actors, but may not make what they know public to protect national security or trade secrets\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, the cyber events that are included in the CFR (COTD) are verified incidents where information is known and verified regarding the states that carried out the attacks and the states that were victims of the attacks based on open-source data.\nWe utilize the four categorizations from the COTD regarding the attack type. The four categories are espionage, sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service. The four categories are examined because these are the four cyberattack types utilized by the COTD (CFR 2021a). Additionally, previous cyber research has discussed and analyzed these attack types (Banks 2017; CISA 2019; Maurer and Morgus 2014), and they are considered standard attack types in the cyber literature. Denial-of-service attacks prevent appropriate users from accessing information systems, devices, and network resources due to a malicious cyber actor (CISA 2019). Attackers can target a variety of resources and can deny service in different ways. Ultimately, denial-of-service attacks overwhelm the computer network by sending more data than it is capable of processing, resulting in a temporary paralysis of the computer network (CFR 2021a). Cyber sabotage is an attack carried out against the integrity of an IT system (Maurer and Morgus 2014, 58). This attack \"causes a disruption to a physical process\" (CFR 2021a). Data destruction is the process of destroying data on electronic or physical mediums (Ministry of Justice 2021). In some cases, this is done intentionally for security purposes. Cyber data destruction results in a computer or computer networks becoming unusable due to the use of malicious software (CFR 2021a). Cyberespionage refers to a state covertly collecting information for intelligence purposes (Australian Cyber Security Center 2021). More specifically, cyberespionage involves penetration of computer systems or networks to obtain information on or going\nthrough these systems, without the information holder's consent (Banks 2017, 513; CFR 2021a). In addition to analyzing the attack types of democratically initiated cyberattacks, we also examine the sectors targeted within victim states based on the COTD's classification as follows: government, private sector, civil society, and the military.\n## FINDINGS\nIn total, there were 27 cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. The overall breakdown of the 27 attacks that were initiated by democracies between 2005 and 2020 is as follows and is presented in table 1. There were 13 cases (48 percent) where democracies attacked only authoritarian states. There were 12 cases (44 percent) where democracies attacked both democracies and authoritarian states simultaneously. There were 2 cases (7 percent) in which democracies attacked only other democracies. Thus, in examining these statistics, we see that when democracies launch cyberattacks, they are likely to target authoritarian regimes specifically, or a combination of democratic and authoritarian regimes in simultaneous attacks. Also, democracies do occasionally target democracies (where an authoritarian regime is not attacked simultaneously), but it is rare. In 7 percent of cases does a democracy attack only another democracy. Thus, the primary targets for democracies appear to be either solely authoritarian states or a simultaneous combination of authoritarian and democratic states. This finding provides support for proposition 1, which stipulates that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies.\nTable 2 displays the specific sector targeted in a cyberattack based on the regime type that is targeted. In respect to the attack type based on the sector that is targeted when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 6 government, 3 private, 1 civil society, and 3 military. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 7 government, 1 private, 0 civil society, and 4 military. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 0 government, 0 private, 1 civil society, and 1 military. Thus, in examining table 2, we find that government sectors are more likely to be targeted in attacks when only authoritarian states are targeted and in attacks where both authoritarian and democratic states are targeted simultaneously. Civil society and military sectors are most frequently targeted when only democratic regimes are the victims of democratically initiated cyberattacks.\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 2.

When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 10 espionage, 1 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and no denial-of-service attacks. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 2 espionage, and no attacks regarding sabotage, data destruction, and denial-of-service attacks.\nIn examining the results in table 3, we find that a few patterns emerge. First, democracies are more likely to commit acts of sabotage when only authoritarian states are targeted versus attacks that include both democratic and authoritarian states or solely democratic states. One hundred percent of the sabotage attacks committed by democracies were committed against only authoritarian states. Second, denial-of-service attacks are more likely to be committed against only authoritarian states. Democracies did not initiate any denial-of-service attacks in attacks that included simultaneous attacks against democracies and authoritarian states. Also, democracies did not deploy any denial-of-service attacks against only democratic states. Once again, one hundred percent of denial-of-service attacks were deployed against only authoritarian states. Regarding data destruction, democracies were equally likely to initiate data destruction attacks against authoritarian states and in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously. Lastly, democracies were more likely to deploy espionage attacks in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously, and 100 percent of the attacks directed against only democratic states were acts of cyberespionage.\nWhen we interpret the results in table 3, it appears that democracies initiate more aggressive and hostile attacks against authoritarian states compared with democratic targets, which provides support for proposition 2. This is not to argue that espionage cannot be destructive. Espionage\nattacks can be costly because they may provide valuable information to a potential adversary that can damage a victim state. However, the types of attacks launched against authoritarian states are more overtly aggressive and hostile because sabotage and denial-of-service attacks often produce significant and immediate damage against a victim state. In addition, these attacks are often immediately known, whereas espionage attacks may be undetected for some time. Thus, the finding that a larger number of sabotage and denial-of-service attacks are initiated against nondemocracies indicates that democracies are more aggressive in deploying their offensive cyber weaponry against authoritarian states compared with when they target other democracies.\nTable 4 displays data regarding whether cyberattacks included in the analysis are carried out in retaliation to a kinetic attack or a cyberattack. Thus, the variable relation refers to whether the cyberattack occurred in response to a kinetic or a cyber hostility that originated from the targeted state. General Retaliation refers to retaliation for a kinetic or cyber hostility originating from the targeted state. Thus, both kinetic and cyber actions are included in the category General Retaliation. Kinetic Retaliation refers to retaliation due to a kinetic hostility committed by the targeted state. Lastly, Cyber Retaliation refers to retaliation for a cyber hostility committed by the targeted state. In examining table 4, we find that the only acts of General Retaliation occurred when democracies attacked only nondemocracies. Out of the 3 total retaliation attacks, 2 were in response to kinetic actions and 1 was in response to a previous cyberattack. When retaliation attacks are initiated by democracies, they are directed at specific authoritarian states. There are no cases of democracies retaliating against other democracies.\nTable 5 displays the number of cyberattacks, and the number of cyberattacks by attack type, initiated by the democratic states included in the analysis. In reviewing table 5, it is important to note that many cyber events involved multiple initiator states. Six of the 26 cases (23 percent) involved multiple initiator states. In examining table 5, we\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 4.

The remaining democratic states in the analysis initiated 1 cyberattack. The findings regarding the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom and the number of cyberattacks deployed reinforce previous scholarship, which finds that more powerful states are more likely to initiate cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). In the next section, we explore the motives, circumstances, and tactics behind these attacks to better understand why democracies may initiate certain types of cyberattacks against authoritarian states versus democracies.\n# CASE STUDY ANALYSIS\nTo more fully understand the nature of state-sponsored cyberattacks initiated by democracies, we analyze qualitative case information pertaining to each cyberattack in respect to the potential motives and tactics associated with the attacks. We utilize publicly available data to obtain this information. In addition, more information is known regarding some events compared with others, and in some cases, there is limited data on the motives and tactics of the attack. As the CFR-COTD states: \"Furthermore, some reporting from the media or cybersecurity companies can be vague or incomplete, making it difficult to confirm incidents for which data is only available from a single source\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, we attempt to provide descriptions of\nthe motives, tactics, and state actors involved in each democratically initiated cyberattack while acknowledging that limited publicly available information and sources exist for some cases. The full list of cases and the key aspects of each case including the cyberattack name, the initiator(s) of the attack, the target(s) of the attack, the type of attack, and the suspected motivation for each attack can be found in table 6. Additionally, given the space constraints of the paper, a more detailed description of each case can be found in the appendix.\nBefore proceeding to the case study analysis, one important point is that additional economic, social, and political motives outside our analysis may have impacted the democratically initiated cyberattacks that are included in the study. Given that 27 cases (cyber events) are discussed in the study, the limited sources for some cases, and the space constraints of the paper, additional possible motives cannot be fully explored for each case. Thus, it is important to note that additional economic, social, and political motives and explanations may exist for each case.\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND SABOTAGE\nIn considering cyberattacks initiated by democracies against only authoritarian states in which the attack type was sabotage, many of the attacks were carried out by the United States. In April 2017, the United States is believed to have sabotaged North Korea's nuclear program by sabotag-\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 6.

The United States' efforts are believed to have been motivated by an attempt to prevent the North Korean military from expanding its missile technology systems to protect South Korea and to maximize security on the Korean Peninsula.\nAnother attack in this category that was executed by the United States that targeted an authoritarian state's missile systems occurred in June 2019 when the US Cyber Command hacked Iranian rocket and missile launch systems in what Iran deemed an unsuccessful effort to disable the systems. This sabotage operation carried out by the United States came during a time of heightened tensions between the two states and served as a response to recent aggression by the Iranian government when it downed a US drone and attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz (Council\non Foreign Relations 2021b). The response by the United States signaled its willingness to deploy cyber capabilities in response to kinetic actions.\nIn a series of attacks launched by the United States against Russia in 2018, the US Cyber Command sabotaged the Russian Internet Research Agency in an attempt to maintain the integrity of the US 2018 elections (Buchanan 2019). Although some information regarding the attack remains unknown, the operation was likely intended to prevent Russian disinformation that could have been disseminated by the Internet Research Agency (Buchanan 2019). In a separate attack directed at Russia, and mentioned in the introduction of the paper, in October 2020 the US Cyber Command sabotaged computers on the TrickBot network, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using Ryuk ransomware (Nakashima 2020). US General and Commander of the US\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nCyber Command Paul Nakasone stated that the cyber operation was carried out as “persistent engagement” with the aim of preserving the integrity of the 2020 US election by eliminating bot interference. A related goal was to thwart other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020).\nIsrael was responsible for the other sabotage attack in the category of democracies initiating sabotage attacks against nondemocracies. In May 2020 Israel conducted a cyberattack targeting Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port near the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran reported only caused damage to private systems (Joffre 2020). This attack was an attempt to sabotage port operations in response to Iran’s failed cyberattack on Israel’s water treatment and sewage facilities that had transpired less than a month prior (TOI 2020). In response to the attack, Iran stated that it was attempting to prevent future cyberattacks by developing its intranet system known as the National Information Network to limit its reliance on the international cyber community (Joffre 2020).\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS\nRegarding denial-of-service attacks when the target is a nondemocracy, the first case involves Taiwan and China. On October 23, 2007, a secret agent working for Taiwan’s military intelligence allegedly planted “Trojan” programs in the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, National Defense Research Institutes, Military Industrial Labs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all of which are part of China’s intelligence infrastructure. The motivation behind the attack was to obtain classified intelligence information (Chung 2007). The attack is considered a denial-of-service attack because it temporarily affected the cyber operations of the Chinese targets.\nAnother denial-of-service attack involves Israel and Syria. In September 2007 Israel sabotaged Syrian military capabilities by disrupting its radar and air defense systems to enable an Israeli air strike (Melman 2007). This incident led Iran to have less confidence in the Syrian air defense capabilities. Additionally, this could be considered a hybrid attack due to the cyber nature of the attack combined with kinetic jammers in a plane being used to sabotage Syria’s radar and air defense capabilities (Melman 2007).\nThe two remaining attacks in the category involve the United States and North Korea and the United States and Russia. In September 2017 the US Cyber Command targeted North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (a.k.a. North Korean Intelligence Agency) to deny service to North Korea’s cyber capabilities (Council on Foreign Relations 2017). This effort was based on directives from the US executive branch and was achieved through the United States overloading North Korea’s internet system with an abundance of traffic, resulting in the stoppage of internet access (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017). The United States used this event as a signal to pressure other states to sever ties with North Korea (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017).\nIn another attack carried out by the United States against Russia, in November 2018 the US Cyber Command sabotaged a Russian troll farm to maintain the integrity of the US midterm election by preventing the dissemination of disinformation (Kube and Dilanian 2019). The US efforts against the Russian government, and more specifically the Internet Research Agency, once again aimed to prevent disinformation by taking the troll farm offline during the day of the 2018 midterm elections and the few days following it (Chiacu and Hosenball 2019).\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe lone event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using data destruction attacks involves the United States and Iran. In late September 2019, the US government conducted cyberattacks against Iran resulting in the destruction of data and physical hardware (Ali and Stewart 2019). This attack was in response to increased tensions between the United States and Iran due to Iran’s alleged attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities a few weeks prior (Council on Foreign Relations 2021b). The goal of the attack was to prevent Tehran’s ability to spread propaganda regarding its attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThe first event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using espionage attacks involves multiple democracies initiating espionage attacks in a coordinated event. In late 2018 Five Eyes (an intelligence alliance between the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) used malware to spy on Yandex (the Russian version of Google) user accounts (Bing, Stubbs, and Menn 2019). The malware known as Regin was used by Five Eyes in a previous operation. The attack was carried out to gain technical information related to account authentication credentials that would enable access to and monitoring privileges over various Yandex user accounts and messages. The specific accounts of interest were likely key members of the Russian government and the Russian military that had personal Yandex accounts.\nThe next event involves the Netherlands and Russia. As reported in 2018, the Netherlands conducted espionage operations through the use of malware by targeting and compromising “the Dukes,” an arm of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (Poulsen 2019). This was likely done to gain a better understanding of the Dukes’ targeting methods and operations and to assist the US intelligence community in determining who was responsible for the 2016 compromise of the Democratic National Committee. Russia’s encroachment on European politics posed a potential future threat to the Netherlands, which likely led to the combined efforts with the US intelligence community to execute the attack in this instance, although direct coordination with US forces remains unconfirmed (Poulsen 2019).\nThe last event in the category involves South Korea and North Korea. As reported in March 2020, South Korea’s\nGlobal Perspectives\nDark Hotel group displayed significant resources and technical capabilities while conducting espionage operations against North Korea through the use of five zero-day exploits in 2019 (Greenberg 2020). While the identities of the specific individuals targeted were not released, it is believed that the attack was executed to gain information such as emails and documents from North Korean government officials and key professionals. The goal was likely to gather as much intelligence as possible on North Korea's military capabilities and nuclear missile program.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES\nIn considering the 13 cyberattacks launched by democracies against authoritarian states, the most common form of attack was sabotage (38 percent), followed by denial of service (31 percent), espionage (23 percent), and data destruction (8 percent). It appears that democracies are more likely to carry out attacks that result in actual damage (cyber or kinetic) when targeting nondemocratic states. Many of the attacks appear to be aimed at damaging an authoritarian state's military capabilities, retaliating for previous kinetic actions directed against a democracy or its allies, attempting to prevent interference in domestic politics by a foreign adversary, disrupting operations by potential rival states, and collecting intelligence from potential authoritarian adversaries.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SABOTAGE\nThe lone event in this category is the well-known Stuxnet attack. Stuxnet was first detected in June 2010 but may have been in operation as early as 2009 (Fildes 2010). It is believed that the United States and Israel were responsible for the classified creation of Stuxnet during an operation codenamed “Olympic Games” (Schwartz 2012). The two states are alleged to have used Stuxnet to target a variety of states including Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Taiwan (Council on Foreign Relations 2010). The most notable incident of the use of Stuxnet was against Iran to severely degrade its nuclear program without the use of ground forces or airstrikes to enhance the national security of both the United States and Israel (Fildes 2010). While the United States and Israel have not claimed responsibility for the cyberattack, strategic political motivations and technological capabilities indicate the two states are the likely sponsors of the event. Additionally, several researchers have contended that the United States and Israel were responsible for the attack (Baezner and Robin 2017; Lindsay 2013; Nakashima and Warrick 2012), making Stuxnet one of the most highly publicized cyberattacks initiated by democratic states against both democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe one event in this category involves a high-profile attack carried out by the United States and Israel directed at multiple states, both democratic and authoritarian. A malware called Flame is believed to have been in operation from August 2010 until May 2012 in multiple countries including Iran, Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Hungary, Austria, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and France (Lee 2012). The malware is extremely complex and could change the future of cyber conflict, according to some observers (Villasenor 2016). The malware is believed to have been sponsored by the United States and Israel with the intent of both destroying data and gaining intelligence. The United States has denied allegations of involvement in the attacks (Paganini 2012). The most likely motives behind the attacks were to conduct cyber operations against adversary states and to gather intelligence to gain strategic advantages against potential enemies. In addition, the likely motives for the sponsoring states in conducting the operations against other democracies were to gain access to financial accounts for persons of interest and to test their capabilities before use against adversaries to ensure that the sponsor states did not lose the element of surprise.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ESPIONAGE\nThere are a total of 10 cases that fall within the category of democracies attacking democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously using espionage attacks. Thus, due to space constraints and the large number of events, we do not include descriptions of each attack here. The descriptions can be found in the appendix. Regarding the broad overview of the attacks, some attacks involved multiple sponsor states, and the attacking democracies include the United States (4 attacks), Israel (3 attacks), the United Kingdom, France, India, Spain, and Pakistan. The motivations behind the attacks varied for each event. The motivations included the desire to obtain sensitive military and financial intelligence from specific states and obtain information on individuals of interest. Other motivations included the desire to obtain classified information to gain influence over ongoing high-stakes international negotiations. Attacks were also carried out to test specific cyber offensive capabilities to lay the groundwork for future attacks. Attacks were also executed to acquire information that would lead to cyber advantages over other states and to gain intelligence on rival states.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY\nIn considering the 12 cyberattacks launched by democracies against democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously, the most common form of attack was espionage (83 percent), followed by data destruction (8 percent) and sabotage (8 percent). Democracies appear significantly more\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nlikely to carry out espionage attacks, rather than attacks that result in direct kinetic or cyber damage, when the targets are both democratic and authoritarian states. Many of the espionage attacks were aimed at collecting intelligence for economic, military, and strategic purposes. Also, attacks appear to be deployed to test offensive cyber capabilities and to damage nondemocratic adversaries' military capabilities (in the case of Stuxnet, where the United States and Israel targeted Iran's nuclear facilities).\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThere were only two cases in which democracies attacked only other democracies. In both cases, the attack type was espionage. The first event involved Pakistan. Throughout 2020 APT 36, a hacker group from Pakistan, targeted multiple Indian officials in espionage operations including those in defense organizations through operation \"honey trap\" (Mantri 2020). This operation was a continuation of recent tensions between Pakistan and India and was used to spread misinformation regarding the coronavirus while also gaining access to Indian government servers (Threat Intelligence Team 2021; Gill 2020), impacting the Indian economy, and gaining an advantage in the realm of command and control (C2) security capabilities.\nThe other attack was initiated by Indonesia. In January 2016 a spyware program linked to the Indonesian government was found to be using a server in Sydney, Australia (Barbaschow 2016). The spyware, FinFisher, has been known to be utilized for surveillance purposes (Main and Duffy 2016). FinFisher was likely deployed by Indonesia due to previous allegations that the Australian government had intercepted communications from the Indonesian president in 2009 (Barbaschow 2016). Although the FinFisher spyware was likely used to spy on members of the Australian government, it is also probable that Indonesia was using the Australian server to obscure their spyware from other states to allow it to operate without detection for a longer period.\n# DISCUSSION\nIn examining the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies, several trends emerge. Firstly, democracies are significantly more likely to target authoritarian states in their attacks. This finding supports previous research that posits that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies. Thus, our findings support the notion that democracies target authoritarian states to a greater degree than nondemocracies. From 2005 through 2020, there were only two known cases in which democracies cyberattacked other democracies (when only democratic states were targeted). The motivations behind cyberattacks directed at democracies are often to collect governmental and economic intelligence through espionage attacks. Secondly, democracies deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states. Democracies are more likely to deploy sabotage, denial-of-service, and data destruction\nattacks when cyberattacking authoritarian states and espionage attacks when targeting other democracies. Thirdly, the motivations behind cyberattacks directed at authoritarian states are to inflict damage on the defensive capabilities of authoritarian states, prevent authoritarian states from interfering with domestic politics in democracies, collect governmental and defense intelligence, and disrupt military operations of rival, authoritarian states. These findings provide support for the literature on democratic peace and kinetic conflict extending into cyberspace. As with kinetic conflict, democracies appear to engage with other democracies less aggressively in cyberspace compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes. Thus, the conflict-inhibiting effects of shared norms, values, and institutions that frequently exist between democracies in the kinetic realm appear to extend into cyberspace when considering cyberattacks.\nKalberg (2016) posits that when applying military theories to the cyber realm, it is important to account for the anonymous nature of cyberattacks. Thus, future research should examine the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks compared with kinetic conflict. Future research should examine how the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affects the initiation of cyberattacks by democratic and authoritarian states and how anonymity in the cyber realm conditions state leaders' decisions to employ cyberattacks instead of kinetic attacks. Answering these questions could shed additional light on the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks based on regime type.\nWhile our research shows that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies and democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted states, several limitations of the study should be discussed. First, as previously mentioned, many cyberattacks are unreported, unverified, and unattributed. Thus, our analysis of democratically initiated cyberattacks captures data only on known, verified, and attributed cyberattacks. Many additional attacks likely occurred during the period that are not accounted for in publicly available data sources. Second, we have attempted to analyze and explain the motivations behind democratically initiated cyberattacks based on open-source data. Additional political, economic, and social motivations likely exist for some of the cases included in the study, and this information could be obtained from classified sources. Lastly, many of the democratically initiated cyberattacks during the period were attributed to the United States. While fourteen democratic states initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020, 55 percent of the cases involved the United States. Thus, the United States has a larger effect on the findings compared to other states.\nIn expanding upon this study, future research could include additional cyber data as it becomes available to conduct large $N$, cross-national quantitative analysis. Future research could also consider the role of nonstate actors and emerging technologies in affecting the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Additionally, future research should continue to consider how regime type affects cyber conflict and examine the nature of cyberattacks deployed by\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nauthoritarian regimes. This research could analyze whether authoritarian states launch more aggressive cyberattacks based on whether the targeted states are democratic or authoritarian. Also, future research could analyze the motivations behind cyberattacks that are deployed by authoritarian states. This research could shed additional light on how regime type and domestic institutions affect the behavior of states in cyberspace.\nIn considering the implications of the study for global security, based on the findings from this study and other cyber scholarship (Hunter et al. 2022), democracies appear more likely to cyberattack authoritarian states and authoritarian states appear more prone to cyberattack democracies. This is not to argue that cyberattacks do not occur between states with similar regime types. Rather, based on the findings from this study and others, cyberattacks are most likely to occur between democratic and authoritarian states. Therefore, in considering cyber defenses, government leaders should be mindful that impactful cyberattacks are most likely to emerge from states with regime types disparate from their own. Additionally, modern and future warfare is likely to entail a mixture of cyber, cognitive, and kinetic forms of conflict (i.e., hybrid warfare) (Danyk and Briggs 2023). Therefore, governments should configure their cyber defenses in a manner that accounts for where cyberattacks are most likely to originate from, and considering the regime type of states could assist in their threat assessments. Lastly, initiating cyberattacks can be a risky strategy at times due to the possibility of cyber or kinetic retaliation from targeted states. Also, the deployment of cyberattacks frequently results in the inability to use the specific form of offensive cyber weaponry in future operations as targeted states are often able to understand the composition of the cyberattack and successfully defend against it in future attacks (Pedersen and Jacobsen 2024). Thus, democracies should be mindful of the potential risks and rewards associated with initiating cyberattacks when conducting cost-benefit analyses regarding the decision to utilize offensive cyber operations.\n## COMPETING INTERESTS\nThe authors have no competing interests to disclose.\n## BIOGRAPHIES\nLance Y.

However, less is known regarding how democracies operate in cyberspace as it pertains to cyberaggression. Thus, this study examines the offensive strategies of democratic states that initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states from 2005 through 2020. In examining the cyberattacks initiated by democracies during this period, we aim to better understand the motives behind democratically initiated cyberattacks, the regime types that are likely to be targeted in the attacks, and the types of cyberattacks that democracies are likely to deploy. In conducting this analysis, we find that democracies rarely attack other democratic states in cyberspace and democracies are likely to deploy more aggressive and hostile attacks when targeting authoritarian regimes. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. These findings have important implications for considering how democratic institutions affect international relations and cybersecurity.\n# INTRODUCTION\nIn October 2020 the US Cyber Command launched a series of cyberattacks that sabotaged the Russian network referred to as TrickBot, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using ransomware termed Ryuk (Nakashima 2020). When questioned about the events, US General and Commander of the US Cyber Command Paul Nakasone acknowledged the United States' efforts as \"persistent engagement\" with the goal being to maintain the integrity of the 2020 US election by preventing bot interference. A secondary goal was likely to prevent other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020). In examining the 2020 TrickBot cyberattack, several questions emerge regarding why democracies carry out cyberattacks and how democratic institutions affect the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies.\nA large amount of literature in international relations has considered the factors that affect the conflict behavior of democratic states regarding traditional forms of military conflict. However, to date, minimal research has examined how democracies behave in cyberspace regarding cyber conflict. This is problematic given the important role many researchers contend that cyber conflict plays in international security (Al-Ahmad 2013; Khan 2018). Thus, we contend that it is important to examine cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies to better understand their motivations, tactics, and the regimes that are most likely to be targeted in democratically initiated attacks. Doing so could help bridge the gap between research on democracies and traditional military conflict and cyber conflict. In addition, given the important role cyberaggression is likely to play in affecting global security in the future, attempting to understand the behavior of democracies in cyberspace is a critical area for security studies.\nPrevious research has found that democracies are less likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes (Hunter et al. 2022). This scholarship has discovered that when democracies do initiate cyberattacks, they are significantly more likely to target authoritarian regimes. In addition, this research finds that democracies do cyberattack other democracies, but it is rare. However, two questions that are not addressed in the research are (1) if democracies initiate cyberattacks to a lesser degree than authoritarian states, what are the motivating factors behind the attacks; and (2) what type of cyberattacks are democracies likely to deploy against other states based on the regime type of the targeted states? In answering these questions, we analyze data from the Coun\na Corresponding author: lahunter@augusta.edu\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\ncil on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a) and conduct case study analyses of all known democratically initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020. We incorporate literature from the democratic peace theory and research on regime type and kinetic conflict in attempting to explain why democracies carry out cyberattacks and to understand the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies. We contend that democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted state. Democracies often deploy more aggressive and hostile cyberattacks against authoritarian regimes compared with cyberattacks that are carried out against other democracies. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. More specifically, we argue that shared democratic norms, institutions, and values between democracies lead democracies to be more likely to target authoritarian states in cyberattacks and to deploy more aggressive cyberattacks against authoritarian states compared with democracies. Overall, this study seeks to expand our understanding of democratic states' behavior in cyberspace by examining the motivating factors behind democratically initiated cyberattacks and the types of cyberattacks democracies deploy based on the regime type of targeted states.\nThe layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows. First, we discuss the definitions of the main cyber terms used in the paper. Next, we examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyber conflict. We then analyze previous scholarship regarding how regime type affects traditional forms of military conflict and cyber conflict. Next, we examine data from the CFR-COTD (CFR 2021a) and conduct case study analyses in which we analyze the motivations, strategies, and targets of cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states by examining the full universe of known and verified cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. Lastly, we discuss our findings and implications for international security.\n# CYBER DEFINITIONS\nTo properly examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we need to define key cyber terms discussed in the study. The first term is \"cyber.\" Cyber refers to a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers\" (NIST 2024). The next term is \"cyber warfare/conflict.\" We use both \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" because some scholarship utilizes the term \"cyber warfare\" and other research uses the term \"cyber conflict\" when discussing the same type of cyber aggression. While the focus of this paper is on cyberattacks, it is important to define \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" as the terms are referenced in the paper concerning previous scholarship on cyber. \"Cyber warfare/cyber conflict\" is defined as \"the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's computers or information networks through,\nfor example, computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks\" (RAND 2024). The last term we define is \"cyberattack.\" The US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 2024) provides two definitions of \"cyberattack.\" The first is \"Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.\" The second is \"An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise's use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.\" The US Federal Emergency Management Agency defines \"cyberattack\" as \"malicious attempts to access or damage a computer system\" (FEMA 2024). The National Cyber Security Centre in the United Kingdom defines a cyberattack as malicious attempts to damage, disrupt or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks or devices, via cyber means (NCCC 2021). We define a cyberattack based on the criteria set forward in the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) in which a nation-state carries out a cyber operation against another nation-state in the form of denial of service, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, or doxing (CFR 2021a). We do not argue that this definition is superior to others. Rather, we contend that it is appropriate based on the aim and scope of the study. We expand on the definition and operationalization of the term \"cyberattack\" in the research design section of the paper. We now turn to examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyberattacks.\n# FACTORS AFFECTING THE INITIATION OF CYBERATTACKS\nMany scholars view cyberattacks as an extension of or an alternative to kinetic conflict (Borghard and Lonergan 2019, 122; Hjortdal 2011, 1). The reasons states deploy cyberattacks as opposed to kinetic attacks vary depending on the state. One perspective for why states initiate cyberattacks is that some states may not possess the power to compete with other states from a kinetic, military standpoint. Some scholars and military leaders consider cyberattacks to be an equalizer between states in some instances because less powerful states may be able to initiate cyberattacks while they lack the capabilities to launch successful kinetic attacks. Based on this perspective, weaker states may choose to deploy cyberattacks against more powerful adversaries. However, this theory has yet to be supported by empirical studies. Research on how power asymmetries affect cyberattacks is limited. One study that examines the effect state power has on cyber conflict finds that more powerful states (measured in terms of economic and military power) are more likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with less powerful states (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). The authors find that on average states that initiate cyberattacks have twice the amount of power compared with the states that are targeted in cyberattacks. Additional studies have found that factors such as international trade (Akoto 2021), previous episodes of kinetic conflict (Osawa\nGlobal Perspectives\n2017), and whether states are rivals (Valeriano and Maness 2014) can influence the likelihood of cyberattacks.\nValeriano (2018) contends that cyberattacks are a form of covert coercion that normally seeks to send ambiguous signals or resolve to rival states. Valeriano finds that cyberattacks tend to transpire in coordination with traditional political activities (such as economic coercion or military threats or provocation) and they usually fail to produce political concessions from the targeted states (2018). Another reason states may deploy cyberattacks is possible anonymity, which enables users to remain undetected in many cases (2015, 19). Thus, even if hostile cyber action is detected, it can be difficult to accurately identify the state that is responsible for the attack. Additionally, cyberattacks can serve a variety of purposes. Cyberattacks can be used for espionage purposes to gain valuable information to aid an aggressor's future operations. Cyberattacks can also be employed to sabotage and destroy targets within the victim state and limit the victim states' capabilities (both cyber and kinetic). Thus, cyberattacks may serve as both enhancers and alternatives to kinetic conflict and can be used for multiple purposes.\nHaving the factors associated with the initiation of cyberattacks in previous scholarship, we now turn to examining how regime type affects the nature, target, and motivation of democratically initiated cyberattacks. Within this discussion, we consider previous research on how regime type affects the conflict behavior of democracies in the kinetic realm and what implications this scholarship has for democracies and the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Thus, we seek to understand how regime type affects the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies.\n## REGIME TYPE AND THE NATURE OF CYBERATTACKS INITIATED BY DEMOCRACIES\nA few important works examine the strategic use of cyber operations by democratic states (Goldman and Warner 2020; Kallberg 2016). Kallberg (2016) highlights the challenges in applying traditional military theory to cyber conflict. Kallberg contends that a theory of cyber conflict should address unique aspects of cyber that include anonymity, object permanence, measurable results, and rapid execution. More specifically, how does the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affect their usage compared with kinetic conflict in which most kinetic attacks are not anonymous? Relatedly, Goldman and Warner (2020) posit that democracies' interests (such as those of the United States) are often at risk due to continuous low-level cyber operations deployed by adversarial states. Over time, these operations can weaken the economic, political, and military power of democratic states. To address the threats, they contend that democracies should pursue an “integrated cybersecurity strategy” that combines national power and military cyber operations and focuses on deterrence, persistence (constant cyber operations that dismantle adversarial cyber activities), and anticipatory resilience (learning from past cyber operations, hardening cyber systems, preparing for future attacks, and limiting the impact of cyberattacks). Solar (2020) examines how emerging democracies in Latin America are approaching cyber threats, the role of the military in providing cyber security, and the implications for democratic governance. Solar finds that militaries in many emerging democracies are taking the lead in controlling cyberinfrastructure for cyber security purposes. Solar contends that this could be problematic in some instances if military involvement in cyber security undermines democratic governance by threatening a secure and open internet. Solar argues that emerging democracies should advance a balanced approach that includes military involvement in cybersecurity along with interactive policy communities with multiple stakeholders (including the defense sector) to review and manage cybersecurity policies. Solar contends that civil oversight of cybersecurity infrastructure is important to protect democratic values and principles (Solar 2020).\nIn trying to understand the behavior of democratic states regarding the initiation of cyberattacks, it is important to discuss multiple perspectives on how regime type can possibly impact cyberattacks. One potential perspective is that democracies could be more prone to launch cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes because cyberattacks could be an alternative to kinetic conflict. One of the rationales for this position is that many cyberattacks are anonymous and attribution is often difficult (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018). According to Tsagourias (2012), multiple characteristics of cyberattacks make attribution difficult. Rid and Buchanon contend that attribution should be viewed as an art and not an exact science because it is a complex, political, and multilayered process (2015). They posit that effective attribution is dependent upon resources, time, and the sophistication of the attacker. Additionally, states are more likely to devote significant resources to attribution when cyberattacks are more severe. Thus, attribution should be viewed as a gradual process, and nation-states should be considered the most capable actors to accurately attribute cyberattacks due to their significant resources. Also, according to Rid and Buchanon, states with greater technological sophistication and human talent should be able to initiate cyberattacks more easily and covertly and attribute cyberattacks more effectively while responding to cyberattacks from adversaries (2015). Therefore, from this perspective, in many instances, initiating a cyberattack could be a less risky tactic than kinetic conflict due to the difficulty in attributing attacks, and democratic states could perceive cyberattacks as a more appropriate strategy than kinetic operations. In addition, some scholars contend that cyberattacks can be executed with reduced costs and lower risks than kinetic conflict due to the lack of need for combat personnel and based on the previously discussed difficulty in attributing cyberattacks (Tsagourias 2012).\nAnother perspective is that democracies should be less likely to initiate cyberattacks not based on the pacifying effects of democratic institutions but according to the notion that democracies are likely to be wealthier than nondemocracies (on average) and have greater technological capacity and dependency (compared with authoritarian states),\nand states with greater technological dependency should be more conservative regarding the initiation of offensive cyber operations (McConnell 2009). However, an alternate perspective is that states with greater wealth and resources are more likely to initiate cyberattacks, based on previous research, which finds that more powerful states are more prone to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). Additionally, other scholars contend that states with greater technological connectivity are more capable regarding cyber offense and defense as it becomes easier for these states to initiate covert cyberattacks and attribute cyberattacks to adversaries (Rid and Buchanan 2015). As Rid and Buchanon remark: “A third common assumption is that the most industrialized and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage. Attribution again reverses this logic: the larger a government's technical prowess, and the larger the pool of talent and skills at its disposal, the higher will be that state's ability to hide its own covert operations, uncover others, and respond accordingly” (2015, 31).\nLastly, a separate perspective is that the conflict-reducing effects of democratic institutions extend not only to kinetic conflict but to cyberattacks as well. This line of reasoning posits that democracies may be more peaceful in cyberspace compared with authoritarian regimes due to the presence of democratic norms, democratic institutions, and democracies' involvement in international institutions. Previous research provides some support for this position in that democracies are found to be less likely to initiate cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes when controlling for several political and economic factors (Hunter et al. 2022). Thus, there is evidence that regime type affects the conflict propensity of states regarding cyber behavior and democracies are less likely to deploy cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes. In addition, this scholarship has found that democracies rarely attack one another in the cyber realm. However, if democracies are less likely to initiate cyberattacks and are less prone to cyberattack other democracies, what motivates democracies to initiate cyberattacks? More specifically, what are the motivations for cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states?\nResearch on the behavior of democracies regarding kinetic conflict finds that democracies do not initiate wars with one another (often referred to as the dyadic democratic peace), although there are many instances of democracies warring with authoritarian regimes (Russett 1993). While this is one of the strongest empirical findings in international relations (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003), researchers debate the rationale for the findings, and some scholars refute the claim that democracies are less likely to war with one another (Barkawi and Laffey 1999; Rosato 2003). In responding to the claims that democratic peace findings are questionable, Imai and Lo (2021) test the democratic peace theory in a cross-national analysis and “show that overturning the negative association between democracy and conflict would require a confounder that is forty-seven times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in other dyads. To put this number in context, the relationship between democracy and peace is at least five times as robust as that between smoking and lung cancer. To explain away the democratic peace, therefore, scholars would have to find far more powerful confounders than those already identified in the literature” (901). In addition, while many scholars contend that democracies rarely or have never gone to war with one another, democracies have engaged in minor conflicts and disputes (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021). Thus, previous scholarship finds that democracies have engaged in lower-level disputes with one another, although rarely have the disputes escalated to war (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021; Mousseau 1997, 1998). One potential explanation for this finding is that when democracies interact with one another, they are more likely to resort to diplomacy due to shared institutions, norms, and values (Anderson and Souva 2010; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; and Rey and Barkdull 2005). A large amount of literature is devoted to explaining the reasons for these findings, and the explanations vary but include the design of democratic institutions, shared norms and values, and democracies' membership and involvement in international institutions. While this research is voluminous, one clear takeaway is that democracies interact with authoritarian and democratic states in significantly different ways, and democracies are more likely to engage with other democracies more peacefully compared with their interactions with non-democracies.\nWhile previous research has demonstrated that democracies are less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks (Hunter et al. 2022), research to date has not examined the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies. If we extend the literature on how democracies interact with other democracies and authoritarian regimes in the kinetic realm to cyberspace, the logical extension is that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies, and in the event of a cyberattack, the cyberattacks directed against other democracies should be less aggressive and hostile (i.e. overtly conflictual and potentially damaging) compared with the cyberattacks launched against authoritarian states. The rationale is that democracies are more likely to resort to compromise and diplomacy when interacting with other democracies compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes (Mousseau 1997, 1998). More specifically, democracies should view other democracies as more friendly and less hostile due to shared values, institutions, and norms, and when issues or disagreements emerge between democracies, they should be more likely to resolve the issues diplomatically rather than through acts of cyberaggression. Therefore, in extending the research on democratic state behavior regarding kinetic conflict to the cyber realm, democracies should pursue more aggressive strategies when interacting with authoritarian regimes and less aggressive strategies when engaging other democracies. Thus, based on our previous discussions, we argue that democracies should be less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks. This leads us to our first proposition.\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nProposition 1: When democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks, democracies should be less likely to target democracies and more likely to target authoritarian states.\nThere are many different forms of cyberattacks. The Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a) disaggregates cyberattacks according to the following types: sabotage, denial of service, data destruction, and espionage. While the amount of damage and intensity of each attack type can vary by attack, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are usually viewed as more aggressive hostile acts compared with cyberattacks that involve only espionage (Schmitt 2012). The reason is that cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, or data destruction often produce actual and immediate damage (kinetic and/or cyber) and are more likely to be reported and discovered by the media and citizens within states. Thus, these cyber actions are often viewed as more hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks. However, we do not argue that espionage attacks are insignificant actions. Cyberespionage attacks are regarded as serious forms of cyberattacks by many researchers because vital information can be gained through acts of cyberespionage that can produce significant real-world effects and implications for national security (Deoliveira 2019). Additionally, espionage attacks can be deployed to gain valuable information on adversary states that can be later used in kinetic attacks or additional cyberattacks (ENISA 2020). However, in the aggregate, while espionage attacks clearly qualify as cyberattacks, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are frequently viewed as more aggressive and hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks.\nIn extending the literature on kinetic conflict to cyberspace, we argue that when democracies initiate cyberattacks, they should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states compared with instances in which they target other democracies. The rationale for this argument is based on research on kinetic conflict that finds that when disagreements occur between democracies, they are less likely to escalate to higher levels of intensity due to shared norms, values, and institutions (Anderson and Souva 2010; Imai and Lo 2021; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; Rey and Barkdull 2005). This stands in contrast to episodes when democracies have disputes with authoritarian regimes, in which there is a greater likelihood of hostile engagement due to\nthe lack of shared norms, values, and institutions. Thus, based on the discussion, our second proposition is:\nProposition 2: Democracies should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks (i.e., sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service) when targeting authoritarian regimes and less hostile cyberattacks (i.e., cyberespionage) when targeting other democratic states.\n# RESEARCH DESIGN\nTo examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we collected data on cyberattacks that were initiated by democracies against other states from 2005 through 2020. The cases included in the study are those in which democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states during the period and attribution for the attack is verified. Thus, every verifiable instance of a democracy initiating a known state-sponsored cyberattack against another state or states during the period is included in the study (as defined and operationalized by the Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a)). We do not analyze cyberattacks executed by nonstate actors. The reason is that we aim to analyze the motives, rationale, and targets of democratically initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks, and examining nonstate hacking/criminal/terrorist groups would not produce relevant information for the purposes of our study. The data on cyberattacks are collected from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a). The Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) provides data on known state-sponsored cyberattacks that transpired during this period in which the initiator and the target are nation-states or are directly affiliated with a nation-state. The state-sponsored cyberattacks that are included in the dataset are events where threat actors commit denial-of-service attacks, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, and doxing (CFR 2021a). The reasoning for the dataset's focus on state-sponsored attacks is as follows: \"The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests. Furthermore, state-sponsored incidents generally have the most accurate and comprehensive reporting. Reporting on nonstate actors, such as hacktivist groups, tends to be murkier and makes for less reliable data\" (CFR 2021a). The CFR data are collected based on several open-source outlets that include but are not limited to\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 1. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks and Target Type\n|  Target Type | Frequency | Percentage  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 13 | 48%  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 12 | 44%  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 2 | 7%  |\ngovernment press documents, cybersecurity corporations, existing repositories, and media reports and publications concerning state-sponsored attacks (CFR 2021a).\nIn discussing cyber data, several limitations should be acknowledged. One limitation regarding the data, which is relevant to all cyber conflict datasets, is that not every cyberattack that transpired during the period is included because of limited information pertaining to some of these cyberattacks. More specifically, some cyberattacks are not reported, and many cyberattacks remain anonymous due to difficulty in accurately attributing attacks and the purposeful effort by some states to mask their cyber activity. Second, the CFR relies on publicly available data. As the CFR stipulates, \"State intelligence agencies and private cybersecurity firms are likely to have the most complete data about state-sponsored actors, but may not make what they know public to protect national security or trade secrets\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, the cyber events that are included in the CFR (COTD) are verified incidents where information is known and verified regarding the states that carried out the attacks and the states that were victims of the attacks based on open-source data.\nWe utilize the four categorizations from the COTD regarding the attack type. The four categories are espionage, sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service. The four categories are examined because these are the four cyberattack types utilized by the COTD (CFR 2021a). Additionally, previous cyber research has discussed and analyzed these attack types (Banks 2017; CISA 2019; Maurer and Morgus 2014), and they are considered standard attack types in the cyber literature. Denial-of-service attacks prevent appropriate users from accessing information systems, devices, and network resources due to a malicious cyber actor (CISA 2019). Attackers can target a variety of resources and can deny service in different ways. Ultimately, denial-of-service attacks overwhelm the computer network by sending more data than it is capable of processing, resulting in a temporary paralysis of the computer network (CFR 2021a). Cyber sabotage is an attack carried out against the integrity of an IT system (Maurer and Morgus 2014, 58). This attack \"causes a disruption to a physical process\" (CFR 2021a). Data destruction is the process of destroying data on electronic or physical mediums (Ministry of Justice 2021). In some cases, this is done intentionally for security purposes. Cyber data destruction results in a computer or computer networks becoming unusable due to the use of malicious software (CFR 2021a). Cyberespionage refers to a state covertly collecting information for intelligence purposes (Australian Cyber Security Center 2021). More specifically, cyberespionage involves penetration of computer systems or networks to obtain information on or going\nthrough these systems, without the information holder's consent (Banks 2017, 513; CFR 2021a). In addition to analyzing the attack types of democratically initiated cyberattacks, we also examine the sectors targeted within victim states based on the COTD's classification as follows: government, private sector, civil society, and the military.\n## FINDINGS\nIn total, there were 27 cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. The overall breakdown of the 27 attacks that were initiated by democracies between 2005 and 2020 is as follows and is presented in table 1. There were 13 cases (48 percent) where democracies attacked only authoritarian states. There were 12 cases (44 percent) where democracies attacked both democracies and authoritarian states simultaneously. There were 2 cases (7 percent) in which democracies attacked only other democracies. Thus, in examining these statistics, we see that when democracies launch cyberattacks, they are likely to target authoritarian regimes specifically, or a combination of democratic and authoritarian regimes in simultaneous attacks. Also, democracies do occasionally target democracies (where an authoritarian regime is not attacked simultaneously), but it is rare. In 7 percent of cases does a democracy attack only another democracy. Thus, the primary targets for democracies appear to be either solely authoritarian states or a simultaneous combination of authoritarian and democratic states. This finding provides support for proposition 1, which stipulates that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies.\nTable 2 displays the specific sector targeted in a cyberattack based on the regime type that is targeted. In respect to the attack type based on the sector that is targeted when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 6 government, 3 private, 1 civil society, and 3 military. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 7 government, 1 private, 0 civil society, and 4 military. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 0 government, 0 private, 1 civil society, and 1 military. Thus, in examining table 2, we find that government sectors are more likely to be targeted in attacks when only authoritarian states are targeted and in attacks where both authoritarian and democratic states are targeted simultaneously. Civil society and military sectors are most frequently targeted when only democratic regimes are the victims of democratically initiated cyberattacks.\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 2. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks, Target Type, and Targeted Sectors\n|  Target Type | Government | Private | Civil Society | Military  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 6 | 3 | 1 | 3  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 7 | 1 | 0 | 4  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1  |\nTable 3.

In respect to the attack type when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 3 espionage, 5 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and 4 denial-of-service attacks. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 10 espionage, 1 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and no denial-of-service attacks. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 2 espionage, and no attacks regarding sabotage, data destruction, and denial-of-service attacks.\nIn examining the results in table 3, we find that a few patterns emerge. First, democracies are more likely to commit acts of sabotage when only authoritarian states are targeted versus attacks that include both democratic and authoritarian states or solely democratic states. One hundred percent of the sabotage attacks committed by democracies were committed against only authoritarian states. Second, denial-of-service attacks are more likely to be committed against only authoritarian states. Democracies did not initiate any denial-of-service attacks in attacks that included simultaneous attacks against democracies and authoritarian states. Also, democracies did not deploy any denial-of-service attacks against only democratic states. Once again, one hundred percent of denial-of-service attacks were deployed against only authoritarian states. Regarding data destruction, democracies were equally likely to initiate data destruction attacks against authoritarian states and in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously. Lastly, democracies were more likely to deploy espionage attacks in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously, and 100 percent of the attacks directed against only democratic states were acts of cyberespionage.\nWhen we interpret the results in table 3, it appears that democracies initiate more aggressive and hostile attacks against authoritarian states compared with democratic targets, which provides support for proposition 2. This is not to argue that espionage cannot be destructive. Espionage\nattacks can be costly because they may provide valuable information to a potential adversary that can damage a victim state. However, the types of attacks launched against authoritarian states are more overtly aggressive and hostile because sabotage and denial-of-service attacks often produce significant and immediate damage against a victim state. In addition, these attacks are often immediately known, whereas espionage attacks may be undetected for some time. Thus, the finding that a larger number of sabotage and denial-of-service attacks are initiated against nondemocracies indicates that democracies are more aggressive in deploying their offensive cyber weaponry against authoritarian states compared with when they target other democracies.\nTable 4 displays data regarding whether cyberattacks included in the analysis are carried out in retaliation to a kinetic attack or a cyberattack. Thus, the variable relation refers to whether the cyberattack occurred in response to a kinetic or a cyber hostility that originated from the targeted state. General Retaliation refers to retaliation for a kinetic or cyber hostility originating from the targeted state. Thus, both kinetic and cyber actions are included in the category General Retaliation. Kinetic Retaliation refers to retaliation due to a kinetic hostility committed by the targeted state. Lastly, Cyber Retaliation refers to retaliation for a cyber hostility committed by the targeted state. In examining table 4, we find that the only acts of General Retaliation occurred when democracies attacked only nondemocracies. Out of the 3 total retaliation attacks, 2 were in response to kinetic actions and 1 was in response to a previous cyberattack. When retaliation attacks are initiated by democracies, they are directed at specific authoritarian states. There are no cases of democracies retaliating against other democracies.\nTable 5 displays the number of cyberattacks, and the number of cyberattacks by attack type, initiated by the democratic states included in the analysis. In reviewing table 5, it is important to note that many cyber events involved multiple initiator states. Six of the 26 cases (23 percent) involved multiple initiator states. In examining table 5, we\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 4.

The remaining democratic states in the analysis initiated 1 cyberattack. The findings regarding the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom and the number of cyberattacks deployed reinforce previous scholarship, which finds that more powerful states are more likely to initiate cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). In the next section, we explore the motives, circumstances, and tactics behind these attacks to better understand why democracies may initiate certain types of cyberattacks against authoritarian states versus democracies.\n# CASE STUDY ANALYSIS\nTo more fully understand the nature of state-sponsored cyberattacks initiated by democracies, we analyze qualitative case information pertaining to each cyberattack in respect to the potential motives and tactics associated with the attacks. We utilize publicly available data to obtain this information. In addition, more information is known regarding some events compared with others, and in some cases, there is limited data on the motives and tactics of the attack. As the CFR-COTD states: \"Furthermore, some reporting from the media or cybersecurity companies can be vague or incomplete, making it difficult to confirm incidents for which data is only available from a single source\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, we attempt to provide descriptions of\nthe motives, tactics, and state actors involved in each democratically initiated cyberattack while acknowledging that limited publicly available information and sources exist for some cases. The full list of cases and the key aspects of each case including the cyberattack name, the initiator(s) of the attack, the target(s) of the attack, the type of attack, and the suspected motivation for each attack can be found in table 6. Additionally, given the space constraints of the paper, a more detailed description of each case can be found in the appendix.\nBefore proceeding to the case study analysis, one important point is that additional economic, social, and political motives outside our analysis may have impacted the democratically initiated cyberattacks that are included in the study. Given that 27 cases (cyber events) are discussed in the study, the limited sources for some cases, and the space constraints of the paper, additional possible motives cannot be fully explored for each case. Thus, it is important to note that additional economic, social, and political motives and explanations may exist for each case.\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND SABOTAGE\nIn considering cyberattacks initiated by democracies against only authoritarian states in which the attack type was sabotage, many of the attacks were carried out by the United States. In April 2017, the United States is believed to have sabotaged North Korea's nuclear program by sabotag-\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 6.

The United States' efforts are believed to have been motivated by an attempt to prevent the North Korean military from expanding its missile technology systems to protect South Korea and to maximize security on the Korean Peninsula.\nAnother attack in this category that was executed by the United States that targeted an authoritarian state's missile systems occurred in June 2019 when the US Cyber Command hacked Iranian rocket and missile launch systems in what Iran deemed an unsuccessful effort to disable the systems. This sabotage operation carried out by the United States came during a time of heightened tensions between the two states and served as a response to recent aggression by the Iranian government when it downed a US drone and attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz (Council\non Foreign Relations 2021b). The response by the United States signaled its willingness to deploy cyber capabilities in response to kinetic actions.\nIn a series of attacks launched by the United States against Russia in 2018, the US Cyber Command sabotaged the Russian Internet Research Agency in an attempt to maintain the integrity of the US 2018 elections (Buchanan 2019). Although some information regarding the attack remains unknown, the operation was likely intended to prevent Russian disinformation that could have been disseminated by the Internet Research Agency (Buchanan 2019). In a separate attack directed at Russia, and mentioned in the introduction of the paper, in October 2020 the US Cyber Command sabotaged computers on the TrickBot network, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using Ryuk ransomware (Nakashima 2020). US General and Commander of the US\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nCyber Command Paul Nakasone stated that the cyber operation was carried out as “persistent engagement” with the aim of preserving the integrity of the 2020 US election by eliminating bot interference. A related goal was to thwart other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020).\nIsrael was responsible for the other sabotage attack in the category of democracies initiating sabotage attacks against nondemocracies. In May 2020 Israel conducted a cyberattack targeting Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port near the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran reported only caused damage to private systems (Joffre 2020). This attack was an attempt to sabotage port operations in response to Iran’s failed cyberattack on Israel’s water treatment and sewage facilities that had transpired less than a month prior (TOI 2020). In response to the attack, Iran stated that it was attempting to prevent future cyberattacks by developing its intranet system known as the National Information Network to limit its reliance on the international cyber community (Joffre 2020).\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS\nRegarding denial-of-service attacks when the target is a nondemocracy, the first case involves Taiwan and China. On October 23, 2007, a secret agent working for Taiwan’s military intelligence allegedly planted “Trojan” programs in the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, National Defense Research Institutes, Military Industrial Labs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all of which are part of China’s intelligence infrastructure. The motivation behind the attack was to obtain classified intelligence information (Chung 2007). The attack is considered a denial-of-service attack because it temporarily affected the cyber operations of the Chinese targets.\nAnother denial-of-service attack involves Israel and Syria. In September 2007 Israel sabotaged Syrian military capabilities by disrupting its radar and air defense systems to enable an Israeli air strike (Melman 2007). This incident led Iran to have less confidence in the Syrian air defense capabilities. Additionally, this could be considered a hybrid attack due to the cyber nature of the attack combined with kinetic jammers in a plane being used to sabotage Syria’s radar and air defense capabilities (Melman 2007).\nThe two remaining attacks in the category involve the United States and North Korea and the United States and Russia. In September 2017 the US Cyber Command targeted North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (a.k.a. North Korean Intelligence Agency) to deny service to North Korea’s cyber capabilities (Council on Foreign Relations 2017). This effort was based on directives from the US executive branch and was achieved through the United States overloading North Korea’s internet system with an abundance of traffic, resulting in the stoppage of internet access (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017). The United States used this event as a signal to pressure other states to sever ties with North Korea (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017).\nIn another attack carried out by the United States against Russia, in November 2018 the US Cyber Command sabotaged a Russian troll farm to maintain the integrity of the US midterm election by preventing the dissemination of disinformation (Kube and Dilanian 2019). The US efforts against the Russian government, and more specifically the Internet Research Agency, once again aimed to prevent disinformation by taking the troll farm offline during the day of the 2018 midterm elections and the few days following it (Chiacu and Hosenball 2019).\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe lone event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using data destruction attacks involves the United States and Iran. In late September 2019, the US government conducted cyberattacks against Iran resulting in the destruction of data and physical hardware (Ali and Stewart 2019). This attack was in response to increased tensions between the United States and Iran due to Iran’s alleged attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities a few weeks prior (Council on Foreign Relations 2021b). The goal of the attack was to prevent Tehran’s ability to spread propaganda regarding its attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThe first event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using espionage attacks involves multiple democracies initiating espionage attacks in a coordinated event. In late 2018 Five Eyes (an intelligence alliance between the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) used malware to spy on Yandex (the Russian version of Google) user accounts (Bing, Stubbs, and Menn 2019). The malware known as Regin was used by Five Eyes in a previous operation. The attack was carried out to gain technical information related to account authentication credentials that would enable access to and monitoring privileges over various Yandex user accounts and messages. The specific accounts of interest were likely key members of the Russian government and the Russian military that had personal Yandex accounts.\nThe next event involves the Netherlands and Russia. As reported in 2018, the Netherlands conducted espionage operations through the use of malware by targeting and compromising “the Dukes,” an arm of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (Poulsen 2019). This was likely done to gain a better understanding of the Dukes’ targeting methods and operations and to assist the US intelligence community in determining who was responsible for the 2016 compromise of the Democratic National Committee. Russia’s encroachment on European politics posed a potential future threat to the Netherlands, which likely led to the combined efforts with the US intelligence community to execute the attack in this instance, although direct coordination with US forces remains unconfirmed (Poulsen 2019).\nThe last event in the category involves South Korea and North Korea. As reported in March 2020, South Korea’s\nGlobal Perspectives\nDark Hotel group displayed significant resources and technical capabilities while conducting espionage operations against North Korea through the use of five zero-day exploits in 2019 (Greenberg 2020). While the identities of the specific individuals targeted were not released, it is believed that the attack was executed to gain information such as emails and documents from North Korean government officials and key professionals. The goal was likely to gather as much intelligence as possible on North Korea's military capabilities and nuclear missile program.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES\nIn considering the 13 cyberattacks launched by democracies against authoritarian states, the most common form of attack was sabotage (38 percent), followed by denial of service (31 percent), espionage (23 percent), and data destruction (8 percent). It appears that democracies are more likely to carry out attacks that result in actual damage (cyber or kinetic) when targeting nondemocratic states. Many of the attacks appear to be aimed at damaging an authoritarian state's military capabilities, retaliating for previous kinetic actions directed against a democracy or its allies, attempting to prevent interference in domestic politics by a foreign adversary, disrupting operations by potential rival states, and collecting intelligence from potential authoritarian adversaries.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SABOTAGE\nThe lone event in this category is the well-known Stuxnet attack. Stuxnet was first detected in June 2010 but may have been in operation as early as 2009 (Fildes 2010). It is believed that the United States and Israel were responsible for the classified creation of Stuxnet during an operation codenamed “Olympic Games” (Schwartz 2012). The two states are alleged to have used Stuxnet to target a variety of states including Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Taiwan (Council on Foreign Relations 2010). The most notable incident of the use of Stuxnet was against Iran to severely degrade its nuclear program without the use of ground forces or airstrikes to enhance the national security of both the United States and Israel (Fildes 2010). While the United States and Israel have not claimed responsibility for the cyberattack, strategic political motivations and technological capabilities indicate the two states are the likely sponsors of the event. Additionally, several researchers have contended that the United States and Israel were responsible for the attack (Baezner and Robin 2017; Lindsay 2013; Nakashima and Warrick 2012), making Stuxnet one of the most highly publicized cyberattacks initiated by democratic states against both democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe one event in this category involves a high-profile attack carried out by the United States and Israel directed at multiple states, both democratic and authoritarian. A malware called Flame is believed to have been in operation from August 2010 until May 2012 in multiple countries including Iran, Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Hungary, Austria, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and France (Lee 2012). The malware is extremely complex and could change the future of cyber conflict, according to some observers (Villasenor 2016). The malware is believed to have been sponsored by the United States and Israel with the intent of both destroying data and gaining intelligence. The United States has denied allegations of involvement in the attacks (Paganini 2012). The most likely motives behind the attacks were to conduct cyber operations against adversary states and to gather intelligence to gain strategic advantages against potential enemies. In addition, the likely motives for the sponsoring states in conducting the operations against other democracies were to gain access to financial accounts for persons of interest and to test their capabilities before use against adversaries to ensure that the sponsor states did not lose the element of surprise.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ESPIONAGE\nThere are a total of 10 cases that fall within the category of democracies attacking democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously using espionage attacks. Thus, due to space constraints and the large number of events, we do not include descriptions of each attack here. The descriptions can be found in the appendix. Regarding the broad overview of the attacks, some attacks involved multiple sponsor states, and the attacking democracies include the United States (4 attacks), Israel (3 attacks), the United Kingdom, France, India, Spain, and Pakistan. The motivations behind the attacks varied for each event. The motivations included the desire to obtain sensitive military and financial intelligence from specific states and obtain information on individuals of interest. Other motivations included the desire to obtain classified information to gain influence over ongoing high-stakes international negotiations. Attacks were also carried out to test specific cyber offensive capabilities to lay the groundwork for future attacks. Attacks were also executed to acquire information that would lead to cyber advantages over other states and to gain intelligence on rival states.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY\nIn considering the 12 cyberattacks launched by democracies against democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously, the most common form of attack was espionage (83 percent), followed by data destruction (8 percent) and sabotage (8 percent). Democracies appear significantly more\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nlikely to carry out espionage attacks, rather than attacks that result in direct kinetic or cyber damage, when the targets are both democratic and authoritarian states. Many of the espionage attacks were aimed at collecting intelligence for economic, military, and strategic purposes. Also, attacks appear to be deployed to test offensive cyber capabilities and to damage nondemocratic adversaries' military capabilities (in the case of Stuxnet, where the United States and Israel targeted Iran's nuclear facilities).\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThere were only two cases in which democracies attacked only other democracies. In both cases, the attack type was espionage. The first event involved Pakistan. Throughout 2020 APT 36, a hacker group from Pakistan, targeted multiple Indian officials in espionage operations including those in defense organizations through operation \"honey trap\" (Mantri 2020). This operation was a continuation of recent tensions between Pakistan and India and was used to spread misinformation regarding the coronavirus while also gaining access to Indian government servers (Threat Intelligence Team 2021; Gill 2020), impacting the Indian economy, and gaining an advantage in the realm of command and control (C2) security capabilities.\nThe other attack was initiated by Indonesia. In January 2016 a spyware program linked to the Indonesian government was found to be using a server in Sydney, Australia (Barbaschow 2016). The spyware, FinFisher, has been known to be utilized for surveillance purposes (Main and Duffy 2016). FinFisher was likely deployed by Indonesia due to previous allegations that the Australian government had intercepted communications from the Indonesian president in 2009 (Barbaschow 2016). Although the FinFisher spyware was likely used to spy on members of the Australian government, it is also probable that Indonesia was using the Australian server to obscure their spyware from other states to allow it to operate without detection for a longer period.\n# DISCUSSION\nIn examining the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies, several trends emerge. Firstly, democracies are significantly more likely to target authoritarian states in their attacks. This finding supports previous research that posits that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies. Thus, our findings support the notion that democracies target authoritarian states to a greater degree than nondemocracies. From 2005 through 2020, there were only two known cases in which democracies cyberattacked other democracies (when only democratic states were targeted). The motivations behind cyberattacks directed at democracies are often to collect governmental and economic intelligence through espionage attacks. Secondly, democracies deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states. Democracies are more likely to deploy sabotage, denial-of-service, and data destruction\nattacks when cyberattacking authoritarian states and espionage attacks when targeting other democracies. Thirdly, the motivations behind cyberattacks directed at authoritarian states are to inflict damage on the defensive capabilities of authoritarian states, prevent authoritarian states from interfering with domestic politics in democracies, collect governmental and defense intelligence, and disrupt military operations of rival, authoritarian states. These findings provide support for the literature on democratic peace and kinetic conflict extending into cyberspace. As with kinetic conflict, democracies appear to engage with other democracies less aggressively in cyberspace compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes. Thus, the conflict-inhibiting effects of shared norms, values, and institutions that frequently exist between democracies in the kinetic realm appear to extend into cyberspace when considering cyberattacks.\nKalberg (2016) posits that when applying military theories to the cyber realm, it is important to account for the anonymous nature of cyberattacks. Thus, future research should examine the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks compared with kinetic conflict. Future research should examine how the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affects the initiation of cyberattacks by democratic and authoritarian states and how anonymity in the cyber realm conditions state leaders' decisions to employ cyberattacks instead of kinetic attacks. Answering these questions could shed additional light on the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks based on regime type.\nWhile our research shows that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies and democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted states, several limitations of the study should be discussed. First, as previously mentioned, many cyberattacks are unreported, unverified, and unattributed. Thus, our analysis of democratically initiated cyberattacks captures data only on known, verified, and attributed cyberattacks. Many additional attacks likely occurred during the period that are not accounted for in publicly available data sources. Second, we have attempted to analyze and explain the motivations behind democratically initiated cyberattacks based on open-source data. Additional political, economic, and social motivations likely exist for some of the cases included in the study, and this information could be obtained from classified sources. Lastly, many of the democratically initiated cyberattacks during the period were attributed to the United States. While fourteen democratic states initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020, 55 percent of the cases involved the United States. Thus, the United States has a larger effect on the findings compared to other states.\nIn expanding upon this study, future research could include additional cyber data as it becomes available to conduct large $N$, cross-national quantitative analysis. Future research could also consider the role of nonstate actors and emerging technologies in affecting the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Additionally, future research should continue to consider how regime type affects cyber conflict and examine the nature of cyberattacks deployed by\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nauthoritarian regimes. This research could analyze whether authoritarian states launch more aggressive cyberattacks based on whether the targeted states are democratic or authoritarian. Also, future research could analyze the motivations behind cyberattacks that are deployed by authoritarian states. This research could shed additional light on how regime type and domestic institutions affect the behavior of states in cyberspace.\nIn considering the implications of the study for global security, based on the findings from this study and other cyber scholarship (Hunter et al. 2022), democracies appear more likely to cyberattack authoritarian states and authoritarian states appear more prone to cyberattack democracies. This is not to argue that cyberattacks do not occur between states with similar regime types. Rather, based on the findings from this study and others, cyberattacks are most likely to occur between democratic and authoritarian states. Therefore, in considering cyber defenses, government leaders should be mindful that impactful cyberattacks are most likely to emerge from states with regime types disparate from their own. Additionally, modern and future warfare is likely to entail a mixture of cyber, cognitive, and kinetic forms of conflict (i.e., hybrid warfare) (Danyk and Briggs 2023). Therefore, governments should configure their cyber defenses in a manner that accounts for where cyberattacks are most likely to originate from, and considering the regime type of states could assist in their threat assessments. Lastly, initiating cyberattacks can be a risky strategy at times due to the possibility of cyber or kinetic retaliation from targeted states. Also, the deployment of cyberattacks frequently results in the inability to use the specific form of offensive cyber weaponry in future operations as targeted states are often able to understand the composition of the cyberattack and successfully defend against it in future attacks (Pedersen and Jacobsen 2024). Thus, democracies should be mindful of the potential risks and rewards associated with initiating cyberattacks when conducting cost-benefit analyses regarding the decision to utilize offensive cyber operations.\n## COMPETING INTERESTS\nThe authors have no competing interests to disclose.\n## BIOGRAPHIES\nLance Y.

However, less is known regarding how democracies operate in cyberspace as it pertains to cyberaggression. Thus, this study examines the offensive strategies of democratic states that initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states from 2005 through 2020. In examining the cyberattacks initiated by democracies during this period, we aim to better understand the motives behind democratically initiated cyberattacks, the regime types that are likely to be targeted in the attacks, and the types of cyberattacks that democracies are likely to deploy. In conducting this analysis, we find that democracies rarely attack other democratic states in cyberspace and democracies are likely to deploy more aggressive and hostile attacks when targeting authoritarian regimes. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. These findings have important implications for considering how democratic institutions affect international relations and cybersecurity.\n# INTRODUCTION\nIn October 2020 the US Cyber Command launched a series of cyberattacks that sabotaged the Russian network referred to as TrickBot, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using ransomware termed Ryuk (Nakashima 2020). When questioned about the events, US General and Commander of the US Cyber Command Paul Nakasone acknowledged the United States' efforts as \"persistent engagement\" with the goal being to maintain the integrity of the 2020 US election by preventing bot interference. A secondary goal was likely to prevent other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020). In examining the 2020 TrickBot cyberattack, several questions emerge regarding why democracies carry out cyberattacks and how democratic institutions affect the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies.\nA large amount of literature in international relations has considered the factors that affect the conflict behavior of democratic states regarding traditional forms of military conflict. However, to date, minimal research has examined how democracies behave in cyberspace regarding cyber conflict. This is problematic given the important role many researchers contend that cyber conflict plays in international security (Al-Ahmad 2013; Khan 2018). Thus, we contend that it is important to examine cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies to better understand their motivations, tactics, and the regimes that are most likely to be targeted in democratically initiated attacks. Doing so could help bridge the gap between research on democracies and traditional military conflict and cyber conflict. In addition, given the important role cyberaggression is likely to play in affecting global security in the future, attempting to understand the behavior of democracies in cyberspace is a critical area for security studies.\nPrevious research has found that democracies are less likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes (Hunter et al. 2022). This scholarship has discovered that when democracies do initiate cyberattacks, they are significantly more likely to target authoritarian regimes. In addition, this research finds that democracies do cyberattack other democracies, but it is rare. However, two questions that are not addressed in the research are (1) if democracies initiate cyberattacks to a lesser degree than authoritarian states, what are the motivating factors behind the attacks; and (2) what type of cyberattacks are democracies likely to deploy against other states based on the regime type of the targeted states? In answering these questions, we analyze data from the Coun\na Corresponding author: lahunter@augusta.edu\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\ncil on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a) and conduct case study analyses of all known democratically initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020. We incorporate literature from the democratic peace theory and research on regime type and kinetic conflict in attempting to explain why democracies carry out cyberattacks and to understand the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies. We contend that democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted state. Democracies often deploy more aggressive and hostile cyberattacks against authoritarian regimes compared with cyberattacks that are carried out against other democracies. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. More specifically, we argue that shared democratic norms, institutions, and values between democracies lead democracies to be more likely to target authoritarian states in cyberattacks and to deploy more aggressive cyberattacks against authoritarian states compared with democracies. Overall, this study seeks to expand our understanding of democratic states' behavior in cyberspace by examining the motivating factors behind democratically initiated cyberattacks and the types of cyberattacks democracies deploy based on the regime type of targeted states.\nThe layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows. First, we discuss the definitions of the main cyber terms used in the paper. Next, we examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyber conflict. We then analyze previous scholarship regarding how regime type affects traditional forms of military conflict and cyber conflict. Next, we examine data from the CFR-COTD (CFR 2021a) and conduct case study analyses in which we analyze the motivations, strategies, and targets of cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states by examining the full universe of known and verified cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. Lastly, we discuss our findings and implications for international security.\n# CYBER DEFINITIONS\nTo properly examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we need to define key cyber terms discussed in the study. The first term is \"cyber.\" Cyber refers to a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers\" (NIST 2024). The next term is \"cyber warfare/conflict.\" We use both \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" because some scholarship utilizes the term \"cyber warfare\" and other research uses the term \"cyber conflict\" when discussing the same type of cyber aggression. While the focus of this paper is on cyberattacks, it is important to define \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" as the terms are referenced in the paper concerning previous scholarship on cyber. \"Cyber warfare/cyber conflict\" is defined as \"the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's computers or information networks through,\nfor example, computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks\" (RAND 2024). The last term we define is \"cyberattack.\" The US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 2024) provides two definitions of \"cyberattack.\" The first is \"Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.\" The second is \"An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise's use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.\" The US Federal Emergency Management Agency defines \"cyberattack\" as \"malicious attempts to access or damage a computer system\" (FEMA 2024). The National Cyber Security Centre in the United Kingdom defines a cyberattack as malicious attempts to damage, disrupt or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks or devices, via cyber means (NCCC 2021). We define a cyberattack based on the criteria set forward in the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) in which a nation-state carries out a cyber operation against another nation-state in the form of denial of service, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, or doxing (CFR 2021a). We do not argue that this definition is superior to others. Rather, we contend that it is appropriate based on the aim and scope of the study. We expand on the definition and operationalization of the term \"cyberattack\" in the research design section of the paper. We now turn to examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyberattacks.\n# FACTORS AFFECTING THE INITIATION OF CYBERATTACKS\nMany scholars view cyberattacks as an extension of or an alternative to kinetic conflict (Borghard and Lonergan 2019, 122; Hjortdal 2011, 1). The reasons states deploy cyberattacks as opposed to kinetic attacks vary depending on the state. One perspective for why states initiate cyberattacks is that some states may not possess the power to compete with other states from a kinetic, military standpoint. Some scholars and military leaders consider cyberattacks to be an equalizer between states in some instances because less powerful states may be able to initiate cyberattacks while they lack the capabilities to launch successful kinetic attacks. Based on this perspective, weaker states may choose to deploy cyberattacks against more powerful adversaries. However, this theory has yet to be supported by empirical studies. Research on how power asymmetries affect cyberattacks is limited. One study that examines the effect state power has on cyber conflict finds that more powerful states (measured in terms of economic and military power) are more likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with less powerful states (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). The authors find that on average states that initiate cyberattacks have twice the amount of power compared with the states that are targeted in cyberattacks. Additional studies have found that factors such as international trade (Akoto 2021), previous episodes of kinetic conflict (Osawa\nGlobal Perspectives\n2017), and whether states are rivals (Valeriano and Maness 2014) can influence the likelihood of cyberattacks.\nValeriano (2018) contends that cyberattacks are a form of covert coercion that normally seeks to send ambiguous signals or resolve to rival states. Valeriano finds that cyberattacks tend to transpire in coordination with traditional political activities (such as economic coercion or military threats or provocation) and they usually fail to produce political concessions from the targeted states (2018). Another reason states may deploy cyberattacks is possible anonymity, which enables users to remain undetected in many cases (2015, 19). Thus, even if hostile cyber action is detected, it can be difficult to accurately identify the state that is responsible for the attack. Additionally, cyberattacks can serve a variety of purposes. Cyberattacks can be used for espionage purposes to gain valuable information to aid an aggressor's future operations. Cyberattacks can also be employed to sabotage and destroy targets within the victim state and limit the victim states' capabilities (both cyber and kinetic). Thus, cyberattacks may serve as both enhancers and alternatives to kinetic conflict and can be used for multiple purposes.\nHaving the factors associated with the initiation of cyberattacks in previous scholarship, we now turn to examining how regime type affects the nature, target, and motivation of democratically initiated cyberattacks. Within this discussion, we consider previous research on how regime type affects the conflict behavior of democracies in the kinetic realm and what implications this scholarship has for democracies and the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Thus, we seek to understand how regime type affects the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies.\n## REGIME TYPE AND THE NATURE OF CYBERATTACKS INITIATED BY DEMOCRACIES\nA few important works examine the strategic use of cyber operations by democratic states (Goldman and Warner 2020; Kallberg 2016). Kallberg (2016) highlights the challenges in applying traditional military theory to cyber conflict. Kallberg contends that a theory of cyber conflict should address unique aspects of cyber that include anonymity, object permanence, measurable results, and rapid execution. More specifically, how does the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affect their usage compared with kinetic conflict in which most kinetic attacks are not anonymous? Relatedly, Goldman and Warner (2020) posit that democracies' interests (such as those of the United States) are often at risk due to continuous low-level cyber operations deployed by adversarial states. Over time, these operations can weaken the economic, political, and military power of democratic states. To address the threats, they contend that democracies should pursue an “integrated cybersecurity strategy” that combines national power and military cyber operations and focuses on deterrence, persistence (constant cyber operations that dismantle adversarial cyber activities), and anticipatory resilience (learning from past cyber operations, hardening cyber systems, preparing for future attacks, and limiting the impact of cyberattacks). Solar (2020) examines how emerging democracies in Latin America are approaching cyber threats, the role of the military in providing cyber security, and the implications for democratic governance. Solar finds that militaries in many emerging democracies are taking the lead in controlling cyberinfrastructure for cyber security purposes. Solar contends that this could be problematic in some instances if military involvement in cyber security undermines democratic governance by threatening a secure and open internet. Solar argues that emerging democracies should advance a balanced approach that includes military involvement in cybersecurity along with interactive policy communities with multiple stakeholders (including the defense sector) to review and manage cybersecurity policies. Solar contends that civil oversight of cybersecurity infrastructure is important to protect democratic values and principles (Solar 2020).\nIn trying to understand the behavior of democratic states regarding the initiation of cyberattacks, it is important to discuss multiple perspectives on how regime type can possibly impact cyberattacks. One potential perspective is that democracies could be more prone to launch cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes because cyberattacks could be an alternative to kinetic conflict. One of the rationales for this position is that many cyberattacks are anonymous and attribution is often difficult (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018). According to Tsagourias (2012), multiple characteristics of cyberattacks make attribution difficult. Rid and Buchanon contend that attribution should be viewed as an art and not an exact science because it is a complex, political, and multilayered process (2015). They posit that effective attribution is dependent upon resources, time, and the sophistication of the attacker. Additionally, states are more likely to devote significant resources to attribution when cyberattacks are more severe. Thus, attribution should be viewed as a gradual process, and nation-states should be considered the most capable actors to accurately attribute cyberattacks due to their significant resources. Also, according to Rid and Buchanon, states with greater technological sophistication and human talent should be able to initiate cyberattacks more easily and covertly and attribute cyberattacks more effectively while responding to cyberattacks from adversaries (2015). Therefore, from this perspective, in many instances, initiating a cyberattack could be a less risky tactic than kinetic conflict due to the difficulty in attributing attacks, and democratic states could perceive cyberattacks as a more appropriate strategy than kinetic operations. In addition, some scholars contend that cyberattacks can be executed with reduced costs and lower risks than kinetic conflict due to the lack of need for combat personnel and based on the previously discussed difficulty in attributing cyberattacks (Tsagourias 2012).\nAnother perspective is that democracies should be less likely to initiate cyberattacks not based on the pacifying effects of democratic institutions but according to the notion that democracies are likely to be wealthier than nondemocracies (on average) and have greater technological capacity and dependency (compared with authoritarian states),\nand states with greater technological dependency should be more conservative regarding the initiation of offensive cyber operations (McConnell 2009). However, an alternate perspective is that states with greater wealth and resources are more likely to initiate cyberattacks, based on previous research, which finds that more powerful states are more prone to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). Additionally, other scholars contend that states with greater technological connectivity are more capable regarding cyber offense and defense as it becomes easier for these states to initiate covert cyberattacks and attribute cyberattacks to adversaries (Rid and Buchanan 2015). As Rid and Buchanon remark: “A third common assumption is that the most industrialized and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage. Attribution again reverses this logic: the larger a government's technical prowess, and the larger the pool of talent and skills at its disposal, the higher will be that state's ability to hide its own covert operations, uncover others, and respond accordingly” (2015, 31).\nLastly, a separate perspective is that the conflict-reducing effects of democratic institutions extend not only to kinetic conflict but to cyberattacks as well. This line of reasoning posits that democracies may be more peaceful in cyberspace compared with authoritarian regimes due to the presence of democratic norms, democratic institutions, and democracies' involvement in international institutions. Previous research provides some support for this position in that democracies are found to be less likely to initiate cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes when controlling for several political and economic factors (Hunter et al. 2022). Thus, there is evidence that regime type affects the conflict propensity of states regarding cyber behavior and democracies are less likely to deploy cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes. In addition, this scholarship has found that democracies rarely attack one another in the cyber realm. However, if democracies are less likely to initiate cyberattacks and are less prone to cyberattack other democracies, what motivates democracies to initiate cyberattacks? More specifically, what are the motivations for cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states?\nResearch on the behavior of democracies regarding kinetic conflict finds that democracies do not initiate wars with one another (often referred to as the dyadic democratic peace), although there are many instances of democracies warring with authoritarian regimes (Russett 1993). While this is one of the strongest empirical findings in international relations (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003), researchers debate the rationale for the findings, and some scholars refute the claim that democracies are less likely to war with one another (Barkawi and Laffey 1999; Rosato 2003). In responding to the claims that democratic peace findings are questionable, Imai and Lo (2021) test the democratic peace theory in a cross-national analysis and “show that overturning the negative association between democracy and conflict would require a confounder that is forty-seven times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in other dyads. To put this number in context, the relationship between democracy and peace is at least five times as robust as that between smoking and lung cancer. To explain away the democratic peace, therefore, scholars would have to find far more powerful confounders than those already identified in the literature” (901). In addition, while many scholars contend that democracies rarely or have never gone to war with one another, democracies have engaged in minor conflicts and disputes (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021). Thus, previous scholarship finds that democracies have engaged in lower-level disputes with one another, although rarely have the disputes escalated to war (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021; Mousseau 1997, 1998). One potential explanation for this finding is that when democracies interact with one another, they are more likely to resort to diplomacy due to shared institutions, norms, and values (Anderson and Souva 2010; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; and Rey and Barkdull 2005). A large amount of literature is devoted to explaining the reasons for these findings, and the explanations vary but include the design of democratic institutions, shared norms and values, and democracies' membership and involvement in international institutions. While this research is voluminous, one clear takeaway is that democracies interact with authoritarian and democratic states in significantly different ways, and democracies are more likely to engage with other democracies more peacefully compared with their interactions with non-democracies.\nWhile previous research has demonstrated that democracies are less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks (Hunter et al. 2022), research to date has not examined the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies. If we extend the literature on how democracies interact with other democracies and authoritarian regimes in the kinetic realm to cyberspace, the logical extension is that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies, and in the event of a cyberattack, the cyberattacks directed against other democracies should be less aggressive and hostile (i.e. overtly conflictual and potentially damaging) compared with the cyberattacks launched against authoritarian states. The rationale is that democracies are more likely to resort to compromise and diplomacy when interacting with other democracies compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes (Mousseau 1997, 1998). More specifically, democracies should view other democracies as more friendly and less hostile due to shared values, institutions, and norms, and when issues or disagreements emerge between democracies, they should be more likely to resolve the issues diplomatically rather than through acts of cyberaggression. Therefore, in extending the research on democratic state behavior regarding kinetic conflict to the cyber realm, democracies should pursue more aggressive strategies when interacting with authoritarian regimes and less aggressive strategies when engaging other democracies. Thus, based on our previous discussions, we argue that democracies should be less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks. This leads us to our first proposition.\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nProposition 1: When democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks, democracies should be less likely to target democracies and more likely to target authoritarian states.\nThere are many different forms of cyberattacks. The Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a) disaggregates cyberattacks according to the following types: sabotage, denial of service, data destruction, and espionage. While the amount of damage and intensity of each attack type can vary by attack, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are usually viewed as more aggressive hostile acts compared with cyberattacks that involve only espionage (Schmitt 2012). The reason is that cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, or data destruction often produce actual and immediate damage (kinetic and/or cyber) and are more likely to be reported and discovered by the media and citizens within states. Thus, these cyber actions are often viewed as more hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks. However, we do not argue that espionage attacks are insignificant actions. Cyberespionage attacks are regarded as serious forms of cyberattacks by many researchers because vital information can be gained through acts of cyberespionage that can produce significant real-world effects and implications for national security (Deoliveira 2019). Additionally, espionage attacks can be deployed to gain valuable information on adversary states that can be later used in kinetic attacks or additional cyberattacks (ENISA 2020). However, in the aggregate, while espionage attacks clearly qualify as cyberattacks, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are frequently viewed as more aggressive and hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks.\nIn extending the literature on kinetic conflict to cyberspace, we argue that when democracies initiate cyberattacks, they should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states compared with instances in which they target other democracies. The rationale for this argument is based on research on kinetic conflict that finds that when disagreements occur between democracies, they are less likely to escalate to higher levels of intensity due to shared norms, values, and institutions (Anderson and Souva 2010; Imai and Lo 2021; Huth and Allee 2003; Reiter and Tillman 2002; Rey and Barkdull 2005). This stands in contrast to episodes when democracies have disputes with authoritarian regimes, in which there is a greater likelihood of hostile engagement due to\nthe lack of shared norms, values, and institutions. Thus, based on the discussion, our second proposition is:\nProposition 2: Democracies should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks (i.e., sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service) when targeting authoritarian regimes and less hostile cyberattacks (i.e., cyberespionage) when targeting other democratic states.\n# RESEARCH DESIGN\nTo examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we collected data on cyberattacks that were initiated by democracies against other states from 2005 through 2020. The cases included in the study are those in which democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states during the period and attribution for the attack is verified. Thus, every verifiable instance of a democracy initiating a known state-sponsored cyberattack against another state or states during the period is included in the study (as defined and operationalized by the Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a)). We do not analyze cyberattacks executed by nonstate actors. The reason is that we aim to analyze the motives, rationale, and targets of democratically initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks, and examining nonstate hacking/criminal/terrorist groups would not produce relevant information for the purposes of our study. The data on cyberattacks are collected from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (CFR 2021a). The Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) provides data on known state-sponsored cyberattacks that transpired during this period in which the initiator and the target are nation-states or are directly affiliated with a nation-state. The state-sponsored cyberattacks that are included in the dataset are events where threat actors commit denial-of-service attacks, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, and doxing (CFR 2021a). The reasoning for the dataset's focus on state-sponsored attacks is as follows: \"The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests. Furthermore, state-sponsored incidents generally have the most accurate and comprehensive reporting. Reporting on nonstate actors, such as hacktivist groups, tends to be murkier and makes for less reliable data\" (CFR 2021a). The CFR data are collected based on several open-source outlets that include but are not limited to\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 1. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks and Target Type\n|  Target Type | Frequency | Percentage  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 13 | 48%  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 12 | 44%  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 2 | 7%  |\ngovernment press documents, cybersecurity corporations, existing repositories, and media reports and publications concerning state-sponsored attacks (CFR 2021a).\nIn discussing cyber data, several limitations should be acknowledged. One limitation regarding the data, which is relevant to all cyber conflict datasets, is that not every cyberattack that transpired during the period is included because of limited information pertaining to some of these cyberattacks. More specifically, some cyberattacks are not reported, and many cyberattacks remain anonymous due to difficulty in accurately attributing attacks and the purposeful effort by some states to mask their cyber activity. Second, the CFR relies on publicly available data. As the CFR stipulates, \"State intelligence agencies and private cybersecurity firms are likely to have the most complete data about state-sponsored actors, but may not make what they know public to protect national security or trade secrets\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, the cyber events that are included in the CFR (COTD) are verified incidents where information is known and verified regarding the states that carried out the attacks and the states that were victims of the attacks based on open-source data.\nWe utilize the four categorizations from the COTD regarding the attack type. The four categories are espionage, sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service. The four categories are examined because these are the four cyberattack types utilized by the COTD (CFR 2021a). Additionally, previous cyber research has discussed and analyzed these attack types (Banks 2017; CISA 2019; Maurer and Morgus 2014), and they are considered standard attack types in the cyber literature. Denial-of-service attacks prevent appropriate users from accessing information systems, devices, and network resources due to a malicious cyber actor (CISA 2019). Attackers can target a variety of resources and can deny service in different ways. Ultimately, denial-of-service attacks overwhelm the computer network by sending more data than it is capable of processing, resulting in a temporary paralysis of the computer network (CFR 2021a). Cyber sabotage is an attack carried out against the integrity of an IT system (Maurer and Morgus 2014, 58). This attack \"causes a disruption to a physical process\" (CFR 2021a). Data destruction is the process of destroying data on electronic or physical mediums (Ministry of Justice 2021). In some cases, this is done intentionally for security purposes. Cyber data destruction results in a computer or computer networks becoming unusable due to the use of malicious software (CFR 2021a). Cyberespionage refers to a state covertly collecting information for intelligence purposes (Australian Cyber Security Center 2021). More specifically, cyberespionage involves penetration of computer systems or networks to obtain information on or going\nthrough these systems, without the information holder's consent (Banks 2017, 513; CFR 2021a). In addition to analyzing the attack types of democratically initiated cyberattacks, we also examine the sectors targeted within victim states based on the COTD's classification as follows: government, private sector, civil society, and the military.\n## FINDINGS\nIn total, there were 27 cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. The overall breakdown of the 27 attacks that were initiated by democracies between 2005 and 2020 is as follows and is presented in table 1. There were 13 cases (48 percent) where democracies attacked only authoritarian states. There were 12 cases (44 percent) where democracies attacked both democracies and authoritarian states simultaneously. There were 2 cases (7 percent) in which democracies attacked only other democracies. Thus, in examining these statistics, we see that when democracies launch cyberattacks, they are likely to target authoritarian regimes specifically, or a combination of democratic and authoritarian regimes in simultaneous attacks. Also, democracies do occasionally target democracies (where an authoritarian regime is not attacked simultaneously), but it is rare. In 7 percent of cases does a democracy attack only another democracy. Thus, the primary targets for democracies appear to be either solely authoritarian states or a simultaneous combination of authoritarian and democratic states. This finding provides support for proposition 1, which stipulates that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies.\nTable 2 displays the specific sector targeted in a cyberattack based on the regime type that is targeted. In respect to the attack type based on the sector that is targeted when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 6 government, 3 private, 1 civil society, and 3 military. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 7 government, 1 private, 0 civil society, and 4 military. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 0 government, 0 private, 1 civil society, and 1 military. Thus, in examining table 2, we find that government sectors are more likely to be targeted in attacks when only authoritarian states are targeted and in attacks where both authoritarian and democratic states are targeted simultaneously. Civil society and military sectors are most frequently targeted when only democratic regimes are the victims of democratically initiated cyberattacks.\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 2. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks, Target Type, and Targeted Sectors\n|  Target Type | Government | Private | Civil Society | Military  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 6 | 3 | 1 | 3  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 7 | 1 | 0 | 4  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1  |\nTable 3.

In respect to the attack type when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 3 espionage, 5 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and 4 denial-of-service attacks. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 10 espionage, 1 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and no denial-of-service attacks. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 2 espionage, and no attacks regarding sabotage, data destruction, and denial-of-service attacks.\nIn examining the results in table 3, we find that a few patterns emerge. First, democracies are more likely to commit acts of sabotage when only authoritarian states are targeted versus attacks that include both democratic and authoritarian states or solely democratic states. One hundred percent of the sabotage attacks committed by democracies were committed against only authoritarian states. Second, denial-of-service attacks are more likely to be committed against only authoritarian states. Democracies did not initiate any denial-of-service attacks in attacks that included simultaneous attacks against democracies and authoritarian states. Also, democracies did not deploy any denial-of-service attacks against only democratic states. Once again, one hundred percent of denial-of-service attacks were deployed against only authoritarian states. Regarding data destruction, democracies were equally likely to initiate data destruction attacks against authoritarian states and in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously. Lastly, democracies were more likely to deploy espionage attacks in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously, and 100 percent of the attacks directed against only democratic states were acts of cyberespionage.\nWhen we interpret the results in table 3, it appears that democracies initiate more aggressive and hostile attacks against authoritarian states compared with democratic targets, which provides support for proposition 2. This is not to argue that espionage cannot be destructive. Espionage\nattacks can be costly because they may provide valuable information to a potential adversary that can damage a victim state. However, the types of attacks launched against authoritarian states are more overtly aggressive and hostile because sabotage and denial-of-service attacks often produce significant and immediate damage against a victim state. In addition, these attacks are often immediately known, whereas espionage attacks may be undetected for some time. Thus, the finding that a larger number of sabotage and denial-of-service attacks are initiated against nondemocracies indicates that democracies are more aggressive in deploying their offensive cyber weaponry against authoritarian states compared with when they target other democracies.\nTable 4 displays data regarding whether cyberattacks included in the analysis are carried out in retaliation to a kinetic attack or a cyberattack. Thus, the variable relation refers to whether the cyberattack occurred in response to a kinetic or a cyber hostility that originated from the targeted state. General Retaliation refers to retaliation for a kinetic or cyber hostility originating from the targeted state. Thus, both kinetic and cyber actions are included in the category General Retaliation. Kinetic Retaliation refers to retaliation due to a kinetic hostility committed by the targeted state. Lastly, Cyber Retaliation refers to retaliation for a cyber hostility committed by the targeted state. In examining table 4, we find that the only acts of General Retaliation occurred when democracies attacked only nondemocracies. Out of the 3 total retaliation attacks, 2 were in response to kinetic actions and 1 was in response to a previous cyberattack. When retaliation attacks are initiated by democracies, they are directed at specific authoritarian states. There are no cases of democracies retaliating against other democracies.\nTable 5 displays the number of cyberattacks, and the number of cyberattacks by attack type, initiated by the democratic states included in the analysis. In reviewing table 5, it is important to note that many cyber events involved multiple initiator states. Six of the 26 cases (23 percent) involved multiple initiator states. In examining table 5, we\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 4.

The remaining democratic states in the analysis initiated 1 cyberattack. The findings regarding the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom and the number of cyberattacks deployed reinforce previous scholarship, which finds that more powerful states are more likely to initiate cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). In the next section, we explore the motives, circumstances, and tactics behind these attacks to better understand why democracies may initiate certain types of cyberattacks against authoritarian states versus democracies.\n# CASE STUDY ANALYSIS\nTo more fully understand the nature of state-sponsored cyberattacks initiated by democracies, we analyze qualitative case information pertaining to each cyberattack in respect to the potential motives and tactics associated with the attacks. We utilize publicly available data to obtain this information. In addition, more information is known regarding some events compared with others, and in some cases, there is limited data on the motives and tactics of the attack. As the CFR-COTD states: \"Furthermore, some reporting from the media or cybersecurity companies can be vague or incomplete, making it difficult to confirm incidents for which data is only available from a single source\" (CFR 2021a). Thus, we attempt to provide descriptions of\nthe motives, tactics, and state actors involved in each democratically initiated cyberattack while acknowledging that limited publicly available information and sources exist for some cases. The full list of cases and the key aspects of each case including the cyberattack name, the initiator(s) of the attack, the target(s) of the attack, the type of attack, and the suspected motivation for each attack can be found in table 6. Additionally, given the space constraints of the paper, a more detailed description of each case can be found in the appendix.\nBefore proceeding to the case study analysis, one important point is that additional economic, social, and political motives outside our analysis may have impacted the democratically initiated cyberattacks that are included in the study. Given that 27 cases (cyber events) are discussed in the study, the limited sources for some cases, and the space constraints of the paper, additional possible motives cannot be fully explored for each case. Thus, it is important to note that additional economic, social, and political motives and explanations may exist for each case.\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND SABOTAGE\nIn considering cyberattacks initiated by democracies against only authoritarian states in which the attack type was sabotage, many of the attacks were carried out by the United States. In April 2017, the United States is believed to have sabotaged North Korea's nuclear program by sabotag-\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 6.

The United States' efforts are believed to have been motivated by an attempt to prevent the North Korean military from expanding its missile technology systems to protect South Korea and to maximize security on the Korean Peninsula.\nAnother attack in this category that was executed by the United States that targeted an authoritarian state's missile systems occurred in June 2019 when the US Cyber Command hacked Iranian rocket and missile launch systems in what Iran deemed an unsuccessful effort to disable the systems. This sabotage operation carried out by the United States came during a time of heightened tensions between the two states and served as a response to recent aggression by the Iranian government when it downed a US drone and attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz (Council\non Foreign Relations 2021b). The response by the United States signaled its willingness to deploy cyber capabilities in response to kinetic actions.\nIn a series of attacks launched by the United States against Russia in 2018, the US Cyber Command sabotaged the Russian Internet Research Agency in an attempt to maintain the integrity of the US 2018 elections (Buchanan 2019). Although some information regarding the attack remains unknown, the operation was likely intended to prevent Russian disinformation that could have been disseminated by the Internet Research Agency (Buchanan 2019). In a separate attack directed at Russia, and mentioned in the introduction of the paper, in October 2020 the US Cyber Command sabotaged computers on the TrickBot network, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using Ryuk ransomware (Nakashima 2020). US General and Commander of the US\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nCyber Command Paul Nakasone stated that the cyber operation was carried out as “persistent engagement” with the aim of preserving the integrity of the 2020 US election by eliminating bot interference. A related goal was to thwart other ransomware attacks on US government entities (Nakashima 2020).\nIsrael was responsible for the other sabotage attack in the category of democracies initiating sabotage attacks against nondemocracies. In May 2020 Israel conducted a cyberattack targeting Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port near the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran reported only caused damage to private systems (Joffre 2020). This attack was an attempt to sabotage port operations in response to Iran’s failed cyberattack on Israel’s water treatment and sewage facilities that had transpired less than a month prior (TOI 2020). In response to the attack, Iran stated that it was attempting to prevent future cyberattacks by developing its intranet system known as the National Information Network to limit its reliance on the international cyber community (Joffre 2020).\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS\nRegarding denial-of-service attacks when the target is a nondemocracy, the first case involves Taiwan and China. On October 23, 2007, a secret agent working for Taiwan’s military intelligence allegedly planted “Trojan” programs in the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, National Defense Research Institutes, Military Industrial Labs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all of which are part of China’s intelligence infrastructure. The motivation behind the attack was to obtain classified intelligence information (Chung 2007). The attack is considered a denial-of-service attack because it temporarily affected the cyber operations of the Chinese targets.\nAnother denial-of-service attack involves Israel and Syria. In September 2007 Israel sabotaged Syrian military capabilities by disrupting its radar and air defense systems to enable an Israeli air strike (Melman 2007). This incident led Iran to have less confidence in the Syrian air defense capabilities. Additionally, this could be considered a hybrid attack due to the cyber nature of the attack combined with kinetic jammers in a plane being used to sabotage Syria’s radar and air defense capabilities (Melman 2007).\nThe two remaining attacks in the category involve the United States and North Korea and the United States and Russia. In September 2017 the US Cyber Command targeted North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (a.k.a. North Korean Intelligence Agency) to deny service to North Korea’s cyber capabilities (Council on Foreign Relations 2017). This effort was based on directives from the US executive branch and was achieved through the United States overloading North Korea’s internet system with an abundance of traffic, resulting in the stoppage of internet access (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017). The United States used this event as a signal to pressure other states to sever ties with North Korea (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017).\nIn another attack carried out by the United States against Russia, in November 2018 the US Cyber Command sabotaged a Russian troll farm to maintain the integrity of the US midterm election by preventing the dissemination of disinformation (Kube and Dilanian 2019). The US efforts against the Russian government, and more specifically the Internet Research Agency, once again aimed to prevent disinformation by taking the troll farm offline during the day of the 2018 midterm elections and the few days following it (Chiacu and Hosenball 2019).\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe lone event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using data destruction attacks involves the United States and Iran. In late September 2019, the US government conducted cyberattacks against Iran resulting in the destruction of data and physical hardware (Ali and Stewart 2019). This attack was in response to increased tensions between the United States and Iran due to Iran’s alleged attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities a few weeks prior (Council on Foreign Relations 2021b). The goal of the attack was to prevent Tehran’s ability to spread propaganda regarding its attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThe first event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using espionage attacks involves multiple democracies initiating espionage attacks in a coordinated event. In late 2018 Five Eyes (an intelligence alliance between the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) used malware to spy on Yandex (the Russian version of Google) user accounts (Bing, Stubbs, and Menn 2019). The malware known as Regin was used by Five Eyes in a previous operation. The attack was carried out to gain technical information related to account authentication credentials that would enable access to and monitoring privileges over various Yandex user accounts and messages. The specific accounts of interest were likely key members of the Russian government and the Russian military that had personal Yandex accounts.\nThe next event involves the Netherlands and Russia. As reported in 2018, the Netherlands conducted espionage operations through the use of malware by targeting and compromising “the Dukes,” an arm of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (Poulsen 2019). This was likely done to gain a better understanding of the Dukes’ targeting methods and operations and to assist the US intelligence community in determining who was responsible for the 2016 compromise of the Democratic National Committee. Russia’s encroachment on European politics posed a potential future threat to the Netherlands, which likely led to the combined efforts with the US intelligence community to execute the attack in this instance, although direct coordination with US forces remains unconfirmed (Poulsen 2019).\nThe last event in the category involves South Korea and North Korea. As reported in March 2020, South Korea’s\nGlobal Perspectives\nDark Hotel group displayed significant resources and technical capabilities while conducting espionage operations against North Korea through the use of five zero-day exploits in 2019 (Greenberg 2020). While the identities of the specific individuals targeted were not released, it is believed that the attack was executed to gain information such as emails and documents from North Korean government officials and key professionals. The goal was likely to gather as much intelligence as possible on North Korea's military capabilities and nuclear missile program.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES\nIn considering the 13 cyberattacks launched by democracies against authoritarian states, the most common form of attack was sabotage (38 percent), followed by denial of service (31 percent), espionage (23 percent), and data destruction (8 percent). It appears that democracies are more likely to carry out attacks that result in actual damage (cyber or kinetic) when targeting nondemocratic states. Many of the attacks appear to be aimed at damaging an authoritarian state's military capabilities, retaliating for previous kinetic actions directed against a democracy or its allies, attempting to prevent interference in domestic politics by a foreign adversary, disrupting operations by potential rival states, and collecting intelligence from potential authoritarian adversaries.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SABOTAGE\nThe lone event in this category is the well-known Stuxnet attack. Stuxnet was first detected in June 2010 but may have been in operation as early as 2009 (Fildes 2010). It is believed that the United States and Israel were responsible for the classified creation of Stuxnet during an operation codenamed “Olympic Games” (Schwartz 2012). The two states are alleged to have used Stuxnet to target a variety of states including Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Taiwan (Council on Foreign Relations 2010). The most notable incident of the use of Stuxnet was against Iran to severely degrade its nuclear program without the use of ground forces or airstrikes to enhance the national security of both the United States and Israel (Fildes 2010). While the United States and Israel have not claimed responsibility for the cyberattack, strategic political motivations and technological capabilities indicate the two states are the likely sponsors of the event. Additionally, several researchers have contended that the United States and Israel were responsible for the attack (Baezner and Robin 2017; Lindsay 2013; Nakashima and Warrick 2012), making Stuxnet one of the most highly publicized cyberattacks initiated by democratic states against both democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe one event in this category involves a high-profile attack carried out by the United States and Israel directed at multiple states, both democratic and authoritarian. A malware called Flame is believed to have been in operation from August 2010 until May 2012 in multiple countries including Iran, Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Hungary, Austria, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and France (Lee 2012). The malware is extremely complex and could change the future of cyber conflict, according to some observers (Villasenor 2016). The malware is believed to have been sponsored by the United States and Israel with the intent of both destroying data and gaining intelligence. The United States has denied allegations of involvement in the attacks (Paganini 2012). The most likely motives behind the attacks were to conduct cyber operations against adversary states and to gather intelligence to gain strategic advantages against potential enemies. In addition, the likely motives for the sponsoring states in conducting the operations against other democracies were to gain access to financial accounts for persons of interest and to test their capabilities before use against adversaries to ensure that the sponsor states did not lose the element of surprise.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ESPIONAGE\nThere are a total of 10 cases that fall within the category of democracies attacking democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously using espionage attacks. Thus, due to space constraints and the large number of events, we do not include descriptions of each attack here. The descriptions can be found in the appendix. Regarding the broad overview of the attacks, some attacks involved multiple sponsor states, and the attacking democracies include the United States (4 attacks), Israel (3 attacks), the United Kingdom, France, India, Spain, and Pakistan. The motivations behind the attacks varied for each event. The motivations included the desire to obtain sensitive military and financial intelligence from specific states and obtain information on individuals of interest. Other motivations included the desire to obtain classified information to gain influence over ongoing high-stakes international negotiations. Attacks were also carried out to test specific cyber offensive capabilities to lay the groundwork for future attacks. Attacks were also executed to acquire information that would lead to cyber advantages over other states and to gain intelligence on rival states.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY\nIn considering the 12 cyberattacks launched by democracies against democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously, the most common form of attack was espionage (83 percent), followed by data destruction (8 percent) and sabotage (8 percent). Democracies appear significantly more\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nlikely to carry out espionage attacks, rather than attacks that result in direct kinetic or cyber damage, when the targets are both democratic and authoritarian states. Many of the espionage attacks were aimed at collecting intelligence for economic, military, and strategic purposes. Also, attacks appear to be deployed to test offensive cyber capabilities and to damage nondemocratic adversaries' military capabilities (in the case of Stuxnet, where the United States and Israel targeted Iran's nuclear facilities).\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThere were only two cases in which democracies attacked only other democracies. In both cases, the attack type was espionage. The first event involved Pakistan. Throughout 2020 APT 36, a hacker group from Pakistan, targeted multiple Indian officials in espionage operations including those in defense organizations through operation \"honey trap\" (Mantri 2020). This operation was a continuation of recent tensions between Pakistan and India and was used to spread misinformation regarding the coronavirus while also gaining access to Indian government servers (Threat Intelligence Team 2021; Gill 2020), impacting the Indian economy, and gaining an advantage in the realm of command and control (C2) security capabilities.\nThe other attack was initiated by Indonesia. In January 2016 a spyware program linked to the Indonesian government was found to be using a server in Sydney, Australia (Barbaschow 2016). The spyware, FinFisher, has been known to be utilized for surveillance purposes (Main and Duffy 2016). FinFisher was likely deployed by Indonesia due to previous allegations that the Australian government had intercepted communications from the Indonesian president in 2009 (Barbaschow 2016). Although the FinFisher spyware was likely used to spy on members of the Australian government, it is also probable that Indonesia was using the Australian server to obscure their spyware from other states to allow it to operate without detection for a longer period.\n# DISCUSSION\nIn examining the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies, several trends emerge. Firstly, democracies are significantly more likely to target authoritarian states in their attacks. This finding supports previous research that posits that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies. Thus, our findings support the notion that democracies target authoritarian states to a greater degree than nondemocracies. From 2005 through 2020, there were only two known cases in which democracies cyberattacked other democracies (when only democratic states were targeted). The motivations behind cyberattacks directed at democracies are often to collect governmental and economic intelligence through espionage attacks. Secondly, democracies deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states. Democracies are more likely to deploy sabotage, denial-of-service, and data destruction\nattacks when cyberattacking authoritarian states and espionage attacks when targeting other democracies. Thirdly, the motivations behind cyberattacks directed at authoritarian states are to inflict damage on the defensive capabilities of authoritarian states, prevent authoritarian states from interfering with domestic politics in democracies, collect governmental and defense intelligence, and disrupt military operations of rival, authoritarian states. These findings provide support for the literature on democratic peace and kinetic conflict extending into cyberspace. As with kinetic conflict, democracies appear to engage with other democracies less aggressively in cyberspace compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes. Thus, the conflict-inhibiting effects of shared norms, values, and institutions that frequently exist between democracies in the kinetic realm appear to extend into cyberspace when considering cyberattacks.\nKalberg (2016) posits that when applying military theories to the cyber realm, it is important to account for the anonymous nature of cyberattacks. Thus, future research should examine the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks compared with kinetic conflict. Future research should examine how the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affects the initiation of cyberattacks by democratic and authoritarian states and how anonymity in the cyber realm conditions state leaders' decisions to employ cyberattacks instead of kinetic attacks. Answering these questions could shed additional light on the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks based on regime type.\nWhile our research shows that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies and democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted states, several limitations of the study should be discussed. First, as previously mentioned, many cyberattacks are unreported, unverified, and unattributed. Thus, our analysis of democratically initiated cyberattacks captures data only on known, verified, and attributed cyberattacks. Many additional attacks likely occurred during the period that are not accounted for in publicly available data sources. Second, we have attempted to analyze and explain the motivations behind democratically initiated cyberattacks based on open-source data. Additional political, economic, and social motivations likely exist for some of the cases included in the study, and this information could be obtained from classified sources. Lastly, many of the democratically initiated cyberattacks during the period were attributed to the United States. While fourteen democratic states initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020, 55 percent of the cases involved the United States. Thus, the United States has a larger effect on the findings compared to other states.\nIn expanding upon this study, future research could include additional cyber data as it becomes available to conduct large $N$, cross-national quantitative analysis. Future research could also consider the role of nonstate actors and emerging technologies in affecting the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Additionally, future research should continue to consider how regime type affects cyber conflict and examine the nature of cyberattacks deployed by\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nauthoritarian regimes. This research could analyze whether authoritarian states launch more aggressive cyberattacks based on whether the targeted states are democratic or authoritarian. Also, future research could analyze the motivations behind cyberattacks that are deployed by authoritarian states. This research could shed additional light on how regime type and domestic institutions affect the behavior of states in cyberspace.\nIn considering the implications of the study for global security, based on the findings from this study and other cyber scholarship (Hunter et al. 2022), democracies appear more likely to cyberattack authoritarian states and authoritarian states appear more prone to cyberattack democracies. This is not to argue that cyberattacks do not occur between states with similar regime types. Rather, based on the findings from this study and others, cyberattacks are most likely to occur between democratic and authoritarian states. Therefore, in considering cyber defenses, government leaders should be mindful that impactful cyberattacks are most likely to emerge from states with regime types disparate from their own. Additionally, modern and future warfare is likely to entail a mixture of cyber, cognitive, and kinetic forms of conflict (i.e., hybrid warfare) (Danyk and Briggs 2023). Therefore, governments should configure their cyber defenses in a manner that accounts for where cyberattacks are most likely to originate from, and considering the regime type of states could assist in their threat assessments. Lastly, initiating cyberattacks can be a risky strategy at times due to the possibility of cyber or kinetic retaliation from targeted states. Also, the deployment of cyberattacks frequently results in the inability to use the specific form of offensive cyber weaponry in future operations as targeted states are often able to understand the composition of the cyberattack and successfully defend against it in future attacks (Pedersen and Jacobsen 2024). Thus, democracies should be mindful of the potential risks and rewards associated with initiating cyberattacks when conducting cost-benefit analyses regarding the decision to utilize offensive cyber operations.\n## COMPETING INTERESTS\nThe authors have no competing interests to disclose.\n## BIOGRAPHIES\nLance Y.

However, less is known regarding how democracies operate in cyberspace as it pertains to cyberaggression. Thus, this study examines the offensive strategies of democratic states that initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states from 2005 through 2020. In examining the cyberattacks initiated by democracies during this period, we aim to better understand the motives behind democratically initiated cyberattacks, the regime types that are likely to be targeted in the attacks, and the types of cyberattacks that democracies are likely to deploy. In conducting this analysis, we find that democracies rarely attack other democratic states in cyberspace and democracies are likely to deploy more aggressive and hostile attacks when targeting authoritarian regimes. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. These findings have important implications for considering how democratic institutions affect international relations and cybersecurity.\n# INTRODUCTION\nIn October 2020 the US Cyber Command launched a series of cyberattacks that sabotaged the Russian network referred to as TrickBot, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using ransomware termed Ryuk . When questioned about the events, US General and Commander of the US Cyber Command Paul Nakasone acknowledged the United States' efforts as \"persistent engagement\" with the goal being to maintain the integrity of the 2020 US election by preventing bot interference. A secondary goal was likely to prevent other ransomware attacks on US government entities . In examining the 2020 TrickBot cyberattack, several questions emerge regarding why democracies carry out cyberattacks and how democratic institutions affect the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies.\nA large amount of literature in international relations has considered the factors that affect the conflict behavior of democratic states regarding traditional forms of military conflict. However, to date, minimal research has examined how democracies behave in cyberspace regarding cyber conflict. This is problematic given the important role many researchers contend that cyber conflict plays in international security . Thus, we contend that it is important to examine cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies to better understand their motivations, tactics, and the regimes that are most likely to be targeted in democratically initiated attacks. Doing so could help bridge the gap between research on democracies and traditional military conflict and cyber conflict. In addition, given the important role cyberaggression is likely to play in affecting global security in the future, attempting to understand the behavior of democracies in cyberspace is a critical area for security studies.\nPrevious research has found that democracies are less likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes . This scholarship has discovered that when democracies do initiate cyberattacks, they are significantly more likely to target authoritarian regimes. In addition, this research finds that democracies do cyberattack other democracies, but it is rare. However, two questions that are not addressed in the research are (1) if democracies initiate cyberattacks to a lesser degree than authoritarian states, what are the motivating factors behind the attacks; and (2) what type of cyberattacks are democracies likely to deploy against other states based on the regime type of the targeted states? In answering these questions, we analyze data from the Coun\na Corresponding author: lahunter@augusta.edu\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\ncil on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset  and conduct case study analyses of all known democratically initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020. We incorporate literature from the democratic peace theory and research on regime type and kinetic conflict in attempting to explain why democracies carry out cyberattacks and to understand the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies. We contend that democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted state. Democracies often deploy more aggressive and hostile cyberattacks against authoritarian regimes compared with cyberattacks that are carried out against other democracies. We attribute these findings to the effects democratic institutions have on state behavior in the cyber realm. More specifically, we argue that shared democratic norms, institutions, and values between democracies lead democracies to be more likely to target authoritarian states in cyberattacks and to deploy more aggressive cyberattacks against authoritarian states compared with democracies. Overall, this study seeks to expand our understanding of democratic states' behavior in cyberspace by examining the motivating factors behind democratically initiated cyberattacks and the types of cyberattacks democracies deploy based on the regime type of targeted states.\nThe layout of the remainder of this paper is as follows. First, we discuss the definitions of the main cyber terms used in the paper. Next, we examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyber conflict. We then analyze previous scholarship regarding how regime type affects traditional forms of military conflict and cyber conflict. Next, we examine data from the CFR-COTD  and conduct case study analyses in which we analyze the motivations, strategies, and targets of cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states by examining the full universe of known and verified cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. Lastly, we discuss our findings and implications for international security.\n# CYBER DEFINITIONS\nTo properly examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we need to define key cyber terms discussed in the study. The first term is \"cyber.\" Cyber refers to a \"global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers\" . The next term is \"cyber warfare/conflict.\" We use both \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" because some scholarship utilizes the term \"cyber warfare\" and other research uses the term \"cyber conflict\" when discussing the same type of cyber aggression. While the focus of this paper is on cyberattacks, it is important to define \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyber conflict\" as the terms are referenced in the paper concerning previous scholarship on cyber. \"Cyber warfare/cyber conflict\" is defined as \"the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's computers or information networks through,\nfor example, computer viruses or denial-of-service attacks\" . The last term we define is \"cyberattack.\" The US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology  provides two definitions of \"cyberattack.\" The first is \"Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.\" The second is \"An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise's use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information.\" The US Federal Emergency Management Agency defines \"cyberattack\" as \"malicious attempts to access or damage a computer system\" . The National Cyber Security Centre in the United Kingdom defines a cyberattack as malicious attempts to damage, disrupt or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks or devices, via cyber means . We define a cyberattack based on the criteria set forward in the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) in which a nation-state carries out a cyber operation against another nation-state in the form of denial of service, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, or doxing . We do not argue that this definition is superior to others. Rather, we contend that it is appropriate based on the aim and scope of the study. We expand on the definition and operationalization of the term \"cyberattack\" in the research design section of the paper. We now turn to examine previous research on the factors that can affect cyberattacks.\n# FACTORS AFFECTING THE INITIATION OF CYBERATTACKS\nMany scholars view cyberattacks as an extension of or an alternative to kinetic conflict . The reasons states deploy cyberattacks as opposed to kinetic attacks vary depending on the state. One perspective for why states initiate cyberattacks is that some states may not possess the power to compete with other states from a kinetic, military standpoint. Some scholars and military leaders consider cyberattacks to be an equalizer between states in some instances because less powerful states may be able to initiate cyberattacks while they lack the capabilities to launch successful kinetic attacks. Based on this perspective, weaker states may choose to deploy cyberattacks against more powerful adversaries. However, this theory has yet to be supported by empirical studies. Research on how power asymmetries affect cyberattacks is limited. One study that examines the effect state power has on cyber conflict finds that more powerful states (measured in terms of economic and military power) are more likely to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks compared with less powerful states (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). The authors find that on average states that initiate cyberattacks have twice the amount of power compared with the states that are targeted in cyberattacks. Additional studies have found that factors such as international trade , previous episodes of kinetic conflict (Osawa\nGlobal Perspectives\n2017), and whether states are rivals  can influence the likelihood of cyberattacks.\nValeriano (2018) contends that cyberattacks are a form of covert coercion that normally seeks to send ambiguous signals or resolve to rival states. Valeriano finds that cyberattacks tend to transpire in coordination with traditional political activities (such as economic coercion or military threats or provocation) and they usually fail to produce political concessions from the targeted states (2018). Another reason states may deploy cyberattacks is possible anonymity, which enables users to remain undetected in many cases (2015, 19). Thus, even if hostile cyber action is detected, it can be difficult to accurately identify the state that is responsible for the attack. Additionally, cyberattacks can serve a variety of purposes. Cyberattacks can be used for espionage purposes to gain valuable information to aid an aggressor's future operations. Cyberattacks can also be employed to sabotage and destroy targets within the victim state and limit the victim states' capabilities (both cyber and kinetic). Thus, cyberattacks may serve as both enhancers and alternatives to kinetic conflict and can be used for multiple purposes.\nHaving the factors associated with the initiation of cyberattacks in previous scholarship, we now turn to examining how regime type affects the nature, target, and motivation of democratically initiated cyberattacks. Within this discussion, we consider previous research on how regime type affects the conflict behavior of democracies in the kinetic realm and what implications this scholarship has for democracies and the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Thus, we seek to understand how regime type affects the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies.\n## REGIME TYPE AND THE NATURE OF CYBERATTACKS INITIATED BY DEMOCRACIES\nA few important works examine the strategic use of cyber operations by democratic states . Kallberg (2016) highlights the challenges in applying traditional military theory to cyber conflict. Kallberg contends that a theory of cyber conflict should address unique aspects of cyber that include anonymity, object permanence, measurable results, and rapid execution. More specifically, how does the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affect their usage compared with kinetic conflict in which most kinetic attacks are not anonymous? Relatedly, Goldman and Warner (2020) posit that democracies' interests (such as those of the United States) are often at risk due to continuous low-level cyber operations deployed by adversarial states. Over time, these operations can weaken the economic, political, and military power of democratic states. To address the threats, they contend that democracies should pursue an “integrated cybersecurity strategy” that combines national power and military cyber operations and focuses on deterrence, persistence (constant cyber operations that dismantle adversarial cyber activities), and anticipatory resilience (learning from past cyber operations, hardening cyber systems, preparing for future attacks, and limiting the impact of cyberattacks). Solar (2020) examines how emerging democracies in Latin America are approaching cyber threats, the role of the military in providing cyber security, and the implications for democratic governance. Solar finds that militaries in many emerging democracies are taking the lead in controlling cyberinfrastructure for cyber security purposes. Solar contends that this could be problematic in some instances if military involvement in cyber security undermines democratic governance by threatening a secure and open internet. Solar argues that emerging democracies should advance a balanced approach that includes military involvement in cybersecurity along with interactive policy communities with multiple stakeholders (including the defense sector) to review and manage cybersecurity policies. Solar contends that civil oversight of cybersecurity infrastructure is important to protect democratic values and principles .\nIn trying to understand the behavior of democratic states regarding the initiation of cyberattacks, it is important to discuss multiple perspectives on how regime type can possibly impact cyberattacks. One potential perspective is that democracies could be more prone to launch cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes because cyberattacks could be an alternative to kinetic conflict. One of the rationales for this position is that many cyberattacks are anonymous and attribution is often difficult (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018). According to Tsagourias (2012), multiple characteristics of cyberattacks make attribution difficult. Rid and Buchanon contend that attribution should be viewed as an art and not an exact science because it is a complex, political, and multilayered process (2015). They posit that effective attribution is dependent upon resources, time, and the sophistication of the attacker. Additionally, states are more likely to devote significant resources to attribution when cyberattacks are more severe. Thus, attribution should be viewed as a gradual process, and nation-states should be considered the most capable actors to accurately attribute cyberattacks due to their significant resources. Also, according to Rid and Buchanon, states with greater technological sophistication and human talent should be able to initiate cyberattacks more easily and covertly and attribute cyberattacks more effectively while responding to cyberattacks from adversaries (2015). Therefore, from this perspective, in many instances, initiating a cyberattack could be a less risky tactic than kinetic conflict due to the difficulty in attributing attacks, and democratic states could perceive cyberattacks as a more appropriate strategy than kinetic operations. In addition, some scholars contend that cyberattacks can be executed with reduced costs and lower risks than kinetic conflict due to the lack of need for combat personnel and based on the previously discussed difficulty in attributing cyberattacks .\nAnother perspective is that democracies should be less likely to initiate cyberattacks not based on the pacifying effects of democratic institutions but according to the notion that democracies are likely to be wealthier than nondemocracies (on average) and have greater technological capacity and dependency (compared with authoritarian states),\nand states with greater technological dependency should be more conservative regarding the initiation of offensive cyber operations . However, an alternate perspective is that states with greater wealth and resources are more likely to initiate cyberattacks, based on previous research, which finds that more powerful states are more prone to initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). Additionally, other scholars contend that states with greater technological connectivity are more capable regarding cyber offense and defense as it becomes easier for these states to initiate covert cyberattacks and attribute cyberattacks to adversaries . As Rid and Buchanon remark: “A third common assumption is that the most industrialized and connected countries are the most vulnerable countries, while less advanced and thus less vulnerable countries have an advantage. Attribution again reverses this logic: the larger a government's technical prowess, and the larger the pool of talent and skills at its disposal, the higher will be that state's ability to hide its own covert operations, uncover others, and respond accordingly” (2015, 31).\nLastly, a separate perspective is that the conflict-reducing effects of democratic institutions extend not only to kinetic conflict but to cyberattacks as well. This line of reasoning posits that democracies may be more peaceful in cyberspace compared with authoritarian regimes due to the presence of democratic norms, democratic institutions, and democracies' involvement in international institutions. Previous research provides some support for this position in that democracies are found to be less likely to initiate cyberattacks compared with authoritarian regimes when controlling for several political and economic factors . Thus, there is evidence that regime type affects the conflict propensity of states regarding cyber behavior and democracies are less likely to deploy cyberattacks than authoritarian regimes. In addition, this scholarship has found that democracies rarely attack one another in the cyber realm. However, if democracies are less likely to initiate cyberattacks and are less prone to cyberattack other democracies, what motivates democracies to initiate cyberattacks? More specifically, what are the motivations for cyberattacks that are deployed by democratic states?\nResearch on the behavior of democracies regarding kinetic conflict finds that democracies do not initiate wars with one another (often referred to as the dyadic democratic peace), although there are many instances of democracies warring with authoritarian regimes . While this is one of the strongest empirical findings in international relations (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003), researchers debate the rationale for the findings, and some scholars refute the claim that democracies are less likely to war with one another . In responding to the claims that democratic peace findings are questionable, Imai and Lo (2021) test the democratic peace theory in a cross-national analysis and “show that overturning the negative association between democracy and conflict would require a confounder that is forty-seven times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in other dyads. To put this number in context, the relationship between democracy and peace is at least five times as robust as that between smoking and lung cancer. To explain away the democratic peace, therefore, scholars would have to find far more powerful confounders than those already identified in the literature” (901). In addition, while many scholars contend that democracies rarely or have never gone to war with one another, democracies have engaged in minor conflicts and disputes (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021). Thus, previous scholarship finds that democracies have engaged in lower-level disputes with one another, although rarely have the disputes escalated to war (Altman, Rojas-de-Galarreta, and Urdinez 2021; Mousseau 1997, 1998). One potential explanation for this finding is that when democracies interact with one another, they are more likely to resort to diplomacy due to shared institutions, norms, and values . A large amount of literature is devoted to explaining the reasons for these findings, and the explanations vary but include the design of democratic institutions, shared norms and values, and democracies' membership and involvement in international institutions. While this research is voluminous, one clear takeaway is that democracies interact with authoritarian and democratic states in significantly different ways, and democracies are more likely to engage with other democracies more peacefully compared with their interactions with non-democracies.\nWhile previous research has demonstrated that democracies are less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks , research to date has not examined the nature of cyberattacks deployed by democracies. If we extend the literature on how democracies interact with other democracies and authoritarian regimes in the kinetic realm to cyberspace, the logical extension is that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies, and in the event of a cyberattack, the cyberattacks directed against other democracies should be less aggressive and hostile (i.e. overtly conflictual and potentially damaging) compared with the cyberattacks launched against authoritarian states. The rationale is that democracies are more likely to resort to compromise and diplomacy when interacting with other democracies compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes . More specifically, democracies should view other democracies as more friendly and less hostile due to shared values, institutions, and norms, and when issues or disagreements emerge between democracies, they should be more likely to resolve the issues diplomatically rather than through acts of cyberaggression. Therefore, in extending the research on democratic state behavior regarding kinetic conflict to the cyber realm, democracies should pursue more aggressive strategies when interacting with authoritarian regimes and less aggressive strategies when engaging other democracies. Thus, based on our previous discussions, we argue that democracies should be less likely to target other democracies in cyberattacks. This leads us to our first proposition.\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nProposition 1: When democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks, democracies should be less likely to target democracies and more likely to target authoritarian states.\nThere are many different forms of cyberattacks. The Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset  disaggregates cyberattacks according to the following types: sabotage, denial of service, data destruction, and espionage. While the amount of damage and intensity of each attack type can vary by attack, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are usually viewed as more aggressive hostile acts compared with cyberattacks that involve only espionage . The reason is that cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, or data destruction often produce actual and immediate damage (kinetic and/or cyber) and are more likely to be reported and discovered by the media and citizens within states. Thus, these cyber actions are often viewed as more hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks. However, we do not argue that espionage attacks are insignificant actions. Cyberespionage attacks are regarded as serious forms of cyberattacks by many researchers because vital information can be gained through acts of cyberespionage that can produce significant real-world effects and implications for national security . Additionally, espionage attacks can be deployed to gain valuable information on adversary states that can be later used in kinetic attacks or additional cyberattacks . However, in the aggregate, while espionage attacks clearly qualify as cyberattacks, cyberattacks involving sabotage, denial of service, and data destruction are frequently viewed as more aggressive and hostile compared with cyberespionage attacks.\nIn extending the literature on kinetic conflict to cyberspace, we argue that when democracies initiate cyberattacks, they should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states compared with instances in which they target other democracies. The rationale for this argument is based on research on kinetic conflict that finds that when disagreements occur between democracies, they are less likely to escalate to higher levels of intensity due to shared norms, values, and institutions . This stands in contrast to episodes when democracies have disputes with authoritarian regimes, in which there is a greater likelihood of hostile engagement due to\nthe lack of shared norms, values, and institutions. Thus, based on the discussion, our second proposition is:\nProposition 2: Democracies should be more likely to deploy more hostile cyberattacks (i.e., sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service) when targeting authoritarian regimes and less hostile cyberattacks (i.e., cyberespionage) when targeting other democratic states.\n# RESEARCH DESIGN\nTo examine the nature of cyberattacks carried out by democracies, we collected data on cyberattacks that were initiated by democracies against other states from 2005 through 2020. The cases included in the study are those in which democracies initiate state-sponsored cyberattacks against other states during the period and attribution for the attack is verified. Thus, every verifiable instance of a democracy initiating a known state-sponsored cyberattack against another state or states during the period is included in the study (as defined and operationalized by the Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset ). We do not analyze cyberattacks executed by nonstate actors. The reason is that we aim to analyze the motives, rationale, and targets of democratically initiated state-sponsored cyberattacks, and examining nonstate hacking/criminal/terrorist groups would not produce relevant information for the purposes of our study. The data on cyberattacks are collected from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset . The Cyber Operations Tracker Dataset (COTD) provides data on known state-sponsored cyberattacks that transpired during this period in which the initiator and the target are nation-states or are directly affiliated with a nation-state. The state-sponsored cyberattacks that are included in the dataset are events where threat actors commit denial-of-service attacks, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, and doxing . The reasoning for the dataset's focus on state-sponsored attacks is as follows: \"The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests. Furthermore, state-sponsored incidents generally have the most accurate and comprehensive reporting. Reporting on nonstate actors, such as hacktivist groups, tends to be murkier and makes for less reliable data\" . The CFR data are collected based on several open-source outlets that include but are not limited to\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 1. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks and Target Type\n|  Target Type | Frequency | Percentage  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 13 | 48%  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 12 | 44%  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 2 | 7%  |\ngovernment press documents, cybersecurity corporations, existing repositories, and media reports and publications concerning state-sponsored attacks .\nIn discussing cyber data, several limitations should be acknowledged. One limitation regarding the data, which is relevant to all cyber conflict datasets, is that not every cyberattack that transpired during the period is included because of limited information pertaining to some of these cyberattacks. More specifically, some cyberattacks are not reported, and many cyberattacks remain anonymous due to difficulty in accurately attributing attacks and the purposeful effort by some states to mask their cyber activity. Second, the CFR relies on publicly available data. As the CFR stipulates, \"State intelligence agencies and private cybersecurity firms are likely to have the most complete data about state-sponsored actors, but may not make what they know public to protect national security or trade secrets\" . Thus, the cyber events that are included in the CFR (COTD) are verified incidents where information is known and verified regarding the states that carried out the attacks and the states that were victims of the attacks based on open-source data.\nWe utilize the four categorizations from the COTD regarding the attack type. The four categories are espionage, sabotage, data destruction, and denial of service. The four categories are examined because these are the four cyberattack types utilized by the COTD . Additionally, previous cyber research has discussed and analyzed these attack types , and they are considered standard attack types in the cyber literature. Denial-of-service attacks prevent appropriate users from accessing information systems, devices, and network resources due to a malicious cyber actor . Attackers can target a variety of resources and can deny service in different ways. Ultimately, denial-of-service attacks overwhelm the computer network by sending more data than it is capable of processing, resulting in a temporary paralysis of the computer network . Cyber sabotage is an attack carried out against the integrity of an IT system . This attack \"causes a disruption to a physical process\" . Data destruction is the process of destroying data on electronic or physical mediums (Ministry of Justice 2021). In some cases, this is done intentionally for security purposes. Cyber data destruction results in a computer or computer networks becoming unusable due to the use of malicious software . Cyberespionage refers to a state covertly collecting information for intelligence purposes (Australian Cyber Security Center 2021). More specifically, cyberespionage involves penetration of computer systems or networks to obtain information on or going\nthrough these systems, without the information holder's consent . In addition to analyzing the attack types of democratically initiated cyberattacks, we also examine the sectors targeted within victim states based on the COTD's classification as follows: government, private sector, civil society, and the military.\n## FINDINGS\nIn total, there were 27 cyberattacks initiated by democracies from 2005 through 2020. The overall breakdown of the 27 attacks that were initiated by democracies between 2005 and 2020 is as follows and is presented in table 1. There were 13 cases (48 percent) where democracies attacked only authoritarian states. There were 12 cases (44 percent) where democracies attacked both democracies and authoritarian states simultaneously. There were 2 cases (7 percent) in which democracies attacked only other democracies. Thus, in examining these statistics, we see that when democracies launch cyberattacks, they are likely to target authoritarian regimes specifically, or a combination of democratic and authoritarian regimes in simultaneous attacks. Also, democracies do occasionally target democracies (where an authoritarian regime is not attacked simultaneously), but it is rare. In 7 percent of cases does a democracy attack only another democracy. Thus, the primary targets for democracies appear to be either solely authoritarian states or a simultaneous combination of authoritarian and democratic states. This finding provides support for proposition 1, which stipulates that democracies should be less likely to cyberattack other democracies.\nTable 2 displays the specific sector targeted in a cyberattack based on the regime type that is targeted. In respect to the attack type based on the sector that is targeted when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 6 government, 3 private, 1 civil society, and 3 military. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 7 government, 1 private, 0 civil society, and 4 military. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 0 government, 0 private, 1 civil society, and 1 military. Thus, in examining table 2, we find that government sectors are more likely to be targeted in attacks when only authoritarian states are targeted and in attacks where both authoritarian and democratic states are targeted simultaneously. Civil society and military sectors are most frequently targeted when only democratic regimes are the victims of democratically initiated cyberattacks.\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 2. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks, Target Type, and Targeted Sectors\n|  Target Type | Government | Private | Civil Society | Military  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 6 | 3 | 1 | 3  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 7 | 1 | 0 | 4  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1  |\nTable 3. Democratically Initiated Cyberattacks, Target Type, and Attack Type\n|  Target Type | Espionage | Sabotage | Data Destruction | Denial of Service  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Only Authoritarian States | 3 | 5 | 1 | 4  |\n|  Democratic and Authoritarian States Simultaneously | 10 | 1 | 1 | 0  |\n|  Only Democratic States | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0  |\nTable 3 displays the attack type when considering the regime type targeted. In respect to the attack type when only authoritarian regimes are targeted, the breakdown of the 13 attacks is as follows: 3 espionage, 5 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and 4 denial-of-service attacks. When democratic and authoritarian states are targeted simultaneously, the breakdown of the 12 attacks is as follows: 10 espionage, 1 sabotage, 1 data destruction, and no denial-of-service attacks. When only democracies are targeted, the breakdown of the 2 attacks is as follows: 2 espionage, and no attacks regarding sabotage, data destruction, and denial-of-service attacks.\nIn examining the results in table 3, we find that a few patterns emerge. First, democracies are more likely to commit acts of sabotage when only authoritarian states are targeted versus attacks that include both democratic and authoritarian states or solely democratic states. One hundred percent of the sabotage attacks committed by democracies were committed against only authoritarian states. Second, denial-of-service attacks are more likely to be committed against only authoritarian states. Democracies did not initiate any denial-of-service attacks in attacks that included simultaneous attacks against democracies and authoritarian states. Also, democracies did not deploy any denial-of-service attacks against only democratic states. Once again, one hundred percent of denial-of-service attacks were deployed against only authoritarian states. Regarding data destruction, democracies were equally likely to initiate data destruction attacks against authoritarian states and in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously. Lastly, democracies were more likely to deploy espionage attacks in attacks that involved democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously, and 100 percent of the attacks directed against only democratic states were acts of cyberespionage.\nWhen we interpret the results in table 3, it appears that democracies initiate more aggressive and hostile attacks against authoritarian states compared with democratic targets, which provides support for proposition 2. This is not to argue that espionage cannot be destructive. Espionage\nattacks can be costly because they may provide valuable information to a potential adversary that can damage a victim state. However, the types of attacks launched against authoritarian states are more overtly aggressive and hostile because sabotage and denial-of-service attacks often produce significant and immediate damage against a victim state. In addition, these attacks are often immediately known, whereas espionage attacks may be undetected for some time. Thus, the finding that a larger number of sabotage and denial-of-service attacks are initiated against nondemocracies indicates that democracies are more aggressive in deploying their offensive cyber weaponry against authoritarian states compared with when they target other democracies.\nTable 4 displays data regarding whether cyberattacks included in the analysis are carried out in retaliation to a kinetic attack or a cyberattack. Thus, the variable relation refers to whether the cyberattack occurred in response to a kinetic or a cyber hostility that originated from the targeted state. General Retaliation refers to retaliation for a kinetic or cyber hostility originating from the targeted state. Thus, both kinetic and cyber actions are included in the category General Retaliation. Kinetic Retaliation refers to retaliation due to a kinetic hostility committed by the targeted state. Lastly, Cyber Retaliation refers to retaliation for a cyber hostility committed by the targeted state. In examining table 4, we find that the only acts of General Retaliation occurred when democracies attacked only nondemocracies. Out of the 3 total retaliation attacks, 2 were in response to kinetic actions and 1 was in response to a previous cyberattack. When retaliation attacks are initiated by democracies, they are directed at specific authoritarian states. There are no cases of democracies retaliating against other democracies.\nTable 5 displays the number of cyberattacks, and the number of cyberattacks by attack type, initiated by the democratic states included in the analysis. In reviewing table 5, it is important to note that many cyber events involved multiple initiator states. Six of the 26 cases (23 percent) involved multiple initiator states. In examining table 5, we\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 4.

The remaining democratic states in the analysis initiated 1 cyberattack. The findings regarding the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom and the number of cyberattacks deployed reinforce previous scholarship, which finds that more powerful states are more likely to initiate cyberattacks due to greater resources and technological capacity (Hunter, Albert, and Garrett 2021). In the next section, we explore the motives, circumstances, and tactics behind these attacks to better understand why democracies may initiate certain types of cyberattacks against authoritarian states versus democracies.\n# CASE STUDY ANALYSIS\nTo more fully understand the nature of state-sponsored cyberattacks initiated by democracies, we analyze qualitative case information pertaining to each cyberattack in respect to the potential motives and tactics associated with the attacks. We utilize publicly available data to obtain this information. In addition, more information is known regarding some events compared with others, and in some cases, there is limited data on the motives and tactics of the attack. As the CFR-COTD states: \"Furthermore, some reporting from the media or cybersecurity companies can be vague or incomplete, making it difficult to confirm incidents for which data is only available from a single source\" . Thus, we attempt to provide descriptions of\nthe motives, tactics, and state actors involved in each democratically initiated cyberattack while acknowledging that limited publicly available information and sources exist for some cases. The full list of cases and the key aspects of each case including the cyberattack name, the initiator(s) of the attack, the target(s) of the attack, the type of attack, and the suspected motivation for each attack can be found in table 6. Additionally, given the space constraints of the paper, a more detailed description of each case can be found in the appendix.\nBefore proceeding to the case study analysis, one important point is that additional economic, social, and political motives outside our analysis may have impacted the democratically initiated cyberattacks that are included in the study. Given that 27 cases (cyber events) are discussed in the study, the limited sources for some cases, and the space constraints of the paper, additional possible motives cannot be fully explored for each case. Thus, it is important to note that additional economic, social, and political motives and explanations may exist for each case.\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND SABOTAGE\nIn considering cyberattacks initiated by democracies against only authoritarian states in which the attack type was sabotage, many of the attacks were carried out by the United States. In April 2017, the United States is believed to have sabotaged North Korea's nuclear program by sabotag-\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nTable 6.

The United States' efforts are believed to have been motivated by an attempt to prevent the North Korean military from expanding its missile technology systems to protect South Korea and to maximize security on the Korean Peninsula.\nAnother attack in this category that was executed by the United States that targeted an authoritarian state's missile systems occurred in June 2019 when the US Cyber Command hacked Iranian rocket and missile launch systems in what Iran deemed an unsuccessful effort to disable the systems. This sabotage operation carried out by the United States came during a time of heightened tensions between the two states and served as a response to recent aggression by the Iranian government when it downed a US drone and attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz (Council\non Foreign Relations 2021b). The response by the United States signaled its willingness to deploy cyber capabilities in response to kinetic actions.\nIn a series of attacks launched by the United States against Russia in 2018, the US Cyber Command sabotaged the Russian Internet Research Agency in an attempt to maintain the integrity of the US 2018 elections . Although some information regarding the attack remains unknown, the operation was likely intended to prevent Russian disinformation that could have been disseminated by the Internet Research Agency . In a separate attack directed at Russia, and mentioned in the introduction of the paper, in October 2020 the US Cyber Command sabotaged computers on the TrickBot network, which houses over one million computers controlled by Russian hackers known for using Ryuk ransomware . US General and Commander of the US\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nCyber Command Paul Nakasone stated that the cyber operation was carried out as “persistent engagement” with the aim of preserving the integrity of the 2020 US election by eliminating bot interference. A related goal was to thwart other ransomware attacks on US government entities .\nIsrael was responsible for the other sabotage attack in the category of democracies initiating sabotage attacks against nondemocracies. In May 2020 Israel conducted a cyberattack targeting Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port near the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran reported only caused damage to private systems . This attack was an attempt to sabotage port operations in response to Iran’s failed cyberattack on Israel’s water treatment and sewage facilities that had transpired less than a month prior . In response to the attack, Iran stated that it was attempting to prevent future cyberattacks by developing its intranet system known as the National Information Network to limit its reliance on the international cyber community .\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS\nRegarding denial-of-service attacks when the target is a nondemocracy, the first case involves Taiwan and China. On October 23, 2007, a secret agent working for Taiwan’s military intelligence allegedly planted “Trojan” programs in the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, National Defense Research Institutes, Military Industrial Labs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all of which are part of China’s intelligence infrastructure. The motivation behind the attack was to obtain classified intelligence information . The attack is considered a denial-of-service attack because it temporarily affected the cyber operations of the Chinese targets.\nAnother denial-of-service attack involves Israel and Syria. In September 2007 Israel sabotaged Syrian military capabilities by disrupting its radar and air defense systems to enable an Israeli air strike . This incident led Iran to have less confidence in the Syrian air defense capabilities. Additionally, this could be considered a hybrid attack due to the cyber nature of the attack combined with kinetic jammers in a plane being used to sabotage Syria’s radar and air defense capabilities .\nThe two remaining attacks in the category involve the United States and North Korea and the United States and Russia. In September 2017 the US Cyber Command targeted North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (a.k.a. North Korean Intelligence Agency) to deny service to North Korea’s cyber capabilities (Council on Foreign Relations 2017). This effort was based on directives from the US executive branch and was achieved through the United States overloading North Korea’s internet system with an abundance of traffic, resulting in the stoppage of internet access (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017). The United States used this event as a signal to pressure other states to sever ties with North Korea (DeYoung, Nakashima, and Rauhala 2017).\nIn another attack carried out by the United States against Russia, in November 2018 the US Cyber Command sabotaged a Russian troll farm to maintain the integrity of the US midterm election by preventing the dissemination of disinformation . The US efforts against the Russian government, and more specifically the Internet Research Agency, once again aimed to prevent disinformation by taking the troll farm offline during the day of the 2018 midterm elections and the few days following it .\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe lone event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using data destruction attacks involves the United States and Iran. In late September 2019, the US government conducted cyberattacks against Iran resulting in the destruction of data and physical hardware . This attack was in response to increased tensions between the United States and Iran due to Iran’s alleged attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities a few weeks prior (Council on Foreign Relations 2021b). The goal of the attack was to prevent Tehran’s ability to spread propaganda regarding its attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.\n## DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThe first event in the category of democracies attacking nondemocracies using espionage attacks involves multiple democracies initiating espionage attacks in a coordinated event. In late 2018 Five Eyes (an intelligence alliance between the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) used malware to spy on Yandex (the Russian version of Google) user accounts (Bing, Stubbs, and Menn 2019). The malware known as Regin was used by Five Eyes in a previous operation. The attack was carried out to gain technical information related to account authentication credentials that would enable access to and monitoring privileges over various Yandex user accounts and messages. The specific accounts of interest were likely key members of the Russian government and the Russian military that had personal Yandex accounts.\nThe next event involves the Netherlands and Russia. As reported in 2018, the Netherlands conducted espionage operations through the use of malware by targeting and compromising “the Dukes,” an arm of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service . This was likely done to gain a better understanding of the Dukes’ targeting methods and operations and to assist the US intelligence community in determining who was responsible for the 2016 compromise of the Democratic National Committee. Russia’s encroachment on European politics posed a potential future threat to the Netherlands, which likely led to the combined efforts with the US intelligence community to execute the attack in this instance, although direct coordination with US forces remains unconfirmed .\nThe last event in the category involves South Korea and North Korea. As reported in March 2020, South Korea’s\nGlobal Perspectives\nDark Hotel group displayed significant resources and technical capabilities while conducting espionage operations against North Korea through the use of five zero-day exploits in 2019 . While the identities of the specific individuals targeted were not released, it is believed that the attack was executed to gain information such as emails and documents from North Korean government officials and key professionals. The goal was likely to gather as much intelligence as possible on North Korea's military capabilities and nuclear missile program.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING NONDEMOCRACIES\nIn considering the 13 cyberattacks launched by democracies against authoritarian states, the most common form of attack was sabotage (38 percent), followed by denial of service (31 percent), espionage (23 percent), and data destruction (8 percent). It appears that democracies are more likely to carry out attacks that result in actual damage (cyber or kinetic) when targeting nondemocratic states. Many of the attacks appear to be aimed at damaging an authoritarian state's military capabilities, retaliating for previous kinetic actions directed against a democracy or its allies, attempting to prevent interference in domestic politics by a foreign adversary, disrupting operations by potential rival states, and collecting intelligence from potential authoritarian adversaries.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SABOTAGE\nThe lone event in this category is the well-known Stuxnet attack. Stuxnet was first detected in June 2010 but may have been in operation as early as 2009 . It is believed that the United States and Israel were responsible for the classified creation of Stuxnet during an operation codenamed “Olympic Games” . The two states are alleged to have used Stuxnet to target a variety of states including Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Uzbekistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Taiwan (Council on Foreign Relations 2010). The most notable incident of the use of Stuxnet was against Iran to severely degrade its nuclear program without the use of ground forces or airstrikes to enhance the national security of both the United States and Israel . While the United States and Israel have not claimed responsibility for the cyberattack, strategic political motivations and technological capabilities indicate the two states are the likely sponsors of the event. Additionally, several researchers have contended that the United States and Israel were responsible for the attack , making Stuxnet one of the most highly publicized cyberattacks initiated by democratic states against both democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND DATA DESTRUCTION\nThe one event in this category involves a high-profile attack carried out by the United States and Israel directed at multiple states, both democratic and authoritarian. A malware called Flame is believed to have been in operation from August 2010 until May 2012 in multiple countries including Iran, Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Hungary, Austria, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and France . The malware is extremely complex and could change the future of cyber conflict, according to some observers . The malware is believed to have been sponsored by the United States and Israel with the intent of both destroying data and gaining intelligence. The United States has denied allegations of involvement in the attacks . The most likely motives behind the attacks were to conduct cyber operations against adversary states and to gather intelligence to gain strategic advantages against potential enemies. In addition, the likely motives for the sponsoring states in conducting the operations against other democracies were to gain access to financial accounts for persons of interest and to test their capabilities before use against adversaries to ensure that the sponsor states did not lose the element of surprise.\n### DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ESPIONAGE\nThere are a total of 10 cases that fall within the category of democracies attacking democracies and nondemocracies simultaneously using espionage attacks. Thus, due to space constraints and the large number of events, we do not include descriptions of each attack here. The descriptions can be found in the appendix. Regarding the broad overview of the attacks, some attacks involved multiple sponsor states, and the attacking democracies include the United States (4 attacks), Israel (3 attacks), the United Kingdom, France, India, Spain, and Pakistan. The motivations behind the attacks varied for each event. The motivations included the desire to obtain sensitive military and financial intelligence from specific states and obtain information on individuals of interest. Other motivations included the desire to obtain classified information to gain influence over ongoing high-stakes international negotiations. Attacks were also carried out to test specific cyber offensive capabilities to lay the groundwork for future attacks. Attacks were also executed to acquire information that would lead to cyber advantages over other states and to gain intelligence on rival states.\n### BRIEF ANALYSIS: DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND NONDEMOCRACIES SIMULTANEOUSLY\nIn considering the 12 cyberattacks launched by democracies against democratic and authoritarian states simultaneously, the most common form of attack was espionage (83 percent), followed by data destruction (8 percent) and sabotage (8 percent). Democracies appear significantly more\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nlikely to carry out espionage attacks, rather than attacks that result in direct kinetic or cyber damage, when the targets are both democratic and authoritarian states. Many of the espionage attacks were aimed at collecting intelligence for economic, military, and strategic purposes. Also, attacks appear to be deployed to test offensive cyber capabilities and to damage nondemocratic adversaries' military capabilities (in the case of Stuxnet, where the United States and Israel targeted Iran's nuclear facilities).\n# DEMOCRACIES ATTACKING DEMOCRACIES AND ESPIONAGE\nThere were only two cases in which democracies attacked only other democracies. In both cases, the attack type was espionage. The first event involved Pakistan. Throughout 2020 APT 36, a hacker group from Pakistan, targeted multiple Indian officials in espionage operations including those in defense organizations through operation \"honey trap\" . This operation was a continuation of recent tensions between Pakistan and India and was used to spread misinformation regarding the coronavirus while also gaining access to Indian government servers (Threat Intelligence Team 2021; Gill 2020), impacting the Indian economy, and gaining an advantage in the realm of command and control (C2) security capabilities.\nThe other attack was initiated by Indonesia. In January 2016 a spyware program linked to the Indonesian government was found to be using a server in Sydney, Australia . The spyware, FinFisher, has been known to be utilized for surveillance purposes . FinFisher was likely deployed by Indonesia due to previous allegations that the Australian government had intercepted communications from the Indonesian president in 2009 . Although the FinFisher spyware was likely used to spy on members of the Australian government, it is also probable that Indonesia was using the Australian server to obscure their spyware from other states to allow it to operate without detection for a longer period.\n# DISCUSSION\nIn examining the nature of cyberattacks that are initiated by democracies, several trends emerge. Firstly, democracies are significantly more likely to target authoritarian states in their attacks. This finding supports previous research that posits that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies. Thus, our findings support the notion that democracies target authoritarian states to a greater degree than nondemocracies. From 2005 through 2020, there were only two known cases in which democracies cyberattacked other democracies (when only democratic states were targeted). The motivations behind cyberattacks directed at democracies are often to collect governmental and economic intelligence through espionage attacks. Secondly, democracies deploy more hostile cyberattacks when targeting authoritarian states. Democracies are more likely to deploy sabotage, denial-of-service, and data destruction\nattacks when cyberattacking authoritarian states and espionage attacks when targeting other democracies. Thirdly, the motivations behind cyberattacks directed at authoritarian states are to inflict damage on the defensive capabilities of authoritarian states, prevent authoritarian states from interfering with domestic politics in democracies, collect governmental and defense intelligence, and disrupt military operations of rival, authoritarian states. These findings provide support for the literature on democratic peace and kinetic conflict extending into cyberspace. As with kinetic conflict, democracies appear to engage with other democracies less aggressively in cyberspace compared with their interactions with authoritarian regimes. Thus, the conflict-inhibiting effects of shared norms, values, and institutions that frequently exist between democracies in the kinetic realm appear to extend into cyberspace when considering cyberattacks.\nKalberg (2016) posits that when applying military theories to the cyber realm, it is important to account for the anonymous nature of cyberattacks. Thus, future research should examine the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks compared with kinetic conflict. Future research should examine how the anonymous nature of many cyberattacks affects the initiation of cyberattacks by democratic and authoritarian states and how anonymity in the cyber realm conditions state leaders' decisions to employ cyberattacks instead of kinetic attacks. Answering these questions could shed additional light on the role of anonymity in affecting cyberattacks based on regime type.\nWhile our research shows that democracies are less likely to cyberattack other democracies and democracies initiate different types of attacks based on the regime type of the targeted states, several limitations of the study should be discussed. First, as previously mentioned, many cyberattacks are unreported, unverified, and unattributed. Thus, our analysis of democratically initiated cyberattacks captures data only on known, verified, and attributed cyberattacks. Many additional attacks likely occurred during the period that are not accounted for in publicly available data sources. Second, we have attempted to analyze and explain the motivations behind democratically initiated cyberattacks based on open-source data. Additional political, economic, and social motivations likely exist for some of the cases included in the study, and this information could be obtained from classified sources. Lastly, many of the democratically initiated cyberattacks during the period were attributed to the United States. While fourteen democratic states initiated cyberattacks from 2005 through 2020, 55 percent of the cases involved the United States. Thus, the United States has a larger effect on the findings compared to other states.\nIn expanding upon this study, future research could include additional cyber data as it becomes available to conduct large $N$, cross-national quantitative analysis. Future research could also consider the role of nonstate actors and emerging technologies in affecting the initiation of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Additionally, future research should continue to consider how regime type affects cyber conflict and examine the nature of cyberattacks deployed by\nGlobal Perspectives\nWhen Democracies Attack: Examining the Offensive Strategies of Democracies in Cyberspace\nauthoritarian regimes. This research could analyze whether authoritarian states launch more aggressive cyberattacks based on whether the targeted states are democratic or authoritarian. Also, future research could analyze the motivations behind cyberattacks that are deployed by authoritarian states. This research could shed additional light on how regime type and domestic institutions affect the behavior of states in cyberspace.\nIn considering the implications of the study for global security, based on the findings from this study and other cyber scholarship , democracies appear more likely to cyberattack authoritarian states and authoritarian states appear more prone to cyberattack democracies. This is not to argue that cyberattacks do not occur between states with similar regime types. Rather, based on the findings from this study and others, cyberattacks are most likely to occur between democratic and authoritarian states. Therefore, in considering cyber defenses, government leaders should be mindful that impactful cyberattacks are most likely to emerge from states with regime types disparate from their own. Additionally, modern and future warfare is likely to entail a mixture of cyber, cognitive, and kinetic forms of conflict (i.e., hybrid warfare) . Therefore, governments should configure their cyber defenses in a manner that accounts for where cyberattacks are most likely to originate from, and considering the regime type of states could assist in their threat assessments. Lastly, initiating cyberattacks can be a risky strategy at times due to the possibility of cyber or kinetic retaliation from targeted states. Also, the deployment of cyberattacks frequently results in the inability to use the specific form of offensive cyber weaponry in future operations as targeted states are often able to understand the composition of the cyberattack and successfully defend against it in future attacks . Thus, democracies should be mindful of the potential risks and rewards associated with initiating cyberattacks when conducting cost-benefit analyses regarding the decision to utilize offensive cyber operations.\n## COMPETING INTERESTS\nThe authors have no competing interests to disclose.\n## BIOGRAPHIES\nLance Y.
