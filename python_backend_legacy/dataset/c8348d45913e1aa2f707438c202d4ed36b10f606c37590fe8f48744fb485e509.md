Introduction\nIt seems one has to accept as inevitable that when something useful for the improvement of man’s life is invented, thoughts will either turn towards how to use it as a weapon or destroy it, or, in the case of computer network technology, both.¹\nApril and May 2007 were the most tumultuous months in Estonia’s history after the restoration of independence in 1991. The relocation of the Bronze Soldier monument from Tallinn city centre resulted in two nights of rioting and looting in Tallinn and besieging of the Estonian embassy in Moscow. Physical rioting and looting was accompanied with virtual violence in cyberspace that lasted for three weeks as governmental and non-governmental websites were attacked with distributed denial of\n* Adviser at the International Law Section, Legal Department, Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Estonia; Conductor of the international humanitarian law course at the University of Tartu, Faculty of Law.

These cyber attacks, or computer network attacks (CNA), crippled the web pages and computer systems of ministries, banks, broadcasters, newspapers and emergency services with the possible aim of reducing the media coverage and dissemination of public information regarding the consequences of the relocation of the Bronze Soldier.² Some Estonian officials accused that the attacks were orchestrated or tolerated by the administration of the Russian Federation.³ The latter denied strongly any involvement in such acts and no definite attribution has been made in this case.⁴\nThe cyber attack on Estonia’s critical IT-systems was not unprecedented, but the combination of crude (ping floods, defacement) and sophisticated (DDoS, use of botnets) measures used in the attack delineated a new standard in cyber attacks against a State.⁵ Both qualitatively and quantitatively the attacks perpetrated were the largest of any known cyber attacks that have taken place in the world recently.\nEstonia’s case might be the best example to demonstrate that globalisation is in the modern world accompanied by an increased number of attacks against computer networks, and that the attacks may be launched by States, representatives of States, terrorists, criminals and/or cyber hooligans. Thus CNA is an asymmetric weapon ideal for use by powerful States that harness the required capability but also by clever individuals with harmful intents.\nConsidering the powerful technical advancements that have been made by information technology over the last three or four decades, it would be logical to assume\n2 NATO has produced a short documentary on the attacks called ‘Six Colours: War In Cyberspace’, <www.nato.int ebookshop=\"\" eix_colours=\"\" six_colours.html=\"\" video=\"\">, visited 30 March 2009.\n3 Daily Telegraph, ‘Russia Accused over Estonian “Cyber-Terrorism”’, 18 May 2007, <www.telegraph.co.uk 1551850=\"\" news=\"\" Russia-accused-over-Estonian-cyber-terrorism.html=\"\" worldnews=\"\" worldnews,=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009; Times Online, ‘Estonia Accuses Russia of “Waging Cyber War”’, 17 May 2007, <www.timesonline.co.uk 28=\"\" article1802959.ece=\"\" europe=\"\" et=\"\" tol=\"\" www.world=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009.\n4 The Guardian, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, 17 May 2007, <www.guardian.co.uk 17=\"\" 2007=\"\" may=\"\" topstories3.russia=\"\" world=\"\" way=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009; RIA Novosti, ‘Estonia Has No Evidence of Kremlin Involvement in Cyber Attacks’, 6 September 2007, <en.rian.ru 20070906=\"\" 76959190.html=\"\" world=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009.\n5 In 2005 the US Defence Department reported that Chinese web sites had been heavily used to target its computer networks.

This assumption is wrong. When discussing cyber attacks in terms of public international law and humanitarian law, we are faced with a relatively new phenomenon, which does not fit into any global legal framework regulating IT activities. There has been progress on a regional level – the Council of Europe has adopted the Convention on Cybercrime and the United States of America is keen to regulate cybercrime issues in legal assistance agreements. $^{6}$  Nevertheless, these advancements are mostly confined to the realm of domestic criminal law and do not address the issues of international law. At the current time it would appear that the lack of sufficient State practice and opinio juris has not allowed international customary law to develop that would concisely deal with cyber attacks.\nThere are several reasons for the lack of a comprehensive legal regulation – various development levels of countries (third world versus developed countries); predictable benefits accompanying the absence of specific frameworks (maintenance of sovereign freedom of action); and the understanding that cyber attacks represent a new legal phenomenon. There does not exist a notable selection of legal materials that would analyse the issue. I. Detter concurs that “[t]he problem has not been approached in any systematic way although numerous institutions and governments have expressed concern about the problem. ... However, there has been little, if any, academic comment.”7 Research publications or books have dealt with problem briefly or not with sufficient in-depth analysis.8 The US Naval War College’s so-called “Blue Book”9 and the 1999 US Department of Defense study remain the foundational materials in this field.10 Despite the ambiguity of the legal situation, more than 30 different countries worldwide, including USA, China, India and Russia, have publicly admitted\n6 The 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n7 I.

Several standards and principles of international law can be successfully applied to information operations (IO) either directly or by analogy. Also, academic discourse has enlivened after the events that took place in spring 2007 and the proliferation of cyber attacks in recent years.\nThe definition of IO is based on USA Department of Defense Joint Publication 1-02.¹² As USA is considered to be the most capable State in the sphere of cyber wars, the definitions provided below are used for the purposes of academic debate and also for the reason that other authors have adopted them to describe cyber attacks.¹³\nInformation operations are defined as the “integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own”.¹⁴ The term represents a generic definition, comprised of the following activities and operations:\n**computer network operations (CNO)** – Comprised of computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.¹⁵\n**computer network exploitation (CNE)** – Enabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks.¹⁶\n11 E.

Both civil and military structures use the same technical facilities. Due to the consolidation of both structures there exists a danger that the initiated CNA will transform, either deliberately or un-deliberately, from one structure to another, thus accompanied by serious consequences. CNA also challenges common understanding of geographical spaces and territorial integrity, as attacks may cross several State borders.^[19]^\nCNA demands that military operations planners and high-ranking government officials take into account the following questions of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. For example, does a cyber attack constitute an ‘armed attack’ under the United Nations Charter? Does there have to be physical damage to property or loss of life before a State can exercise the right of self-defence? What would be a proportionate response against such an attack? What are the evaluation criteria for targets that are dual-use targets used both by military and civil systems? Is the cyber attack a violation of criminal or international law? In what cases is there State responsibility for acts of individuals acting from its own territory? What could be the future perspectives for the regulation of CNA?\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a general assessment of the legal consequences of CNA according to jus ad bellum and jus in bello, mapping the problems encountered in both spheres of law upon the application of international law on CNA, and to suggest possible future perspectives for the regulation of CNA.\n## 2. Jus ad Bellum and CNA\nThe foundation for the contemporary jus ad bellum, the law regarding the use of force, is the Charter of the United Nations.^[20]^ According to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter,\n17 Ibid.\n18 Ibid.\n19 By conducting a CNA with a ‘botnet’, the attacking computers may reside in different jurisdictions and the data stream may cross State borders by way of masking the initial source of the attack. Therefore the target may have to counter attacks that come from different jurisdictions and may have a concise centre of origin, but tracking the origin can be difficult, if not impossible.\n20 Hereinafter also ‘UN Charter’.\nErki Kodar\n“[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. Such a ban of the use of force is regarded as an imperative norm of international law, *jus cogens*, from which no deviation is allowed, and it is binding for all States in the world community.”²¹\nFor further analysis, it is important to know the two UN Charter exceptions from the ban of using force, namely, the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State (Article 51 of UN Charter) and use of force within the framework of a collective security system (Articles 39 and 42 of UN Charter).\n## 2.1. Applying the UN Charter to CNA – Can CNA Constitute Use of Force?\nThe first obstacle to the implementation of the regulation regarding the use of force is the following question: Could CNA be treated as an armed attack? Although Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does not elaborate on what could be interpreted as a threat or use of force, the *travaux préparatoires* of the Charter indicate that this must be an armed attack.²² More so, the Charter mentions that each State has the inherent right of an individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State. The competence of the Security Council in relation to acting upon CNA matters will raise fewer problems, as it is possible for the Security Council to treat CNA as a threat to peace or violation of peace (it is doubtful whether CNA can cross the threshold established for aggression), provided that there is political will between the Permanent Members.²³\nCNA represents a challenge to the valid paradigm related to the use of force as its consequences cannot easily be classified as activities that threaten the values of the international community or as consequences that are of the severity equal to the use of physical force. The consequences can be spread over a broad spectrum from everyday IT disruption to widespread physical damages. In the former category would be for example the temporary paralysation of computer networks without any direct or indirect physical effects. The latter category could entail attacks against critical infrastructure systems with intent to cause physical damages to objects or even loss of life. Disruption of IT systems will most probably not equate to an armed attack as they would be more of nuisance if any anything else and can be dealt with in the domestic legal system with Computer Emergency Response Teams, judicial system and mutual assistance agreements, if applicable. In the case of physical damages and loss of life\n21 M. Shaw, *International Law*, 5th ed. (Cambridge University Press, 2006) p. 1018.\n22 On the interpretation of the term ‘armed attack’ in light of CNA, see M. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’, 37 *Columbia Journal of Transnational Law* (1999) pp. 900–908. On the issue what constitutes a ‘force’, see Shaw, *supra* note 21, pp. 1019–1021.\n23 Schmitt, *supra* note 22, pp. 924–927.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthe State has to evaluate whether the CNA caused the damages and are the damages analogous to an armed attack and would give right to resort to self-defence.\nA majority of acknowledged international law scholars are of the opinion that CNA can be regarded as an armed attack only if certain stringent criteria have been fulfilled, but mainly the consequences of the CNA must be equal to the consequences of a physical armed attack.[24] For example, economic and political measures of pressure will not constitute the violation of the ban to use force even though CNA is a very useful tool for disrupting commerce communications, etc. Thus, CNA will oscillate between measures adopted to apply political and economic pressure and the use of armed force. Incurrence of physical damage as a result of CNA is the pre-requisite to regard it as an armed attack. Unfortunately, this criterion cannot be treated as an absolute and it largely depends on the evaluation of the situation. The consequences of CNA should be assessed case-by-case to ascertain whether they are similar to the consequences of an armed attack or whether consequences stay below the level of threshold for use of force.\nThis categorisation is critical because upon it determines which type of countermeasures the defending State may choose in the given case. Professor M. Schmitt gives two explanatory examples: In the first case, \"computer network attacks disable a busy air traffic control system during horrendous weather. An airliner crashes and deaths result. No kinetic force has been used to destroy the airliner, but CNA was plainly the proximate cause of the tragedy.\"25 Causal relation between the CNA and the airplane crash is established. Opposite of this spectrum, CNA is used to attack \"a university computer network, designed to disrupt military related research occurring in campus laboratories\".26 This attack interferes with the conduct of research related to armed forces.\nLeaving aside the questions of attribution and State involvement in the attacks, Schmitt posits that the first case can be construed as use of force as it results in a loss of life, physical destruction and the consequences are comparable to the use of armed force.[27] Thus it would be lawful for the injured State to act in self-defence after such an incident even though no physical attack infringed its borders. In the second case, the consequences of CNA are less serious than in the first example and represent an assumed unlawful invasion into a computer network and the consequences of this\n24 D. Silver, ‘Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force under Article 2(4)’, 76 International Law Studies (2002) pp. 84–92; Y. Dinstein, ‘Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense’, 76 International Law Studies (2002) pp. 102–105; Schmitt, supra note 22, pp. 914–915; An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations, Department of Defense, Office of General Counsel, <www.au.af.mil au=\"\" awc=\"\" doc-io-legal=\"\" dwc=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009, pp. 18–25.\n25 Schmitt, supra note 22, p. 916.\n26 Ibid.\n27 Ibid.\n139</www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\nactivity cannot be equal to the use of armed force, although scientific work related to the activities of armed forces has been disrupted.\nIf CNA can constitute use of armed force, the canonical restrictions established for the response to an armed attack in self-defence must be also applied thereto – that is, countermeasures taken to deal with a threat must be proportional and necessary to the threat. Another contentious issue is whether a State under a CNA attack can counter in self-defence with only CNA or with physical force. Law regarding use of force does not prescribe the measures to be adopted in self-defence as long as they are proportionate and necessary against the attack. Therefore it would be lawful for the injured State to resort to physical force if the aforementioned criteria are fulfilled.\nWithout concise legal regulation, it will be up to State practice to decide whether CNA will qualify as use of force or not. Such a case-based approach will not necessarily contribute to completely uniform practice but, if we are to look for a better consensus, the UN Security Council has the competence to qualify CNA as a threat to peace as provided by Article 39 of the UN Charter. The involvement of the Security Council would be beneficial for the Permanent Members or for larger countries that have sufficient clout to influence Permanent Members.\nThe involvement of the Security Council would be most probably of little use for non-members when the suspected or alleged acts of one of the Permanent Members are in question. In such cases the Security Council will most probably find itself in a veto deadlock. However, the Security Council could give more specific guidelines with regard to CNA incidents that fall into the 'grey area' of use of force or not. Then again this scenario could be counterproductive and against the self-interests of the Permanent Members because they are also potentially the most capable States for conducting such acts and gaining from such behaviour.\n## 2.2. Problems Related to Attribution of Responsibility in Case of CNA\nThe above lack of legal distinction should not be interpreted as a situation where everything explicitly not forbidden is permissible if the use of CNA does not violate *jus cogens* norms, customary law or treaty law. Unlawful or indiscriminate uses of CNA can violate generally recognised principles of international law (for example, the principle of non-intervention in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of a State). The injured State may demand reparations for injuries from the responsible State according to the principles of State responsibility. Nevertheless, the matter of State responsibility is especially complicated in the case of CNA as its source can be concealed. The subject of attack may be acting on false impressions of the attack coming from another State that is not necessarily responsible for the attack (for example, the responsible State D may launch CNA against State A through unbeknownst State C and masking the origin of the attack as to convey the impression that CNA comes from State B).\nThe relative ease of use of CNA has the potential to make States complacent with regard to State responsibility. If CNA has been State orchestrated, carried out by the agents of State, then the attribution of State responsibility is not complicated.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nNowadays laptops have more computing power than a room full of supercomputers in the 1970s and private individuals and organisations have access to high-speed internet connections from which to conduct multiple CNAs of different severity unbeknownst to their State of residence. This can create situations where State A knowingly or unknowingly tolerates CNA activities against State B and the attacks cross the threshold of armed attack. In this case State B regards itself as being under attack and starts to defend itself against the actions coming from State A. Therefore State A may unwillingly violate international law. By the text of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts²⁸ the acts individuals of State A are attributable to it and the acts in question breach international obligation (prohibition of use of force, prohibition of non-intervention).²⁹ State B can prove the support of State A with either signal or human reconnaissance (for example, identifying that the attack is being launched from a computer network of a government agency) or from official pronouncements of government officials.\nIf an individual living in State A is violating the rights of State B from the territory of the same State, State B may require the punishment of that respective individual from State A or initiation of extradition proceedings. Under aggravating circumstances, State B may adopt self-defence measures against an attack coming from State A in the territory of State A, but only if State A does not wish or is unable to avoid the appropriate actions against State B. Professor Y. Dinstein has classified the attribution of responsibility related to CNA originating from State A and directed against State B into four categories:³⁰\nThe first category consists of cases where citizens of State A launch CNA on their own initiative and for reasons only known to them. Their activities cannot be attributed to the government of State A. In the given case, State A should exercise sufficient executive duress against the individuals concerned so that they would either end or avoid launching the attacks against State B from the territory of State A.³¹\nThe second category consists of cases when certain individuals or terrorists residing in State A launch CNA against State B for certain ideological, etc. reasons and the terrorists are not supported by State A. The obligations of State A are the same that were described under the first category.³²\nIn the third category terrorists supported by the State A launch CNA against State B. If the actions can be attributed to terrorists supported by State A, the terrorists could be treated as de facto representatives of State A as provided by the principles of State\n28 Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-third Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001).\n29 Article 2 of 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n30 Dinstein, supra note 24, p. 103.\n31 Ibid., pp. 103–104.\n32 Ibid.\n141\nErki Kodar\nresponsibility, and State A will be held responsible to State B.³³ The support given to terrorists by State A needs to be proven in this case.³⁴\nIn the fourth category government organs of State A launch CNA against State B. This represents the most complicated category as the actions of representatives of a State within the CNA sphere may have a number of forms – like espionage (which cannot be construed as the use of force), interruption of communication systems with no harm to humans (not grave enough to exceed the threshold of use of force) and cyber attacks that result in harm done to persons. The latter is treated as CNA that oversteps the threshold established for the use of force, but all the cases described in this category can be ascribed to State A.³⁵\n‘Active defence’ is also possible as a counter-measure against CNA, meaning that a State under CNA attack will attack the computer system of another State being the source of the CNA, considering that it will be later forced to apologise, in public, for the ‘counterattack’ or pay compensation.\nAt the current moment, launching a cyber attack by a State against another State represents the exception and not the rule.³⁶ Most CNAs are perpetrated by individuals and non-State actors, but the attribution of such acts to them or the State harbouring them is complicated as evidence is hard to get or evidence can be misleading in the case of a sophisticated attack.\n## 2.3. Jus ad Bellum and CNA – Future Trends\nIn the near future, jus ad bellum will still be subject to an understanding that the use of force or threat of force within cyberspace will remain a fact to be identified separately in each case. The majority of cyber attacks will not exceed the threshold of use of force, but the valid paradigm may be subject to change if clear-cut cases emerge. For example, some scholars are of the opinion that the USA may decide to respond with armed force if a cyber attack launched by another State destroys the informa\n33 Article 8 of 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n34 Dinstein, supra note 24, p. 104.\n35 Ibid., p. 105.\n36 Currently the use of CNA against a State occurs in an armed conflict as an additional measure to classical kinetic force. The conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008 also had occurrences of CNA use but it is open whether these were carried out by Russia or ‘voluntary hackers’.

The non liquet position, adopted by the Department of Defense of the USA in 1999, was the following:\nAs in all cases when a nation considers acting in self-defense, the nation considering such action will have to make its best judgment on how world opinion, or perhaps a body such as the International Court of Justice or the United Nations Security Council, is likely to apply the doctrine of self-defence to electronic attacks. As with many novel legal issues, we are likely to discover the answer only from experience.³⁸\nThis decade old position would seem to be still valid prima facie as there have been no clarifying developments in international law in this regard. If we are dealing with a situation where State A is supporting the activities of criminals and therefore CNA is launched against State B, responding with CNA to CNA is probably acceptable and justified. If CNA exceeds the threshold for the use of force, the traditional kinetic self-defence capabilities may be employed. But at the moment there does not exist a defined yardstick – CNA with grave consequences can be treated as the use of force in the future, while consequences that do not meet the threshold will not be treated as use of force.\nIn the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), CNA with consequences equal to use of force might be in some extreme cases regarded as events that may trigger the collective self-defence provision of Article 5 in the North Atlantic Treaty, although this seems doubtful. NATO’s own rhetoric has been in this field cautious, if not in the negative.³⁹ This is due to the fact that current and previous attacks have not exceeded the threshold mentioned, and thus it is hard to predict the consequence of future CNA. Most probably the only article applicable in the NATO framework would be Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, in which case members will enter into consultations if the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the members is threatened. Only time and State practice will tell whether CNA\n37 Schmitt, supra note 13, p. 377.\n38 An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations, Department of Defense, Office of General Counsel, <www.au.af.mil au=\"\" dodo-io-legal=\"\" dwc=\"\" awcgate=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009, p. 19.\n39 Press conference with NATO Secretary General following the informal meeting of NATO Defence Ministers, 8 February 2008, <nids.hq.nato.int 2008=\"\" 2008/s080208c.html=\"\" docu=\"\" speech=\"\">, visited on 27 March 2009; DefenseLink, ‘NATO Leader Expresses Cautious Optimism about Afghanistan’, <www.defenselink.mil news=\"\" newsarticle.aspx?id=\"48910\">, visited on 27 March 2009; IBLS, ‘NATO Agrees To Create Cyber Defence Management Authority’, 15 May 2008, <www.ibls.com 2009;=\"\" 4=\"\" and=\"\" approach=\"\" en=\"\" infosociety=\"\" infosociety.nato-agrees-common-approach-cyber-defence=\"\" internet_law_news_portal_view.aspx?s=\"latestnews&amp;id=2054\" name=\"\" nato-agrees-common-approach-cyber-defence=\"\" site=\"\" www.euractiv.com=\"\">, visited on 27 March 2009.\n143</www.ibls.com></www.defenselink.mil></nids.hq.nato.int></www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\ncan be realistically construed as use of force according to the UN Charter that would activate the self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty framework.\n## 3. Jus in Bello and CNA\n*Jus in bello* or international humanitarian law is a set of legal norms applicable in case of an armed conflict. When CNA is used in an armed conflict as a weapon then legal restrictions arising that regulate the use of weapons are applicable to CNA. These restrictions must be adhered to in self-defence operations when countering CNA with CNA or when responding to a physical attack with CNA. Also, in cases of use of CNA as an offensive weapon there is a need to understand the legal restrictions that regulate the selection of targets and the precautions in attack to be adopted.\n## 3.1. Legal Assumptions for the Implementation of Humanitarian Law in the Case of CNA\nIn international humanitarian law, there is no explicit provision that deals with either CNA or IO or cyber war. Nevertheless, the Martens Clause, which is regarded as customary law,⁴⁰ states that “in cases not included in the [Hague] Regulations adopted by them, populations and belligerents remain under the protection and empire of the principles of international law, as they result from the usages established between civilised nations, from the laws of humanity and the requirements of the public conscience”.⁴¹ The modernised Martens Clause is contained in Article 1(2) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which states that “[i] n cases not covered by this Protocol or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of the principles of international law derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience”.⁴² The purpose of the Martens Clause is to affirm that the belligerents’ choice of methods or means of warfare is not unlimited and to eliminate any incidents in armed conflicts that are not covered by treaty regulation or customary law. Therefore, these principles reaffirm that even without explicit mention of CNA in modern treaties or customs, certain restrictions still apply.\nThe ICJ has reaffirmed that for weapons two customary law restrictions apply. Firstly, “[s]tates must never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military\n⁴⁰ “The Court points to the Martens Clause, whose continuing existence and applicability is not to be doubted, as an affirmation that the principles and rules of humanitarian law apply to nuclear weapons”, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, 8 July 1996, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 87, <www.icj-cij.org 7495.pdf=\"\" 95=\"\" docket=\"\" files=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n⁴¹ Preamble of the 1899 Hague Convention (II) and 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land.\n⁴² 1977 Additional Protocol 1, Article 1(2).</www.icj-cij.org>\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ntargets\".43 Secondly, \"it is prohibited to cause unnecessary suffering to combatants; it is accordingly prohibited to use weapons causing them such harm or uselessly aggravating their suffering. ... [S]tates do not have unlimited freedom of choice of means in the weapons they use.\"44 All of the above and the restrictions applicable to weapons must be taken into account if using CNA in an armed conflict.45\nCNA must be capable of fulfilling the requirement set for weapons – that it can be used in an attack and aimed against specific targets. According to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its Additional Protocols of 1977, an attack is an act of violence,[46] which raises the question: Is CNA out-of-bounds for international humanitarian law because CNA is not a use of violence in the strictest sense of the word? The answer to this question is ‘no’ as for the purposes of humanitarian law an ‘attack’ shall represent a generic and a broad definition.[47] ‘Violence’ therefore in humanitarian law is defined through the consequence of physical (in case of objects and physical persons) or mental (in case of physical persons only) damage. CNA does most probably bring the described consequences, and therefore the use of CNA should be treated as an attack.\nStates also have an obligation when adopting a new weapon to conduct an assessment process to determine whether the use of such new weapon would under some or all conditions be prohibited or restricted under the standards of humanitarian or some other category of international law.[48] Unfortunately States have no obligation to publicise these findings, and thus the majority of these analyses are off the record and not available to the general public.\nThe discussion below is based on an assumption that there is an established armed conflict governed by the norms and principles prescribed in international humanitarian law. International humanitarian law will only apply to CNA if CNA's consequences are not just sporadic and isolated cases and are aimed to cause injuries, death, damages and destruction and where such consequences are predictable or desired. Humanitarian law is not applicable to CNA if these consequences do not include the causing of injuries, death, damages and destruction during an armed conflict (for example, the failure of a university intranet, downloading of financial information, temporary closing of access to internet or being involved in cyber espionage).\n43 Nuclear Weapons case, supra note 40, para. 78.\n44 Ibid.\n45 It has been argued that “[i]t is perfectly reasonable to assume that also the new forms of CNA, which do not involve the use of traditional weapons, are subject to IHL just as any new weapon or delivery system has been so far when used in an armed conflict”, in Dörmann, supra note 13.\n46 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 49(1).\n47 Commentary of the 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 49, <www.icrc.org 470-750062?opendocument=\"\" ihl.nsf=\"\" com=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n48 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 36.</www.icrc.org>\nErki Kodar\n## 3.2. CNA and Legitimate Targets\nIf CNA constitutes an attack or the use of violence in an armed conflict, the next question arises: What can be attacked with the weapon and what are the legitimate targets? For analytical purposes M. Schmitt divides targets into four categories: combatants and military targets; civilians, who directly participate in hostilities; objects used by both military and civilians; specifically protected objects.^[49]^\nCombatants and military targets are legitimate targets^[50]^ and can be targeted as long as the means and methods of attack comply with the restrictions established by humanitarian law.^[51]^ Therefore, aiming a CNA against combatants is permissible (for example, falsifying military air traffic control system navigational information that results in a military transport crash).^[52]^ When attacking military targets, the attack against a target must considerably contribute to military action and provide for a definite military advantage.^[53]^ Attack against the enemy's command and control networks, etc. does not create difficulties. However, which principles should be adopted in case of contestable targets: Can CNA be aimed against a banking system as the sustainability of armed forces depends on wealth? If a State is disproportionately dependent upon a specific industry (for example, oil), can CNA be used to stop production and distribution?^[54]^ Is it important that the attack is accompanied by physical destruction, not just inconvenience? If the purpose is only to cause inconvenience, this does not exceed the threshold of a military attack.\nCivilians represent individuals who are not considered combatants and civilian targets are targets that are not military targets. Therefore the armed forces have an obligation to direct their attacks against military objectives.^[55]^ Notwithstanding legitimate collateral damage, the ban on attacking civilians and civilian targets is practically absolute. Civilians lose their immunity when participating directly in hostilities by causing damages to the members or supplies of the enemy's armed forces.^[56]^ The use of civilians to launch CNA, as sub-contractors or civil servants, is full of legal problems and issues.^[57]^ The main problem with CNA is that it encompasses activities\n^[49]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, pp. 379–387.\n^[50]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52 notes that civilian objects shall not be the object of attack and that attacks shall be limited to military objectives.\n^[51]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(i) demands that the attackers must do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are not civilian objects, but military objectives.\n^[52]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 380.\n^[53]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3).\n^[54]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 381. This is an issue of interpretation of the 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3). Some States, like the USA, regard economic targets as legitimate targets.\n^[55]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Articles 48, 50(1), 51(2) and 52(1).\n^[56]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 51(3).\n^[57]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 384; Dörmann, *supra* note 13; 2003 Summary Report prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross on the Direct Participation in\n146\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthat can be realistically conducted by government agencies and authorities rather than by members of armed forces. If civilians are directly involved in conducting CNA resulting in physical damages, such persons may be treated as unlawful combatants as they are participating directly in hostilities. Thus the IT-support personnel who are contributing to a CNA operation are at the risk of being considered targets. Civilians employed for the purpose of CNA represent a challenge for humanitarian law as they would not fit under the category of lawful combatants. When it is impossible to restrict the participation of civilians in military activities, this may endanger the civilian population as the enemy cannot make a clear distinction between combatants and civilians. Considering the skill-sets required for CNA it is more than reasonable to assume civilian involvement in such attacks, but the correct course of action should be that the members of armed forces conduct CNA.\nDual-use targets have both military and civil purposes (airports, railways, electrical systems, communication systems, factories producing material for both the civilian population and armed forces, etc.).58 If an object is being used for military purposes, it will be construed as a military target that can be attacked with all the permissible methods, including CNA. The aforementioned is also valid in a situation where the military objectives of a target are only secondary to the civilian objectives.\nHumanitarian law grants special protection to certain objects like dykes, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.59 Objects under special protection are defined as hazardous facilities as attacking them may launch dangerous forces and cause serious losses among the civilian population. As a general rule, such targets should not be attacked if the emission of dangerous forces cannot be controlled, but in the case of CNA it would be possible to neutralise these targets without launching any dangerous forces (which is an advantage, compared to kinetic weapons).60\n# 3.3. CNA's Compatibility with General Principles of Humanitarian Law\nOnce it has been determined that a target is lawful, the concordance of attack with general principles (and norms regarding targeting) of humanitarian law should be assessed before the attack is launched. These principles are the principle of distinction, prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, principle of proportionality and the prohibition of perfidy.\nHostilities under International Humanitarian Law, <www.icrc.org eng=\"\" direct%20participation-hostilities-ihl-311205=\"\" siteeng0.nsf=\"\" siteeng0.nsf/=\"\" /=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009; K.

While CNA can be used in compliance with the principle of distinction, it can also be, like conventional weapons, used indiscriminately. No matter how attractive the idea of launching one extensive CNA campaign against the infrastructures of the State as a whole would be, including attacks against the civil sector, all CNA attacks must be aimed against military targets. The principle entails an obligation to minimise collateral damage and to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be disproportionate to the value of the military objective to be attacked.\nThe principle of distinction is closely knitted with the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks. Indiscriminate attack stands for attacks that are not aimed against a specific military objective, employing the methods and means of warfare, which cannot be aimed against a military target or employing the methods and means of warfare the consequence of which cannot be restricted.⁶² With CNA, the main threat is posed by the fact that it can be used for launching indiscriminate attacks, either deliberately or inadvertently. If malicious code CNA is employed that is uncontrollable and spreading through civilian systems, then such CNA is prohibited as an indiscriminate weapon.⁶³ Taking into account that civilian and military networks are closely intertwined, the launched CNA must be of such sophistication that it conforms to the prohibition.\nThe principle of proportionality demands that conflicting interests must be weighed against each other – sufferings and damages versus military advantage.⁶⁴ If military advantage outweighs incidental loss of life or damages to civilians or civilian objects, the attack is construed to be in compliance with the principle of proportionality (although the principle seems to be rather simple, its implementation in practice is extremely complicated). The majority of the problems of CNA in this equation are caused by knock-on effects that are “not directly and immediately caused by the attack, but nevertheless the product thereof – it is the problem of the effects caused by the effects of an attack”.⁶⁵ As CNA may result in consequences which are initially unpredictable, one must always assess when planning an attack whether CNA would be accompanied by endangering the civil population or not. As the CNA attacks are complicated and may, with great probability, affect civilian systems, one must assess the causal damages and possible consequences during the planning stage of any operation prior to launching an attack and seek ways to mitigate these effects. Then again, CNA as a method may help to diminish collateral damage as it allows, instead of physical destruction, to ‘switch off’ the target (for example, instead of bombing an\n61 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 48.\n62 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 51(4).\n63 Schmitt, supra note 13, p. 389.\n64 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(iii).\n65 Schmitt, supra note 13, p. 392.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nairport it is possible to disturb the operation of flight control systems).⁶⁶ CNA allows the attacker to directly control the consequences and minimise the risk to civilian population when the attained military advantage has been achieved.\nPerfidy is the feigning of protected status with the intent to kill, injure or capture an adversary.⁶⁷ The prohibition of perfidy does not mean that ruses of war cannot be used.⁶⁸ For the purposes of CNA, a ruse would be communication of incorrect information on location and manoeuvres, forging the information in the enemy’s reconnaissance database, etc.⁶⁹ Perfidy would be pretending to have a protected status, and for the purposes of CNA this would be deceptive use of codes and signals given to medical transport by the International Civil Aviation Organization.⁷⁰\nWhile the humanitarian law in force is, in general, sufficient to protect individuals and objects from CNA, some uncertainties still exist. Even though it was impossible to predict the occurrence of CNA upon the emergence of current humanitarian law, some general standards are, nevertheless, applicable to CNA. At the same time CNA is characterised by specifics that also represent challenges and problems for the purposes of *jus in bello*: When does one consider CNA as an ‘attack’ in *jus in bello* and when only as a nuisance? But CNA is also a positive tool that allows for achieving military objectives without the causal damages that may result from kinetic attacks. It should also be remembered that CNA is a weapon, and any unlawful use may bring about incrimination for the commitment of war crimes.\n## 4. Possible Future Scenarios for the Regulation of CNA\nIn all probability a new defined structure of international law will not be introduced in the nearest future that would encapsulate all the cases of use of force with regard to cyberspace and the assessment of CNA *vis-à-vis* the right of self-defence. The issue is at the mercy of practical experiences of different States as there seems to be unwillingness to enter into international or regional agreements in this sphere. The *status quo* is useful for States with better CNA capabilities to maintain freedom of action. But there might be will to move towards some foreseeable developments.⁷¹\nIn 1998 Russia attempted to initiate a United Nations General Assembly resolution dealing with the banning of some highly dangerous information operations.⁷²\n66 *Ibid.*, p. 394.\n67 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 37(1).\n68 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 37(2).\n69 K.

The Naval War College in Newport, USA organised a CNA-conference in 1999, where the participants agreed that it would be useful and sensible to intensify international co-operation in the sphere of computer crime and cyber terrorism, but the time has not yet come for introducing a comprehensive regulation or banning in general.73 More extensive co-operation in the sphere of legal assistance was justified with the pretence for the criminalisation of actions threatening the international community to bring the criminals to justice and to simplify the extradition procedure.74\nIf legal assistance agreements are to serve as an effective instrument to fight cybercrime, it is necessary for them to have an explicit scope including either cybercrime or all crimes in general. If countries have not entered into extradition agreements, this means that such countries have neither a duty nor the domestic legal basis to extradite a person to another State.75 It would also be difficult to sustain the argument that the principle of *aut dedere aut judicare* is customary law with relation to CNA.76 An alternative to extradition would be to administer justice to a person who has committed CNA against another State in the CNA's State of origin.77\nDoc.

Estonia's Role in the Development of CNA-related Agreements or Standards?\nProfessor D. Hollis, who studied the cyber attacks against Estonia, suggests the creation of the right of hot pursuit available to a State which is the object of a cyber attack as \"nations could agree to waive sovereignty concerns and permit a direct response in certain cases, such as cyber attacks by terrorists that all nations might want thwarted\".[78] The thought would suggest that it would be appropriate to allow the attacked State to use counter measures to defend itself from an attack with extraterritorial measures even if such countermeasures would violate the sovereignty of the State being the origin of the attacks. Let us assume that hackers from Russia were behind the attacks against Estonia, and they had no connections with either the government or the armed forces. According to the current procedure, Estonia should ask Russia to maintain law and order in its territory as a kinetic counterattack would represent violation of Russia's sovereignty. According to proposed new standards of international law the States could leave aside all the worries related to their sovereignty and allow, in certain cases (as a community value all States should be interested in preventing the activities of cyber terrorists), the implementation of direct countermeasures by a State under attack.[79] While this sounds sensible, the development of an appropriate regulation is highly doubtful as States do not wish to open a Pandora's Box on the use of force, and the described scenario would leave numerous opportunities for serious misconduct and abuse.\nHollis also opines that Estonia wanted to construe cyber attack against the State as military activity (a new paradigm) and not as an act subject to penal power (the former paradigm). It can be assumed that in the future cyberspace will become the battlefield where military power is used, humanitarian law is applied and valid penal power framework may be imposed for combined effect.[80] In a military sense, cyberspace can be treated as an asymmetric field even now as States are not necessarily combating each other; it is rather the case of non-State actors positioning themselves against a State (or joining in with the State).\nThe establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia may represent a progressive step for the purposes of international law. The birth and activities of the centre may provide beneficial practical experiences and legal evidence. In addition, CNA can be regulated under national law, which could\nErki Kodar\nalso provide the grounds for the birth of internationally acknowledged standards in the future.\n## 4.2. Possible Developments of International Law in the Sphere of CNA\nA way ahead could be the conclusion of a multilateral agreement, involving specific and accurate standards applicable to CNA. In the given situation, the conclusion of a framework treaty that prescribes main and essential principles and gives States more freedom for the interpretation of specific aspects is more likely. Regionally, the conclusion of either bilateral or regional agreements (Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime represents a step in this direction) may be possible – provided that there is political will.\nOne way forward would be to draft new counterterrorism measures and agreements dealing with cybercrime and cyber terrorism. Measures preventing cybercrime have been taken both at the regional and global level to supplement national criminal law and international co-operation in the sphere of investigating and prosecuting such crimes. The main problem here is the difference of national law of different States or conflict of legal systems. Also, constitutional restrictions to extradition must be considered here.⁸¹ The format of an agreement for the prevention of cybercrime would be similar to the other agreements related to fighting terrorism wherein a certain type of behaviour shall qualify as terrorist activity and will be subject to a certain procedure between the member States. The aforementioned would provide a universal jurisdictional basis, or quasi-universal jurisdictional bases, for certain types of crime. At the moment, cyber terrorism is not taken seriously enough to be a subject for such agreements, and CNA must breach a high threshold to be considered as an issue worthy of international agreements.⁸² While the events that took place in Estonia in 2007 did not exceed this threshold, they can most certainly be interpreted as something more serious than common vandalism; therefore Estonia could have the opportunity to initiate the procedure for the conclusion of an agreement on the prevention of cyber terrorism. The main problem here is the fact that it is difficult to agree on which activities should be construed as cybercrime and ascertain where the line between common crime and terrorism should be drawn.\nAnother category of potential agreements could restrict the sovereign freedom of States – declarative agreements on lawful principles, armament control agreements and humanitarian law agreements. A declarative agreement would involve the most general principles that States would be willing to observe for the purposes of implementing international law (for example, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, stating that outer space is intended for common peaceful use by mankind). The pre-requisite for\n⁸¹ Russia invoked a ‘constitutional ban’ recently in the Litvinenko case and refused to extradite the prime suspect, Andrei Lugovoi.

The crux of the matter is the abrupt and powerful development of information technology as it would be impossible to predict future situations with the required level of accuracy upon the conclusion of such agreements, and consequently States may be hesitant to sign a carte blanche treaty. With armament control agreements States could commit themselves not to develop, acquire or transfer certain CNA capabilities or not to use their capabilities in a way that would be destabilising for the armament control regime or crisis management systems of another State. The pre-requisites and problems encountered when discussing this type of agreements are the same as with declarative agreements. Also, States will not always have a monopoly in CNA capabilities, considering the interests and capacities of hackers and cyber terrorists themselves. Humanitarian law agreements usually restrict the use of certain types of weapons in the case of an armed conflict. The restrictions are justified by stating that the weapon may cause unnecessary suffering. Information technology weapons, adopted in cyber war, may not necessarily fit the criteria on the grounds equivalent to conventional weapons. As general humanitarian law principles and standards can be applied to CNA, the efficiency of such agreements is doubtful. Special standards applicable to CNA would be more useful than agreements attempting to restrict the utilisation thereof.⁸³\nThe conclusion of multilateral conventions, restricting the liberty of freedom of States, is not considered as realistic in the near future, as only very few countries, if any, have an understanding of the capacities and vulnerabilities related to cyber war, sufficient to promote the long-term national interests of such States.⁸⁴\nBilateral agreements or agreements with a limited number of parties are most useful in a situation where a certain number of governments are directly involved with a concrete and common problem. This type of agreement represents a useful form of co-operation within regional scope. G8, the Council of Europe and the Organization of American States have used this to enter into regional conventions on cybercrime (and the NATO process is, potentially through cyber defence policy, moving in this direction). There still will be potential risks related to cases exceeding the limits of regional agreements or where the organisations are dominated by some of the member States, thus turning the convention into a dead letter agreement.⁸⁵\nOn an organisational plane the United Nations General Assembly has often shown initiative for the adoption of resolutions that request or invite the member States to pursue certain principles in their activities. While resolutions are not strictly\n⁸³ Ibid., pp. 446–450; D.

Unfortunately, at the moment, the General Assembly seems to be lacking the initiative. Considering the novelty of legal problems related to CNA, the adoption of resolutions on cyber war is probably not realistic over the next decade.⁸⁶\nOne alternative is represented by codification of customary law as a ‘manual’, as was done with the law of naval warfare by the International Institute of Humanitarian Law, or to enthuse progress by way of custom, codes of conduct or rules of engagement where codification would be based on experience.⁸⁷ Unfortunately, the summoning of the experts of the given sphere is highly unlikely for the lack of customary law to be codified for the purposes of cyber war. Adoption of best-practices guidelines seems to be realistic.⁸⁸\nThe current mindset of States seems to be more domestic than international as States have identified that CNA prevention and control is closely connected with regular home and private users. Estonia adopted in 2008 the Cyber Security Strategy,⁸⁹ and President Obama’s administration is conducting at the moment a 60-day cyber security review to ascertain how to apply cyber security policy.⁹⁰ The Center of Strategic and International Studies Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency released a report on the same issues 8 December 2008.⁹¹ The aim of both documents is to raise the awareness of private computer users and the private sector to take responsibility for their computers and secure them against unwanted uses. Some authors argue that there exists a civic duty to secure private machines against becoming a part of botnet.⁹² Responsible civil conduct would minimise the risk of exploitation for the users but also for the State concerned as it enables the State to exercise diligence on its own territory and control, to a certain extent, that its sovereign territory is not used for conducting CNAs against other states. Thus States are trying to get their houses in order before moving towards international measures.\nIn general, future perspectives for the regulation of CNA are stuck behind several obstacles. Firstly, legislative problems related to CNA are not fully understood, mainly because of technological unpredictability. Secondly, traditional armament control agreements and humanitarian law conventions cannot be adapted for CNA\n⁸⁶ Ibid., p. 452.\n⁸⁷ J.

Thirdly, States have no explicit picture of the form of an international law regime that would promote their national interests in the best possible way in a long-term perspective with regard to CNA.\n# 5. Conclusion\nCNA is a challenge for international law because at the moment the law applies by way of analogy and interpretation in *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*. There are no express norms or customs that would regulate the uncertainty of CNA. The current framework of international law tries to fit the odd-shaped peg of CNA into a predetermined context, but this is not a satisfactory long-term solution. But some applicable rules and principles are better than no rules, better than a legal vacuum that would leave CNA out of legal reality. States and individuals with CNA capabilities will use the ambiguity to their advantage, but this will also bring State practice and more clarity to law, albeit through actions and consequences that may be harmful and unforeseen.\nWhen Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed that the life of law has not been of logic but of experience, he meant both the aforementioned and the possible future. The law is always behind the present, either by a step or two. Due to its flexible norm-creating procedure, international law only has to encounter a number of CNA incidents that will change the paradigm and give the required incentive to create legal regulation concerning the use of information weapons. Until then States need to cope with the existing law. Where it regards the use of CNA as use of force we can paraphrase Justice Stewart that we will know it when we see it or, in other words, law will recognise certain forms of CNA as the use of force only after it has been factually established that it has been the use of force.\nWhile the more capable States have adopted either ambivalent or even an attitude of ignorance with regard to the regulation of CNA over the last decade, some forms of co-operation may still be realistic, as demonstrated by the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. Estonia's contribution to NATO's cyber defence policy and the establishment of the Centre of Excellence may lead NATO towards another agreement, which may expand the member States' understanding of cyber law and cyber war and influence other States.\n155",

Introduction\nIt seems one has to accept as inevitable that when something useful for the improvement of man’s life is invented, thoughts will either turn towards how to use it as a weapon or destroy it, or, in the case of computer network technology, both.\nApril and May 2007 were the most tumultuous months in Estonia’s history after the restoration of independence in 1991. The relocation of the Bronze Soldier monument from Tallinn city centre resulted in two nights of rioting and looting in Tallinn and besieging of the Estonian embassy in Moscow. Physical rioting and looting was accompanied with virtual violence in cyberspace that lasted for three weeks as governmental and non-governmental websites were attacked with distributed denial of\n* Adviser at the International Law Section, Legal Department, Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Estonia; Conductor of the international humanitarian law course at the University of Tartu, Faculty of Law. All the views expressed and possible mistakes made in this article are the author’s alone.\n\nservice attacks (DDoS), ping floods, botnets and web page defacements. These cyber attacks, or computer network attacks (CNA), crippled the web pages and computer systems of ministries, banks, broadcasters, newspapers and emergency services with the possible aim of reducing the media coverage and dissemination of public information regarding the consequences of the relocation of the Bronze Soldier. Some Estonian officials accused that the attacks were orchestrated or tolerated by the administration of the Russian Federation. The latter denied strongly any involvement in such acts and no definite attribution has been made in this case.\nThe cyber attack on Estonia’s critical IT-systems was not unprecedented, but the combination of crude (ping floods, defacement) and sophisticated (DDoS, use of botnets) measures used in the attack delineated a new standard in cyber attacks against a State. Both qualitatively and quantitatively the attacks perpetrated were the largest of any known cyber attacks that have taken place in the world recently.\nEstonia’s case might be the best example to demonstrate that globalisation is in the modern world accompanied by an increased number of attacks against computer networks, and that the attacks may be launched by States, representatives of States, terrorists, criminals and/or cyber hooligans. Thus CNA is an asymmetric weapon ideal for use by powerful States that harness the required capability but also by clever individuals with harmful intents.\nConsidering the powerful technical advancements that have been made by information technology over the last three or four decades, it would be logical to assume\n\n134</www.scribd.com></www.washingtonpost.com></en.rian.ru></www.guardian.co.uk></www.telegraph.co.uk></www.nato.int>\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthat a uniform and existing legal regulation has been imposed on both cyber attacks and IT-crime. This assumption is wrong. When discussing cyber attacks in terms of public international law and humanitarian law, we are faced with a relatively new phenomenon, which does not fit into any global legal framework regulating IT activities. There has been progress on a regional level – the Council of Europe has adopted the Convention on Cybercrime and the United States of America is keen to regulate cybercrime issues in legal assistance agreements. $^{6}$  Nevertheless, these advancements are mostly confined to the realm of domestic criminal law and do not address the issues of international law. At the current time it would appear that the lack of sufficient State practice and opinio juris has not allowed international customary law to develop that would concisely deal with cyber attacks.\nThere are several reasons for the lack of a comprehensive legal regulation – various development levels of countries (third world versus developed countries); predictable benefits accompanying the absence of specific frameworks (maintenance of sovereign freedom of action); and the understanding that cyber attacks represent a new legal phenomenon. There does not exist a notable selection of legal materials that would analyse the issue. I. Detter concurs that “[t]he problem has not been approached in any systematic way although numerous institutions and governments have expressed concern about the problem. ... However, there has been little, if any, academic comment.”7 Research publications or books have dealt with problem briefly or not with sufficient in-depth analysis.8 The US Naval War College’s so-called “Blue Book”9 and the 1999 US Department of Defense study remain the foundational materials in this field.10 Despite the ambiguity of the legal situation, more than 30 different countries worldwide, including USA, China, India and Russia, have publicly admitted\n\n135</www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\nto development of military capabilities and doctrines related to information operations.\nThe above does not mean that the legal situation could be described as empty or as a loophole. Several standards and principles of international law can be successfully applied to information operations (IO) either directly or by analogy. Also, academic discourse has enlivened after the events that took place in spring 2007 and the proliferation of cyber attacks in recent years.\nThe definition of IO is based on USA Department of Defense Joint Publication 1-02. As USA is considered to be the most capable State in the sphere of cyber wars, the definitions provided below are used for the purposes of academic debate and also for the reason that other authors have adopted them to describe cyber attacks.\nInformation operations are defined as the “integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own”. The term represents a generic definition, comprised of the following activities and operations:\n**computer network operations (CNO)** – Comprised of computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.\n**computer network exploitation (CNE)** – Enabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks.\n\n136</www.icrc.org></www.icrc.org>\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ncomputer network attack (CNA) – Actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.^[17]^\ncomputer network defense (CND) – Actions taken to protect, monitor, analyse, detect, and respond to unauthorised activity within the Department of Defense information systems and computer networks.^[18]^\nCNA represents actions aimed against information in another computer network and computers, and the consequences of such actions may be extensive due to the fact that computers and computer networks are largely dual-use systems. Both civil and military structures use the same technical facilities. Due to the consolidation of both structures there exists a danger that the initiated CNA will transform, either deliberately or un-deliberately, from one structure to another, thus accompanied by serious consequences. CNA also challenges common understanding of geographical spaces and territorial integrity, as attacks may cross several State borders.^[19]^\nCNA demands that military operations planners and high-ranking government officials take into account the following questions of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. For example, does a cyber attack constitute an ‘armed attack’ under the United Nations Charter? Does there have to be physical damage to property or loss of life before a State can exercise the right of self-defence? What would be a proportionate response against such an attack? What are the evaluation criteria for targets that are dual-use targets used both by military and civil systems? Is the cyber attack a violation of criminal or international law? In what cases is there State responsibility for acts of individuals acting from its own territory? What could be the future perspectives for the regulation of CNA?\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a general assessment of the legal consequences of CNA according to jus ad bellum and jus in bello, mapping the problems encountered in both spheres of law upon the application of international law on CNA, and to suggest possible future perspectives for the regulation of CNA.\n## 2. Jus ad Bellum and CNA\nThe foundation for the contemporary jus ad bellum, the law regarding the use of force, is the Charter of the United Nations.^[20]^ According to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter,\n\nErki Kodar\n“[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. Such a ban of the use of force is regarded as an imperative norm of international law, *jus cogens*, from which no deviation is allowed, and it is binding for all States in the world community.”\nFor further analysis, it is important to know the two UN Charter exceptions from the ban of using force, namely, the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State (Article 51 of UN Charter) and use of force within the framework of a collective security system (Articles 39 and 42 of UN Charter).\n## 2.1. Applying the UN Charter to CNA – Can CNA Constitute Use of Force?\nThe first obstacle to the implementation of the regulation regarding the use of force is the following question: Could CNA be treated as an armed attack? Although Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does not elaborate on what could be interpreted as a threat or use of force, the *travaux préparatoires* of the Charter indicate that this must be an armed attack. More so, the Charter mentions that each State has the inherent right of an individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State. The competence of the Security Council in relation to acting upon CNA matters will raise fewer problems, as it is possible for the Security Council to treat CNA as a threat to peace or violation of peace (it is doubtful whether CNA can cross the threshold established for aggression), provided that there is political will between the Permanent Members.\nCNA represents a challenge to the valid paradigm related to the use of force as its consequences cannot easily be classified as activities that threaten the values of the international community or as consequences that are of the severity equal to the use of physical force. The consequences can be spread over a broad spectrum from everyday IT disruption to widespread physical damages. In the former category would be for example the temporary paralysation of computer networks without any direct or indirect physical effects. The latter category could entail attacks against critical infrastructure systems with intent to cause physical damages to objects or even loss of life. Disruption of IT systems will most probably not equate to an armed attack as they would be more of nuisance if any anything else and can be dealt with in the domestic legal system with Computer Emergency Response Teams, judicial system and mutual assistance agreements, if applicable. In the case of physical damages and loss of life\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthe State has to evaluate whether the CNA caused the damages and are the damages analogous to an armed attack and would give right to resort to self-defence.\nA majority of acknowledged international law scholars are of the opinion that CNA can be regarded as an armed attack only if certain stringent criteria have been fulfilled, but mainly the consequences of the CNA must be equal to the consequences of a physical armed attack.[24] For example, economic and political measures of pressure will not constitute the violation of the ban to use force even though CNA is a very useful tool for disrupting commerce communications, etc. Thus, CNA will oscillate between measures adopted to apply political and economic pressure and the use of armed force. Incurrence of physical damage as a result of CNA is the pre-requisite to regard it as an armed attack. Unfortunately, this criterion cannot be treated as an absolute and it largely depends on the evaluation of the situation. The consequences of CNA should be assessed case-by-case to ascertain whether they are similar to the consequences of an armed attack or whether consequences stay below the level of threshold for use of force.\nThis categorisation is critical because upon it determines which type of countermeasures the defending State may choose in the given case. Professor M. Schmitt gives two explanatory examples: In the first case, \"computer network attacks disable a busy air traffic control system during horrendous weather. An airliner crashes and deaths result. No kinetic force has been used to destroy the airliner, but CNA was plainly the proximate cause of the tragedy.\"25 Causal relation between the CNA and the airplane crash is established. Opposite of this spectrum, CNA is used to attack \"a university computer network, designed to disrupt military related research occurring in campus laboratories\".26 This attack interferes with the conduct of research related to armed forces.\nLeaving aside the questions of attribution and State involvement in the attacks, Schmitt posits that the first case can be construed as use of force as it results in a loss of life, physical destruction and the consequences are comparable to the use of armed force.[27] Thus it would be lawful for the injured State to act in self-defence after such an incident even though no physical attack infringed its borders. In the second case, the consequences of CNA are less serious than in the first example and represent an assumed unlawful invasion into a computer network and the consequences of this\n\n139</www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\nactivity cannot be equal to the use of armed force, although scientific work related to the activities of armed forces has been disrupted.\nIf CNA can constitute use of armed force, the canonical restrictions established for the response to an armed attack in self-defence must be also applied thereto – that is, countermeasures taken to deal with a threat must be proportional and necessary to the threat. Another contentious issue is whether a State under a CNA attack can counter in self-defence with only CNA or with physical force. Law regarding use of force does not prescribe the measures to be adopted in self-defence as long as they are proportionate and necessary against the attack. Therefore it would be lawful for the injured State to resort to physical force if the aforementioned criteria are fulfilled.\nWithout concise legal regulation, it will be up to State practice to decide whether CNA will qualify as use of force or not. Such a case-based approach will not necessarily contribute to completely uniform practice but, if we are to look for a better consensus, the UN Security Council has the competence to qualify CNA as a threat to peace as provided by Article 39 of the UN Charter. The involvement of the Security Council would be beneficial for the Permanent Members or for larger countries that have sufficient clout to influence Permanent Members.\nThe involvement of the Security Council would be most probably of little use for non-members when the suspected or alleged acts of one of the Permanent Members are in question. In such cases the Security Council will most probably find itself in a veto deadlock. However, the Security Council could give more specific guidelines with regard to CNA incidents that fall into the 'grey area' of use of force or not. Then again this scenario could be counterproductive and against the self-interests of the Permanent Members because they are also potentially the most capable States for conducting such acts and gaining from such behaviour.\n## 2.2. Problems Related to Attribution of Responsibility in Case of CNA\nThe above lack of legal distinction should not be interpreted as a situation where everything explicitly not forbidden is permissible if the use of CNA does not violate *jus cogens* norms, customary law or treaty law. Unlawful or indiscriminate uses of CNA can violate generally recognised principles of international law (for example, the principle of non-intervention in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of a State). The injured State may demand reparations for injuries from the responsible State according to the principles of State responsibility. Nevertheless, the matter of State responsibility is especially complicated in the case of CNA as its source can be concealed. The subject of attack may be acting on false impressions of the attack coming from another State that is not necessarily responsible for the attack (for example, the responsible State D may launch CNA against State A through unbeknownst State C and masking the origin of the attack as to convey the impression that CNA comes from State B).\nThe relative ease of use of CNA has the potential to make States complacent with regard to State responsibility. If CNA has been State orchestrated, carried out by the agents of State, then the attribution of State responsibility is not complicated.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nNowadays laptops have more computing power than a room full of supercomputers in the 1970s and private individuals and organisations have access to high-speed internet connections from which to conduct multiple CNAs of different severity unbeknownst to their State of residence. This can create situations where State A knowingly or unknowingly tolerates CNA activities against State B and the attacks cross the threshold of armed attack. In this case State B regards itself as being under attack and starts to defend itself against the actions coming from State A. Therefore State A may unwillingly violate international law. By the text of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts the acts individuals of State A are attributable to it and the acts in question breach international obligation (prohibition of use of force, prohibition of non-intervention). State B can prove the support of State A with either signal or human reconnaissance (for example, identifying that the attack is being launched from a computer network of a government agency) or from official pronouncements of government officials.\nIf an individual living in State A is violating the rights of State B from the territory of the same State, State B may require the punishment of that respective individual from State A or initiation of extradition proceedings. Under aggravating circumstances, State B may adopt self-defence measures against an attack coming from State A in the territory of State A, but only if State A does not wish or is unable to avoid the appropriate actions against State B. Professor Y. Dinstein has classified the attribution of responsibility related to CNA originating from State A and directed against State B into four categories:\nThe first category consists of cases where citizens of State A launch CNA on their own initiative and for reasons only known to them. Their activities cannot be attributed to the government of State A. In the given case, State A should exercise sufficient executive duress against the individuals concerned so that they would either end or avoid launching the attacks against State B from the territory of State A.\nThe second category consists of cases when certain individuals or terrorists residing in State A launch CNA against State B for certain ideological, etc. reasons and the terrorists are not supported by State A. The obligations of State A are the same that were described under the first category.\nIn the third category terrorists supported by the State A launch CNA against State B. If the actions can be attributed to terrorists supported by State A, the terrorists could be treated as de facto representatives of State A as provided by the principles of State\n\nresponsibility, and State A will be held responsible to State B. The support given to terrorists by State A needs to be proven in this case.\nIn the fourth category government organs of State A launch CNA against State B. This represents the most complicated category as the actions of representatives of a State within the CNA sphere may have a number of forms – like espionage (which cannot be construed as the use of force), interruption of communication systems with no harm to humans (not grave enough to exceed the threshold of use of force) and cyber attacks that result in harm done to persons. The latter is treated as CNA that oversteps the threshold established for the use of force, but all the cases described in this category can be ascribed to State A.\n‘Active defence’ is also possible as a counter-measure against CNA, meaning that a State under CNA attack will attack the computer system of another State being the source of the CNA, considering that it will be later forced to apologise, in public, for the ‘counterattack’ or pay compensation.\nAt the current moment, launching a cyber attack by a State against another State represents the exception and not the rule. Most CNAs are perpetrated by individuals and non-State actors, but the attribution of such acts to them or the State harbouring them is complicated as evidence is hard to get or evidence can be misleading in the case of a sophisticated attack.\n## 2.3. Jus ad Bellum and CNA – Future Trends\nIn the near future, jus ad bellum will still be subject to an understanding that the use of force or threat of force within cyberspace will remain a fact to be identified separately in each case. The majority of cyber attacks will not exceed the threshold of use of force, but the valid paradigm may be subject to change if clear-cut cases emerge. For example, some scholars are of the opinion that the USA may decide to respond with armed force if a cyber attack launched by another State destroys the informa\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ntion systems of the New York Stock Exchange or causes physical damages thereto. While not being a military objective in the classical sense, the damages might be of the effect that they can be equated with the effects of use of force. The non liquet position, adopted by the Department of Defense of the USA in 1999, was the following:\nAs in all cases when a nation considers acting in self-defense, the nation considering such action will have to make its best judgment on how world opinion, or perhaps a body such as the International Court of Justice or the United Nations Security Council, is likely to apply the doctrine of self-defence to electronic attacks. As with many novel legal issues, we are likely to discover the answer only from experience.\nThis decade old position would seem to be still valid prima facie as there have been no clarifying developments in international law in this regard. If we are dealing with a situation where State A is supporting the activities of criminals and therefore CNA is launched against State B, responding with CNA to CNA is probably acceptable and justified. If CNA exceeds the threshold for the use of force, the traditional kinetic self-defence capabilities may be employed. But at the moment there does not exist a defined yardstick – CNA with grave consequences can be treated as the use of force in the future, while consequences that do not meet the threshold will not be treated as use of force.\nIn the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), CNA with consequences equal to use of force might be in some extreme cases regarded as events that may trigger the collective self-defence provision of Article 5 in the North Atlantic Treaty, although this seems doubtful. NATO’s own rhetoric has been in this field cautious, if not in the negative. This is due to the fact that current and previous attacks have not exceeded the threshold mentioned, and thus it is hard to predict the consequence of future CNA. Most probably the only article applicable in the NATO framework would be Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, in which case members will enter into consultations if the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the members is threatened. Only time and State practice will tell whether CNA\n\n143</www.ibls.com></www.defenselink.mil></nids.hq.nato.int></www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\ncan be realistically construed as use of force according to the UN Charter that would activate the self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty framework.\n## 3. Jus in Bello and CNA\n*Jus in bello* or international humanitarian law is a set of legal norms applicable in case of an armed conflict. When CNA is used in an armed conflict as a weapon then legal restrictions arising that regulate the use of weapons are applicable to CNA. These restrictions must be adhered to in self-defence operations when countering CNA with CNA or when responding to a physical attack with CNA. Also, in cases of use of CNA as an offensive weapon there is a need to understand the legal restrictions that regulate the selection of targets and the precautions in attack to be adopted.\n## 3.1. Legal Assumptions for the Implementation of Humanitarian Law in the Case of CNA\nIn international humanitarian law, there is no explicit provision that deals with either CNA or IO or cyber war. Nevertheless, the Martens Clause, which is regarded as customary law, states that “in cases not included in the [Hague] Regulations adopted by them, populations and belligerents remain under the protection and empire of the principles of international law, as they result from the usages established between civilised nations, from the laws of humanity and the requirements of the public conscience”. The modernised Martens Clause is contained in Article 1(2) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which states that “[i] n cases not covered by this Protocol or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of the principles of international law derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience”. The purpose of the Martens Clause is to affirm that the belligerents’ choice of methods or means of warfare is not unlimited and to eliminate any incidents in armed conflicts that are not covered by treaty regulation or customary law. Therefore, these principles reaffirm that even without explicit mention of CNA in modern treaties or customs, certain restrictions still apply.\nThe ICJ has reaffirmed that for weapons two customary law restrictions apply. Firstly, “[s]tates must never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military\n “The Court points to the Martens Clause, whose continuing existence and applicability is not to be doubted, as an affirmation that the principles and rules of humanitarian law apply to nuclear weapons”, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, 8 July 1996, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 87, <www.icj-cij.org 7495.pdf=\"\" 95=\"\" docket=\"\" files=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n Preamble of the 1899 Hague Convention (II) and 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land.\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ntargets\".43 Secondly, \"it is prohibited to cause unnecessary suffering to combatants; it is accordingly prohibited to use weapons causing them such harm or uselessly aggravating their suffering. ... [S]tates do not have unlimited freedom of choice of means in the weapons they use.\"44 All of the above and the restrictions applicable to weapons must be taken into account if using CNA in an armed conflict.45\nCNA must be capable of fulfilling the requirement set for weapons – that it can be used in an attack and aimed against specific targets. According to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its Additional Protocols of 1977, an attack is an act of violence,[46] which raises the question: Is CNA out-of-bounds for international humanitarian law because CNA is not a use of violence in the strictest sense of the word? The answer to this question is ‘no’ as for the purposes of humanitarian law an ‘attack’ shall represent a generic and a broad definition.[47] ‘Violence’ therefore in humanitarian law is defined through the consequence of physical (in case of objects and physical persons) or mental (in case of physical persons only) damage. CNA does most probably bring the described consequences, and therefore the use of CNA should be treated as an attack.\nStates also have an obligation when adopting a new weapon to conduct an assessment process to determine whether the use of such new weapon would under some or all conditions be prohibited or restricted under the standards of humanitarian or some other category of international law.[48] Unfortunately States have no obligation to publicise these findings, and thus the majority of these analyses are off the record and not available to the general public.\nThe discussion below is based on an assumption that there is an established armed conflict governed by the norms and principles prescribed in international humanitarian law. International humanitarian law will only apply to CNA if CNA's consequences are not just sporadic and isolated cases and are aimed to cause injuries, death, damages and destruction and where such consequences are predictable or desired. Humanitarian law is not applicable to CNA if these consequences do not include the causing of injuries, death, damages and destruction during an armed conflict (for example, the failure of a university intranet, downloading of financial information, temporary closing of access to internet or being involved in cyber espionage).\n\nErki Kodar\n## 3.2. CNA and Legitimate Targets\nIf CNA constitutes an attack or the use of violence in an armed conflict, the next question arises: What can be attacked with the weapon and what are the legitimate targets? For analytical purposes M. Schmitt divides targets into four categories: combatants and military targets; civilians, who directly participate in hostilities; objects used by both military and civilians; specifically protected objects.^[49]^\nCombatants and military targets are legitimate targets^[50]^ and can be targeted as long as the means and methods of attack comply with the restrictions established by humanitarian law.^[51]^ Therefore, aiming a CNA against combatants is permissible (for example, falsifying military air traffic control system navigational information that results in a military transport crash).^[52]^ When attacking military targets, the attack against a target must considerably contribute to military action and provide for a definite military advantage.^[53]^ Attack against the enemy's command and control networks, etc. does not create difficulties. However, which principles should be adopted in case of contestable targets: Can CNA be aimed against a banking system as the sustainability of armed forces depends on wealth? If a State is disproportionately dependent upon a specific industry (for example, oil), can CNA be used to stop production and distribution?^[54]^ Is it important that the attack is accompanied by physical destruction, not just inconvenience? If the purpose is only to cause inconvenience, this does not exceed the threshold of a military attack.\nCivilians represent individuals who are not considered combatants and civilian targets are targets that are not military targets. Therefore the armed forces have an obligation to direct their attacks against military objectives.^[55]^ Notwithstanding legitimate collateral damage, the ban on attacking civilians and civilian targets is practically absolute. Civilians lose their immunity when participating directly in hostilities by causing damages to the members or supplies of the enemy's armed forces.^[56]^ The use of civilians to launch CNA, as sub-contractors or civil servants, is full of legal problems and issues.^[57]^ The main problem with CNA is that it encompasses activities\n^[49]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, pp. 379–387.\n^[50]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52 notes that civilian objects shall not be the object of attack and that attacks shall be limited to military objectives.\n^[51]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(i) demands that the attackers must do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are not civilian objects, but military objectives.\n^[52]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 380.\n^[53]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3).\n^[54]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 381.

If civilians are directly involved in conducting CNA resulting in physical damages, such persons may be treated as unlawful combatants as they are participating directly in hostilities. Thus the IT-support personnel who are contributing to a CNA operation are at the risk of being considered targets. Civilians employed for the purpose of CNA represent a challenge for humanitarian law as they would not fit under the category of lawful combatants. When it is impossible to restrict the participation of civilians in military activities, this may endanger the civilian population as the enemy cannot make a clear distinction between combatants and civilians. Considering the skill-sets required for CNA it is more than reasonable to assume civilian involvement in such attacks, but the correct course of action should be that the members of armed forces conduct CNA.\nDual-use targets have both military and civil purposes (airports, railways, electrical systems, communication systems, factories producing material for both the civilian population and armed forces, etc.).58 If an object is being used for military purposes, it will be construed as a military target that can be attacked with all the permissible methods, including CNA. The aforementioned is also valid in a situation where the military objectives of a target are only secondary to the civilian objectives.\nHumanitarian law grants special protection to certain objects like dykes, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.59 Objects under special protection are defined as hazardous facilities as attacking them may launch dangerous forces and cause serious losses among the civilian population. As a general rule, such targets should not be attacked if the emission of dangerous forces cannot be controlled, but in the case of CNA it would be possible to neutralise these targets without launching any dangerous forces (which is an advantage, compared to kinetic weapons).60\n# 3.3. CNA's Compatibility with General Principles of Humanitarian Law\nOnce it has been determined that a target is lawful, the concordance of attack with general principles (and norms regarding targeting) of humanitarian law should be assessed before the attack is launched. These principles are the principle of distinction, prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, principle of proportionality and the prohibition of perfidy.\nHostilities under International Humanitarian Law, <www.icrc.org eng=\"\" direct%20participation-hostilities-ihl-311205=\"\" siteeng0.nsf=\"\" siteeng0.nsf/=\"\" /=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009; K.

Therefore, only military targets may be attacked. While CNA can be used in compliance with the principle of distinction, it can also be, like conventional weapons, used indiscriminately. No matter how attractive the idea of launching one extensive CNA campaign against the infrastructures of the State as a whole would be, including attacks against the civil sector, all CNA attacks must be aimed against military targets. The principle entails an obligation to minimise collateral damage and to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be disproportionate to the value of the military objective to be attacked.\nThe principle of distinction is closely knitted with the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks. Indiscriminate attack stands for attacks that are not aimed against a specific military objective, employing the methods and means of warfare, which cannot be aimed against a military target or employing the methods and means of warfare the consequence of which cannot be restricted. With CNA, the main threat is posed by the fact that it can be used for launching indiscriminate attacks, either deliberately or inadvertently. If malicious code CNA is employed that is uncontrollable and spreading through civilian systems, then such CNA is prohibited as an indiscriminate weapon. Taking into account that civilian and military networks are closely intertwined, the launched CNA must be of such sophistication that it conforms to the prohibition.\nThe principle of proportionality demands that conflicting interests must be weighed against each other – sufferings and damages versus military advantage. If military advantage outweighs incidental loss of life or damages to civilians or civilian objects, the attack is construed to be in compliance with the principle of proportionality (although the principle seems to be rather simple, its implementation in practice is extremely complicated). The majority of the problems of CNA in this equation are caused by knock-on effects that are “not directly and immediately caused by the attack, but nevertheless the product thereof – it is the problem of the effects caused by the effects of an attack”. As CNA may result in consequences which are initially unpredictable, one must always assess when planning an attack whether CNA would be accompanied by endangering the civil population or not. As the CNA attacks are complicated and may, with great probability, affect civilian systems, one must assess the causal damages and possible consequences during the planning stage of any operation prior to launching an attack and seek ways to mitigate these effects. Then again, CNA as a method may help to diminish collateral damage as it allows, instead of physical destruction, to ‘switch off’ the target (for example, instead of bombing an\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nairport it is possible to disturb the operation of flight control systems). CNA allows the attacker to directly control the consequences and minimise the risk to civilian population when the attained military advantage has been achieved.\nPerfidy is the feigning of protected status with the intent to kill, injure or capture an adversary. The prohibition of perfidy does not mean that ruses of war cannot be used. For the purposes of CNA, a ruse would be communication of incorrect information on location and manoeuvres, forging the information in the enemy’s reconnaissance database, etc. Perfidy would be pretending to have a protected status, and for the purposes of CNA this would be deceptive use of codes and signals given to medical transport by the International Civil Aviation Organization.\nWhile the humanitarian law in force is, in general, sufficient to protect individuals and objects from CNA, some uncertainties still exist. Even though it was impossible to predict the occurrence of CNA upon the emergence of current humanitarian law, some general standards are, nevertheless, applicable to CNA. At the same time CNA is characterised by specifics that also represent challenges and problems for the purposes of *jus in bello*: When does one consider CNA as an ‘attack’ in *jus in bello* and when only as a nuisance? But CNA is also a positive tool that allows for achieving military objectives without the causal damages that may result from kinetic attacks. It should also be remembered that CNA is a weapon, and any unlawful use may bring about incrimination for the commitment of war crimes.\n## 4. Possible Future Scenarios for the Regulation of CNA\nIn all probability a new defined structure of international law will not be introduced in the nearest future that would encapsulate all the cases of use of force with regard to cyberspace and the assessment of CNA *vis-à-vis* the right of self-defence. The issue is at the mercy of practical experiences of different States as there seems to be unwillingness to enter into international or regional agreements in this sphere. The *status quo* is useful for States with better CNA capabilities to maintain freedom of action. But there might be will to move towards some foreseeable developments.\nIn 1998 Russia attempted to initiate a United Nations General Assembly resolution dealing with the banning of some highly dangerous information operations.\n\n149</www.icrc.org>\nErki Kodar\nUnfortunately Russia has not volunteered to continue with this initiative over the last couple of years. The Naval War College in Newport, USA organised a CNA-conference in 1999, where the participants agreed that it would be useful and sensible to intensify international co-operation in the sphere of computer crime and cyber terrorism, but the time has not yet come for introducing a comprehensive regulation or banning in general.73 More extensive co-operation in the sphere of legal assistance was justified with the pretence for the criminalisation of actions threatening the international community to bring the criminals to justice and to simplify the extradition procedure.74\nIf legal assistance agreements are to serve as an effective instrument to fight cybercrime, it is necessary for them to have an explicit scope including either cybercrime or all crimes in general. If countries have not entered into extradition agreements, this means that such countries have neither a duty nor the domestic legal basis to extradite a person to another State.75 It would also be difficult to sustain the argument that the principle of *aut dedere aut judicare* is customary law with relation to CNA.76 An alternative to extradition would be to administer justice to a person who has committed CNA against another State in the CNA's State of origin.77\nDoc.

Estonia's Role in the Development of CNA-related Agreements or Standards?\nProfessor D. Hollis, who studied the cyber attacks against Estonia, suggests the creation of the right of hot pursuit available to a State which is the object of a cyber attack as \"nations could agree to waive sovereignty concerns and permit a direct response in certain cases, such as cyber attacks by terrorists that all nations might want thwarted\".[78] The thought would suggest that it would be appropriate to allow the attacked State to use counter measures to defend itself from an attack with extraterritorial measures even if such countermeasures would violate the sovereignty of the State being the origin of the attacks. Let us assume that hackers from Russia were behind the attacks against Estonia, and they had no connections with either the government or the armed forces. According to the current procedure, Estonia should ask Russia to maintain law and order in its territory as a kinetic counterattack would represent violation of Russia's sovereignty. According to proposed new standards of international law the States could leave aside all the worries related to their sovereignty and allow, in certain cases (as a community value all States should be interested in preventing the activities of cyber terrorists), the implementation of direct countermeasures by a State under attack.[79] While this sounds sensible, the development of an appropriate regulation is highly doubtful as States do not wish to open a Pandora's Box on the use of force, and the described scenario would leave numerous opportunities for serious misconduct and abuse.\nHollis also opines that Estonia wanted to construe cyber attack against the State as military activity (a new paradigm) and not as an act subject to penal power (the former paradigm). It can be assumed that in the future cyberspace will become the battlefield where military power is used, humanitarian law is applied and valid penal power framework may be imposed for combined effect.[80] In a military sense, cyberspace can be treated as an asymmetric field even now as States are not necessarily combating each other; it is rather the case of non-State actors positioning themselves against a State (or joining in with the State).\nThe establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia may represent a progressive step for the purposes of international law. The birth and activities of the centre may provide beneficial practical experiences and legal evidence. In addition, CNA can be regulated under national law, which could\nErki Kodar\nalso provide the grounds for the birth of internationally acknowledged standards in the future.\n## 4.2. Possible Developments of International Law in the Sphere of CNA\nA way ahead could be the conclusion of a multilateral agreement, involving specific and accurate standards applicable to CNA. In the given situation, the conclusion of a framework treaty that prescribes main and essential principles and gives States more freedom for the interpretation of specific aspects is more likely. Regionally, the conclusion of either bilateral or regional agreements (Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime represents a step in this direction) may be possible – provided that there is political will.\nOne way forward would be to draft new counterterrorism measures and agreements dealing with cybercrime and cyber terrorism. Measures preventing cybercrime have been taken both at the regional and global level to supplement national criminal law and international co-operation in the sphere of investigating and prosecuting such crimes. The main problem here is the difference of national law of different States or conflict of legal systems. Also, constitutional restrictions to extradition must be considered here. The format of an agreement for the prevention of cybercrime would be similar to the other agreements related to fighting terrorism wherein a certain type of behaviour shall qualify as terrorist activity and will be subject to a certain procedure between the member States. The aforementioned would provide a universal jurisdictional basis, or quasi-universal jurisdictional bases, for certain types of crime. At the moment, cyber terrorism is not taken seriously enough to be a subject for such agreements, and CNA must breach a high threshold to be considered as an issue worthy of international agreements. While the events that took place in Estonia in 2007 did not exceed this threshold, they can most certainly be interpreted as something more serious than common vandalism; therefore Estonia could have the opportunity to initiate the procedure for the conclusion of an agreement on the prevention of cyber terrorism. The main problem here is the fact that it is difficult to agree on which activities should be construed as cybercrime and ascertain where the line between common crime and terrorism should be drawn.\nAnother category of potential agreements could restrict the sovereign freedom of States – declarative agreements on lawful principles, armament control agreements and humanitarian law agreements. A declarative agreement would involve the most general principles that States would be willing to observe for the purposes of implementing international law (for example, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, stating that outer space is intended for common peaceful use by mankind). The pre-requisite for\n Russia invoked a ‘constitutional ban’ recently in the Litvinenko case and refused to extradite the prime suspect, Andrei Lugovoi.

The crux of the matter is the abrupt and powerful development of information technology as it would be impossible to predict future situations with the required level of accuracy upon the conclusion of such agreements, and consequently States may be hesitant to sign a carte blanche treaty. With armament control agreements States could commit themselves not to develop, acquire or transfer certain CNA capabilities or not to use their capabilities in a way that would be destabilising for the armament control regime or crisis management systems of another State. The pre-requisites and problems encountered when discussing this type of agreements are the same as with declarative agreements. Also, States will not always have a monopoly in CNA capabilities, considering the interests and capacities of hackers and cyber terrorists themselves. Humanitarian law agreements usually restrict the use of certain types of weapons in the case of an armed conflict. The restrictions are justified by stating that the weapon may cause unnecessary suffering. Information technology weapons, adopted in cyber war, may not necessarily fit the criteria on the grounds equivalent to conventional weapons. As general humanitarian law principles and standards can be applied to CNA, the efficiency of such agreements is doubtful. Special standards applicable to CNA would be more useful than agreements attempting to restrict the utilisation thereof.\nThe conclusion of multilateral conventions, restricting the liberty of freedom of States, is not considered as realistic in the near future, as only very few countries, if any, have an understanding of the capacities and vulnerabilities related to cyber war, sufficient to promote the long-term national interests of such States.\nBilateral agreements or agreements with a limited number of parties are most useful in a situation where a certain number of governments are directly involved with a concrete and common problem. This type of agreement represents a useful form of co-operation within regional scope. G8, the Council of Europe and the Organization of American States have used this to enter into regional conventions on cybercrime (and the NATO process is, potentially through cyber defence policy, moving in this direction). There still will be potential risks related to cases exceeding the limits of regional agreements or where the organisations are dominated by some of the member States, thus turning the convention into a dead letter agreement.\nOn an organisational plane the United Nations General Assembly has often shown initiative for the adoption of resolutions that request or invite the member States to pursue certain principles in their activities. While resolutions are not strictly\n Ibid., pp. 446–450; D. Hollis, ‘New Tools, New Rules: International Law and Information Operations’, *Temple University Legal Studies Research Paper* No. 2007-15, <ssrn.com abstract=\"1009224\">, visited 28 March 2009, pp. 16–17.\n G.

Unfortunately, at the moment, the General Assembly seems to be lacking the initiative. Considering the novelty of legal problems related to CNA, the adoption of resolutions on cyber war is probably not realistic over the next decade.\nOne alternative is represented by codification of customary law as a ‘manual’, as was done with the law of naval warfare by the International Institute of Humanitarian Law, or to enthuse progress by way of custom, codes of conduct or rules of engagement where codification would be based on experience. Unfortunately, the summoning of the experts of the given sphere is highly unlikely for the lack of customary law to be codified for the purposes of cyber war. Adoption of best-practices guidelines seems to be realistic.\nThe current mindset of States seems to be more domestic than international as States have identified that CNA prevention and control is closely connected with regular home and private users. Estonia adopted in 2008 the Cyber Security Strategy, and President Obama’s administration is conducting at the moment a 60-day cyber security review to ascertain how to apply cyber security policy. The Center of Strategic and International Studies Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency released a report on the same issues 8 December 2008. The aim of both documents is to raise the awareness of private computer users and the private sector to take responsibility for their computers and secure them against unwanted uses. Some authors argue that there exists a civic duty to secure private machines against becoming a part of botnet. Responsible civil conduct would minimise the risk of exploitation for the users but also for the State concerned as it enables the State to exercise diligence on its own territory and control, to a certain extent, that its sovereign territory is not used for conducting CNAs against other states. Thus States are trying to get their houses in order before moving towards international measures.\nIn general, future perspectives for the regulation of CNA are stuck behind several obstacles. Firstly, legislative problems related to CNA are not fully understood, mainly because of technological unpredictability. Secondly, traditional armament control agreements and humanitarian law conventions cannot be adapted for CNA\n Ibid., p. 452.\n J.

Thirdly, States have no explicit picture of the form of an international law regime that would promote their national interests in the best possible way in a long-term perspective with regard to CNA.\n# 5. Conclusion\nCNA is a challenge for international law because at the moment the law applies by way of analogy and interpretation in *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*. There are no express norms or customs that would regulate the uncertainty of CNA. The current framework of international law tries to fit the odd-shaped peg of CNA into a predetermined context, but this is not a satisfactory long-term solution. But some applicable rules and principles are better than no rules, better than a legal vacuum that would leave CNA out of legal reality. States and individuals with CNA capabilities will use the ambiguity to their advantage, but this will also bring State practice and more clarity to law, albeit through actions and consequences that may be harmful and unforeseen.\nWhen Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed that the life of law has not been of logic but of experience, he meant both the aforementioned and the possible future. The law is always behind the present, either by a step or two. Due to its flexible norm-creating procedure, international law only has to encounter a number of CNA incidents that will change the paradigm and give the required incentive to create legal regulation concerning the use of information weapons. Until then States need to cope with the existing law. Where it regards the use of CNA as use of force we can paraphrase Justice Stewart that we will know it when we see it or, in other words, law will recognise certain forms of CNA as the use of force only after it has been factually established that it has been the use of force.\nWhile the more capable States have adopted either ambivalent or even an attitude of ignorance with regard to the regulation of CNA over the last decade, some forms of co-operation may still be realistic, as demonstrated by the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. Estonia's contribution to NATO's cyber defence policy and the establishment of the Centre of Excellence may lead NATO towards another agreement, which may expand the member States' understanding of cyber law and cyber war and influence other States.\n155",

These cyber attacks, or computer network attacks (CNA), crippled the web pages and computer systems of ministries, banks, broadcasters, newspapers and emergency services with the possible aim of reducing the media coverage and dissemination of public information regarding the consequences of the relocation of the Bronze Soldier.² Some Estonian officials accused that the attacks were orchestrated or tolerated by the administration of the Russian Federation.³ The latter denied strongly any involvement in such acts and no definite attribution has been made in this case.⁴\nThe cyber attack on Estonia’s critical IT-systems was not unprecedented, but the combination of crude (ping floods, defacement) and sophisticated (DDoS, use of botnets) measures used in the attack delineated a new standard in cyber attacks against a State.⁵ Both qualitatively and quantitatively the attacks perpetrated were the largest of any known cyber attacks that have taken place in the world recently.\nEstonia’s case might be the best example to demonstrate that globalisation is in the modern world accompanied by an increased number of attacks against computer networks, and that the attacks may be launched by States, representatives of States, terrorists, criminals and/or cyber hooligans. Thus CNA is an asymmetric weapon ideal for use by powerful States that harness the required capability but also by clever individuals with harmful intents.\nConsidering the powerful technical advancements that have been made by information technology over the last three or four decades, it would be logical to assume\n2 NATO has produced a short documentary on the attacks called ‘Six Colours: War In Cyberspace’, <www.nato.int ebookshop=\"\" eix_colours=\"\" six_colours.html=\"\" video=\"\">, visited 30 March 2009.\n3 Daily Telegraph, ‘Russia Accused over Estonian “Cyber-Terrorism”’, 18 May 2007, <www.telegraph.co.uk 1551850=\"\" news=\"\" Russia-accused-over-Estonian-cyber-terrorism.html=\"\" worldnews=\"\" worldnews,=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009; Times Online, ‘Estonia Accuses Russia of “Waging Cyber War”’, 17 May 2007, <www.timesonline.co.uk 28=\"\" article1802959.ece=\"\" europe=\"\" et=\"\" tol=\"\" www.world=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009.\n4 The Guardian, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, 17 May 2007, <www.guardian.co.uk 17=\"\" 2007=\"\" may=\"\" topstories3.russia=\"\" world=\"\" way=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009; RIA Novosti, ‘Estonia Has No Evidence of Kremlin Involvement in Cyber Attacks’, 6 September 2007, <en.rian.ru 20070906=\"\" 76959190.html=\"\" world=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009.\n5 In 2005 the US Defence Department reported that Chinese web sites had been heavily used to target its computer networks.

This assumption is wrong. When discussing cyber attacks in terms of public international law and humanitarian law, we are faced with a relatively new phenomenon, which does not fit into any global legal framework regulating IT activities. There has been progress on a regional level – the Council of Europe has adopted the Convention on Cybercrime and the United States of America is keen to regulate cybercrime issues in legal assistance agreements. $^{6}$  Nevertheless, these advancements are mostly confined to the realm of domestic criminal law and do not address the issues of international law. At the current time it would appear that the lack of sufficient State practice and opinio juris has not allowed international customary law to develop that would concisely deal with cyber attacks.\nThere are several reasons for the lack of a comprehensive legal regulation – various development levels of countries (third world versus developed countries); predictable benefits accompanying the absence of specific frameworks (maintenance of sovereign freedom of action); and the understanding that cyber attacks represent a new legal phenomenon. There does not exist a notable selection of legal materials that would analyse the issue. I. Detter concurs that “[t]he problem has not been approached in any systematic way although numerous institutions and governments have expressed concern about the problem. ... However, there has been little, if any, academic comment.”7 Research publications or books have dealt with problem briefly or not with sufficient in-depth analysis.8 The US Naval War College’s so-called “Blue Book”9 and the 1999 US Department of Defense study remain the foundational materials in this field.10 Despite the ambiguity of the legal situation, more than 30 different countries worldwide, including USA, China, India and Russia, have publicly admitted\n6 The 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n7 I.

Both civil and military structures use the same technical facilities. Due to the consolidation of both structures there exists a danger that the initiated CNA will transform, either deliberately or un-deliberately, from one structure to another, thus accompanied by serious consequences. CNA also challenges common understanding of geographical spaces and territorial integrity, as attacks may cross several State borders.^^\nCNA demands that military operations planners and high-ranking government officials take into account the following questions of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. For example, does a cyber attack constitute an ‘armed attack’ under the United Nations Charter? Does there have to be physical damage to property or loss of life before a State can exercise the right of self-defence? What would be a proportionate response against such an attack? What are the evaluation criteria for targets that are dual-use targets used both by military and civil systems? Is the cyber attack a violation of criminal or international law? In what cases is there State responsibility for acts of individuals acting from its own territory? What could be the future perspectives for the regulation of CNA?\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a general assessment of the legal consequences of CNA according to jus ad bellum and jus in bello, mapping the problems encountered in both spheres of law upon the application of international law on CNA, and to suggest possible future perspectives for the regulation of CNA.",
    "## 2. Jus ad Bellum and CNA": "The foundation for the contemporary jus ad bellum, the law regarding the use of force, is the Charter of the United Nations.^^ According to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter,\n17 Ibid.\n18 Ibid.\n19 By conducting a CNA with a ‘botnet’, the attacking computers may reside in different jurisdictions and the data stream may cross State borders by way of masking the initial source of the attack. Therefore the target may have to counter attacks that come from different jurisdictions and may have a concise centre of origin, but tracking the origin can be difficult, if not impossible.\n20 Hereinafter also ‘UN Charter’.\nErki Kodar\n“[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. Such a ban of the use of force is regarded as an imperative norm of international law, *jus cogens*, from which no deviation is allowed, and it is binding for all States in the world community.”²¹\nFor further analysis, it is important to know the two UN Charter exceptions from the ban of using force, namely, the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State (Article 51 of UN Charter) and use of force within the framework of a collective security system (Articles 39 and 42 of UN Charter).\n## 2.1. Applying the UN Charter to CNA – Can CNA Constitute Use of Force?\nThe first obstacle to the implementation of the regulation regarding the use of force is the following question: Could CNA be treated as an armed attack? Although Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does not elaborate on what could be interpreted as a threat or use of force, the *travaux préparatoires* of the Charter indicate that this must be an armed attack.²² More so, the Charter mentions that each State has the inherent right of an individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State. The competence of the Security Council in relation to acting upon CNA matters will raise fewer problems, as it is possible for the Security Council to treat CNA as a threat to peace or violation of peace (it is doubtful whether CNA can cross the threshold established for aggression), provided that there is political will between the Permanent Members.²³\nCNA represents a challenge to the valid paradigm related to the use of force as its consequences cannot easily be classified as activities that threaten the values of the international community or as consequences that are of the severity equal to the use of physical force. The consequences can be spread over a broad spectrum from everyday IT disruption to widespread physical damages. In the former category would be for example the temporary paralysation of computer networks without any direct or indirect physical effects. The latter category could entail attacks against critical infrastructure systems with intent to cause physical damages to objects or even loss of life. Disruption of IT systems will most probably not equate to an armed attack as they would be more of nuisance if any anything else and can be dealt with in the domestic legal system with Computer Emergency Response Teams, judicial system and mutual assistance agreements, if applicable. In the case of physical damages and loss of life\n21 M. Shaw, *International Law*, 5th ed. (Cambridge University Press, 2006) p. 1018.\n22 On the interpretation of the term ‘armed attack’ in light of CNA, see M. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’, 37 *Columbia Journal of Transnational Law* (1999) pp. 900–908. On the issue what constitutes a ‘force’, see Shaw, *supra* note 21, pp. 1019–1021.\n23 Schmitt, *supra* note 22, pp. 924–927.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthe State has to evaluate whether the CNA caused the damages and are the damages analogous to an armed attack and would give right to resort to self-defence.\nA majority of acknowledged international law scholars are of the opinion that CNA can be regarded as an armed attack only if certain stringent criteria have been fulfilled, but mainly the consequences of the CNA must be equal to the consequences of a physical armed attack. For example, economic and political measures of pressure will not constitute the violation of the ban to use force even though CNA is a very useful tool for disrupting commerce communications, etc. Thus, CNA will oscillate between measures adopted to apply political and economic pressure and the use of armed force. Incurrence of physical damage as a result of CNA is the pre-requisite to regard it as an armed attack. Unfortunately, this criterion cannot be treated as an absolute and it largely depends on the evaluation of the situation. The consequences of CNA should be assessed case-by-case to ascertain whether they are similar to the consequences of an armed attack or whether consequences stay below the level of threshold for use of force.\nThis categorisation is critical because upon it determines which type of countermeasures the defending State may choose in the given case. Professor M. Schmitt gives two explanatory examples: In the first case, \"computer network attacks disable a busy air traffic control system during horrendous weather. An airliner crashes and deaths result. No kinetic force has been used to destroy the airliner, but CNA was plainly the proximate cause of the tragedy.\"25 Causal relation between the CNA and the airplane crash is established. Opposite of this spectrum, CNA is used to attack \"a university computer network, designed to disrupt military related research occurring in campus laboratories\".26 This attack interferes with the conduct of research related to armed forces.\nLeaving aside the questions of attribution and State involvement in the attacks, Schmitt posits that the first case can be construed as use of force as it results in a loss of life, physical destruction and the consequences are comparable to the use of armed force. Thus it would be lawful for the injured State to act in self-defence after such an incident even though no physical attack infringed its borders. In the second case, the consequences of CNA are less serious than in the first example and represent an assumed unlawful invasion into a computer network and the consequences of this\n24 D. Silver, ‘Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force under Article 2(4)’, 76 International Law Studies (2002) pp. 84–92; Y. Dinstein, ‘Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense’, 76 International Law Studies (2002) pp. 102–105; Schmitt, supra note 22, pp. 914–915; An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations, Department of Defense, Office of General Counsel, <www.au.af.mil au=\"\" awc=\"\" doc-io-legal=\"\" dwc=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009, pp. 18–25.\n25 Schmitt, supra note 22, p. 916.\n26 Ibid.\n27 Ibid.\n139</www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\nactivity cannot be equal to the use of armed force, although scientific work related to the activities of armed forces has been disrupted.\nIf CNA can constitute use of armed force, the canonical restrictions established for the response to an armed attack in self-defence must be also applied thereto – that is, countermeasures taken to deal with a threat must be proportional and necessary to the threat. Another contentious issue is whether a State under a CNA attack can counter in self-defence with only CNA or with physical force. Law regarding use of force does not prescribe the measures to be adopted in self-defence as long as they are proportionate and necessary against the attack. Therefore it would be lawful for the injured State to resort to physical force if the aforementioned criteria are fulfilled.\nWithout concise legal regulation, it will be up to State practice to decide whether CNA will qualify as use of force or not. Such a case-based approach will not necessarily contribute to completely uniform practice but, if we are to look for a better consensus, the UN Security Council has the competence to qualify CNA as a threat to peace as provided by Article 39 of the UN Charter. The involvement of the Security Council would be beneficial for the Permanent Members or for larger countries that have sufficient clout to influence Permanent Members.\nThe involvement of the Security Council would be most probably of little use for non-members when the suspected or alleged acts of one of the Permanent Members are in question. In such cases the Security Council will most probably find itself in a veto deadlock. However, the Security Council could give more specific guidelines with regard to CNA incidents that fall into the 'grey area' of use of force or not. Then again this scenario could be counterproductive and against the self-interests of the Permanent Members because they are also potentially the most capable States for conducting such acts and gaining from such behaviour.\n## 2.2. Problems Related to Attribution of Responsibility in Case of CNA\nThe above lack of legal distinction should not be interpreted as a situation where everything explicitly not forbidden is permissible if the use of CNA does not violate *jus cogens* norms, customary law or treaty law. Unlawful or indiscriminate uses of CNA can violate generally recognised principles of international law (for example, the principle of non-intervention in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of a State). The injured State may demand reparations for injuries from the responsible State according to the principles of State responsibility. Nevertheless, the matter of State responsibility is especially complicated in the case of CNA as its source can be concealed. The subject of attack may be acting on false impressions of the attack coming from another State that is not necessarily responsible for the attack (for example, the responsible State D may launch CNA against State A through unbeknownst State C and masking the origin of the attack as to convey the impression that CNA comes from State B).\nThe relative ease of use of CNA has the potential to make States complacent with regard to State responsibility. If CNA has been State orchestrated, carried out by the agents of State, then the attribution of State responsibility is not complicated.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nNowadays laptops have more computing power than a room full of supercomputers in the 1970s and private individuals and organisations have access to high-speed internet connections from which to conduct multiple CNAs of different severity unbeknownst to their State of residence. This can create situations where State A knowingly or unknowingly tolerates CNA activities against State B and the attacks cross the threshold of armed attack. In this case State B regards itself as being under attack and starts to defend itself against the actions coming from State A. Therefore State A may unwillingly violate international law. By the text of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts²⁸ the acts individuals of State A are attributable to it and the acts in question breach international obligation (prohibition of use of force, prohibition of non-intervention).²⁹ State B can prove the support of State A with either signal or human reconnaissance (for example, identifying that the attack is being launched from a computer network of a government agency) or from official pronouncements of government officials.\nIf an individual living in State A is violating the rights of State B from the territory of the same State, State B may require the punishment of that respective individual from State A or initiation of extradition proceedings. Under aggravating circumstances, State B may adopt self-defence measures against an attack coming from State A in the territory of State A, but only if State A does not wish or is unable to avoid the appropriate actions against State B. Professor Y. Dinstein has classified the attribution of responsibility related to CNA originating from State A and directed against State B into four categories:³⁰\nThe first category consists of cases where citizens of State A launch CNA on their own initiative and for reasons only known to them. Their activities cannot be attributed to the government of State A. In the given case, State A should exercise sufficient executive duress against the individuals concerned so that they would either end or avoid launching the attacks against State B from the territory of State A.³¹\nThe second category consists of cases when certain individuals or terrorists residing in State A launch CNA against State B for certain ideological, etc. reasons and the terrorists are not supported by State A. The obligations of State A are the same that were described under the first category.³²\nIn the third category terrorists supported by the State A launch CNA against State B. If the actions can be attributed to terrorists supported by State A, the terrorists could be treated as de facto representatives of State A as provided by the principles of State\n28 Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-third Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001).\n29 Article 2 of 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n30 Dinstein, supra note 24, p. 103.\n31 Ibid., pp. 103–104.\n32 Ibid.\n141\nErki Kodar\nresponsibility, and State A will be held responsible to State B.³³ The support given to terrorists by State A needs to be proven in this case.³⁴\nIn the fourth category government organs of State A launch CNA against State B. This represents the most complicated category as the actions of representatives of a State within the CNA sphere may have a number of forms – like espionage (which cannot be construed as the use of force), interruption of communication systems with no harm to humans (not grave enough to exceed the threshold of use of force) and cyber attacks that result in harm done to persons. The latter is treated as CNA that oversteps the threshold established for the use of force, but all the cases described in this category can be ascribed to State A.³⁵\n‘Active defence’ is also possible as a counter-measure against CNA, meaning that a State under CNA attack will attack the computer system of another State being the source of the CNA, considering that it will be later forced to apologise, in public, for the ‘counterattack’ or pay compensation.\nAt the current moment, launching a cyber attack by a State against another State represents the exception and not the rule.³⁶ Most CNAs are perpetrated by individuals and non-State actors, but the attribution of such acts to them or the State harbouring them is complicated as evidence is hard to get or evidence can be misleading in the case of a sophisticated attack.\n## 2.3. Jus ad Bellum and CNA – Future Trends\nIn the near future, jus ad bellum will still be subject to an understanding that the use of force or threat of force within cyberspace will remain a fact to be identified separately in each case. The majority of cyber attacks will not exceed the threshold of use of force, but the valid paradigm may be subject to change if clear-cut cases emerge. For example, some scholars are of the opinion that the USA may decide to respond with armed force if a cyber attack launched by another State destroys the informa\n33 Article 8 of 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n34 Dinstein, supra note 24, p. 104.\n35 Ibid., p. 105.\n36 Currently the use of CNA against a State occurs in an armed conflict as an additional measure to classical kinetic force. The conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008 also had occurrences of CNA use but it is open whether these were carried out by Russia or ‘voluntary hackers’.

The non liquet position, adopted by the Department of Defense of the USA in 1999, was the following:\nAs in all cases when a nation considers acting in self-defense, the nation considering such action will have to make its best judgment on how world opinion, or perhaps a body such as the International Court of Justice or the United Nations Security Council, is likely to apply the doctrine of self-defence to electronic attacks. As with many novel legal issues, we are likely to discover the answer only from experience.³⁸\nThis decade old position would seem to be still valid prima facie as there have been no clarifying developments in international law in this regard. If we are dealing with a situation where State A is supporting the activities of criminals and therefore CNA is launched against State B, responding with CNA to CNA is probably acceptable and justified. If CNA exceeds the threshold for the use of force, the traditional kinetic self-defence capabilities may be employed. But at the moment there does not exist a defined yardstick – CNA with grave consequences can be treated as the use of force in the future, while consequences that do not meet the threshold will not be treated as use of force.\nIn the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), CNA with consequences equal to use of force might be in some extreme cases regarded as events that may trigger the collective self-defence provision of Article 5 in the North Atlantic Treaty, although this seems doubtful. NATO’s own rhetoric has been in this field cautious, if not in the negative.³⁹ This is due to the fact that current and previous attacks have not exceeded the threshold mentioned, and thus it is hard to predict the consequence of future CNA. Most probably the only article applicable in the NATO framework would be Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, in which case members will enter into consultations if the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the members is threatened. Only time and State practice will tell whether CNA\n37 Schmitt, supra note 13, p. 377.\n38 An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations, Department of Defense, Office of General Counsel, <www.au.af.mil au=\"\" dodo-io-legal=\"\" dwc=\"\" awcgate=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009, p. 19.\n39 Press conference with NATO Secretary General following the informal meeting of NATO Defence Ministers, 8 February 2008, <nids.hq.nato.int 2008=\"\" 2008/s080208c.html=\"\" docu=\"\" speech=\"\">, visited on 27 March 2009; DefenseLink, ‘NATO Leader Expresses Cautious Optimism about Afghanistan’, <www.defenselink.mil news=\"\" newsarticle.aspx?id=\"48910\">, visited on 27 March 2009; IBLS, ‘NATO Agrees To Create Cyber Defence Management Authority’, 15 May 2008, <www.ibls.com 2009;=\"\" 4=\"\" and=\"\" approach=\"\" en=\"\" infosociety=\"\" infosociety.nato-agrees-common-approach-cyber-defence=\"\" internet_law_news_portal_view.aspx?s=\"latestnews&amp;id=2054\" name=\"\" nato-agrees-common-approach-cyber-defence=\"\" site=\"\" www.euractiv.com=\"\">, visited on 27 March 2009.\n143</www.ibls.com></www.defenselink.mil></nids.hq.nato.int></www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\ncan be realistically construed as use of force according to the UN Charter that would activate the self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty framework.",
    "## 3. Jus in Bello and CNA": "*Jus in bello* or international humanitarian law is a set of legal norms applicable in case of an armed conflict. When CNA is used in an armed conflict as a weapon then legal restrictions arising that regulate the use of weapons are applicable to CNA. These restrictions must be adhered to in self-defence operations when countering CNA with CNA or when responding to a physical attack with CNA. Also, in cases of use of CNA as an offensive weapon there is a need to understand the legal restrictions that regulate the selection of targets and the precautions in attack to be adopted.\n## 3.1. Legal Assumptions for the Implementation of Humanitarian Law in the Case of CNA\nIn international humanitarian law, there is no explicit provision that deals with either CNA or IO or cyber war. Nevertheless, the Martens Clause, which is regarded as customary law,⁴⁰ states that “in cases not included in the [Hague] Regulations adopted by them, populations and belligerents remain under the protection and empire of the principles of international law, as they result from the usages established between civilised nations, from the laws of humanity and the requirements of the public conscience”.⁴¹ The modernised Martens Clause is contained in Article 1(2) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which states that “[i] n cases not covered by this Protocol or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of the principles of international law derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience”.⁴² The purpose of the Martens Clause is to affirm that the belligerents’ choice of methods or means of warfare is not unlimited and to eliminate any incidents in armed conflicts that are not covered by treaty regulation or customary law. Therefore, these principles reaffirm that even without explicit mention of CNA in modern treaties or customs, certain restrictions still apply.\nThe ICJ has reaffirmed that for weapons two customary law restrictions apply. Firstly, “[s]tates must never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military\n⁴⁰ “The Court points to the Martens Clause, whose continuing existence and applicability is not to be doubted, as an affirmation that the principles and rules of humanitarian law apply to nuclear weapons”, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, 8 July 1996, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 87, <www.icj-cij.org 7495.pdf=\"\" 95=\"\" docket=\"\" files=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n⁴¹ Preamble of the 1899 Hague Convention (II) and 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land.\n⁴² 1977 Additional Protocol 1, Article 1(2).</www.icj-cij.org>\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ntargets\".43 Secondly, \"it is prohibited to cause unnecessary suffering to combatants; it is accordingly prohibited to use weapons causing them such harm or uselessly aggravating their suffering. ... [S]tates do not have unlimited freedom of choice of means in the weapons they use.\"44 All of the above and the restrictions applicable to weapons must be taken into account if using CNA in an armed conflict.45\nCNA must be capable of fulfilling the requirement set for weapons – that it can be used in an attack and aimed against specific targets. According to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its Additional Protocols of 1977, an attack is an act of violence, which raises the question: Is CNA out-of-bounds for international humanitarian law because CNA is not a use of violence in the strictest sense of the word? The answer to this question is ‘no’ as for the purposes of humanitarian law an ‘attack’ shall represent a generic and a broad definition. ‘Violence’ therefore in humanitarian law is defined through the consequence of physical (in case of objects and physical persons) or mental (in case of physical persons only) damage. CNA does most probably bring the described consequences, and therefore the use of CNA should be treated as an attack.\nStates also have an obligation when adopting a new weapon to conduct an assessment process to determine whether the use of such new weapon would under some or all conditions be prohibited or restricted under the standards of humanitarian or some other category of international law. Unfortunately States have no obligation to publicise these findings, and thus the majority of these analyses are off the record and not available to the general public.\nThe discussion below is based on an assumption that there is an established armed conflict governed by the norms and principles prescribed in international humanitarian law. International humanitarian law will only apply to CNA if CNA's consequences are not just sporadic and isolated cases and are aimed to cause injuries, death, damages and destruction and where such consequences are predictable or desired. Humanitarian law is not applicable to CNA if these consequences do not include the causing of injuries, death, damages and destruction during an armed conflict (for example, the failure of a university intranet, downloading of financial information, temporary closing of access to internet or being involved in cyber espionage).\n43 Nuclear Weapons case, supra note 40, para. 78.\n44 Ibid.\n45 It has been argued that “[i]t is perfectly reasonable to assume that also the new forms of CNA, which do not involve the use of traditional weapons, are subject to IHL just as any new weapon or delivery system has been so far when used in an armed conflict”, in Dörmann, supra note 13.\n46 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 49(1).\n47 Commentary of the 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 49, <www.icrc.org 470-750062?opendocument=\"\" ihl.nsf=\"\" com=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n48 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 36.</www.icrc.org>\nErki Kodar\n## 3.2. CNA and Legitimate Targets\nIf CNA constitutes an attack or the use of violence in an armed conflict, the next question arises: What can be attacked with the weapon and what are the legitimate targets? For analytical purposes M. Schmitt divides targets into four categories: combatants and military targets; civilians, who directly participate in hostilities; objects used by both military and civilians; specifically protected objects.^^\nCombatants and military targets are legitimate targets^^ and can be targeted as long as the means and methods of attack comply with the restrictions established by humanitarian law.^^ Therefore, aiming a CNA against combatants is permissible (for example, falsifying military air traffic control system navigational information that results in a military transport crash).^^ When attacking military targets, the attack against a target must considerably contribute to military action and provide for a definite military advantage.^^ Attack against the enemy's command and control networks, etc. does not create difficulties. However, which principles should be adopted in case of contestable targets: Can CNA be aimed against a banking system as the sustainability of armed forces depends on wealth? If a State is disproportionately dependent upon a specific industry (for example, oil), can CNA be used to stop production and distribution?^^ Is it important that the attack is accompanied by physical destruction, not just inconvenience? If the purpose is only to cause inconvenience, this does not exceed the threshold of a military attack.\nCivilians represent individuals who are not considered combatants and civilian targets are targets that are not military targets. Therefore the armed forces have an obligation to direct their attacks against military objectives.^^ Notwithstanding legitimate collateral damage, the ban on attacking civilians and civilian targets is practically absolute. Civilians lose their immunity when participating directly in hostilities by causing damages to the members or supplies of the enemy's armed forces.^^ The use of civilians to launch CNA, as sub-contractors or civil servants, is full of legal problems and issues.^^ The main problem with CNA is that it encompasses activities\n^^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, pp. 379–387.\n^^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52 notes that civilian objects shall not be the object of attack and that attacks shall be limited to military objectives.\n^^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(i) demands that the attackers must do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are not civilian objects, but military objectives.\n^^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 380.\n^^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3).\n^^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 381. This is an issue of interpretation of the 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3). Some States, like the USA, regard economic targets as legitimate targets.\n^^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Articles 48, 50(1), 51(2) and 52(1).\n^^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 51(3).\n^^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 384; Dörmann, *supra* note 13; 2003 Summary Report prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross on the Direct Participation in\n146\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthat can be realistically conducted by government agencies and authorities rather than by members of armed forces. If civilians are directly involved in conducting CNA resulting in physical damages, such persons may be treated as unlawful combatants as they are participating directly in hostilities. Thus the IT-support personnel who are contributing to a CNA operation are at the risk of being considered targets. Civilians employed for the purpose of CNA represent a challenge for humanitarian law as they would not fit under the category of lawful combatants. When it is impossible to restrict the participation of civilians in military activities, this may endanger the civilian population as the enemy cannot make a clear distinction between combatants and civilians. Considering the skill-sets required for CNA it is more than reasonable to assume civilian involvement in such attacks, but the correct course of action should be that the members of armed forces conduct CNA.\nDual-use targets have both military and civil purposes (airports, railways, electrical systems, communication systems, factories producing material for both the civilian population and armed forces, etc.).58 If an object is being used for military purposes, it will be construed as a military target that can be attacked with all the permissible methods, including CNA. The aforementioned is also valid in a situation where the military objectives of a target are only secondary to the civilian objectives.\nHumanitarian law grants special protection to certain objects like dykes, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.59 Objects under special protection are defined as hazardous facilities as attacking them may launch dangerous forces and cause serious losses among the civilian population. As a general rule, such targets should not be attacked if the emission of dangerous forces cannot be controlled, but in the case of CNA it would be possible to neutralise these targets without launching any dangerous forces (which is an advantage, compared to kinetic weapons).60\n# 3.3. CNA's Compatibility with General Principles of Humanitarian Law\nOnce it has been determined that a target is lawful, the concordance of attack with general principles (and norms regarding targeting) of humanitarian law should be assessed before the attack is launched. These principles are the principle of distinction, prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, principle of proportionality and the prohibition of perfidy.\nHostilities under International Humanitarian Law, <www.icrc.org eng=\"\" direct%20participation-hostilities-ihl-311205=\"\" siteeng0.nsf=\"\" siteeng0.nsf/=\"\" /=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009; K.

While CNA can be used in compliance with the principle of distinction, it can also be, like conventional weapons, used indiscriminately. No matter how attractive the idea of launching one extensive CNA campaign against the infrastructures of the State as a whole would be, including attacks against the civil sector, all CNA attacks must be aimed against military targets. The principle entails an obligation to minimise collateral damage and to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be disproportionate to the value of the military objective to be attacked.\nThe principle of distinction is closely knitted with the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks. Indiscriminate attack stands for attacks that are not aimed against a specific military objective, employing the methods and means of warfare, which cannot be aimed against a military target or employing the methods and means of warfare the consequence of which cannot be restricted.⁶² With CNA, the main threat is posed by the fact that it can be used for launching indiscriminate attacks, either deliberately or inadvertently. If malicious code CNA is employed that is uncontrollable and spreading through civilian systems, then such CNA is prohibited as an indiscriminate weapon.⁶³ Taking into account that civilian and military networks are closely intertwined, the launched CNA must be of such sophistication that it conforms to the prohibition.\nThe principle of proportionality demands that conflicting interests must be weighed against each other – sufferings and damages versus military advantage.⁶⁴ If military advantage outweighs incidental loss of life or damages to civilians or civilian objects, the attack is construed to be in compliance with the principle of proportionality (although the principle seems to be rather simple, its implementation in practice is extremely complicated). The majority of the problems of CNA in this equation are caused by knock-on effects that are “not directly and immediately caused by the attack, but nevertheless the product thereof – it is the problem of the effects caused by the effects of an attack”.⁶⁵ As CNA may result in consequences which are initially unpredictable, one must always assess when planning an attack whether CNA would be accompanied by endangering the civil population or not. As the CNA attacks are complicated and may, with great probability, affect civilian systems, one must assess the causal damages and possible consequences during the planning stage of any operation prior to launching an attack and seek ways to mitigate these effects. Then again, CNA as a method may help to diminish collateral damage as it allows, instead of physical destruction, to ‘switch off’ the target (for example, instead of bombing an\n61 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 48.\n62 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 51(4).\n63 Schmitt, supra note 13, p. 389.\n64 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(iii).\n65 Schmitt, supra note 13, p. 392.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nairport it is possible to disturb the operation of flight control systems).⁶⁶ CNA allows the attacker to directly control the consequences and minimise the risk to civilian population when the attained military advantage has been achieved.\nPerfidy is the feigning of protected status with the intent to kill, injure or capture an adversary.⁶⁷ The prohibition of perfidy does not mean that ruses of war cannot be used.⁶⁸ For the purposes of CNA, a ruse would be communication of incorrect information on location and manoeuvres, forging the information in the enemy’s reconnaissance database, etc.⁶⁹ Perfidy would be pretending to have a protected status, and for the purposes of CNA this would be deceptive use of codes and signals given to medical transport by the International Civil Aviation Organization.⁷⁰\nWhile the humanitarian law in force is, in general, sufficient to protect individuals and objects from CNA, some uncertainties still exist. Even though it was impossible to predict the occurrence of CNA upon the emergence of current humanitarian law, some general standards are, nevertheless, applicable to CNA. At the same time CNA is characterised by specifics that also represent challenges and problems for the purposes of *jus in bello*: When does one consider CNA as an ‘attack’ in *jus in bello* and when only as a nuisance? But CNA is also a positive tool that allows for achieving military objectives without the causal damages that may result from kinetic attacks. It should also be remembered that CNA is a weapon, and any unlawful use may bring about incrimination for the commitment of war crimes.",
    "## 4. Possible Future Scenarios for the Regulation of CNA": "In all probability a new defined structure of international law will not be introduced in the nearest future that would encapsulate all the cases of use of force with regard to cyberspace and the assessment of CNA *vis-à-vis* the right of self-defence. The issue is at the mercy of practical experiences of different States as there seems to be unwillingness to enter into international or regional agreements in this sphere. The *status quo* is useful for States with better CNA capabilities to maintain freedom of action. But there might be will to move towards some foreseeable developments.⁷¹\nIn 1998 Russia attempted to initiate a United Nations General Assembly resolution dealing with the banning of some highly dangerous information operations.⁷²\n66 *Ibid.*, p. 394.\n67 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 37(1).\n68 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 37(2).\n69 K.

The Naval War College in Newport, USA organised a CNA-conference in 1999, where the participants agreed that it would be useful and sensible to intensify international co-operation in the sphere of computer crime and cyber terrorism, but the time has not yet come for introducing a comprehensive regulation or banning in general.73 More extensive co-operation in the sphere of legal assistance was justified with the pretence for the criminalisation of actions threatening the international community to bring the criminals to justice and to simplify the extradition procedure.74\nIf legal assistance agreements are to serve as an effective instrument to fight cybercrime, it is necessary for them to have an explicit scope including either cybercrime or all crimes in general. If countries have not entered into extradition agreements, this means that such countries have neither a duty nor the domestic legal basis to extradite a person to another State.75 It would also be difficult to sustain the argument that the principle of *aut dedere aut judicare* is customary law with relation to CNA.76 An alternative to extradition would be to administer justice to a person who has committed CNA against another State in the CNA's State of origin.77\nDoc.

Estonia's Role in the Development of CNA-related Agreements or Standards?\nProfessor D. Hollis, who studied the cyber attacks against Estonia, suggests the creation of the right of hot pursuit available to a State which is the object of a cyber attack as \"nations could agree to waive sovereignty concerns and permit a direct response in certain cases, such as cyber attacks by terrorists that all nations might want thwarted\". The thought would suggest that it would be appropriate to allow the attacked State to use counter measures to defend itself from an attack with extraterritorial measures even if such countermeasures would violate the sovereignty of the State being the origin of the attacks. Let us assume that hackers from Russia were behind the attacks against Estonia, and they had no connections with either the government or the armed forces. According to the current procedure, Estonia should ask Russia to maintain law and order in its territory as a kinetic counterattack would represent violation of Russia's sovereignty. According to proposed new standards of international law the States could leave aside all the worries related to their sovereignty and allow, in certain cases (as a community value all States should be interested in preventing the activities of cyber terrorists), the implementation of direct countermeasures by a State under attack. While this sounds sensible, the development of an appropriate regulation is highly doubtful as States do not wish to open a Pandora's Box on the use of force, and the described scenario would leave numerous opportunities for serious misconduct and abuse.\nHollis also opines that Estonia wanted to construe cyber attack against the State as military activity (a new paradigm) and not as an act subject to penal power (the former paradigm). It can be assumed that in the future cyberspace will become the battlefield where military power is used, humanitarian law is applied and valid penal power framework may be imposed for combined effect. In a military sense, cyberspace can be treated as an asymmetric field even now as States are not necessarily combating each other; it is rather the case of non-State actors positioning themselves against a State (or joining in with the State).\nThe establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia may represent a progressive step for the purposes of international law. The birth and activities of the centre may provide beneficial practical experiences and legal evidence. In addition, CNA can be regulated under national law, which could\nErki Kodar\nalso provide the grounds for the birth of internationally acknowledged standards in the future.\n## 4.2. Possible Developments of International Law in the Sphere of CNA\nA way ahead could be the conclusion of a multilateral agreement, involving specific and accurate standards applicable to CNA. In the given situation, the conclusion of a framework treaty that prescribes main and essential principles and gives States more freedom for the interpretation of specific aspects is more likely. Regionally, the conclusion of either bilateral or regional agreements (Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime represents a step in this direction) may be possible – provided that there is political will.\nOne way forward would be to draft new counterterrorism measures and agreements dealing with cybercrime and cyber terrorism. Measures preventing cybercrime have been taken both at the regional and global level to supplement national criminal law and international co-operation in the sphere of investigating and prosecuting such crimes. The main problem here is the difference of national law of different States or conflict of legal systems. Also, constitutional restrictions to extradition must be considered here.⁸¹ The format of an agreement for the prevention of cybercrime would be similar to the other agreements related to fighting terrorism wherein a certain type of behaviour shall qualify as terrorist activity and will be subject to a certain procedure between the member States. The aforementioned would provide a universal jurisdictional basis, or quasi-universal jurisdictional bases, for certain types of crime. At the moment, cyber terrorism is not taken seriously enough to be a subject for such agreements, and CNA must breach a high threshold to be considered as an issue worthy of international agreements.⁸² While the events that took place in Estonia in 2007 did not exceed this threshold, they can most certainly be interpreted as something more serious than common vandalism; therefore Estonia could have the opportunity to initiate the procedure for the conclusion of an agreement on the prevention of cyber terrorism. The main problem here is the fact that it is difficult to agree on which activities should be construed as cybercrime and ascertain where the line between common crime and terrorism should be drawn.\nAnother category of potential agreements could restrict the sovereign freedom of States – declarative agreements on lawful principles, armament control agreements and humanitarian law agreements. A declarative agreement would involve the most general principles that States would be willing to observe for the purposes of implementing international law (for example, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, stating that outer space is intended for common peaceful use by mankind). The pre-requisite for\n⁸¹ Russia invoked a ‘constitutional ban’ recently in the Litvinenko case and refused to extradite the prime suspect, Andrei Lugovoi.

The crux of the matter is the abrupt and powerful development of information technology as it would be impossible to predict future situations with the required level of accuracy upon the conclusion of such agreements, and consequently States may be hesitant to sign a carte blanche treaty. With armament control agreements States could commit themselves not to develop, acquire or transfer certain CNA capabilities or not to use their capabilities in a way that would be destabilising for the armament control regime or crisis management systems of another State. The pre-requisites and problems encountered when discussing this type of agreements are the same as with declarative agreements. Also, States will not always have a monopoly in CNA capabilities, considering the interests and capacities of hackers and cyber terrorists themselves. Humanitarian law agreements usually restrict the use of certain types of weapons in the case of an armed conflict. The restrictions are justified by stating that the weapon may cause unnecessary suffering. Information technology weapons, adopted in cyber war, may not necessarily fit the criteria on the grounds equivalent to conventional weapons. As general humanitarian law principles and standards can be applied to CNA, the efficiency of such agreements is doubtful. Special standards applicable to CNA would be more useful than agreements attempting to restrict the utilisation thereof.⁸³\nThe conclusion of multilateral conventions, restricting the liberty of freedom of States, is not considered as realistic in the near future, as only very few countries, if any, have an understanding of the capacities and vulnerabilities related to cyber war, sufficient to promote the long-term national interests of such States.⁸⁴\nBilateral agreements or agreements with a limited number of parties are most useful in a situation where a certain number of governments are directly involved with a concrete and common problem. This type of agreement represents a useful form of co-operation within regional scope. G8, the Council of Europe and the Organization of American States have used this to enter into regional conventions on cybercrime (and the NATO process is, potentially through cyber defence policy, moving in this direction). There still will be potential risks related to cases exceeding the limits of regional agreements or where the organisations are dominated by some of the member States, thus turning the convention into a dead letter agreement.⁸⁵\nOn an organisational plane the United Nations General Assembly has often shown initiative for the adoption of resolutions that request or invite the member States to pursue certain principles in their activities. While resolutions are not strictly\n⁸³ Ibid., pp. 446–450; D. Hollis, ‘New Tools, New Rules: International Law and Information Operations’, *Temple University Legal Studies Research Paper* No. 2007-15, <ssrn.com abstract=\"1009224\">, visited 28 March 2009, pp. 16–17.\n⁸⁴ G.

Unfortunately, at the moment, the General Assembly seems to be lacking the initiative. Considering the novelty of legal problems related to CNA, the adoption of resolutions on cyber war is probably not realistic over the next decade.⁸⁶\nOne alternative is represented by codification of customary law as a ‘manual’, as was done with the law of naval warfare by the International Institute of Humanitarian Law, or to enthuse progress by way of custom, codes of conduct or rules of engagement where codification would be based on experience.⁸⁷ Unfortunately, the summoning of the experts of the given sphere is highly unlikely for the lack of customary law to be codified for the purposes of cyber war. Adoption of best-practices guidelines seems to be realistic.⁸⁸\nThe current mindset of States seems to be more domestic than international as States have identified that CNA prevention and control is closely connected with regular home and private users. Estonia adopted in 2008 the Cyber Security Strategy,⁸⁹ and President Obama’s administration is conducting at the moment a 60-day cyber security review to ascertain how to apply cyber security policy.⁹⁰ The Center of Strategic and International Studies Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency released a report on the same issues 8 December 2008.⁹¹ The aim of both documents is to raise the awareness of private computer users and the private sector to take responsibility for their computers and secure them against unwanted uses. Some authors argue that there exists a civic duty to secure private machines against becoming a part of botnet.⁹² Responsible civil conduct would minimise the risk of exploitation for the users but also for the State concerned as it enables the State to exercise diligence on its own territory and control, to a certain extent, that its sovereign territory is not used for conducting CNAs against other states. Thus States are trying to get their houses in order before moving towards international measures.\nIn general, future perspectives for the regulation of CNA are stuck behind several obstacles. Firstly, legislative problems related to CNA are not fully understood, mainly because of technological unpredictability. Secondly, traditional armament control agreements and humanitarian law conventions cannot be adapted for CNA\n⁸⁶ Ibid., p. 452.\n⁸⁷ J.

Thirdly, States have no explicit picture of the form of an international law regime that would promote their national interests in the best possible way in a long-term perspective with regard to CNA.",
    "# 5. Conclusion": "CNA is a challenge for international law because at the moment the law applies by way of analogy and interpretation in *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*. There are no express norms or customs that would regulate the uncertainty of CNA. The current framework of international law tries to fit the odd-shaped peg of CNA into a predetermined context, but this is not a satisfactory long-term solution. But some applicable rules and principles are better than no rules, better than a legal vacuum that would leave CNA out of legal reality. States and individuals with CNA capabilities will use the ambiguity to their advantage, but this will also bring State practice and more clarity to law, albeit through actions and consequences that may be harmful and unforeseen.\nWhen Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed that the life of law has not been of logic but of experience, he meant both the aforementioned and the possible future. The law is always behind the present, either by a step or two. Due to its flexible norm-creating procedure, international law only has to encounter a number of CNA incidents that will change the paradigm and give the required incentive to create legal regulation concerning the use of information weapons. Until then States need to cope with the existing law. Where it regards the use of CNA as use of force we can paraphrase Justice Stewart that we will know it when we see it or, in other words, law will recognise certain forms of CNA as the use of force only after it has been factually established that it has been the use of force.\nWhile the more capable States have adopted either ambivalent or even an attitude of ignorance with regard to the regulation of CNA over the last decade, some forms of co-operation may still be realistic, as demonstrated by the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. Estonia's contribution to NATO's cyber defence policy and the establishment of the Centre of Excellence may lead NATO towards another agreement, which may expand the member States' understanding of cyber law and cyber war and influence other States.\n155"

Some Estonian officials accused that the attacks were orchestrated or tolerated by the administration of the Russian Federation. The latter denied strongly any involvement in such acts and no definite attribution has been made in this case.\nThe cyber attack on Estonia’s critical IT-systems was not unprecedented, but the combination of crude (ping floods, defacement) and sophisticated (DDoS, use of botnets) measures used in the attack delineated a new standard in cyber attacks against a State. Both qualitatively and quantitatively the attacks perpetrated were the largest of any known cyber attacks that have taken place in the world recently.\nEstonia’s case might be the best example to demonstrate that globalisation is in the modern world accompanied by an increased number of attacks against computer networks, and that the attacks may be launched by States, representatives of States, terrorists, criminals and/or cyber hooligans. Thus CNA is an asymmetric weapon ideal for use by powerful States that harness the required capability but also by clever individuals with harmful intents.\nConsidering the powerful technical advancements that have been made by information technology over the last three or four decades, it would be logical to assume\n\n134</www.scribd.com></www.washingtonpost.com></en.rian.ru></www.guardian.co.uk></www.telegraph.co.uk></www.nato.int>\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthat a uniform and existing legal regulation has been imposed on both cyber attacks and IT-crime. This assumption is wrong. When discussing cyber attacks in terms of public international law and humanitarian law, we are faced with a relatively new phenomenon, which does not fit into any global legal framework regulating IT activities. There has been progress on a regional level – the Council of Europe has adopted the Convention on Cybercrime and the United States of America is keen to regulate cybercrime issues in legal assistance agreements. $^{6}$  Nevertheless, these advancements are mostly confined to the realm of domestic criminal law and do not address the issues of international law. At the current time it would appear that the lack of sufficient State practice and opinio juris has not allowed international customary law to develop that would concisely deal with cyber attacks.\nThere are several reasons for the lack of a comprehensive legal regulation – various development levels of countries (third world versus developed countries); predictable benefits accompanying the absence of specific frameworks (maintenance of sovereign freedom of action); and the understanding that cyber attacks represent a new legal phenomenon. There does not exist a notable selection of legal materials that would analyse the issue. I. Detter concurs that “[t]he problem has not been approached in any systematic way although numerous institutions and governments have expressed concern about the problem. ... However, there has been little, if any, academic comment.”7 Research publications or books have dealt with problem briefly or not with sufficient in-depth analysis.8 The US Naval War College’s so-called “Blue Book”9 and the 1999 US Department of Defense study remain the foundational materials in this field.10 Despite the ambiguity of the legal situation, more than 30 different countries worldwide, including USA, China, India and Russia, have publicly admitted\n\n135</www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\nto development of military capabilities and doctrines related to information operations.\nThe above does not mean that the legal situation could be described as empty or as a loophole. Several standards and principles of international law can be successfully applied to information operations (IO) either directly or by analogy. Also, academic discourse has enlivened after the events that took place in spring 2007 and the proliferation of cyber attacks in recent years.\nThe definition of IO is based on USA Department of Defense Joint Publication 1-02. As USA is considered to be the most capable State in the sphere of cyber wars, the definitions provided below are used for the purposes of academic debate and also for the reason that other authors have adopted them to describe cyber attacks.\nInformation operations are defined as the “integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own”. The term represents a generic definition, comprised of the following activities and operations:\n**computer network operations (CNO)** – Comprised of computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.\n**computer network exploitation (CNE)** – Enabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks.\n\n136</www.icrc.org></www.icrc.org>\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ncomputer network attack (CNA) – Actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.^[17]^\ncomputer network defense (CND) – Actions taken to protect, monitor, analyse, detect, and respond to unauthorised activity within the Department of Defense information systems and computer networks.^[18]^\nCNA represents actions aimed against information in another computer network and computers, and the consequences of such actions may be extensive due to the fact that computers and computer networks are largely dual-use systems. Both civil and military structures use the same technical facilities. Due to the consolidation of both structures there exists a danger that the initiated CNA will transform, either deliberately or un-deliberately, from one structure to another, thus accompanied by serious consequences. CNA also challenges common understanding of geographical spaces and territorial integrity, as attacks may cross several State borders.^[19]^\nCNA demands that military operations planners and high-ranking government officials take into account the following questions of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. For example, does a cyber attack constitute an ‘armed attack’ under the United Nations Charter? Does there have to be physical damage to property or loss of life before a State can exercise the right of self-defence? What would be a proportionate response against such an attack? What are the evaluation criteria for targets that are dual-use targets used both by military and civil systems? Is the cyber attack a violation of criminal or international law? In what cases is there State responsibility for acts of individuals acting from its own territory? What could be the future perspectives for the regulation of CNA?\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a general assessment of the legal consequences of CNA according to jus ad bellum and jus in bello, mapping the problems encountered in both spheres of law upon the application of international law on CNA, and to suggest possible future perspectives for the regulation of CNA.\n## 2. Jus ad Bellum and CNA\nThe foundation for the contemporary jus ad bellum, the law regarding the use of force, is the Charter of the United Nations.^[20]^ According to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter,\n\nErki Kodar\n“[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. Such a ban of the use of force is regarded as an imperative norm of international law, *jus cogens*, from which no deviation is allowed, and it is binding for all States in the world community.”\nFor further analysis, it is important to know the two UN Charter exceptions from the ban of using force, namely, the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State (Article 51 of UN Charter) and use of force within the framework of a collective security system (Articles 39 and 42 of UN Charter).\n## 2.1. Applying the UN Charter to CNA – Can CNA Constitute Use of Force?\nThe first obstacle to the implementation of the regulation regarding the use of force is the following question: Could CNA be treated as an armed attack? Although Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does not elaborate on what could be interpreted as a threat or use of force, the *travaux préparatoires* of the Charter indicate that this must be an armed attack. More so, the Charter mentions that each State has the inherent right of an individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State. The competence of the Security Council in relation to acting upon CNA matters will raise fewer problems, as it is possible for the Security Council to treat CNA as a threat to peace or violation of peace (it is doubtful whether CNA can cross the threshold established for aggression), provided that there is political will between the Permanent Members.\nCNA represents a challenge to the valid paradigm related to the use of force as its consequences cannot easily be classified as activities that threaten the values of the international community or as consequences that are of the severity equal to the use of physical force. The consequences can be spread over a broad spectrum from everyday IT disruption to widespread physical damages. In the former category would be for example the temporary paralysation of computer networks without any direct or indirect physical effects. The latter category could entail attacks against critical infrastructure systems with intent to cause physical damages to objects or even loss of life. Disruption of IT systems will most probably not equate to an armed attack as they would be more of nuisance if any anything else and can be dealt with in the domestic legal system with Computer Emergency Response Teams, judicial system and mutual assistance agreements, if applicable. In the case of physical damages and loss of life\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthe State has to evaluate whether the CNA caused the damages and are the damages analogous to an armed attack and would give right to resort to self-defence.\nA majority of acknowledged international law scholars are of the opinion that CNA can be regarded as an armed attack only if certain stringent criteria have been fulfilled, but mainly the consequences of the CNA must be equal to the consequences of a physical armed attack.[24] For example, economic and political measures of pressure will not constitute the violation of the ban to use force even though CNA is a very useful tool for disrupting commerce communications, etc. Thus, CNA will oscillate between measures adopted to apply political and economic pressure and the use of armed force. Incurrence of physical damage as a result of CNA is the pre-requisite to regard it as an armed attack. Unfortunately, this criterion cannot be treated as an absolute and it largely depends on the evaluation of the situation. The consequences of CNA should be assessed case-by-case to ascertain whether they are similar to the consequences of an armed attack or whether consequences stay below the level of threshold for use of force.\nThis categorisation is critical because upon it determines which type of countermeasures the defending State may choose in the given case. Professor M. Schmitt gives two explanatory examples: In the first case, \"computer network attacks disable a busy air traffic control system during horrendous weather. An airliner crashes and deaths result. No kinetic force has been used to destroy the airliner, but CNA was plainly the proximate cause of the tragedy.\"25 Causal relation between the CNA and the airplane crash is established. Opposite of this spectrum, CNA is used to attack \"a university computer network, designed to disrupt military related research occurring in campus laboratories\".26 This attack interferes with the conduct of research related to armed forces.\nLeaving aside the questions of attribution and State involvement in the attacks, Schmitt posits that the first case can be construed as use of force as it results in a loss of life, physical destruction and the consequences are comparable to the use of armed force.[27] Thus it would be lawful for the injured State to act in self-defence after such an incident even though no physical attack infringed its borders. In the second case, the consequences of CNA are less serious than in the first example and represent an assumed unlawful invasion into a computer network and the consequences of this\n\n139</www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\nactivity cannot be equal to the use of armed force, although scientific work related to the activities of armed forces has been disrupted.\nIf CNA can constitute use of armed force, the canonical restrictions established for the response to an armed attack in self-defence must be also applied thereto – that is, countermeasures taken to deal with a threat must be proportional and necessary to the threat. Another contentious issue is whether a State under a CNA attack can counter in self-defence with only CNA or with physical force. Law regarding use of force does not prescribe the measures to be adopted in self-defence as long as they are proportionate and necessary against the attack. Therefore it would be lawful for the injured State to resort to physical force if the aforementioned criteria are fulfilled.\nWithout concise legal regulation, it will be up to State practice to decide whether CNA will qualify as use of force or not. Such a case-based approach will not necessarily contribute to completely uniform practice but, if we are to look for a better consensus, the UN Security Council has the competence to qualify CNA as a threat to peace as provided by Article 39 of the UN Charter. The involvement of the Security Council would be beneficial for the Permanent Members or for larger countries that have sufficient clout to influence Permanent Members.\nThe involvement of the Security Council would be most probably of little use for non-members when the suspected or alleged acts of one of the Permanent Members are in question. In such cases the Security Council will most probably find itself in a veto deadlock. However, the Security Council could give more specific guidelines with regard to CNA incidents that fall into the 'grey area' of use of force or not. Then again this scenario could be counterproductive and against the self-interests of the Permanent Members because they are also potentially the most capable States for conducting such acts and gaining from such behaviour.\n## 2.2. Problems Related to Attribution of Responsibility in Case of CNA\nThe above lack of legal distinction should not be interpreted as a situation where everything explicitly not forbidden is permissible if the use of CNA does not violate *jus cogens* norms, customary law or treaty law. Unlawful or indiscriminate uses of CNA can violate generally recognised principles of international law (for example, the principle of non-intervention in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of a State). The injured State may demand reparations for injuries from the responsible State according to the principles of State responsibility. Nevertheless, the matter of State responsibility is especially complicated in the case of CNA as its source can be concealed. The subject of attack may be acting on false impressions of the attack coming from another State that is not necessarily responsible for the attack (for example, the responsible State D may launch CNA against State A through unbeknownst State C and masking the origin of the attack as to convey the impression that CNA comes from State B).\nThe relative ease of use of CNA has the potential to make States complacent with regard to State responsibility. If CNA has been State orchestrated, carried out by the agents of State, then the attribution of State responsibility is not complicated.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nNowadays laptops have more computing power than a room full of supercomputers in the 1970s and private individuals and organisations have access to high-speed internet connections from which to conduct multiple CNAs of different severity unbeknownst to their State of residence. This can create situations where State A knowingly or unknowingly tolerates CNA activities against State B and the attacks cross the threshold of armed attack. In this case State B regards itself as being under attack and starts to defend itself against the actions coming from State A. Therefore State A may unwillingly violate international law. By the text of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts the acts individuals of State A are attributable to it and the acts in question breach international obligation (prohibition of use of force, prohibition of non-intervention). State B can prove the support of State A with either signal or human reconnaissance (for example, identifying that the attack is being launched from a computer network of a government agency) or from official pronouncements of government officials.\nIf an individual living in State A is violating the rights of State B from the territory of the same State, State B may require the punishment of that respective individual from State A or initiation of extradition proceedings. Under aggravating circumstances, State B may adopt self-defence measures against an attack coming from State A in the territory of State A, but only if State A does not wish or is unable to avoid the appropriate actions against State B. Professor Y. Dinstein has classified the attribution of responsibility related to CNA originating from State A and directed against State B into four categories:\nThe first category consists of cases where citizens of State A launch CNA on their own initiative and for reasons only known to them. Their activities cannot be attributed to the government of State A. In the given case, State A should exercise sufficient executive duress against the individuals concerned so that they would either end or avoid launching the attacks against State B from the territory of State A.\nThe second category consists of cases when certain individuals or terrorists residing in State A launch CNA against State B for certain ideological, etc. reasons and the terrorists are not supported by State A. The obligations of State A are the same that were described under the first category.\nIn the third category terrorists supported by the State A launch CNA against State B. If the actions can be attributed to terrorists supported by State A, the terrorists could be treated as de facto representatives of State A as provided by the principles of State\n\nresponsibility, and State A will be held responsible to State B. The support given to terrorists by State A needs to be proven in this case.\nIn the fourth category government organs of State A launch CNA against State B. This represents the most complicated category as the actions of representatives of a State within the CNA sphere may have a number of forms – like espionage (which cannot be construed as the use of force), interruption of communication systems with no harm to humans (not grave enough to exceed the threshold of use of force) and cyber attacks that result in harm done to persons. The latter is treated as CNA that oversteps the threshold established for the use of force, but all the cases described in this category can be ascribed to State A.\n‘Active defence’ is also possible as a counter-measure against CNA, meaning that a State under CNA attack will attack the computer system of another State being the source of the CNA, considering that it will be later forced to apologise, in public, for the ‘counterattack’ or pay compensation.\nAt the current moment, launching a cyber attack by a State against another State represents the exception and not the rule. Most CNAs are perpetrated by individuals and non-State actors, but the attribution of such acts to them or the State harbouring them is complicated as evidence is hard to get or evidence can be misleading in the case of a sophisticated attack.\n## 2.3. Jus ad Bellum and CNA – Future Trends\nIn the near future, jus ad bellum will still be subject to an understanding that the use of force or threat of force within cyberspace will remain a fact to be identified separately in each case. The majority of cyber attacks will not exceed the threshold of use of force, but the valid paradigm may be subject to change if clear-cut cases emerge. For example, some scholars are of the opinion that the USA may decide to respond with armed force if a cyber attack launched by another State destroys the informa\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ntion systems of the New York Stock Exchange or causes physical damages thereto. While not being a military objective in the classical sense, the damages might be of the effect that they can be equated with the effects of use of force. The non liquet position, adopted by the Department of Defense of the USA in 1999, was the following:\nAs in all cases when a nation considers acting in self-defense, the nation considering such action will have to make its best judgment on how world opinion, or perhaps a body such as the International Court of Justice or the United Nations Security Council, is likely to apply the doctrine of self-defence to electronic attacks. As with many novel legal issues, we are likely to discover the answer only from experience.\nThis decade old position would seem to be still valid prima facie as there have been no clarifying developments in international law in this regard. If we are dealing with a situation where State A is supporting the activities of criminals and therefore CNA is launched against State B, responding with CNA to CNA is probably acceptable and justified. If CNA exceeds the threshold for the use of force, the traditional kinetic self-defence capabilities may be employed. But at the moment there does not exist a defined yardstick – CNA with grave consequences can be treated as the use of force in the future, while consequences that do not meet the threshold will not be treated as use of force.\nIn the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), CNA with consequences equal to use of force might be in some extreme cases regarded as events that may trigger the collective self-defence provision of Article 5 in the North Atlantic Treaty, although this seems doubtful. NATO’s own rhetoric has been in this field cautious, if not in the negative. This is due to the fact that current and previous attacks have not exceeded the threshold mentioned, and thus it is hard to predict the consequence of future CNA. Most probably the only article applicable in the NATO framework would be Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, in which case members will enter into consultations if the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the members is threatened. Only time and State practice will tell whether CNA\n\n143</www.ibls.com></www.defenselink.mil></nids.hq.nato.int></www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\ncan be realistically construed as use of force according to the UN Charter that would activate the self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty framework.\n## 3. Jus in Bello and CNA\n*Jus in bello* or international humanitarian law is a set of legal norms applicable in case of an armed conflict. When CNA is used in an armed conflict as a weapon then legal restrictions arising that regulate the use of weapons are applicable to CNA. These restrictions must be adhered to in self-defence operations when countering CNA with CNA or when responding to a physical attack with CNA. Also, in cases of use of CNA as an offensive weapon there is a need to understand the legal restrictions that regulate the selection of targets and the precautions in attack to be adopted.\n## 3.1. Legal Assumptions for the Implementation of Humanitarian Law in the Case of CNA\nIn international humanitarian law, there is no explicit provision that deals with either CNA or IO or cyber war. Nevertheless, the Martens Clause, which is regarded as customary law, states that “in cases not included in the [Hague] Regulations adopted by them, populations and belligerents remain under the protection and empire of the principles of international law, as they result from the usages established between civilised nations, from the laws of humanity and the requirements of the public conscience”. The modernised Martens Clause is contained in Article 1(2) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which states that “[i] n cases not covered by this Protocol or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of the principles of international law derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience”. The purpose of the Martens Clause is to affirm that the belligerents’ choice of methods or means of warfare is not unlimited and to eliminate any incidents in armed conflicts that are not covered by treaty regulation or customary law. Therefore, these principles reaffirm that even without explicit mention of CNA in modern treaties or customs, certain restrictions still apply.\nThe ICJ has reaffirmed that for weapons two customary law restrictions apply. Firstly, “[s]tates must never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military\n “The Court points to the Martens Clause, whose continuing existence and applicability is not to be doubted, as an affirmation that the principles and rules of humanitarian law apply to nuclear weapons”, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, 8 July 1996, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 87, <www.icj-cij.org 7495.pdf=\"\" 95=\"\" docket=\"\" files=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n Preamble of the 1899 Hague Convention (II) and 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land.\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ntargets\".43 Secondly, \"it is prohibited to cause unnecessary suffering to combatants; it is accordingly prohibited to use weapons causing them such harm or uselessly aggravating their suffering. ... [S]tates do not have unlimited freedom of choice of means in the weapons they use.\"44 All of the above and the restrictions applicable to weapons must be taken into account if using CNA in an armed conflict.45\nCNA must be capable of fulfilling the requirement set for weapons – that it can be used in an attack and aimed against specific targets. According to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its Additional Protocols of 1977, an attack is an act of violence,[46] which raises the question: Is CNA out-of-bounds for international humanitarian law because CNA is not a use of violence in the strictest sense of the word? The answer to this question is ‘no’ as for the purposes of humanitarian law an ‘attack’ shall represent a generic and a broad definition.[47] ‘Violence’ therefore in humanitarian law is defined through the consequence of physical (in case of objects and physical persons) or mental (in case of physical persons only) damage. CNA does most probably bring the described consequences, and therefore the use of CNA should be treated as an attack.\nStates also have an obligation when adopting a new weapon to conduct an assessment process to determine whether the use of such new weapon would under some or all conditions be prohibited or restricted under the standards of humanitarian or some other category of international law.[48] Unfortunately States have no obligation to publicise these findings, and thus the majority of these analyses are off the record and not available to the general public.\nThe discussion below is based on an assumption that there is an established armed conflict governed by the norms and principles prescribed in international humanitarian law. International humanitarian law will only apply to CNA if CNA's consequences are not just sporadic and isolated cases and are aimed to cause injuries, death, damages and destruction and where such consequences are predictable or desired. Humanitarian law is not applicable to CNA if these consequences do not include the causing of injuries, death, damages and destruction during an armed conflict (for example, the failure of a university intranet, downloading of financial information, temporary closing of access to internet or being involved in cyber espionage).\n\nErki Kodar\n## 3.2. CNA and Legitimate Targets\nIf CNA constitutes an attack or the use of violence in an armed conflict, the next question arises: What can be attacked with the weapon and what are the legitimate targets? For analytical purposes M. Schmitt divides targets into four categories: combatants and military targets; civilians, who directly participate in hostilities; objects used by both military and civilians; specifically protected objects.^[49]^\nCombatants and military targets are legitimate targets^[50]^ and can be targeted as long as the means and methods of attack comply with the restrictions established by humanitarian law.^[51]^ Therefore, aiming a CNA against combatants is permissible (for example, falsifying military air traffic control system navigational information that results in a military transport crash).^[52]^ When attacking military targets, the attack against a target must considerably contribute to military action and provide for a definite military advantage.^[53]^ Attack against the enemy's command and control networks, etc. does not create difficulties. However, which principles should be adopted in case of contestable targets: Can CNA be aimed against a banking system as the sustainability of armed forces depends on wealth? If a State is disproportionately dependent upon a specific industry (for example, oil), can CNA be used to stop production and distribution?^[54]^ Is it important that the attack is accompanied by physical destruction, not just inconvenience? If the purpose is only to cause inconvenience, this does not exceed the threshold of a military attack.\nCivilians represent individuals who are not considered combatants and civilian targets are targets that are not military targets. Therefore the armed forces have an obligation to direct their attacks against military objectives.^[55]^ Notwithstanding legitimate collateral damage, the ban on attacking civilians and civilian targets is practically absolute. Civilians lose their immunity when participating directly in hostilities by causing damages to the members or supplies of the enemy's armed forces.^[56]^ The use of civilians to launch CNA, as sub-contractors or civil servants, is full of legal problems and issues.^[57]^ The main problem with CNA is that it encompasses activities\n^[49]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, pp. 379–387.\n^[50]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52 notes that civilian objects shall not be the object of attack and that attacks shall be limited to military objectives.\n^[51]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(i) demands that the attackers must do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are not civilian objects, but military objectives.\n^[52]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 380.\n^[53]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3).\n^[54]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 381. This is an issue of interpretation of the 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3). Some States, like the USA, regard economic targets as legitimate targets.\n^[55]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Articles 48, 50(1), 51(2) and 52(1).\n^[56]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 51(3).\n^[57]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 384; Dörmann, *supra* note 13; 2003 Summary Report prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross on the Direct Participation in\n\nthat can be realistically conducted by government agencies and authorities rather than by members of armed forces. If civilians are directly involved in conducting CNA resulting in physical damages, such persons may be treated as unlawful combatants as they are participating directly in hostilities. Thus the IT-support personnel who are contributing to a CNA operation are at the risk of being considered targets. Civilians employed for the purpose of CNA represent a challenge for humanitarian law as they would not fit under the category of lawful combatants. When it is impossible to restrict the participation of civilians in military activities, this may endanger the civilian population as the enemy cannot make a clear distinction between combatants and civilians. Considering the skill-sets required for CNA it is more than reasonable to assume civilian involvement in such attacks, but the correct course of action should be that the members of armed forces conduct CNA.\nDual-use targets have both military and civil purposes (airports, railways, electrical systems, communication systems, factories producing material for both the civilian population and armed forces, etc.).58 If an object is being used for military purposes, it will be construed as a military target that can be attacked with all the permissible methods, including CNA. The aforementioned is also valid in a situation where the military objectives of a target are only secondary to the civilian objectives.\nHumanitarian law grants special protection to certain objects like dykes, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.59 Objects under special protection are defined as hazardous facilities as attacking them may launch dangerous forces and cause serious losses among the civilian population. As a general rule, such targets should not be attacked if the emission of dangerous forces cannot be controlled, but in the case of CNA it would be possible to neutralise these targets without launching any dangerous forces (which is an advantage, compared to kinetic weapons).60\n# 3.3. CNA's Compatibility with General Principles of Humanitarian Law\nOnce it has been determined that a target is lawful, the concordance of attack with general principles (and norms regarding targeting) of humanitarian law should be assessed before the attack is launched. These principles are the principle of distinction, prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, principle of proportionality and the prohibition of perfidy.\nHostilities under International Humanitarian Law, <www.icrc.org eng=\"\" direct%20participation-hostilities-ihl-311205=\"\" siteeng0.nsf=\"\" siteeng0.nsf/=\"\" /=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009; K.

Therefore, only military targets may be attacked. While CNA can be used in compliance with the principle of distinction, it can also be, like conventional weapons, used indiscriminately. No matter how attractive the idea of launching one extensive CNA campaign against the infrastructures of the State as a whole would be, including attacks against the civil sector, all CNA attacks must be aimed against military targets. The principle entails an obligation to minimise collateral damage and to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be disproportionate to the value of the military objective to be attacked.\nThe principle of distinction is closely knitted with the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks. Indiscriminate attack stands for attacks that are not aimed against a specific military objective, employing the methods and means of warfare, which cannot be aimed against a military target or employing the methods and means of warfare the consequence of which cannot be restricted. With CNA, the main threat is posed by the fact that it can be used for launching indiscriminate attacks, either deliberately or inadvertently. If malicious code CNA is employed that is uncontrollable and spreading through civilian systems, then such CNA is prohibited as an indiscriminate weapon. Taking into account that civilian and military networks are closely intertwined, the launched CNA must be of such sophistication that it conforms to the prohibition.\nThe principle of proportionality demands that conflicting interests must be weighed against each other – sufferings and damages versus military advantage. If military advantage outweighs incidental loss of life or damages to civilians or civilian objects, the attack is construed to be in compliance with the principle of proportionality (although the principle seems to be rather simple, its implementation in practice is extremely complicated). The majority of the problems of CNA in this equation are caused by knock-on effects that are “not directly and immediately caused by the attack, but nevertheless the product thereof – it is the problem of the effects caused by the effects of an attack”. As CNA may result in consequences which are initially unpredictable, one must always assess when planning an attack whether CNA would be accompanied by endangering the civil population or not. As the CNA attacks are complicated and may, with great probability, affect civilian systems, one must assess the causal damages and possible consequences during the planning stage of any operation prior to launching an attack and seek ways to mitigate these effects. Then again, CNA as a method may help to diminish collateral damage as it allows, instead of physical destruction, to ‘switch off’ the target (for example, instead of bombing an\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nairport it is possible to disturb the operation of flight control systems). CNA allows the attacker to directly control the consequences and minimise the risk to civilian population when the attained military advantage has been achieved.\nPerfidy is the feigning of protected status with the intent to kill, injure or capture an adversary. The prohibition of perfidy does not mean that ruses of war cannot be used. For the purposes of CNA, a ruse would be communication of incorrect information on location and manoeuvres, forging the information in the enemy’s reconnaissance database, etc. Perfidy would be pretending to have a protected status, and for the purposes of CNA this would be deceptive use of codes and signals given to medical transport by the International Civil Aviation Organization.\nWhile the humanitarian law in force is, in general, sufficient to protect individuals and objects from CNA, some uncertainties still exist. Even though it was impossible to predict the occurrence of CNA upon the emergence of current humanitarian law, some general standards are, nevertheless, applicable to CNA. At the same time CNA is characterised by specifics that also represent challenges and problems for the purposes of *jus in bello*: When does one consider CNA as an ‘attack’ in *jus in bello* and when only as a nuisance? But CNA is also a positive tool that allows for achieving military objectives without the causal damages that may result from kinetic attacks. It should also be remembered that CNA is a weapon, and any unlawful use may bring about incrimination for the commitment of war crimes.\n## 4. Possible Future Scenarios for the Regulation of CNA\nIn all probability a new defined structure of international law will not be introduced in the nearest future that would encapsulate all the cases of use of force with regard to cyberspace and the assessment of CNA *vis-à-vis* the right of self-defence. The issue is at the mercy of practical experiences of different States as there seems to be unwillingness to enter into international or regional agreements in this sphere. The *status quo* is useful for States with better CNA capabilities to maintain freedom of action. But there might be will to move towards some foreseeable developments.\nIn 1998 Russia attempted to initiate a United Nations General Assembly resolution dealing with the banning of some highly dangerous information operations.\n\n149</www.icrc.org>\nErki Kodar\nUnfortunately Russia has not volunteered to continue with this initiative over the last couple of years. The Naval War College in Newport, USA organised a CNA-conference in 1999, where the participants agreed that it would be useful and sensible to intensify international co-operation in the sphere of computer crime and cyber terrorism, but the time has not yet come for introducing a comprehensive regulation or banning in general.73 More extensive co-operation in the sphere of legal assistance was justified with the pretence for the criminalisation of actions threatening the international community to bring the criminals to justice and to simplify the extradition procedure.74\nIf legal assistance agreements are to serve as an effective instrument to fight cybercrime, it is necessary for them to have an explicit scope including either cybercrime or all crimes in general. If countries have not entered into extradition agreements, this means that such countries have neither a duty nor the domestic legal basis to extradite a person to another State.75 It would also be difficult to sustain the argument that the principle of *aut dedere aut judicare* is customary law with relation to CNA.76 An alternative to extradition would be to administer justice to a person who has committed CNA against another State in the CNA's State of origin.77\nDoc.

Estonia's Role in the Development of CNA-related Agreements or Standards?\nProfessor D. Hollis, who studied the cyber attacks against Estonia, suggests the creation of the right of hot pursuit available to a State which is the object of a cyber attack as \"nations could agree to waive sovereignty concerns and permit a direct response in certain cases, such as cyber attacks by terrorists that all nations might want thwarted\".[78] The thought would suggest that it would be appropriate to allow the attacked State to use counter measures to defend itself from an attack with extraterritorial measures even if such countermeasures would violate the sovereignty of the State being the origin of the attacks. Let us assume that hackers from Russia were behind the attacks against Estonia, and they had no connections with either the government or the armed forces. According to the current procedure, Estonia should ask Russia to maintain law and order in its territory as a kinetic counterattack would represent violation of Russia's sovereignty. According to proposed new standards of international law the States could leave aside all the worries related to their sovereignty and allow, in certain cases (as a community value all States should be interested in preventing the activities of cyber terrorists), the implementation of direct countermeasures by a State under attack.[79] While this sounds sensible, the development of an appropriate regulation is highly doubtful as States do not wish to open a Pandora's Box on the use of force, and the described scenario would leave numerous opportunities for serious misconduct and abuse.\nHollis also opines that Estonia wanted to construe cyber attack against the State as military activity (a new paradigm) and not as an act subject to penal power (the former paradigm). It can be assumed that in the future cyberspace will become the battlefield where military power is used, humanitarian law is applied and valid penal power framework may be imposed for combined effect.[80] In a military sense, cyberspace can be treated as an asymmetric field even now as States are not necessarily combating each other; it is rather the case of non-State actors positioning themselves against a State (or joining in with the State).\nThe establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia may represent a progressive step for the purposes of international law. The birth and activities of the centre may provide beneficial practical experiences and legal evidence. In addition, CNA can be regulated under national law, which could\nErki Kodar\nalso provide the grounds for the birth of internationally acknowledged standards in the future.\n## 4.2. Possible Developments of International Law in the Sphere of CNA\nA way ahead could be the conclusion of a multilateral agreement, involving specific and accurate standards applicable to CNA. In the given situation, the conclusion of a framework treaty that prescribes main and essential principles and gives States more freedom for the interpretation of specific aspects is more likely. Regionally, the conclusion of either bilateral or regional agreements (Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime represents a step in this direction) may be possible – provided that there is political will.\nOne way forward would be to draft new counterterrorism measures and agreements dealing with cybercrime and cyber terrorism. Measures preventing cybercrime have been taken both at the regional and global level to supplement national criminal law and international co-operation in the sphere of investigating and prosecuting such crimes. The main problem here is the difference of national law of different States or conflict of legal systems. Also, constitutional restrictions to extradition must be considered here. The format of an agreement for the prevention of cybercrime would be similar to the other agreements related to fighting terrorism wherein a certain type of behaviour shall qualify as terrorist activity and will be subject to a certain procedure between the member States. The aforementioned would provide a universal jurisdictional basis, or quasi-universal jurisdictional bases, for certain types of crime. At the moment, cyber terrorism is not taken seriously enough to be a subject for such agreements, and CNA must breach a high threshold to be considered as an issue worthy of international agreements. While the events that took place in Estonia in 2007 did not exceed this threshold, they can most certainly be interpreted as something more serious than common vandalism; therefore Estonia could have the opportunity to initiate the procedure for the conclusion of an agreement on the prevention of cyber terrorism. The main problem here is the fact that it is difficult to agree on which activities should be construed as cybercrime and ascertain where the line between common crime and terrorism should be drawn.\nAnother category of potential agreements could restrict the sovereign freedom of States – declarative agreements on lawful principles, armament control agreements and humanitarian law agreements. A declarative agreement would involve the most general principles that States would be willing to observe for the purposes of implementing international law (for example, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, stating that outer space is intended for common peaceful use by mankind). The pre-requisite for\n Russia invoked a ‘constitutional ban’ recently in the Litvinenko case and refused to extradite the prime suspect, Andrei Lugovoi.

The crux of the matter is the abrupt and powerful development of information technology as it would be impossible to predict future situations with the required level of accuracy upon the conclusion of such agreements, and consequently States may be hesitant to sign a carte blanche treaty. With armament control agreements States could commit themselves not to develop, acquire or transfer certain CNA capabilities or not to use their capabilities in a way that would be destabilising for the armament control regime or crisis management systems of another State. The pre-requisites and problems encountered when discussing this type of agreements are the same as with declarative agreements. Also, States will not always have a monopoly in CNA capabilities, considering the interests and capacities of hackers and cyber terrorists themselves. Humanitarian law agreements usually restrict the use of certain types of weapons in the case of an armed conflict. The restrictions are justified by stating that the weapon may cause unnecessary suffering. Information technology weapons, adopted in cyber war, may not necessarily fit the criteria on the grounds equivalent to conventional weapons. As general humanitarian law principles and standards can be applied to CNA, the efficiency of such agreements is doubtful. Special standards applicable to CNA would be more useful than agreements attempting to restrict the utilisation thereof.\nThe conclusion of multilateral conventions, restricting the liberty of freedom of States, is not considered as realistic in the near future, as only very few countries, if any, have an understanding of the capacities and vulnerabilities related to cyber war, sufficient to promote the long-term national interests of such States.\nBilateral agreements or agreements with a limited number of parties are most useful in a situation where a certain number of governments are directly involved with a concrete and common problem. This type of agreement represents a useful form of co-operation within regional scope. G8, the Council of Europe and the Organization of American States have used this to enter into regional conventions on cybercrime (and the NATO process is, potentially through cyber defence policy, moving in this direction). There still will be potential risks related to cases exceeding the limits of regional agreements or where the organisations are dominated by some of the member States, thus turning the convention into a dead letter agreement.\nOn an organisational plane the United Nations General Assembly has often shown initiative for the adoption of resolutions that request or invite the member States to pursue certain principles in their activities. While resolutions are not strictly\n Ibid., pp. 446–450; D. Hollis, ‘New Tools, New Rules: International Law and Information Operations’, *Temple University Legal Studies Research Paper* No. 2007-15, <ssrn.com abstract=\"1009224\">, visited 28 March 2009, pp. 16–17.\n G. Evron, ‘Battling Botnets and Online Mobs: Estonia’s Defense Efforts during the Internet War’, 9 *Georgetown Journal of International Affairs* (2008) p. 126; Johnson, supra note 73, p. 450.\n Johnson, supra note 73, pp. 451–452.\n153</ssrn.com>\nErki Kodar\nregarded as law, they may still become customary law over time or contain nascent customary law. Unfortunately, at the moment, the General Assembly seems to be lacking the initiative. Considering the novelty of legal problems related to CNA, the adoption of resolutions on cyber war is probably not realistic over the next decade.\nOne alternative is represented by codification of customary law as a ‘manual’, as was done with the law of naval warfare by the International Institute of Humanitarian Law, or to enthuse progress by way of custom, codes of conduct or rules of engagement where codification would be based on experience. Unfortunately, the summoning of the experts of the given sphere is highly unlikely for the lack of customary law to be codified for the purposes of cyber war. Adoption of best-practices guidelines seems to be realistic.\nThe current mindset of States seems to be more domestic than international as States have identified that CNA prevention and control is closely connected with regular home and private users. Estonia adopted in 2008 the Cyber Security Strategy, and President Obama’s administration is conducting at the moment a 60-day cyber security review to ascertain how to apply cyber security policy. The Center of Strategic and International Studies Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency released a report on the same issues 8 December 2008. The aim of both documents is to raise the awareness of private computer users and the private sector to take responsibility for their computers and secure them against unwanted uses. Some authors argue that there exists a civic duty to secure private machines against becoming a part of botnet. Responsible civil conduct would minimise the risk of exploitation for the users but also for the State concerned as it enables the State to exercise diligence on its own territory and control, to a certain extent, that its sovereign territory is not used for conducting CNAs against other states. Thus States are trying to get their houses in order before moving towards international measures.\nIn general, future perspectives for the regulation of CNA are stuck behind several obstacles. Firstly, legislative problems related to CNA are not fully understood, mainly because of technological unpredictability. Secondly, traditional armament control agreements and humanitarian law conventions cannot be adapted for CNA\n Ibid., p. 452.\n J.

Thirdly, States have no explicit picture of the form of an international law regime that would promote their national interests in the best possible way in a long-term perspective with regard to CNA.\n# 5. Conclusion\nCNA is a challenge for international law because at the moment the law applies by way of analogy and interpretation in *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*. There are no express norms or customs that would regulate the uncertainty of CNA. The current framework of international law tries to fit the odd-shaped peg of CNA into a predetermined context, but this is not a satisfactory long-term solution. But some applicable rules and principles are better than no rules, better than a legal vacuum that would leave CNA out of legal reality. States and individuals with CNA capabilities will use the ambiguity to their advantage, but this will also bring State practice and more clarity to law, albeit through actions and consequences that may be harmful and unforeseen.\nWhen Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed that the life of law has not been of logic but of experience, he meant both the aforementioned and the possible future. The law is always behind the present, either by a step or two. Due to its flexible norm-creating procedure, international law only has to encounter a number of CNA incidents that will change the paradigm and give the required incentive to create legal regulation concerning the use of information weapons. Until then States need to cope with the existing law. Where it regards the use of CNA as use of force we can paraphrase Justice Stewart that we will know it when we see it or, in other words, law will recognise certain forms of CNA as the use of force only after it has been factually established that it has been the use of force.\nWhile the more capable States have adopted either ambivalent or even an attitude of ignorance with regard to the regulation of CNA over the last decade, some forms of co-operation may still be realistic, as demonstrated by the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. Estonia's contribution to NATO's cyber defence policy and the establishment of the Centre of Excellence may lead NATO towards another agreement, which may expand the member States' understanding of cyber law and cyber war and influence other States.\n155",

Introduction\nIt seems one has to accept as inevitable that when something useful for the improvement of man’s life is invented, thoughts will either turn towards how to use it as a weapon or destroy it, or, in the case of computer network technology, both.\nApril and May 2007 were the most tumultuous months in Estonia’s history after the restoration of independence in 1991. The relocation of the Bronze Soldier monument from Tallinn city centre resulted in two nights of rioting and looting in Tallinn and besieging of the Estonian embassy in Moscow. Physical rioting and looting was accompanied with virtual violence in cyberspace that lasted for three weeks as governmental and non-governmental websites were attacked with distributed denial of\n* Adviser at the International Law Section, Legal Department, Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Estonia; Conductor of the international humanitarian law course at the University of Tartu, Faculty of Law.

These cyber attacks, or computer network attacks (CNA), crippled the web pages and computer systems of ministries, banks, broadcasters, newspapers and emergency services with the possible aim of reducing the media coverage and dissemination of public information regarding the consequences of the relocation of the Bronze Soldier. Some Estonian officials accused that the attacks were orchestrated or tolerated by the administration of the Russian Federation. The latter denied strongly any involvement in such acts and no definite attribution has been made in this case.\nThe cyber attack on Estonia’s critical IT-systems was not unprecedented, but the combination of crude (ping floods, defacement) and sophisticated (DDoS, use of botnets) measures used in the attack delineated a new standard in cyber attacks against a State. Both qualitatively and quantitatively the attacks perpetrated were the largest of any known cyber attacks that have taken place in the world recently.\nEstonia’s case might be the best example to demonstrate that globalisation is in the modern world accompanied by an increased number of attacks against computer networks, and that the attacks may be launched by States, representatives of States, terrorists, criminals and/or cyber hooligans. Thus CNA is an asymmetric weapon ideal for use by powerful States that harness the required capability but also by clever individuals with harmful intents.\nConsidering the powerful technical advancements that have been made by information technology over the last three or four decades, it would be logical to assume\n\n134</www.scribd.com></www.washingtonpost.com></en.rian.ru></www.guardian.co.uk></www.telegraph.co.uk></www.nato.int>\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthat a uniform and existing legal regulation has been imposed on both cyber attacks and IT-crime. This assumption is wrong. When discussing cyber attacks in terms of public international law and humanitarian law, we are faced with a relatively new phenomenon, which does not fit into any global legal framework regulating IT activities. There has been progress on a regional level – the Council of Europe has adopted the Convention on Cybercrime and the United States of America is keen to regulate cybercrime issues in legal assistance agreements. $^{6}$  Nevertheless, these advancements are mostly confined to the realm of domestic criminal law and do not address the issues of international law. At the current time it would appear that the lack of sufficient State practice and opinio juris has not allowed international customary law to develop that would concisely deal with cyber attacks.\nThere are several reasons for the lack of a comprehensive legal regulation – various development levels of countries (third world versus developed countries); predictable benefits accompanying the absence of specific frameworks (maintenance of sovereign freedom of action); and the understanding that cyber attacks represent a new legal phenomenon. There does not exist a notable selection of legal materials that would analyse the issue. I. Detter concurs that “[t]he problem has not been approached in any systematic way although numerous institutions and governments have expressed concern about the problem. ... However, there has been little, if any, academic comment.”7 Research publications or books have dealt with problem briefly or not with sufficient in-depth analysis.8 The US Naval War College’s so-called “Blue Book”9 and the 1999 US Department of Defense study remain the foundational materials in this field.10 Despite the ambiguity of the legal situation, more than 30 different countries worldwide, including USA, China, India and Russia, have publicly admitted\n\n135</www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\nto development of military capabilities and doctrines related to information operations.\nThe above does not mean that the legal situation could be described as empty or as a loophole. Several standards and principles of international law can be successfully applied to information operations (IO) either directly or by analogy. Also, academic discourse has enlivened after the events that took place in spring 2007 and the proliferation of cyber attacks in recent years.\nThe definition of IO is based on USA Department of Defense Joint Publication 1-02. As USA is considered to be the most capable State in the sphere of cyber wars, the definitions provided below are used for the purposes of academic debate and also for the reason that other authors have adopted them to describe cyber attacks.\nInformation operations are defined as the “integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own”. The term represents a generic definition, comprised of the following activities and operations:\n**computer network operations (CNO)** – Comprised of computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.\n**computer network exploitation (CNE)** – Enabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks.\n\n136</www.icrc.org></www.icrc.org>\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ncomputer network attack (CNA) – Actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.^[17]^\ncomputer network defense (CND) – Actions taken to protect, monitor, analyse, detect, and respond to unauthorised activity within the Department of Defense information systems and computer networks.^[18]^\nCNA represents actions aimed against information in another computer network and computers, and the consequences of such actions may be extensive due to the fact that computers and computer networks are largely dual-use systems. Both civil and military structures use the same technical facilities. Due to the consolidation of both structures there exists a danger that the initiated CNA will transform, either deliberately or un-deliberately, from one structure to another, thus accompanied by serious consequences. CNA also challenges common understanding of geographical spaces and territorial integrity, as attacks may cross several State borders.^[19]^\nCNA demands that military operations planners and high-ranking government officials take into account the following questions of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. For example, does a cyber attack constitute an ‘armed attack’ under the United Nations Charter? Does there have to be physical damage to property or loss of life before a State can exercise the right of self-defence? What would be a proportionate response against such an attack? What are the evaluation criteria for targets that are dual-use targets used both by military and civil systems? Is the cyber attack a violation of criminal or international law? In what cases is there State responsibility for acts of individuals acting from its own territory? What could be the future perspectives for the regulation of CNA?\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a general assessment of the legal consequences of CNA according to jus ad bellum and jus in bello, mapping the problems encountered in both spheres of law upon the application of international law on CNA, and to suggest possible future perspectives for the regulation of CNA.\n## 2. Jus ad Bellum and CNA\nThe foundation for the contemporary jus ad bellum, the law regarding the use of force, is the Charter of the United Nations.^[20]^ According to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter,\n\nErki Kodar\n“[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. Such a ban of the use of force is regarded as an imperative norm of international law, *jus cogens*, from which no deviation is allowed, and it is binding for all States in the world community.”\nFor further analysis, it is important to know the two UN Charter exceptions from the ban of using force, namely, the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State (Article 51 of UN Charter) and use of force within the framework of a collective security system (Articles 39 and 42 of UN Charter).\n## 2.1. Applying the UN Charter to CNA – Can CNA Constitute Use of Force?\nThe first obstacle to the implementation of the regulation regarding the use of force is the following question: Could CNA be treated as an armed attack? Although Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does not elaborate on what could be interpreted as a threat or use of force, the *travaux préparatoires* of the Charter indicate that this must be an armed attack. More so, the Charter mentions that each State has the inherent right of an individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State. The competence of the Security Council in relation to acting upon CNA matters will raise fewer problems, as it is possible for the Security Council to treat CNA as a threat to peace or violation of peace (it is doubtful whether CNA can cross the threshold established for aggression), provided that there is political will between the Permanent Members.\nCNA represents a challenge to the valid paradigm related to the use of force as its consequences cannot easily be classified as activities that threaten the values of the international community or as consequences that are of the severity equal to the use of physical force. The consequences can be spread over a broad spectrum from everyday IT disruption to widespread physical damages. In the former category would be for example the temporary paralysation of computer networks without any direct or indirect physical effects. The latter category could entail attacks against critical infrastructure systems with intent to cause physical damages to objects or even loss of life. Disruption of IT systems will most probably not equate to an armed attack as they would be more of nuisance if any anything else and can be dealt with in the domestic legal system with Computer Emergency Response Teams, judicial system and mutual assistance agreements, if applicable. In the case of physical damages and loss of life\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthe State has to evaluate whether the CNA caused the damages and are the damages analogous to an armed attack and would give right to resort to self-defence.\nA majority of acknowledged international law scholars are of the opinion that CNA can be regarded as an armed attack only if certain stringent criteria have been fulfilled, but mainly the consequences of the CNA must be equal to the consequences of a physical armed attack.[24] For example, economic and political measures of pressure will not constitute the violation of the ban to use force even though CNA is a very useful tool for disrupting commerce communications, etc. Thus, CNA will oscillate between measures adopted to apply political and economic pressure and the use of armed force. Incurrence of physical damage as a result of CNA is the pre-requisite to regard it as an armed attack. Unfortunately, this criterion cannot be treated as an absolute and it largely depends on the evaluation of the situation. The consequences of CNA should be assessed case-by-case to ascertain whether they are similar to the consequences of an armed attack or whether consequences stay below the level of threshold for use of force.\nThis categorisation is critical because upon it determines which type of countermeasures the defending State may choose in the given case. Professor M. Schmitt gives two explanatory examples: In the first case, \"computer network attacks disable a busy air traffic control system during horrendous weather. An airliner crashes and deaths result. No kinetic force has been used to destroy the airliner, but CNA was plainly the proximate cause of the tragedy.\"25 Causal relation between the CNA and the airplane crash is established. Opposite of this spectrum, CNA is used to attack \"a university computer network, designed to disrupt military related research occurring in campus laboratories\".26 This attack interferes with the conduct of research related to armed forces.\nLeaving aside the questions of attribution and State involvement in the attacks, Schmitt posits that the first case can be construed as use of force as it results in a loss of life, physical destruction and the consequences are comparable to the use of armed force.[27] Thus it would be lawful for the injured State to act in self-defence after such an incident even though no physical attack infringed its borders. In the second case, the consequences of CNA are less serious than in the first example and represent an assumed unlawful invasion into a computer network and the consequences of this\n\n139</www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\nactivity cannot be equal to the use of armed force, although scientific work related to the activities of armed forces has been disrupted.\nIf CNA can constitute use of armed force, the canonical restrictions established for the response to an armed attack in self-defence must be also applied thereto – that is, countermeasures taken to deal with a threat must be proportional and necessary to the threat. Another contentious issue is whether a State under a CNA attack can counter in self-defence with only CNA or with physical force. Law regarding use of force does not prescribe the measures to be adopted in self-defence as long as they are proportionate and necessary against the attack. Therefore it would be lawful for the injured State to resort to physical force if the aforementioned criteria are fulfilled.\nWithout concise legal regulation, it will be up to State practice to decide whether CNA will qualify as use of force or not. Such a case-based approach will not necessarily contribute to completely uniform practice but, if we are to look for a better consensus, the UN Security Council has the competence to qualify CNA as a threat to peace as provided by Article 39 of the UN Charter. The involvement of the Security Council would be beneficial for the Permanent Members or for larger countries that have sufficient clout to influence Permanent Members.\nThe involvement of the Security Council would be most probably of little use for non-members when the suspected or alleged acts of one of the Permanent Members are in question. In such cases the Security Council will most probably find itself in a veto deadlock. However, the Security Council could give more specific guidelines with regard to CNA incidents that fall into the 'grey area' of use of force or not. Then again this scenario could be counterproductive and against the self-interests of the Permanent Members because they are also potentially the most capable States for conducting such acts and gaining from such behaviour.\n## 2.2. Problems Related to Attribution of Responsibility in Case of CNA\nThe above lack of legal distinction should not be interpreted as a situation where everything explicitly not forbidden is permissible if the use of CNA does not violate *jus cogens* norms, customary law or treaty law. Unlawful or indiscriminate uses of CNA can violate generally recognised principles of international law (for example, the principle of non-intervention in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of a State). The injured State may demand reparations for injuries from the responsible State according to the principles of State responsibility. Nevertheless, the matter of State responsibility is especially complicated in the case of CNA as its source can be concealed. The subject of attack may be acting on false impressions of the attack coming from another State that is not necessarily responsible for the attack (for example, the responsible State D may launch CNA against State A through unbeknownst State C and masking the origin of the attack as to convey the impression that CNA comes from State B).\nThe relative ease of use of CNA has the potential to make States complacent with regard to State responsibility. If CNA has been State orchestrated, carried out by the agents of State, then the attribution of State responsibility is not complicated.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nNowadays laptops have more computing power than a room full of supercomputers in the 1970s and private individuals and organisations have access to high-speed internet connections from which to conduct multiple CNAs of different severity unbeknownst to their State of residence. This can create situations where State A knowingly or unknowingly tolerates CNA activities against State B and the attacks cross the threshold of armed attack. In this case State B regards itself as being under attack and starts to defend itself against the actions coming from State A. Therefore State A may unwillingly violate international law. By the text of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts the acts individuals of State A are attributable to it and the acts in question breach international obligation (prohibition of use of force, prohibition of non-intervention). State B can prove the support of State A with either signal or human reconnaissance (for example, identifying that the attack is being launched from a computer network of a government agency) or from official pronouncements of government officials.\nIf an individual living in State A is violating the rights of State B from the territory of the same State, State B may require the punishment of that respective individual from State A or initiation of extradition proceedings. Under aggravating circumstances, State B may adopt self-defence measures against an attack coming from State A in the territory of State A, but only if State A does not wish or is unable to avoid the appropriate actions against State B. Professor Y. Dinstein has classified the attribution of responsibility related to CNA originating from State A and directed against State B into four categories:\nThe first category consists of cases where citizens of State A launch CNA on their own initiative and for reasons only known to them. Their activities cannot be attributed to the government of State A. In the given case, State A should exercise sufficient executive duress against the individuals concerned so that they would either end or avoid launching the attacks against State B from the territory of State A.\nThe second category consists of cases when certain individuals or terrorists residing in State A launch CNA against State B for certain ideological, etc. reasons and the terrorists are not supported by State A. The obligations of State A are the same that were described under the first category.\nIn the third category terrorists supported by the State A launch CNA against State B. If the actions can be attributed to terrorists supported by State A, the terrorists could be treated as de facto representatives of State A as provided by the principles of State\n\nresponsibility, and State A will be held responsible to State B. The support given to terrorists by State A needs to be proven in this case.\nIn the fourth category government organs of State A launch CNA against State B. This represents the most complicated category as the actions of representatives of a State within the CNA sphere may have a number of forms – like espionage (which cannot be construed as the use of force), interruption of communication systems with no harm to humans (not grave enough to exceed the threshold of use of force) and cyber attacks that result in harm done to persons. The latter is treated as CNA that oversteps the threshold established for the use of force, but all the cases described in this category can be ascribed to State A.\n‘Active defence’ is also possible as a counter-measure against CNA, meaning that a State under CNA attack will attack the computer system of another State being the source of the CNA, considering that it will be later forced to apologise, in public, for the ‘counterattack’ or pay compensation.\nAt the current moment, launching a cyber attack by a State against another State represents the exception and not the rule. Most CNAs are perpetrated by individuals and non-State actors, but the attribution of such acts to them or the State harbouring them is complicated as evidence is hard to get or evidence can be misleading in the case of a sophisticated attack.\n## 2.3. Jus ad Bellum and CNA – Future Trends\nIn the near future, jus ad bellum will still be subject to an understanding that the use of force or threat of force within cyberspace will remain a fact to be identified separately in each case. The majority of cyber attacks will not exceed the threshold of use of force, but the valid paradigm may be subject to change if clear-cut cases emerge. For example, some scholars are of the opinion that the USA may decide to respond with armed force if a cyber attack launched by another State destroys the informa\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ntion systems of the New York Stock Exchange or causes physical damages thereto. While not being a military objective in the classical sense, the damages might be of the effect that they can be equated with the effects of use of force. The non liquet position, adopted by the Department of Defense of the USA in 1999, was the following:\nAs in all cases when a nation considers acting in self-defense, the nation considering such action will have to make its best judgment on how world opinion, or perhaps a body such as the International Court of Justice or the United Nations Security Council, is likely to apply the doctrine of self-defence to electronic attacks. As with many novel legal issues, we are likely to discover the answer only from experience.\nThis decade old position would seem to be still valid prima facie as there have been no clarifying developments in international law in this regard. If we are dealing with a situation where State A is supporting the activities of criminals and therefore CNA is launched against State B, responding with CNA to CNA is probably acceptable and justified. If CNA exceeds the threshold for the use of force, the traditional kinetic self-defence capabilities may be employed. But at the moment there does not exist a defined yardstick – CNA with grave consequences can be treated as the use of force in the future, while consequences that do not meet the threshold will not be treated as use of force.\nIn the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), CNA with consequences equal to use of force might be in some extreme cases regarded as events that may trigger the collective self-defence provision of Article 5 in the North Atlantic Treaty, although this seems doubtful. NATO’s own rhetoric has been in this field cautious, if not in the negative. This is due to the fact that current and previous attacks have not exceeded the threshold mentioned, and thus it is hard to predict the consequence of future CNA. Most probably the only article applicable in the NATO framework would be Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, in which case members will enter into consultations if the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the members is threatened. Only time and State practice will tell whether CNA\n\n143</www.ibls.com></www.defenselink.mil></nids.hq.nato.int></www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\ncan be realistically construed as use of force according to the UN Charter that would activate the self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty framework.\n## 3. Jus in Bello and CNA\n*Jus in bello* or international humanitarian law is a set of legal norms applicable in case of an armed conflict. When CNA is used in an armed conflict as a weapon then legal restrictions arising that regulate the use of weapons are applicable to CNA. These restrictions must be adhered to in self-defence operations when countering CNA with CNA or when responding to a physical attack with CNA. Also, in cases of use of CNA as an offensive weapon there is a need to understand the legal restrictions that regulate the selection of targets and the precautions in attack to be adopted.\n## 3.1. Legal Assumptions for the Implementation of Humanitarian Law in the Case of CNA\nIn international humanitarian law, there is no explicit provision that deals with either CNA or IO or cyber war. Nevertheless, the Martens Clause, which is regarded as customary law, states that “in cases not included in the [Hague] Regulations adopted by them, populations and belligerents remain under the protection and empire of the principles of international law, as they result from the usages established between civilised nations, from the laws of humanity and the requirements of the public conscience”. The modernised Martens Clause is contained in Article 1(2) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which states that “[i] n cases not covered by this Protocol or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of the principles of international law derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience”. The purpose of the Martens Clause is to affirm that the belligerents’ choice of methods or means of warfare is not unlimited and to eliminate any incidents in armed conflicts that are not covered by treaty regulation or customary law. Therefore, these principles reaffirm that even without explicit mention of CNA in modern treaties or customs, certain restrictions still apply.\nThe ICJ has reaffirmed that for weapons two customary law restrictions apply. Firstly, “[s]tates must never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military\n “The Court points to the Martens Clause, whose continuing existence and applicability is not to be doubted, as an affirmation that the principles and rules of humanitarian law apply to nuclear weapons”, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, 8 July 1996, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 87, <www.icj-cij.org 7495.pdf=\"\" 95=\"\" docket=\"\" files=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n Preamble of the 1899 Hague Convention (II) and 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land.\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ntargets\".43 Secondly, \"it is prohibited to cause unnecessary suffering to combatants; it is accordingly prohibited to use weapons causing them such harm or uselessly aggravating their suffering. ... [S]tates do not have unlimited freedom of choice of means in the weapons they use.\"44 All of the above and the restrictions applicable to weapons must be taken into account if using CNA in an armed conflict.45\nCNA must be capable of fulfilling the requirement set for weapons – that it can be used in an attack and aimed against specific targets. According to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its Additional Protocols of 1977, an attack is an act of violence,[46] which raises the question: Is CNA out-of-bounds for international humanitarian law because CNA is not a use of violence in the strictest sense of the word? The answer to this question is ‘no’ as for the purposes of humanitarian law an ‘attack’ shall represent a generic and a broad definition.[47] ‘Violence’ therefore in humanitarian law is defined through the consequence of physical (in case of objects and physical persons) or mental (in case of physical persons only) damage. CNA does most probably bring the described consequences, and therefore the use of CNA should be treated as an attack.\nStates also have an obligation when adopting a new weapon to conduct an assessment process to determine whether the use of such new weapon would under some or all conditions be prohibited or restricted under the standards of humanitarian or some other category of international law.[48] Unfortunately States have no obligation to publicise these findings, and thus the majority of these analyses are off the record and not available to the general public.\nThe discussion below is based on an assumption that there is an established armed conflict governed by the norms and principles prescribed in international humanitarian law. International humanitarian law will only apply to CNA if CNA's consequences are not just sporadic and isolated cases and are aimed to cause injuries, death, damages and destruction and where such consequences are predictable or desired. Humanitarian law is not applicable to CNA if these consequences do not include the causing of injuries, death, damages and destruction during an armed conflict (for example, the failure of a university intranet, downloading of financial information, temporary closing of access to internet or being involved in cyber espionage).\n\nErki Kodar\n## 3.2. CNA and Legitimate Targets\nIf CNA constitutes an attack or the use of violence in an armed conflict, the next question arises: What can be attacked with the weapon and what are the legitimate targets? For analytical purposes M. Schmitt divides targets into four categories: combatants and military targets; civilians, who directly participate in hostilities; objects used by both military and civilians; specifically protected objects.^[49]^\nCombatants and military targets are legitimate targets^[50]^ and can be targeted as long as the means and methods of attack comply with the restrictions established by humanitarian law.^[51]^ Therefore, aiming a CNA against combatants is permissible (for example, falsifying military air traffic control system navigational information that results in a military transport crash).^[52]^ When attacking military targets, the attack against a target must considerably contribute to military action and provide for a definite military advantage.^[53]^ Attack against the enemy's command and control networks, etc. does not create difficulties. However, which principles should be adopted in case of contestable targets: Can CNA be aimed against a banking system as the sustainability of armed forces depends on wealth? If a State is disproportionately dependent upon a specific industry (for example, oil), can CNA be used to stop production and distribution?^[54]^ Is it important that the attack is accompanied by physical destruction, not just inconvenience? If the purpose is only to cause inconvenience, this does not exceed the threshold of a military attack.\nCivilians represent individuals who are not considered combatants and civilian targets are targets that are not military targets. Therefore the armed forces have an obligation to direct their attacks against military objectives.^[55]^ Notwithstanding legitimate collateral damage, the ban on attacking civilians and civilian targets is practically absolute. Civilians lose their immunity when participating directly in hostilities by causing damages to the members or supplies of the enemy's armed forces.^[56]^ The use of civilians to launch CNA, as sub-contractors or civil servants, is full of legal problems and issues.^[57]^ The main problem with CNA is that it encompasses activities\n^[49]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, pp. 379–387.\n^[50]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52 notes that civilian objects shall not be the object of attack and that attacks shall be limited to military objectives.\n^[51]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(i) demands that the attackers must do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are not civilian objects, but military objectives.\n^[52]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 380.\n^[53]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3).\n^[54]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 381. This is an issue of interpretation of the 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3). Some States, like the USA, regard economic targets as legitimate targets.\n^[55]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Articles 48, 50(1), 51(2) and 52(1).\n^[56]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 51(3).\n^[57]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 384; Dörmann, *supra* note 13; 2003 Summary Report prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross on the Direct Participation in\n\nthat can be realistically conducted by government agencies and authorities rather than by members of armed forces. If civilians are directly involved in conducting CNA resulting in physical damages, such persons may be treated as unlawful combatants as they are participating directly in hostilities. Thus the IT-support personnel who are contributing to a CNA operation are at the risk of being considered targets. Civilians employed for the purpose of CNA represent a challenge for humanitarian law as they would not fit under the category of lawful combatants. When it is impossible to restrict the participation of civilians in military activities, this may endanger the civilian population as the enemy cannot make a clear distinction between combatants and civilians. Considering the skill-sets required for CNA it is more than reasonable to assume civilian involvement in such attacks, but the correct course of action should be that the members of armed forces conduct CNA.\nDual-use targets have both military and civil purposes (airports, railways, electrical systems, communication systems, factories producing material for both the civilian population and armed forces, etc.).58 If an object is being used for military purposes, it will be construed as a military target that can be attacked with all the permissible methods, including CNA. The aforementioned is also valid in a situation where the military objectives of a target are only secondary to the civilian objectives.\nHumanitarian law grants special protection to certain objects like dykes, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.59 Objects under special protection are defined as hazardous facilities as attacking them may launch dangerous forces and cause serious losses among the civilian population. As a general rule, such targets should not be attacked if the emission of dangerous forces cannot be controlled, but in the case of CNA it would be possible to neutralise these targets without launching any dangerous forces (which is an advantage, compared to kinetic weapons).60\n# 3.3. CNA's Compatibility with General Principles of Humanitarian Law\nOnce it has been determined that a target is lawful, the concordance of attack with general principles (and norms regarding targeting) of humanitarian law should be assessed before the attack is launched. These principles are the principle of distinction, prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, principle of proportionality and the prohibition of perfidy.\nHostilities under International Humanitarian Law, <www.icrc.org eng=\"\" direct%20participation-hostilities-ihl-311205=\"\" siteeng0.nsf=\"\" siteeng0.nsf/=\"\" /=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009; K.

Therefore, only military targets may be attacked. While CNA can be used in compliance with the principle of distinction, it can also be, like conventional weapons, used indiscriminately. No matter how attractive the idea of launching one extensive CNA campaign against the infrastructures of the State as a whole would be, including attacks against the civil sector, all CNA attacks must be aimed against military targets. The principle entails an obligation to minimise collateral damage and to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be disproportionate to the value of the military objective to be attacked.\nThe principle of distinction is closely knitted with the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks. Indiscriminate attack stands for attacks that are not aimed against a specific military objective, employing the methods and means of warfare, which cannot be aimed against a military target or employing the methods and means of warfare the consequence of which cannot be restricted. With CNA, the main threat is posed by the fact that it can be used for launching indiscriminate attacks, either deliberately or inadvertently. If malicious code CNA is employed that is uncontrollable and spreading through civilian systems, then such CNA is prohibited as an indiscriminate weapon. Taking into account that civilian and military networks are closely intertwined, the launched CNA must be of such sophistication that it conforms to the prohibition.\nThe principle of proportionality demands that conflicting interests must be weighed against each other – sufferings and damages versus military advantage. If military advantage outweighs incidental loss of life or damages to civilians or civilian objects, the attack is construed to be in compliance with the principle of proportionality (although the principle seems to be rather simple, its implementation in practice is extremely complicated). The majority of the problems of CNA in this equation are caused by knock-on effects that are “not directly and immediately caused by the attack, but nevertheless the product thereof – it is the problem of the effects caused by the effects of an attack”. As CNA may result in consequences which are initially unpredictable, one must always assess when planning an attack whether CNA would be accompanied by endangering the civil population or not. As the CNA attacks are complicated and may, with great probability, affect civilian systems, one must assess the causal damages and possible consequences during the planning stage of any operation prior to launching an attack and seek ways to mitigate these effects. Then again, CNA as a method may help to diminish collateral damage as it allows, instead of physical destruction, to ‘switch off’ the target (for example, instead of bombing an\n\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nairport it is possible to disturb the operation of flight control systems). CNA allows the attacker to directly control the consequences and minimise the risk to civilian population when the attained military advantage has been achieved.\nPerfidy is the feigning of protected status with the intent to kill, injure or capture an adversary. The prohibition of perfidy does not mean that ruses of war cannot be used. For the purposes of CNA, a ruse would be communication of incorrect information on location and manoeuvres, forging the information in the enemy’s reconnaissance database, etc. Perfidy would be pretending to have a protected status, and for the purposes of CNA this would be deceptive use of codes and signals given to medical transport by the International Civil Aviation Organization.\nWhile the humanitarian law in force is, in general, sufficient to protect individuals and objects from CNA, some uncertainties still exist. Even though it was impossible to predict the occurrence of CNA upon the emergence of current humanitarian law, some general standards are, nevertheless, applicable to CNA. At the same time CNA is characterised by specifics that also represent challenges and problems for the purposes of *jus in bello*: When does one consider CNA as an ‘attack’ in *jus in bello* and when only as a nuisance? But CNA is also a positive tool that allows for achieving military objectives without the causal damages that may result from kinetic attacks. It should also be remembered that CNA is a weapon, and any unlawful use may bring about incrimination for the commitment of war crimes.\n## 4. Possible Future Scenarios for the Regulation of CNA\nIn all probability a new defined structure of international law will not be introduced in the nearest future that would encapsulate all the cases of use of force with regard to cyberspace and the assessment of CNA *vis-à-vis* the right of self-defence. The issue is at the mercy of practical experiences of different States as there seems to be unwillingness to enter into international or regional agreements in this sphere. The *status quo* is useful for States with better CNA capabilities to maintain freedom of action. But there might be will to move towards some foreseeable developments.\nIn 1998 Russia attempted to initiate a United Nations General Assembly resolution dealing with the banning of some highly dangerous information operations.\n\n149</www.icrc.org>\nErki Kodar\nUnfortunately Russia has not volunteered to continue with this initiative over the last couple of years. The Naval War College in Newport, USA organised a CNA-conference in 1999, where the participants agreed that it would be useful and sensible to intensify international co-operation in the sphere of computer crime and cyber terrorism, but the time has not yet come for introducing a comprehensive regulation or banning in general.73 More extensive co-operation in the sphere of legal assistance was justified with the pretence for the criminalisation of actions threatening the international community to bring the criminals to justice and to simplify the extradition procedure.74\nIf legal assistance agreements are to serve as an effective instrument to fight cybercrime, it is necessary for them to have an explicit scope including either cybercrime or all crimes in general. If countries have not entered into extradition agreements, this means that such countries have neither a duty nor the domestic legal basis to extradite a person to another State.75 It would also be difficult to sustain the argument that the principle of *aut dedere aut judicare* is customary law with relation to CNA.76 An alternative to extradition would be to administer justice to a person who has committed CNA against another State in the CNA's State of origin.77\nDoc.

Estonia's Role in the Development of CNA-related Agreements or Standards?\nProfessor D. Hollis, who studied the cyber attacks against Estonia, suggests the creation of the right of hot pursuit available to a State which is the object of a cyber attack as \"nations could agree to waive sovereignty concerns and permit a direct response in certain cases, such as cyber attacks by terrorists that all nations might want thwarted\".[78] The thought would suggest that it would be appropriate to allow the attacked State to use counter measures to defend itself from an attack with extraterritorial measures even if such countermeasures would violate the sovereignty of the State being the origin of the attacks. Let us assume that hackers from Russia were behind the attacks against Estonia, and they had no connections with either the government or the armed forces. According to the current procedure, Estonia should ask Russia to maintain law and order in its territory as a kinetic counterattack would represent violation of Russia's sovereignty. According to proposed new standards of international law the States could leave aside all the worries related to their sovereignty and allow, in certain cases (as a community value all States should be interested in preventing the activities of cyber terrorists), the implementation of direct countermeasures by a State under attack.[79] While this sounds sensible, the development of an appropriate regulation is highly doubtful as States do not wish to open a Pandora's Box on the use of force, and the described scenario would leave numerous opportunities for serious misconduct and abuse.\nHollis also opines that Estonia wanted to construe cyber attack against the State as military activity (a new paradigm) and not as an act subject to penal power (the former paradigm). It can be assumed that in the future cyberspace will become the battlefield where military power is used, humanitarian law is applied and valid penal power framework may be imposed for combined effect.[80] In a military sense, cyberspace can be treated as an asymmetric field even now as States are not necessarily combating each other; it is rather the case of non-State actors positioning themselves against a State (or joining in with the State).\nThe establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia may represent a progressive step for the purposes of international law. The birth and activities of the centre may provide beneficial practical experiences and legal evidence. In addition, CNA can be regulated under national law, which could\nErki Kodar\nalso provide the grounds for the birth of internationally acknowledged standards in the future.\n## 4.2. Possible Developments of International Law in the Sphere of CNA\nA way ahead could be the conclusion of a multilateral agreement, involving specific and accurate standards applicable to CNA. In the given situation, the conclusion of a framework treaty that prescribes main and essential principles and gives States more freedom for the interpretation of specific aspects is more likely. Regionally, the conclusion of either bilateral or regional agreements (Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime represents a step in this direction) may be possible – provided that there is political will.\nOne way forward would be to draft new counterterrorism measures and agreements dealing with cybercrime and cyber terrorism. Measures preventing cybercrime have been taken both at the regional and global level to supplement national criminal law and international co-operation in the sphere of investigating and prosecuting such crimes. The main problem here is the difference of national law of different States or conflict of legal systems. Also, constitutional restrictions to extradition must be considered here. The format of an agreement for the prevention of cybercrime would be similar to the other agreements related to fighting terrorism wherein a certain type of behaviour shall qualify as terrorist activity and will be subject to a certain procedure between the member States. The aforementioned would provide a universal jurisdictional basis, or quasi-universal jurisdictional bases, for certain types of crime. At the moment, cyber terrorism is not taken seriously enough to be a subject for such agreements, and CNA must breach a high threshold to be considered as an issue worthy of international agreements. While the events that took place in Estonia in 2007 did not exceed this threshold, they can most certainly be interpreted as something more serious than common vandalism; therefore Estonia could have the opportunity to initiate the procedure for the conclusion of an agreement on the prevention of cyber terrorism. The main problem here is the fact that it is difficult to agree on which activities should be construed as cybercrime and ascertain where the line between common crime and terrorism should be drawn.\nAnother category of potential agreements could restrict the sovereign freedom of States – declarative agreements on lawful principles, armament control agreements and humanitarian law agreements. A declarative agreement would involve the most general principles that States would be willing to observe for the purposes of implementing international law (for example, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, stating that outer space is intended for common peaceful use by mankind). The pre-requisite for\n Russia invoked a ‘constitutional ban’ recently in the Litvinenko case and refused to extradite the prime suspect, Andrei Lugovoi.

The crux of the matter is the abrupt and powerful development of information technology as it would be impossible to predict future situations with the required level of accuracy upon the conclusion of such agreements, and consequently States may be hesitant to sign a carte blanche treaty. With armament control agreements States could commit themselves not to develop, acquire or transfer certain CNA capabilities or not to use their capabilities in a way that would be destabilising for the armament control regime or crisis management systems of another State. The pre-requisites and problems encountered when discussing this type of agreements are the same as with declarative agreements. Also, States will not always have a monopoly in CNA capabilities, considering the interests and capacities of hackers and cyber terrorists themselves. Humanitarian law agreements usually restrict the use of certain types of weapons in the case of an armed conflict. The restrictions are justified by stating that the weapon may cause unnecessary suffering. Information technology weapons, adopted in cyber war, may not necessarily fit the criteria on the grounds equivalent to conventional weapons. As general humanitarian law principles and standards can be applied to CNA, the efficiency of such agreements is doubtful. Special standards applicable to CNA would be more useful than agreements attempting to restrict the utilisation thereof.\nThe conclusion of multilateral conventions, restricting the liberty of freedom of States, is not considered as realistic in the near future, as only very few countries, if any, have an understanding of the capacities and vulnerabilities related to cyber war, sufficient to promote the long-term national interests of such States.\nBilateral agreements or agreements with a limited number of parties are most useful in a situation where a certain number of governments are directly involved with a concrete and common problem. This type of agreement represents a useful form of co-operation within regional scope. G8, the Council of Europe and the Organization of American States have used this to enter into regional conventions on cybercrime (and the NATO process is, potentially through cyber defence policy, moving in this direction). There still will be potential risks related to cases exceeding the limits of regional agreements or where the organisations are dominated by some of the member States, thus turning the convention into a dead letter agreement.\nOn an organisational plane the United Nations General Assembly has often shown initiative for the adoption of resolutions that request or invite the member States to pursue certain principles in their activities. While resolutions are not strictly\n Ibid., pp. 446–450; D. Hollis, ‘New Tools, New Rules: International Law and Information Operations’, *Temple University Legal Studies Research Paper* No. 2007-15, <ssrn.com abstract=\"1009224\">, visited 28 March 2009, pp. 16–17.\n G. Evron, ‘Battling Botnets and Online Mobs: Estonia’s Defense Efforts during the Internet War’, 9 *Georgetown Journal of International Affairs* (2008) p. 126; Johnson, supra note 73, p. 450.\n Johnson, supra note 73, pp. 451–452.\n153</ssrn.com>\nErki Kodar\nregarded as law, they may still become customary law over time or contain nascent customary law. Unfortunately, at the moment, the General Assembly seems to be lacking the initiative. Considering the novelty of legal problems related to CNA, the adoption of resolutions on cyber war is probably not realistic over the next decade.\nOne alternative is represented by codification of customary law as a ‘manual’, as was done with the law of naval warfare by the International Institute of Humanitarian Law, or to enthuse progress by way of custom, codes of conduct or rules of engagement where codification would be based on experience. Unfortunately, the summoning of the experts of the given sphere is highly unlikely for the lack of customary law to be codified for the purposes of cyber war. Adoption of best-practices guidelines seems to be realistic.\nThe current mindset of States seems to be more domestic than international as States have identified that CNA prevention and control is closely connected with regular home and private users. Estonia adopted in 2008 the Cyber Security Strategy, and President Obama’s administration is conducting at the moment a 60-day cyber security review to ascertain how to apply cyber security policy. The Center of Strategic and International Studies Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency released a report on the same issues 8 December 2008. The aim of both documents is to raise the awareness of private computer users and the private sector to take responsibility for their computers and secure them against unwanted uses. Some authors argue that there exists a civic duty to secure private machines against becoming a part of botnet. Responsible civil conduct would minimise the risk of exploitation for the users but also for the State concerned as it enables the State to exercise diligence on its own territory and control, to a certain extent, that its sovereign territory is not used for conducting CNAs against other states. Thus States are trying to get their houses in order before moving towards international measures.\nIn general, future perspectives for the regulation of CNA are stuck behind several obstacles. Firstly, legislative problems related to CNA are not fully understood, mainly because of technological unpredictability. Secondly, traditional armament control agreements and humanitarian law conventions cannot be adapted for CNA\n Ibid., p. 452.\n J.

Thirdly, States have no explicit picture of the form of an international law regime that would promote their national interests in the best possible way in a long-term perspective with regard to CNA.\n# 5. Conclusion\nCNA is a challenge for international law because at the moment the law applies by way of analogy and interpretation in *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*. There are no express norms or customs that would regulate the uncertainty of CNA. The current framework of international law tries to fit the odd-shaped peg of CNA into a predetermined context, but this is not a satisfactory long-term solution. But some applicable rules and principles are better than no rules, better than a legal vacuum that would leave CNA out of legal reality. States and individuals with CNA capabilities will use the ambiguity to their advantage, but this will also bring State practice and more clarity to law, albeit through actions and consequences that may be harmful and unforeseen.\nWhen Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed that the life of law has not been of logic but of experience, he meant both the aforementioned and the possible future. The law is always behind the present, either by a step or two. Due to its flexible norm-creating procedure, international law only has to encounter a number of CNA incidents that will change the paradigm and give the required incentive to create legal regulation concerning the use of information weapons. Until then States need to cope with the existing law. Where it regards the use of CNA as use of force we can paraphrase Justice Stewart that we will know it when we see it or, in other words, law will recognise certain forms of CNA as the use of force only after it has been factually established that it has been the use of force.\nWhile the more capable States have adopted either ambivalent or even an attitude of ignorance with regard to the regulation of CNA over the last decade, some forms of co-operation may still be realistic, as demonstrated by the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. Estonia's contribution to NATO's cyber defence policy and the establishment of the Centre of Excellence may lead NATO towards another agreement, which may expand the member States' understanding of cyber law and cyber war and influence other States.\n155"

Introduction\nIt seems one has to accept as inevitable that when something useful for the improvement of man’s life is invented, thoughts will either turn towards how to use it as a weapon or destroy it, or, in the case of computer network technology, both.¹\nApril and May 2007 were the most tumultuous months in Estonia’s history after the restoration of independence in 1991. The relocation of the Bronze Soldier monument from Tallinn city centre resulted in two nights of rioting and looting in Tallinn and besieging of the Estonian embassy in Moscow. Physical rioting and looting was accompanied with virtual violence in cyberspace that lasted for three weeks as governmental and non-governmental websites were attacked with distributed denial of\n* Adviser at the International Law Section, Legal Department, Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Estonia; Conductor of the international humanitarian law course at the University of Tartu, Faculty of Law.

These cyber attacks, or computer network attacks (CNA), crippled the web pages and computer systems of ministries, banks, broadcasters, newspapers and emergency services with the possible aim of reducing the media coverage and dissemination of public information regarding the consequences of the relocation of the Bronze Soldier.² Some Estonian officials accused that the attacks were orchestrated or tolerated by the administration of the Russian Federation.³ The latter denied strongly any involvement in such acts and no definite attribution has been made in this case.⁴\nThe cyber attack on Estonia’s critical IT-systems was not unprecedented, but the combination of crude (ping floods, defacement) and sophisticated (DDoS, use of botnets) measures used in the attack delineated a new standard in cyber attacks against a State.⁵ Both qualitatively and quantitatively the attacks perpetrated were the largest of any known cyber attacks that have taken place in the world recently.\nEstonia’s case might be the best example to demonstrate that globalisation is in the modern world accompanied by an increased number of attacks against computer networks, and that the attacks may be launched by States, representatives of States, terrorists, criminals and/or cyber hooligans. Thus CNA is an asymmetric weapon ideal for use by powerful States that harness the required capability but also by clever individuals with harmful intents.\nConsidering the powerful technical advancements that have been made by information technology over the last three or four decades, it would be logical to assume\n2 NATO has produced a short documentary on the attacks called ‘Six Colours: War In Cyberspace’, <www.nato.int ebookshop=\"\" eix_colours=\"\" six_colours.html=\"\" video=\"\">, visited 30 March 2009.\n3 Daily Telegraph, ‘Russia Accused over Estonian “Cyber-Terrorism”’, 18 May 2007, <www.telegraph.co.uk 1551850=\"\" news=\"\" Russia-accused-over-Estonian-cyber-terrorism.html=\"\" worldnews=\"\" worldnews,=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009; Times Online, ‘Estonia Accuses Russia of “Waging Cyber War”’, 17 May 2007, <www.timesonline.co.uk 28=\"\" article1802959.ece=\"\" europe=\"\" et=\"\" tol=\"\" www.world=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009.\n4 The Guardian, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, 17 May 2007, <www.guardian.co.uk 17=\"\" 2007=\"\" may=\"\" topstories3.russia=\"\" world=\"\" way=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009; RIA Novosti, ‘Estonia Has No Evidence of Kremlin Involvement in Cyber Attacks’, 6 September 2007, <en.rian.ru 20070906=\"\" 76959190.html=\"\" world=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009.\n5 In 2005 the US Defence Department reported that Chinese web sites had been heavily used to target its computer networks.

This assumption is wrong. When discussing cyber attacks in terms of public international law and humanitarian law, we are faced with a relatively new phenomenon, which does not fit into any global legal framework regulating IT activities. There has been progress on a regional level – the Council of Europe has adopted the Convention on Cybercrime and the United States of America is keen to regulate cybercrime issues in legal assistance agreements. $^{6}$  Nevertheless, these advancements are mostly confined to the realm of domestic criminal law and do not address the issues of international law. At the current time it would appear that the lack of sufficient State practice and opinio juris has not allowed international customary law to develop that would concisely deal with cyber attacks.\nThere are several reasons for the lack of a comprehensive legal regulation – various development levels of countries (third world versus developed countries); predictable benefits accompanying the absence of specific frameworks (maintenance of sovereign freedom of action); and the understanding that cyber attacks represent a new legal phenomenon. There does not exist a notable selection of legal materials that would analyse the issue. I. Detter concurs that “[t]he problem has not been approached in any systematic way although numerous institutions and governments have expressed concern about the problem. ... However, there has been little, if any, academic comment.”7 Research publications or books have dealt with problem briefly or not with sufficient in-depth analysis.8 The US Naval War College’s so-called “Blue Book”9 and the 1999 US Department of Defense study remain the foundational materials in this field.10 Despite the ambiguity of the legal situation, more than 30 different countries worldwide, including USA, China, India and Russia, have publicly admitted\n6 The 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n7 I.

Several standards and principles of international law can be successfully applied to information operations (IO) either directly or by analogy. Also, academic discourse has enlivened after the events that took place in spring 2007 and the proliferation of cyber attacks in recent years.\nThe definition of IO is based on USA Department of Defense Joint Publication 1-02.¹² As USA is considered to be the most capable State in the sphere of cyber wars, the definitions provided below are used for the purposes of academic debate and also for the reason that other authors have adopted them to describe cyber attacks.¹³\nInformation operations are defined as the “integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own”.¹⁴ The term represents a generic definition, comprised of the following activities and operations:\n**computer network operations (CNO)** – Comprised of computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.¹⁵\n**computer network exploitation (CNE)** – Enabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks.¹⁶\n11 E.

Both civil and military structures use the same technical facilities. Due to the consolidation of both structures there exists a danger that the initiated CNA will transform, either deliberately or un-deliberately, from one structure to another, thus accompanied by serious consequences. CNA also challenges common understanding of geographical spaces and territorial integrity, as attacks may cross several State borders.^^\nCNA demands that military operations planners and high-ranking government officials take into account the following questions of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. For example, does a cyber attack constitute an ‘armed attack’ under the United Nations Charter? Does there have to be physical damage to property or loss of life before a State can exercise the right of self-defence? What would be a proportionate response against such an attack? What are the evaluation criteria for targets that are dual-use targets used both by military and civil systems? Is the cyber attack a violation of criminal or international law? In what cases is there State responsibility for acts of individuals acting from its own territory? What could be the future perspectives for the regulation of CNA?\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a general assessment of the legal consequences of CNA according to jus ad bellum and jus in bello, mapping the problems encountered in both spheres of law upon the application of international law on CNA, and to suggest possible future perspectives for the regulation of CNA.\n## 2. Jus ad Bellum and CNA\nThe foundation for the contemporary jus ad bellum, the law regarding the use of force, is the Charter of the United Nations.^^ According to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter,\n17 Ibid.\n18 Ibid.\n19 By conducting a CNA with a ‘botnet’, the attacking computers may reside in different jurisdictions and the data stream may cross State borders by way of masking the initial source of the attack. Therefore the target may have to counter attacks that come from different jurisdictions and may have a concise centre of origin, but tracking the origin can be difficult, if not impossible.\n20 Hereinafter also ‘UN Charter’.\nErki Kodar\n“[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. Such a ban of the use of force is regarded as an imperative norm of international law, *jus cogens*, from which no deviation is allowed, and it is binding for all States in the world community.”²¹\nFor further analysis, it is important to know the two UN Charter exceptions from the ban of using force, namely, the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State (Article 51 of UN Charter) and use of force within the framework of a collective security system (Articles 39 and 42 of UN Charter).\n## 2.1. Applying the UN Charter to CNA – Can CNA Constitute Use of Force?\nThe first obstacle to the implementation of the regulation regarding the use of force is the following question: Could CNA be treated as an armed attack? Although Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does not elaborate on what could be interpreted as a threat or use of force, the *travaux préparatoires* of the Charter indicate that this must be an armed attack.²² More so, the Charter mentions that each State has the inherent right of an individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State. The competence of the Security Council in relation to acting upon CNA matters will raise fewer problems, as it is possible for the Security Council to treat CNA as a threat to peace or violation of peace (it is doubtful whether CNA can cross the threshold established for aggression), provided that there is political will between the Permanent Members.²³\nCNA represents a challenge to the valid paradigm related to the use of force as its consequences cannot easily be classified as activities that threaten the values of the international community or as consequences that are of the severity equal to the use of physical force. The consequences can be spread over a broad spectrum from everyday IT disruption to widespread physical damages. In the former category would be for example the temporary paralysation of computer networks without any direct or indirect physical effects. The latter category could entail attacks against critical infrastructure systems with intent to cause physical damages to objects or even loss of life. Disruption of IT systems will most probably not equate to an armed attack as they would be more of nuisance if any anything else and can be dealt with in the domestic legal system with Computer Emergency Response Teams, judicial system and mutual assistance agreements, if applicable. In the case of physical damages and loss of life\n21 M. Shaw, *International Law*, 5th ed. (Cambridge University Press, 2006) p. 1018.\n22 On the interpretation of the term ‘armed attack’ in light of CNA, see M. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’, 37 *Columbia Journal of Transnational Law* (1999) pp. 900–908. On the issue what constitutes a ‘force’, see Shaw, *supra* note 21, pp. 1019–1021.\n23 Schmitt, *supra* note 22, pp. 924–927.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthe State has to evaluate whether the CNA caused the damages and are the damages analogous to an armed attack and would give right to resort to self-defence.\nA majority of acknowledged international law scholars are of the opinion that CNA can be regarded as an armed attack only if certain stringent criteria have been fulfilled, but mainly the consequences of the CNA must be equal to the consequences of a physical armed attack. For example, economic and political measures of pressure will not constitute the violation of the ban to use force even though CNA is a very useful tool for disrupting commerce communications, etc. Thus, CNA will oscillate between measures adopted to apply political and economic pressure and the use of armed force. Incurrence of physical damage as a result of CNA is the pre-requisite to regard it as an armed attack. Unfortunately, this criterion cannot be treated as an absolute and it largely depends on the evaluation of the situation. The consequences of CNA should be assessed case-by-case to ascertain whether they are similar to the consequences of an armed attack or whether consequences stay below the level of threshold for use of force.\nThis categorisation is critical because upon it determines which type of countermeasures the defending State may choose in the given case. Professor M. Schmitt gives two explanatory examples: In the first case, \"computer network attacks disable a busy air traffic control system during horrendous weather. An airliner crashes and deaths result. No kinetic force has been used to destroy the airliner, but CNA was plainly the proximate cause of the tragedy.\"25 Causal relation between the CNA and the airplane crash is established. Opposite of this spectrum, CNA is used to attack \"a university computer network, designed to disrupt military related research occurring in campus laboratories\".26 This attack interferes with the conduct of research related to armed forces.\nLeaving aside the questions of attribution and State involvement in the attacks, Schmitt posits that the first case can be construed as use of force as it results in a loss of life, physical destruction and the consequences are comparable to the use of armed force. Thus it would be lawful for the injured State to act in self-defence after such an incident even though no physical attack infringed its borders. In the second case, the consequences of CNA are less serious than in the first example and represent an assumed unlawful invasion into a computer network and the consequences of this\n24 D. Silver, ‘Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force under Article 2(4)’, 76 International Law Studies (2002) pp. 84–92; Y. Dinstein, ‘Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense’, 76 International Law Studies (2002) pp. 102–105; Schmitt, supra note 22, pp. 914–915; An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations, Department of Defense, Office of General Counsel, <www.au.af.mil au=\"\" awc=\"\" doc-io-legal=\"\" dwc=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009, pp. 18–25.\n25 Schmitt, supra note 22, p. 916.\n26 Ibid.\n27 Ibid.\n139</www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\nactivity cannot be equal to the use of armed force, although scientific work related to the activities of armed forces has been disrupted.\nIf CNA can constitute use of armed force, the canonical restrictions established for the response to an armed attack in self-defence must be also applied thereto – that is, countermeasures taken to deal with a threat must be proportional and necessary to the threat. Another contentious issue is whether a State under a CNA attack can counter in self-defence with only CNA or with physical force. Law regarding use of force does not prescribe the measures to be adopted in self-defence as long as they are proportionate and necessary against the attack. Therefore it would be lawful for the injured State to resort to physical force if the aforementioned criteria are fulfilled.\nWithout concise legal regulation, it will be up to State practice to decide whether CNA will qualify as use of force or not. Such a case-based approach will not necessarily contribute to completely uniform practice but, if we are to look for a better consensus, the UN Security Council has the competence to qualify CNA as a threat to peace as provided by Article 39 of the UN Charter. The involvement of the Security Council would be beneficial for the Permanent Members or for larger countries that have sufficient clout to influence Permanent Members.\nThe involvement of the Security Council would be most probably of little use for non-members when the suspected or alleged acts of one of the Permanent Members are in question. In such cases the Security Council will most probably find itself in a veto deadlock. However, the Security Council could give more specific guidelines with regard to CNA incidents that fall into the 'grey area' of use of force or not. Then again this scenario could be counterproductive and against the self-interests of the Permanent Members because they are also potentially the most capable States for conducting such acts and gaining from such behaviour.\n## 2.2. Problems Related to Attribution of Responsibility in Case of CNA\nThe above lack of legal distinction should not be interpreted as a situation where everything explicitly not forbidden is permissible if the use of CNA does not violate *jus cogens* norms, customary law or treaty law. Unlawful or indiscriminate uses of CNA can violate generally recognised principles of international law (for example, the principle of non-intervention in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of a State). The injured State may demand reparations for injuries from the responsible State according to the principles of State responsibility. Nevertheless, the matter of State responsibility is especially complicated in the case of CNA as its source can be concealed. The subject of attack may be acting on false impressions of the attack coming from another State that is not necessarily responsible for the attack (for example, the responsible State D may launch CNA against State A through unbeknownst State C and masking the origin of the attack as to convey the impression that CNA comes from State B).\nThe relative ease of use of CNA has the potential to make States complacent with regard to State responsibility. If CNA has been State orchestrated, carried out by the agents of State, then the attribution of State responsibility is not complicated.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nNowadays laptops have more computing power than a room full of supercomputers in the 1970s and private individuals and organisations have access to high-speed internet connections from which to conduct multiple CNAs of different severity unbeknownst to their State of residence. This can create situations where State A knowingly or unknowingly tolerates CNA activities against State B and the attacks cross the threshold of armed attack. In this case State B regards itself as being under attack and starts to defend itself against the actions coming from State A. Therefore State A may unwillingly violate international law. By the text of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts²⁸ the acts individuals of State A are attributable to it and the acts in question breach international obligation (prohibition of use of force, prohibition of non-intervention).²⁹ State B can prove the support of State A with either signal or human reconnaissance (for example, identifying that the attack is being launched from a computer network of a government agency) or from official pronouncements of government officials.\nIf an individual living in State A is violating the rights of State B from the territory of the same State, State B may require the punishment of that respective individual from State A or initiation of extradition proceedings. Under aggravating circumstances, State B may adopt self-defence measures against an attack coming from State A in the territory of State A, but only if State A does not wish or is unable to avoid the appropriate actions against State B. Professor Y. Dinstein has classified the attribution of responsibility related to CNA originating from State A and directed against State B into four categories:³⁰\nThe first category consists of cases where citizens of State A launch CNA on their own initiative and for reasons only known to them. Their activities cannot be attributed to the government of State A. In the given case, State A should exercise sufficient executive duress against the individuals concerned so that they would either end or avoid launching the attacks against State B from the territory of State A.³¹\nThe second category consists of cases when certain individuals or terrorists residing in State A launch CNA against State B for certain ideological, etc. reasons and the terrorists are not supported by State A. The obligations of State A are the same that were described under the first category.³²\nIn the third category terrorists supported by the State A launch CNA against State B. If the actions can be attributed to terrorists supported by State A, the terrorists could be treated as de facto representatives of State A as provided by the principles of State\n28 Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-third Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001).\n29 Article 2 of 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n30 Dinstein, supra note 24, p. 103.\n31 Ibid., pp. 103–104.\n32 Ibid.\n141\nErki Kodar\nresponsibility, and State A will be held responsible to State B.³³ The support given to terrorists by State A needs to be proven in this case.³⁴\nIn the fourth category government organs of State A launch CNA against State B. This represents the most complicated category as the actions of representatives of a State within the CNA sphere may have a number of forms – like espionage (which cannot be construed as the use of force), interruption of communication systems with no harm to humans (not grave enough to exceed the threshold of use of force) and cyber attacks that result in harm done to persons. The latter is treated as CNA that oversteps the threshold established for the use of force, but all the cases described in this category can be ascribed to State A.³⁵\n‘Active defence’ is also possible as a counter-measure against CNA, meaning that a State under CNA attack will attack the computer system of another State being the source of the CNA, considering that it will be later forced to apologise, in public, for the ‘counterattack’ or pay compensation.\nAt the current moment, launching a cyber attack by a State against another State represents the exception and not the rule.³⁶ Most CNAs are perpetrated by individuals and non-State actors, but the attribution of such acts to them or the State harbouring them is complicated as evidence is hard to get or evidence can be misleading in the case of a sophisticated attack.\n## 2.3. Jus ad Bellum and CNA – Future Trends\nIn the near future, jus ad bellum will still be subject to an understanding that the use of force or threat of force within cyberspace will remain a fact to be identified separately in each case. The majority of cyber attacks will not exceed the threshold of use of force, but the valid paradigm may be subject to change if clear-cut cases emerge. For example, some scholars are of the opinion that the USA may decide to respond with armed force if a cyber attack launched by another State destroys the informa\n33 Article 8 of 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n34 Dinstein, supra note 24, p. 104.\n35 Ibid., p. 105.\n36 Currently the use of CNA against a State occurs in an armed conflict as an additional measure to classical kinetic force. The conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008 also had occurrences of CNA use but it is open whether these were carried out by Russia or ‘voluntary hackers’.

The non liquet position, adopted by the Department of Defense of the USA in 1999, was the following:\nAs in all cases when a nation considers acting in self-defense, the nation considering such action will have to make its best judgment on how world opinion, or perhaps a body such as the International Court of Justice or the United Nations Security Council, is likely to apply the doctrine of self-defence to electronic attacks. As with many novel legal issues, we are likely to discover the answer only from experience.³⁸\nThis decade old position would seem to be still valid prima facie as there have been no clarifying developments in international law in this regard. If we are dealing with a situation where State A is supporting the activities of criminals and therefore CNA is launched against State B, responding with CNA to CNA is probably acceptable and justified. If CNA exceeds the threshold for the use of force, the traditional kinetic self-defence capabilities may be employed. But at the moment there does not exist a defined yardstick – CNA with grave consequences can be treated as the use of force in the future, while consequences that do not meet the threshold will not be treated as use of force.\nIn the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), CNA with consequences equal to use of force might be in some extreme cases regarded as events that may trigger the collective self-defence provision of Article 5 in the North Atlantic Treaty, although this seems doubtful. NATO’s own rhetoric has been in this field cautious, if not in the negative.³⁹ This is due to the fact that current and previous attacks have not exceeded the threshold mentioned, and thus it is hard to predict the consequence of future CNA. Most probably the only article applicable in the NATO framework would be Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, in which case members will enter into consultations if the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the members is threatened. Only time and State practice will tell whether CNA\n37 Schmitt, supra note 13, p. 377.\n38 An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations, Department of Defense, Office of General Counsel, <www.au.af.mil au=\"\" dodo-io-legal=\"\" dwc=\"\" awcgate=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009, p. 19.\n39 Press conference with NATO Secretary General following the informal meeting of NATO Defence Ministers, 8 February 2008, <nids.hq.nato.int 2008=\"\" 2008/s080208c.html=\"\" docu=\"\" speech=\"\">, visited on 27 March 2009; DefenseLink, ‘NATO Leader Expresses Cautious Optimism about Afghanistan’, <www.defenselink.mil news=\"\" newsarticle.aspx?id=\"48910\">, visited on 27 March 2009; IBLS, ‘NATO Agrees To Create Cyber Defence Management Authority’, 15 May 2008, <www.ibls.com 2009;=\"\" 4=\"\" and=\"\" approach=\"\" en=\"\" infosociety=\"\" infosociety.nato-agrees-common-approach-cyber-defence=\"\" internet_law_news_portal_view.aspx?s=\"latestnews&amp;id=2054\" name=\"\" nato-agrees-common-approach-cyber-defence=\"\" site=\"\" www.euractiv.com=\"\">, visited on 27 March 2009.\n143</www.ibls.com></www.defenselink.mil></nids.hq.nato.int></www.au.af.mil>\nErki Kodar\ncan be realistically construed as use of force according to the UN Charter that would activate the self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty framework.\n## 3. Jus in Bello and CNA\n*Jus in bello* or international humanitarian law is a set of legal norms applicable in case of an armed conflict. When CNA is used in an armed conflict as a weapon then legal restrictions arising that regulate the use of weapons are applicable to CNA. These restrictions must be adhered to in self-defence operations when countering CNA with CNA or when responding to a physical attack with CNA. Also, in cases of use of CNA as an offensive weapon there is a need to understand the legal restrictions that regulate the selection of targets and the precautions in attack to be adopted.\n## 3.1. Legal Assumptions for the Implementation of Humanitarian Law in the Case of CNA\nIn international humanitarian law, there is no explicit provision that deals with either CNA or IO or cyber war. Nevertheless, the Martens Clause, which is regarded as customary law,⁴⁰ states that “in cases not included in the [Hague] Regulations adopted by them, populations and belligerents remain under the protection and empire of the principles of international law, as they result from the usages established between civilised nations, from the laws of humanity and the requirements of the public conscience”.⁴¹ The modernised Martens Clause is contained in Article 1(2) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which states that “[i] n cases not covered by this Protocol or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of the principles of international law derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience”.⁴² The purpose of the Martens Clause is to affirm that the belligerents’ choice of methods or means of warfare is not unlimited and to eliminate any incidents in armed conflicts that are not covered by treaty regulation or customary law. Therefore, these principles reaffirm that even without explicit mention of CNA in modern treaties or customs, certain restrictions still apply.\nThe ICJ has reaffirmed that for weapons two customary law restrictions apply. Firstly, “[s]tates must never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military\n⁴⁰ “The Court points to the Martens Clause, whose continuing existence and applicability is not to be doubted, as an affirmation that the principles and rules of humanitarian law apply to nuclear weapons”, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, 8 July 1996, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 87, <www.icj-cij.org 7495.pdf=\"\" 95=\"\" docket=\"\" files=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n⁴¹ Preamble of the 1899 Hague Convention (II) and 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land.\n⁴² 1977 Additional Protocol 1, Article 1(2).</www.icj-cij.org>\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\ntargets\".43 Secondly, \"it is prohibited to cause unnecessary suffering to combatants; it is accordingly prohibited to use weapons causing them such harm or uselessly aggravating their suffering. ... [S]tates do not have unlimited freedom of choice of means in the weapons they use.\"44 All of the above and the restrictions applicable to weapons must be taken into account if using CNA in an armed conflict.45\nCNA must be capable of fulfilling the requirement set for weapons – that it can be used in an attack and aimed against specific targets. According to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its Additional Protocols of 1977, an attack is an act of violence, which raises the question: Is CNA out-of-bounds for international humanitarian law because CNA is not a use of violence in the strictest sense of the word? The answer to this question is ‘no’ as for the purposes of humanitarian law an ‘attack’ shall represent a generic and a broad definition. ‘Violence’ therefore in humanitarian law is defined through the consequence of physical (in case of objects and physical persons) or mental (in case of physical persons only) damage. CNA does most probably bring the described consequences, and therefore the use of CNA should be treated as an attack.\nStates also have an obligation when adopting a new weapon to conduct an assessment process to determine whether the use of such new weapon would under some or all conditions be prohibited or restricted under the standards of humanitarian or some other category of international law. Unfortunately States have no obligation to publicise these findings, and thus the majority of these analyses are off the record and not available to the general public.\nThe discussion below is based on an assumption that there is an established armed conflict governed by the norms and principles prescribed in international humanitarian law. International humanitarian law will only apply to CNA if CNA's consequences are not just sporadic and isolated cases and are aimed to cause injuries, death, damages and destruction and where such consequences are predictable or desired. Humanitarian law is not applicable to CNA if these consequences do not include the causing of injuries, death, damages and destruction during an armed conflict (for example, the failure of a university intranet, downloading of financial information, temporary closing of access to internet or being involved in cyber espionage).\n43 Nuclear Weapons case, supra note 40, para. 78.\n44 Ibid.\n45 It has been argued that “[i]t is perfectly reasonable to assume that also the new forms of CNA, which do not involve the use of traditional weapons, are subject to IHL just as any new weapon or delivery system has been so far when used in an armed conflict”, in Dörmann, supra note 13.\n46 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 49(1).\n47 Commentary of the 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 49, <www.icrc.org 470-750062?opendocument=\"\" ihl.nsf=\"\" com=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n48 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 36.</www.icrc.org>\nErki Kodar\n## 3.2. CNA and Legitimate Targets\nIf CNA constitutes an attack or the use of violence in an armed conflict, the next question arises: What can be attacked with the weapon and what are the legitimate targets? For analytical purposes M. Schmitt divides targets into four categories: combatants and military targets; civilians, who directly participate in hostilities; objects used by both military and civilians; specifically protected objects.^^\nCombatants and military targets are legitimate targets^^ and can be targeted as long as the means and methods of attack comply with the restrictions established by humanitarian law.^^ Therefore, aiming a CNA against combatants is permissible (for example, falsifying military air traffic control system navigational information that results in a military transport crash).^^ When attacking military targets, the attack against a target must considerably contribute to military action and provide for a definite military advantage.^^ Attack against the enemy's command and control networks, etc. does not create difficulties. However, which principles should be adopted in case of contestable targets: Can CNA be aimed against a banking system as the sustainability of armed forces depends on wealth? If a State is disproportionately dependent upon a specific industry (for example, oil), can CNA be used to stop production and distribution?^^ Is it important that the attack is accompanied by physical destruction, not just inconvenience? If the purpose is only to cause inconvenience, this does not exceed the threshold of a military attack.\nCivilians represent individuals who are not considered combatants and civilian targets are targets that are not military targets. Therefore the armed forces have an obligation to direct their attacks against military objectives.^^ Notwithstanding legitimate collateral damage, the ban on attacking civilians and civilian targets is practically absolute. Civilians lose their immunity when participating directly in hostilities by causing damages to the members or supplies of the enemy's armed forces.^^ The use of civilians to launch CNA, as sub-contractors or civil servants, is full of legal problems and issues.^^ The main problem with CNA is that it encompasses activities\n^^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, pp. 379–387.\n^^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52 notes that civilian objects shall not be the object of attack and that attacks shall be limited to military objectives.\n^^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(i) demands that the attackers must do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are not civilian objects, but military objectives.\n^^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 380.\n^^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3).\n^^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 381. This is an issue of interpretation of the 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3). Some States, like the USA, regard economic targets as legitimate targets.\n^^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Articles 48, 50(1), 51(2) and 52(1).\n^^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 51(3).\n^^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 384; Dörmann, *supra* note 13; 2003 Summary Report prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross on the Direct Participation in\n146\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nthat can be realistically conducted by government agencies and authorities rather than by members of armed forces. If civilians are directly involved in conducting CNA resulting in physical damages, such persons may be treated as unlawful combatants as they are participating directly in hostilities. Thus the IT-support personnel who are contributing to a CNA operation are at the risk of being considered targets. Civilians employed for the purpose of CNA represent a challenge for humanitarian law as they would not fit under the category of lawful combatants. When it is impossible to restrict the participation of civilians in military activities, this may endanger the civilian population as the enemy cannot make a clear distinction between combatants and civilians. Considering the skill-sets required for CNA it is more than reasonable to assume civilian involvement in such attacks, but the correct course of action should be that the members of armed forces conduct CNA.\nDual-use targets have both military and civil purposes (airports, railways, electrical systems, communication systems, factories producing material for both the civilian population and armed forces, etc.).58 If an object is being used for military purposes, it will be construed as a military target that can be attacked with all the permissible methods, including CNA. The aforementioned is also valid in a situation where the military objectives of a target are only secondary to the civilian objectives.\nHumanitarian law grants special protection to certain objects like dykes, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.59 Objects under special protection are defined as hazardous facilities as attacking them may launch dangerous forces and cause serious losses among the civilian population. As a general rule, such targets should not be attacked if the emission of dangerous forces cannot be controlled, but in the case of CNA it would be possible to neutralise these targets without launching any dangerous forces (which is an advantage, compared to kinetic weapons).60\n# 3.3. CNA's Compatibility with General Principles of Humanitarian Law\nOnce it has been determined that a target is lawful, the concordance of attack with general principles (and norms regarding targeting) of humanitarian law should be assessed before the attack is launched. These principles are the principle of distinction, prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, principle of proportionality and the prohibition of perfidy.\nHostilities under International Humanitarian Law, <www.icrc.org eng=\"\" direct%20participation-hostilities-ihl-311205=\"\" siteeng0.nsf=\"\" siteeng0.nsf/=\"\" /=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009; K.

While CNA can be used in compliance with the principle of distinction, it can also be, like conventional weapons, used indiscriminately. No matter how attractive the idea of launching one extensive CNA campaign against the infrastructures of the State as a whole would be, including attacks against the civil sector, all CNA attacks must be aimed against military targets. The principle entails an obligation to minimise collateral damage and to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be disproportionate to the value of the military objective to be attacked.\nThe principle of distinction is closely knitted with the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks. Indiscriminate attack stands for attacks that are not aimed against a specific military objective, employing the methods and means of warfare, which cannot be aimed against a military target or employing the methods and means of warfare the consequence of which cannot be restricted.⁶² With CNA, the main threat is posed by the fact that it can be used for launching indiscriminate attacks, either deliberately or inadvertently. If malicious code CNA is employed that is uncontrollable and spreading through civilian systems, then such CNA is prohibited as an indiscriminate weapon.⁶³ Taking into account that civilian and military networks are closely intertwined, the launched CNA must be of such sophistication that it conforms to the prohibition.\nThe principle of proportionality demands that conflicting interests must be weighed against each other – sufferings and damages versus military advantage.⁶⁴ If military advantage outweighs incidental loss of life or damages to civilians or civilian objects, the attack is construed to be in compliance with the principle of proportionality (although the principle seems to be rather simple, its implementation in practice is extremely complicated). The majority of the problems of CNA in this equation are caused by knock-on effects that are “not directly and immediately caused by the attack, but nevertheless the product thereof – it is the problem of the effects caused by the effects of an attack”.⁶⁵ As CNA may result in consequences which are initially unpredictable, one must always assess when planning an attack whether CNA would be accompanied by endangering the civil population or not. As the CNA attacks are complicated and may, with great probability, affect civilian systems, one must assess the causal damages and possible consequences during the planning stage of any operation prior to launching an attack and seek ways to mitigate these effects. Then again, CNA as a method may help to diminish collateral damage as it allows, instead of physical destruction, to ‘switch off’ the target (for example, instead of bombing an\n61 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 48.\n62 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 51(4).\n63 Schmitt, supra note 13, p. 389.\n64 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(iii).\n65 Schmitt, supra note 13, p. 392.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\nairport it is possible to disturb the operation of flight control systems).⁶⁶ CNA allows the attacker to directly control the consequences and minimise the risk to civilian population when the attained military advantage has been achieved.\nPerfidy is the feigning of protected status with the intent to kill, injure or capture an adversary.⁶⁷ The prohibition of perfidy does not mean that ruses of war cannot be used.⁶⁸ For the purposes of CNA, a ruse would be communication of incorrect information on location and manoeuvres, forging the information in the enemy’s reconnaissance database, etc.⁶⁹ Perfidy would be pretending to have a protected status, and for the purposes of CNA this would be deceptive use of codes and signals given to medical transport by the International Civil Aviation Organization.⁷⁰\nWhile the humanitarian law in force is, in general, sufficient to protect individuals and objects from CNA, some uncertainties still exist. Even though it was impossible to predict the occurrence of CNA upon the emergence of current humanitarian law, some general standards are, nevertheless, applicable to CNA. At the same time CNA is characterised by specifics that also represent challenges and problems for the purposes of *jus in bello*: When does one consider CNA as an ‘attack’ in *jus in bello* and when only as a nuisance? But CNA is also a positive tool that allows for achieving military objectives without the causal damages that may result from kinetic attacks. It should also be remembered that CNA is a weapon, and any unlawful use may bring about incrimination for the commitment of war crimes.\n## 4. Possible Future Scenarios for the Regulation of CNA\nIn all probability a new defined structure of international law will not be introduced in the nearest future that would encapsulate all the cases of use of force with regard to cyberspace and the assessment of CNA *vis-à-vis* the right of self-defence. The issue is at the mercy of practical experiences of different States as there seems to be unwillingness to enter into international or regional agreements in this sphere. The *status quo* is useful for States with better CNA capabilities to maintain freedom of action. But there might be will to move towards some foreseeable developments.⁷¹\nIn 1998 Russia attempted to initiate a United Nations General Assembly resolution dealing with the banning of some highly dangerous information operations.⁷²\n66 *Ibid.*, p. 394.\n67 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 37(1).\n68 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 37(2).\n69 K.

The Naval War College in Newport, USA organised a CNA-conference in 1999, where the participants agreed that it would be useful and sensible to intensify international co-operation in the sphere of computer crime and cyber terrorism, but the time has not yet come for introducing a comprehensive regulation or banning in general.73 More extensive co-operation in the sphere of legal assistance was justified with the pretence for the criminalisation of actions threatening the international community to bring the criminals to justice and to simplify the extradition procedure.74\nIf legal assistance agreements are to serve as an effective instrument to fight cybercrime, it is necessary for them to have an explicit scope including either cybercrime or all crimes in general. If countries have not entered into extradition agreements, this means that such countries have neither a duty nor the domestic legal basis to extradite a person to another State.75 It would also be difficult to sustain the argument that the principle of *aut dedere aut judicare* is customary law with relation to CNA.76 An alternative to extradition would be to administer justice to a person who has committed CNA against another State in the CNA's State of origin.77\nDoc.

Estonia's Role in the Development of CNA-related Agreements or Standards?\nProfessor D. Hollis, who studied the cyber attacks against Estonia, suggests the creation of the right of hot pursuit available to a State which is the object of a cyber attack as \"nations could agree to waive sovereignty concerns and permit a direct response in certain cases, such as cyber attacks by terrorists that all nations might want thwarted\". The thought would suggest that it would be appropriate to allow the attacked State to use counter measures to defend itself from an attack with extraterritorial measures even if such countermeasures would violate the sovereignty of the State being the origin of the attacks. Let us assume that hackers from Russia were behind the attacks against Estonia, and they had no connections with either the government or the armed forces. According to the current procedure, Estonia should ask Russia to maintain law and order in its territory as a kinetic counterattack would represent violation of Russia's sovereignty. According to proposed new standards of international law the States could leave aside all the worries related to their sovereignty and allow, in certain cases (as a community value all States should be interested in preventing the activities of cyber terrorists), the implementation of direct countermeasures by a State under attack. While this sounds sensible, the development of an appropriate regulation is highly doubtful as States do not wish to open a Pandora's Box on the use of force, and the described scenario would leave numerous opportunities for serious misconduct and abuse.\nHollis also opines that Estonia wanted to construe cyber attack against the State as military activity (a new paradigm) and not as an act subject to penal power (the former paradigm). It can be assumed that in the future cyberspace will become the battlefield where military power is used, humanitarian law is applied and valid penal power framework may be imposed for combined effect. In a military sense, cyberspace can be treated as an asymmetric field even now as States are not necessarily combating each other; it is rather the case of non-State actors positioning themselves against a State (or joining in with the State).\nThe establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia may represent a progressive step for the purposes of international law. The birth and activities of the centre may provide beneficial practical experiences and legal evidence. In addition, CNA can be regulated under national law, which could\nErki Kodar\nalso provide the grounds for the birth of internationally acknowledged standards in the future.\n## 4.2. Possible Developments of International Law in the Sphere of CNA\nA way ahead could be the conclusion of a multilateral agreement, involving specific and accurate standards applicable to CNA. In the given situation, the conclusion of a framework treaty that prescribes main and essential principles and gives States more freedom for the interpretation of specific aspects is more likely. Regionally, the conclusion of either bilateral or regional agreements (Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime represents a step in this direction) may be possible – provided that there is political will.\nOne way forward would be to draft new counterterrorism measures and agreements dealing with cybercrime and cyber terrorism. Measures preventing cybercrime have been taken both at the regional and global level to supplement national criminal law and international co-operation in the sphere of investigating and prosecuting such crimes. The main problem here is the difference of national law of different States or conflict of legal systems. Also, constitutional restrictions to extradition must be considered here.⁸¹ The format of an agreement for the prevention of cybercrime would be similar to the other agreements related to fighting terrorism wherein a certain type of behaviour shall qualify as terrorist activity and will be subject to a certain procedure between the member States. The aforementioned would provide a universal jurisdictional basis, or quasi-universal jurisdictional bases, for certain types of crime. At the moment, cyber terrorism is not taken seriously enough to be a subject for such agreements, and CNA must breach a high threshold to be considered as an issue worthy of international agreements.⁸² While the events that took place in Estonia in 2007 did not exceed this threshold, they can most certainly be interpreted as something more serious than common vandalism; therefore Estonia could have the opportunity to initiate the procedure for the conclusion of an agreement on the prevention of cyber terrorism. The main problem here is the fact that it is difficult to agree on which activities should be construed as cybercrime and ascertain where the line between common crime and terrorism should be drawn.\nAnother category of potential agreements could restrict the sovereign freedom of States – declarative agreements on lawful principles, armament control agreements and humanitarian law agreements. A declarative agreement would involve the most general principles that States would be willing to observe for the purposes of implementing international law (for example, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, stating that outer space is intended for common peaceful use by mankind). The pre-requisite for\n⁸¹ Russia invoked a ‘constitutional ban’ recently in the Litvinenko case and refused to extradite the prime suspect, Andrei Lugovoi.

The crux of the matter is the abrupt and powerful development of information technology as it would be impossible to predict future situations with the required level of accuracy upon the conclusion of such agreements, and consequently States may be hesitant to sign a carte blanche treaty. With armament control agreements States could commit themselves not to develop, acquire or transfer certain CNA capabilities or not to use their capabilities in a way that would be destabilising for the armament control regime or crisis management systems of another State. The pre-requisites and problems encountered when discussing this type of agreements are the same as with declarative agreements. Also, States will not always have a monopoly in CNA capabilities, considering the interests and capacities of hackers and cyber terrorists themselves. Humanitarian law agreements usually restrict the use of certain types of weapons in the case of an armed conflict. The restrictions are justified by stating that the weapon may cause unnecessary suffering. Information technology weapons, adopted in cyber war, may not necessarily fit the criteria on the grounds equivalent to conventional weapons. As general humanitarian law principles and standards can be applied to CNA, the efficiency of such agreements is doubtful. Special standards applicable to CNA would be more useful than agreements attempting to restrict the utilisation thereof.⁸³\nThe conclusion of multilateral conventions, restricting the liberty of freedom of States, is not considered as realistic in the near future, as only very few countries, if any, have an understanding of the capacities and vulnerabilities related to cyber war, sufficient to promote the long-term national interests of such States.⁸⁴\nBilateral agreements or agreements with a limited number of parties are most useful in a situation where a certain number of governments are directly involved with a concrete and common problem. This type of agreement represents a useful form of co-operation within regional scope. G8, the Council of Europe and the Organization of American States have used this to enter into regional conventions on cybercrime (and the NATO process is, potentially through cyber defence policy, moving in this direction). There still will be potential risks related to cases exceeding the limits of regional agreements or where the organisations are dominated by some of the member States, thus turning the convention into a dead letter agreement.⁸⁵\nOn an organisational plane the United Nations General Assembly has often shown initiative for the adoption of resolutions that request or invite the member States to pursue certain principles in their activities. While resolutions are not strictly\n⁸³ Ibid., pp. 446–450; D.

Unfortunately, at the moment, the General Assembly seems to be lacking the initiative. Considering the novelty of legal problems related to CNA, the adoption of resolutions on cyber war is probably not realistic over the next decade.⁸⁶\nOne alternative is represented by codification of customary law as a ‘manual’, as was done with the law of naval warfare by the International Institute of Humanitarian Law, or to enthuse progress by way of custom, codes of conduct or rules of engagement where codification would be based on experience.⁸⁷ Unfortunately, the summoning of the experts of the given sphere is highly unlikely for the lack of customary law to be codified for the purposes of cyber war. Adoption of best-practices guidelines seems to be realistic.⁸⁸\nThe current mindset of States seems to be more domestic than international as States have identified that CNA prevention and control is closely connected with regular home and private users. Estonia adopted in 2008 the Cyber Security Strategy,⁸⁹ and President Obama’s administration is conducting at the moment a 60-day cyber security review to ascertain how to apply cyber security policy.⁹⁰ The Center of Strategic and International Studies Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency released a report on the same issues 8 December 2008.⁹¹ The aim of both documents is to raise the awareness of private computer users and the private sector to take responsibility for their computers and secure them against unwanted uses. Some authors argue that there exists a civic duty to secure private machines against becoming a part of botnet.⁹² Responsible civil conduct would minimise the risk of exploitation for the users but also for the State concerned as it enables the State to exercise diligence on its own territory and control, to a certain extent, that its sovereign territory is not used for conducting CNAs against other states. Thus States are trying to get their houses in order before moving towards international measures.\nIn general, future perspectives for the regulation of CNA are stuck behind several obstacles. Firstly, legislative problems related to CNA are not fully understood, mainly because of technological unpredictability. Secondly, traditional armament control agreements and humanitarian law conventions cannot be adapted for CNA\n⁸⁶ Ibid., p. 452.\n⁸⁷ J.

Thirdly, States have no explicit picture of the form of an international law regime that would promote their national interests in the best possible way in a long-term perspective with regard to CNA.\n# 5. Conclusion\nCNA is a challenge for international law because at the moment the law applies by way of analogy and interpretation in *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*. There are no express norms or customs that would regulate the uncertainty of CNA. The current framework of international law tries to fit the odd-shaped peg of CNA into a predetermined context, but this is not a satisfactory long-term solution. But some applicable rules and principles are better than no rules, better than a legal vacuum that would leave CNA out of legal reality. States and individuals with CNA capabilities will use the ambiguity to their advantage, but this will also bring State practice and more clarity to law, albeit through actions and consequences that may be harmful and unforeseen.\nWhen Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed that the life of law has not been of logic but of experience, he meant both the aforementioned and the possible future. The law is always behind the present, either by a step or two. Due to its flexible norm-creating procedure, international law only has to encounter a number of CNA incidents that will change the paradigm and give the required incentive to create legal regulation concerning the use of information weapons. Until then States need to cope with the existing law. Where it regards the use of CNA as use of force we can paraphrase Justice Stewart that we will know it when we see it or, in other words, law will recognise certain forms of CNA as the use of force only after it has been factually established that it has been the use of force.\nWhile the more capable States have adopted either ambivalent or even an attitude of ignorance with regard to the regulation of CNA over the last decade, some forms of co-operation may still be realistic, as demonstrated by the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. Estonia's contribution to NATO's cyber defence policy and the establishment of the Centre of Excellence may lead NATO towards another agreement, which may expand the member States' understanding of cyber law and cyber war and influence other States.\n155"

Introduction\nIt seems one has to accept as inevitable that when something useful for the improvement of man’s life is invented, thoughts will either turn towards how to use it as a weapon or destroy it, or, in the case of computer network technology, both.¹\nApril and May 2007 were the most tumultuous months in Estonia’s history after the restoration of independence in 1991. The relocation of the Bronze Soldier monument from Tallinn city centre resulted in two nights of rioting and looting in Tallinn and besieging of the Estonian embassy in Moscow. Physical rioting and looting was accompanied with virtual violence in cyberspace that lasted for three weeks as governmental and non-governmental websites were attacked with distributed denial of\n* Adviser at the International Law Section, Legal Department, Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Estonia; Conductor of the international humanitarian law course at the University of Tartu, Faculty of Law. All the views expressed and possible mistakes made in this article are the author’s alone.\n\nservice attacks (DDoS), ping floods, botnets and web page defacements. These cyber attacks, or computer network attacks (CNA), crippled the web pages and computer systems of ministries, banks, broadcasters, newspapers and emergency services with the possible aim of reducing the media coverage and dissemination of public information regarding the consequences of the relocation of the Bronze Soldier.² Some Estonian officials accused that the attacks were orchestrated or tolerated by the administration of the Russian Federation.³ The latter denied strongly any involvement in such acts and no definite attribution has been made in this case.⁴ The cyber attack on Estonia’s critical IT-systems was not unprecedented, but the combination of crude (ping floods, defacement) and sophisticated (DDoS, use of botnets) measures used in the attack delineated a new standard in cyber attacks against a State.⁵ Both qualitatively and quantitatively the attacks perpetrated were the largest of any known cyber attacks that have taken place in the world recently.\nEstonia’s case might be the best example to demonstrate that globalisation is in the modern world accompanied by an increased number of attacks against computer networks, and that the attacks may be launched by States, representatives of States, terrorists, criminals and/or cyber hooligans. Thus CNA is an asymmetric weapon ideal for use by powerful States that harness the required capability but also by clever individuals with harmful intents.\nConsidering the powerful technical advancements that have been made by information technology over the last three or four decades, it would be logical to assume 134</www.scribd.com></www.washingtonpost.com></en.rian.ru></www.guardian.co.uk></www.telegraph.co.uk></www.nato.int> Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello that a uniform and existing legal regulation has been imposed on both cyber attacks and IT-crime. This assumption is wrong. When discussing cyber attacks in terms of public international law and humanitarian law, we are faced with a relatively new phenomenon, which does not fit into any global legal framework regulating IT activities. There has been progress on a regional level – the Council of Europe has adopted the Convention on Cybercrime and the United States of America is keen to regulate cybercrime issues in legal assistance agreements. Nevertheless, these advancements are mostly confined to the realm of domestic criminal law and do not address the issues of international law. At the current time it would appear that the lack of sufficient State practice and opinio juris has not allowed international customary law to develop that would concisely deal with cyber attacks.\nThere are several reasons for the lack of a comprehensive legal regulation – various development levels of countries (third world versus developed countries); predictable benefits accompanying the absence of specific frameworks (maintenance of sovereign freedom of action); and the understanding that cyber attacks represent a new legal phenomenon. There does not exist a notable selection of legal materials that would analyse the issue. I. Detter concurs that “[t]he problem has not been approached in any systematic way although numerous institutions and governments have expressed concern about the problem.... However, there has been little, if any, academic comment.”7 Research publications or books have dealt with problem briefly or not with sufficient in-depth analysis.8 The US Naval War College’s so-called “Blue Book”9 and the 1999 US Department of Defense study remain the foundational materials in this field.10 Despite the ambiguity of the legal situation, more than 30 different countries worldwide, including USA, China, India and Russia, have publicly admitted 135</www.au.af.mil> Erki Kodar to development of military capabilities and doctrines related to information operations.¹¹ The above does not mean that the legal situation could be described as empty or as a loophole. Several standards and principles of international law can be successfully applied to information operations (IO) either directly or by analogy. Also, academic discourse has enlivened after the events that took place in spring 2007 and the proliferation of cyber attacks in recent years.\nThe definition of IO is based on USA Department of Defense Joint Publication 1-02.¹² As USA is considered to be the most capable State in the sphere of cyber wars, the definitions provided below are used for the purposes of academic debate and also for the reason that other authors have adopted them to describe cyber attacks.¹³ Information operations are defined as the “integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own”.¹⁴ The term represents a generic definition, comprised of the following activities and operations: **computer network operations (CNO)** – Comprised of computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.¹⁵ **computer network exploitation (CNE)** – Enabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks.¹⁶ 136</www.icrc.org></www.icrc.org> Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello computer network attack (CNA) – Actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.^[17]^ computer network defense (CND) – Actions taken to protect, monitor, analyse, detect, and respond to unauthorised activity within the Department of Defense information systems and computer networks.^[18]^ CNA represents actions aimed against information in another computer network and computers, and the consequences of such actions may be extensive due to the fact that computers and computer networks are largely dual-use systems. Both civil and military structures use the same technical facilities. Due to the consolidation of both structures there exists a danger that the initiated CNA will transform, either deliberately or un-deliberately, from one structure to another, thus accompanied by serious consequences. CNA also challenges common understanding of geographical spaces and territorial integrity, as attacks may cross several State borders.^[19]^ CNA demands that military operations planners and high-ranking government officials take into account the following questions of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. For example, does a cyber attack constitute an ‘armed attack’ under the United Nations Charter? Does there have to be physical damage to property or loss of life before a State can exercise the right of self-defence? What would be a proportionate response against such an attack? What are the evaluation criteria for targets that are dual-use targets used both by military and civil systems? Is the cyber attack a violation of criminal or international law? In what cases is there State responsibility for acts of individuals acting from its own territory? What could be the future perspectives for the regulation of CNA?\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a general assessment of the legal consequences of CNA according to jus ad bellum and jus in bello, mapping the problems encountered in both spheres of law upon the application of international law on CNA, and to suggest possible future perspectives for the regulation of CNA.\n## 2. Jus ad Bellum and CNA The foundation for the contemporary jus ad bellum, the law regarding the use of force, is the Charter of the United Nations.^[20]^ According to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, Erki Kodar “[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. Such a ban of the use of force is regarded as an imperative norm of international law, *jus cogens*, from which no deviation is allowed, and it is binding for all States in the world community.”²¹ For further analysis, it is important to know the two UN Charter exceptions from the ban of using force, namely, the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State (Article 51 of UN Charter) and use of force within the framework of a collective security system (Articles 39 and 42 of UN Charter).\n## 2.1. Applying the UN Charter to CNA – Can CNA Constitute Use of Force?\nThe first obstacle to the implementation of the regulation regarding the use of force is the following question: Could CNA be treated as an armed attack? Although Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does not elaborate on what could be interpreted as a threat or use of force, the *travaux préparatoires* of the Charter indicate that this must be an armed attack.²² More so, the Charter mentions that each State has the inherent right of an individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State. The competence of the Security Council in relation to acting upon CNA matters will raise fewer problems, as it is possible for the Security Council to treat CNA as a threat to peace or violation of peace (it is doubtful whether CNA can cross the threshold established for aggression), provided that there is political will between the Permanent Members.²³ CNA represents a challenge to the valid paradigm related to the use of force as its consequences cannot easily be classified as activities that threaten the values of the international community or as consequences that are of the severity equal to the use of physical force. The consequences can be spread over a broad spectrum from everyday IT disruption to widespread physical damages. In the former category would be for example the temporary paralysation of computer networks without any direct or indirect physical effects. The latter category could entail attacks against critical infrastructure systems with intent to cause physical damages to objects or even loss of life. Disruption of IT systems will most probably not equate to an armed attack as they would be more of nuisance if any anything else and can be dealt with in the domestic legal system with Computer Emergency Response Teams, judicial system and mutual assistance agreements, if applicable. In the case of physical damages and loss of life Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello the State has to evaluate whether the CNA caused the damages and are the damages analogous to an armed attack and would give right to resort to self-defence.\nA majority of acknowledged international law scholars are of the opinion that CNA can be regarded as an armed attack only if certain stringent criteria have been fulfilled, but mainly the consequences of the CNA must be equal to the consequences of a physical armed attack.[24] For example, economic and political measures of pressure will not constitute the violation of the ban to use force even though CNA is a very useful tool for disrupting commerce communications, etc. Thus, CNA will oscillate between measures adopted to apply political and economic pressure and the use of armed force. Incurrence of physical damage as a result of CNA is the pre-requisite to regard it as an armed attack. Unfortunately, this criterion cannot be treated as an absolute and it largely depends on the evaluation of the situation. The consequences of CNA should be assessed case-by-case to ascertain whether they are similar to the consequences of an armed attack or whether consequences stay below the level of threshold for use of force.\nThis categorisation is critical because upon it determines which type of countermeasures the defending State may choose in the given case. Professor M. Schmitt gives two explanatory examples: In the first case,\"computer network attacks disable a busy air traffic control system during horrendous weather. An airliner crashes and deaths result. No kinetic force has been used to destroy the airliner, but CNA was plainly the proximate cause of the tragedy.\"25 Causal relation between the CNA and the airplane crash is established. Opposite of this spectrum, CNA is used to attack\"a university computer network, designed to disrupt military related research occurring in campus laboratories\".26 This attack interferes with the conduct of research related to armed forces.\nLeaving aside the questions of attribution and State involvement in the attacks, Schmitt posits that the first case can be construed as use of force as it results in a loss of life, physical destruction and the consequences are comparable to the use of armed force.[27] Thus it would be lawful for the injured State to act in self-defence after such an incident even though no physical attack infringed its borders. In the second case, the consequences of CNA are less serious than in the first example and represent an assumed unlawful invasion into a computer network and the consequences of this 139</www.au.af.mil> Erki Kodar activity cannot be equal to the use of armed force, although scientific work related to the activities of armed forces has been disrupted.\nIf CNA can constitute use of armed force, the canonical restrictions established for the response to an armed attack in self-defence must be also applied thereto – that is, countermeasures taken to deal with a threat must be proportional and necessary to the threat. Another contentious issue is whether a State under a CNA attack can counter in self-defence with only CNA or with physical force. Law regarding use of force does not prescribe the measures to be adopted in self-defence as long as they are proportionate and necessary against the attack. Therefore it would be lawful for the injured State to resort to physical force if the aforementioned criteria are fulfilled.\nWithout concise legal regulation, it will be up to State practice to decide whether CNA will qualify as use of force or not. Such a case-based approach will not necessarily contribute to completely uniform practice but, if we are to look for a better consensus, the UN Security Council has the competence to qualify CNA as a threat to peace as provided by Article 39 of the UN Charter. The involvement of the Security Council would be beneficial for the Permanent Members or for larger countries that have sufficient clout to influence Permanent Members.\nThe involvement of the Security Council would be most probably of little use for non-members when the suspected or alleged acts of one of the Permanent Members are in question. In such cases the Security Council will most probably find itself in a veto deadlock. However, the Security Council could give more specific guidelines with regard to CNA incidents that fall into the 'grey area' of use of force or not. Then again this scenario could be counterproductive and against the self-interests of the Permanent Members because they are also potentially the most capable States for conducting such acts and gaining from such behaviour.\n## 2.2. Problems Related to Attribution of Responsibility in Case of CNA The above lack of legal distinction should not be interpreted as a situation where everything explicitly not forbidden is permissible if the use of CNA does not violate *jus cogens* norms, customary law or treaty law. Unlawful or indiscriminate uses of CNA can violate generally recognised principles of international law (for example, the principle of non-intervention in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of a State). The injured State may demand reparations for injuries from the responsible State according to the principles of State responsibility. Nevertheless, the matter of State responsibility is especially complicated in the case of CNA as its source can be concealed. The subject of attack may be acting on false impressions of the attack coming from another State that is not necessarily responsible for the attack (for example, the responsible State D may launch CNA against State A through unbeknownst State C and masking the origin of the attack as to convey the impression that CNA comes from State B).\nThe relative ease of use of CNA has the potential to make States complacent with regard to State responsibility. If CNA has been State orchestrated, carried out by the agents of State, then the attribution of State responsibility is not complicated.\nComputer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello Nowadays laptops have more computing power than a room full of supercomputers in the 1970s and private individuals and organisations have access to high-speed internet connections from which to conduct multiple CNAs of different severity unbeknownst to their State of residence. This can create situations where State A knowingly or unknowingly tolerates CNA activities against State B and the attacks cross the threshold of armed attack. In this case State B regards itself as being under attack and starts to defend itself against the actions coming from State A. Therefore State A may unwillingly violate international law. By the text of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts²⁸ the acts individuals of State A are attributable to it and the acts in question breach international obligation (prohibition of use of force, prohibition of non-intervention).²⁹ State B can prove the support of State A with either signal or human reconnaissance (for example, identifying that the attack is being launched from a computer network of a government agency) or from official pronouncements of government officials.\nIf an individual living in State A is violating the rights of State B from the territory of the same State, State B may require the punishment of that respective individual from State A or initiation of extradition proceedings. Under aggravating circumstances, State B may adopt self-defence measures against an attack coming from State A in the territory of State A, but only if State A does not wish or is unable to avoid the appropriate actions against State B. Professor Y. Dinstein has classified the attribution of responsibility related to CNA originating from State A and directed against State B into four categories:³⁰ The first category consists of cases where citizens of State A launch CNA on their own initiative and for reasons only known to them. Their activities cannot be attributed to the government of State A. In the given case, State A should exercise sufficient executive duress against the individuals concerned so that they would either end or avoid launching the attacks against State B from the territory of State A.³¹ The second category consists of cases when certain individuals or terrorists residing in State A launch CNA against State B for certain ideological, etc. reasons and the terrorists are not supported by State A. The obligations of State A are the same that were described under the first category.³² In the third category terrorists supported by the State A launch CNA against State B. If the actions can be attributed to terrorists supported by State A, the terrorists could be treated as de facto representatives of State A as provided by the principles of State responsibility, and State A will be held responsible to State B.³³ The support given to terrorists by State A needs to be proven in this case.³⁴ In the fourth category government organs of State A launch CNA against State B. This represents the most complicated category as the actions of representatives of a State within the CNA sphere may have a number of forms – like espionage (which cannot be construed as the use of force), interruption of communication systems with no harm to humans (not grave enough to exceed the threshold of use of force) and cyber attacks that result in harm done to persons. The latter is treated as CNA that oversteps the threshold established for the use of force, but all the cases described in this category can be ascribed to State A.³⁵ ‘Active defence’ is also possible as a counter-measure against CNA, meaning that a State under CNA attack will attack the computer system of another State being the source of the CNA, considering that it will be later forced to apologise, in public, for the ‘counterattack’ or pay compensation.\nAt the current moment, launching a cyber attack by a State against another State represents the exception and not the rule.³⁶ Most CNAs are perpetrated by individuals and non-State actors, but the attribution of such acts to them or the State harbouring them is complicated as evidence is hard to get or evidence can be misleading in the case of a sophisticated attack.\n## 2.3. Jus ad Bellum and CNA – Future Trends In the near future, jus ad bellum will still be subject to an understanding that the use of force or threat of force within cyberspace will remain a fact to be identified separately in each case. The majority of cyber attacks will not exceed the threshold of use of force, but the valid paradigm may be subject to change if clear-cut cases emerge. For example, some scholars are of the opinion that the USA may decide to respond with armed force if a cyber attack launched by another State destroys the informa Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello tion systems of the New York Stock Exchange or causes physical damages thereto.³⁷ While not being a military objective in the classical sense, the damages might be of the effect that they can be equated with the effects of use of force. The non liquet position, adopted by the Department of Defense of the USA in 1999, was the following: As in all cases when a nation considers acting in self-defense, the nation considering such action will have to make its best judgment on how world opinion, or perhaps a body such as the International Court of Justice or the United Nations Security Council, is likely to apply the doctrine of self-defence to electronic attacks. As with many novel legal issues, we are likely to discover the answer only from experience.³⁸ This decade old position would seem to be still valid prima facie as there have been no clarifying developments in international law in this regard. If we are dealing with a situation where State A is supporting the activities of criminals and therefore CNA is launched against State B, responding with CNA to CNA is probably acceptable and justified. If CNA exceeds the threshold for the use of force, the traditional kinetic self-defence capabilities may be employed. But at the moment there does not exist a defined yardstick – CNA with grave consequences can be treated as the use of force in the future, while consequences that do not meet the threshold will not be treated as use of force.\nIn the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), CNA with consequences equal to use of force might be in some extreme cases regarded as events that may trigger the collective self-defence provision of Article 5 in the North Atlantic Treaty, although this seems doubtful. NATO’s own rhetoric has been in this field cautious, if not in the negative.³⁹ This is due to the fact that current and previous attacks have not exceeded the threshold mentioned, and thus it is hard to predict the consequence of future CNA. Most probably the only article applicable in the NATO framework would be Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, in which case members will enter into consultations if the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the members is threatened. Only time and State practice will tell whether CNA 143</www.ibls.com></www.defenselink.mil></nids.hq.nato.int></www.au.af.mil> Erki Kodar can be realistically construed as use of force according to the UN Charter that would activate the self-defence provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty framework.\n## 3. Jus in Bello and CNA *Jus in bello* or international humanitarian law is a set of legal norms applicable in case of an armed conflict. When CNA is used in an armed conflict as a weapon then legal restrictions arising that regulate the use of weapons are applicable to CNA. These restrictions must be adhered to in self-defence operations when countering CNA with CNA or when responding to a physical attack with CNA. Also, in cases of use of CNA as an offensive weapon there is a need to understand the legal restrictions that regulate the selection of targets and the precautions in attack to be adopted.\n## 3.1. Legal Assumptions for the Implementation of Humanitarian Law in the Case of CNA In international humanitarian law, there is no explicit provision that deals with either CNA or IO or cyber war. Nevertheless, the Martens Clause, which is regarded as customary law,⁴⁰ states that “in cases not included in the [Hague] Regulations adopted by them, populations and belligerents remain under the protection and empire of the principles of international law, as they result from the usages established between civilised nations, from the laws of humanity and the requirements of the public conscience”.⁴¹ The modernised Martens Clause is contained in Article 1(2) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which states that “[i] n cases not covered by this Protocol or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of the principles of international law derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience”.⁴² The purpose of the Martens Clause is to affirm that the belligerents’ choice of methods or means of warfare is not unlimited and to eliminate any incidents in armed conflicts that are not covered by treaty regulation or customary law. Therefore, these principles reaffirm that even without explicit mention of CNA in modern treaties or customs, certain restrictions still apply.\nThe ICJ has reaffirmed that for weapons two customary law restrictions apply. Firstly, “[s]tates must never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military ⁴⁰ “The Court points to the Martens Clause, whose continuing existence and applicability is not to be doubted, as an affirmation that the principles and rules of humanitarian law apply to nuclear weapons”, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, 8 July 1996, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 87, <www.icj-cij.org 7495.pdf=\"\"95=\"\"docket=\"\"files=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n⁴¹ Preamble of the 1899 Hague Convention (II) and 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land.\n⁴² 1977 Additional Protocol 1, Article 1(2).</www.icj-cij.org> Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello targets\".43 Secondly,\"it is prohibited to cause unnecessary suffering to combatants; it is accordingly prohibited to use weapons causing them such harm or uselessly aggravating their suffering.... [S]tates do not have unlimited freedom of choice of means in the weapons they use.\"44 All of the above and the restrictions applicable to weapons must be taken into account if using CNA in an armed conflict.45 CNA must be capable of fulfilling the requirement set for weapons – that it can be used in an attack and aimed against specific targets. According to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its Additional Protocols of 1977, an attack is an act of violence,[46] which raises the question: Is CNA out-of-bounds for international humanitarian law because CNA is not a use of violence in the strictest sense of the word? The answer to this question is ‘no’ as for the purposes of humanitarian law an ‘attack’ shall represent a generic and a broad definition.[47] ‘Violence’ therefore in humanitarian law is defined through the consequence of physical (in case of objects and physical persons) or mental (in case of physical persons only) damage. CNA does most probably bring the described consequences, and therefore the use of CNA should be treated as an attack.\nStates also have an obligation when adopting a new weapon to conduct an assessment process to determine whether the use of such new weapon would under some or all conditions be prohibited or restricted under the standards of humanitarian or some other category of international law.[48] Unfortunately States have no obligation to publicise these findings, and thus the majority of these analyses are off the record and not available to the general public.\nThe discussion below is based on an assumption that there is an established armed conflict governed by the norms and principles prescribed in international humanitarian law. International humanitarian law will only apply to CNA if CNA's consequences are not just sporadic and isolated cases and are aimed to cause injuries, death, damages and destruction and where such consequences are predictable or desired. Humanitarian law is not applicable to CNA if these consequences do not include the causing of injuries, death, damages and destruction during an armed conflict (for example, the failure of a university intranet, downloading of financial information, temporary closing of access to internet or being involved in cyber espionage).\n\nErki Kodar ## 3.2. CNA and Legitimate Targets If CNA constitutes an attack or the use of violence in an armed conflict, the next question arises: What can be attacked with the weapon and what are the legitimate targets? For analytical purposes M. Schmitt divides targets into four categories: combatants and military targets; civilians, who directly participate in hostilities; objects used by both military and civilians; specifically protected objects.^[49]^ Combatants and military targets are legitimate targets^[50]^ and can be targeted as long as the means and methods of attack comply with the restrictions established by humanitarian law.^[51]^ Therefore, aiming a CNA against combatants is permissible (for example, falsifying military air traffic control system navigational information that results in a military transport crash).^[52]^ When attacking military targets, the attack against a target must considerably contribute to military action and provide for a definite military advantage.^[53]^ Attack against the enemy's command and control networks, etc. does not create difficulties. However, which principles should be adopted in case of contestable targets: Can CNA be aimed against a banking system as the sustainability of armed forces depends on wealth? If a State is disproportionately dependent upon a specific industry (for example, oil), can CNA be used to stop production and distribution?^[54]^ Is it important that the attack is accompanied by physical destruction, not just inconvenience? If the purpose is only to cause inconvenience, this does not exceed the threshold of a military attack.\nCivilians represent individuals who are not considered combatants and civilian targets are targets that are not military targets. Therefore the armed forces have an obligation to direct their attacks against military objectives.^[55]^ Notwithstanding legitimate collateral damage, the ban on attacking civilians and civilian targets is practically absolute. Civilians lose their immunity when participating directly in hostilities by causing damages to the members or supplies of the enemy's armed forces.^[56]^ The use of civilians to launch CNA, as sub-contractors or civil servants, is full of legal problems and issues.^[57]^ The main problem with CNA is that it encompasses activities ^[49]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, pp. 379–387.\n^[50]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52 notes that civilian objects shall not be the object of attack and that attacks shall be limited to military objectives.\n^[51]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(i) demands that the attackers must do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are not civilian objects, but military objectives.\n^[52]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 380.\n^[53]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3).\n^[54]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 381.

If civilians are directly involved in conducting CNA resulting in physical damages, such persons may be treated as unlawful combatants as they are participating directly in hostilities. Thus the IT-support personnel who are contributing to a CNA operation are at the risk of being considered targets. Civilians employed for the purpose of CNA represent a challenge for humanitarian law as they would not fit under the category of lawful combatants. When it is impossible to restrict the participation of civilians in military activities, this may endanger the civilian population as the enemy cannot make a clear distinction between combatants and civilians. Considering the skill-sets required for CNA it is more than reasonable to assume civilian involvement in such attacks, but the correct course of action should be that the members of armed forces conduct CNA.\nDual-use targets have both military and civil purposes (airports, railways, electrical systems, communication systems, factories producing material for both the civilian population and armed forces, etc.).58 If an object is being used for military purposes, it will be construed as a military target that can be attacked with all the permissible methods, including CNA. The aforementioned is also valid in a situation where the military objectives of a target are only secondary to the civilian objectives.\nHumanitarian law grants special protection to certain objects like dykes, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.59 Objects under special protection are defined as hazardous facilities as attacking them may launch dangerous forces and cause serious losses among the civilian population. As a general rule, such targets should not be attacked if the emission of dangerous forces cannot be controlled, but in the case of CNA it would be possible to neutralise these targets without launching any dangerous forces (which is an advantage, compared to kinetic weapons).60 # 3.3. CNA's Compatibility with General Principles of Humanitarian Law Once it has been determined that a target is lawful, the concordance of attack with general principles (and norms regarding targeting) of humanitarian law should be assessed before the attack is launched. These principles are the principle of distinction, prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, principle of proportionality and the prohibition of perfidy.\nHostilities under International Humanitarian Law, <www.icrc.org eng=\"\"direct%20participation-hostilities-ihl-311205=\"\"siteeng0.nsf=\"\"siteeng0.nsf/=\"\"/=\"\"/participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\"/participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009; K.

While CNA can be used in compliance with the principle of distinction, it can also be, like conventional weapons, used indiscriminately. No matter how attractive the idea of launching one extensive CNA campaign against the infrastructures of the State as a whole would be, including attacks against the civil sector, all CNA attacks must be aimed against military targets. The principle entails an obligation to minimise collateral damage and to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be disproportionate to the value of the military objective to be attacked.\nThe principle of distinction is closely knitted with the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks. Indiscriminate attack stands for attacks that are not aimed against a specific military objective, employing the methods and means of warfare, which cannot be aimed against a military target or employing the methods and means of warfare the consequence of which cannot be restricted.⁶² With CNA, the main threat is posed by the fact that it can be used for launching indiscriminate attacks, either deliberately or inadvertently. If malicious code CNA is employed that is uncontrollable and spreading through civilian systems, then such CNA is prohibited as an indiscriminate weapon.⁶³ Taking into account that civilian and military networks are closely intertwined, the launched CNA must be of such sophistication that it conforms to the prohibition.\nThe principle of proportionality demands that conflicting interests must be weighed against each other – sufferings and damages versus military advantage.⁶⁴ If military advantage outweighs incidental loss of life or damages to civilians or civilian objects, the attack is construed to be in compliance with the principle of proportionality (although the principle seems to be rather simple, its implementation in practice is extremely complicated). The majority of the problems of CNA in this equation are caused by knock-on effects that are “not directly and immediately caused by the attack, but nevertheless the product thereof – it is the problem of the effects caused by the effects of an attack”.⁶⁵ As CNA may result in consequences which are initially unpredictable, one must always assess when planning an attack whether CNA would be accompanied by endangering the civil population or not. As the CNA attacks are complicated and may, with great probability, affect civilian systems, one must assess the causal damages and possible consequences during the planning stage of any operation prior to launching an attack and seek ways to mitigate these effects. Then again, CNA as a method may help to diminish collateral damage as it allows, instead of physical destruction, to ‘switch off’ the target (for example, instead of bombing an Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello airport it is possible to disturb the operation of flight control systems).⁶⁶ CNA allows the attacker to directly control the consequences and minimise the risk to civilian population when the attained military advantage has been achieved.\nPerfidy is the feigning of protected status with the intent to kill, injure or capture an adversary.⁶⁷ The prohibition of perfidy does not mean that ruses of war cannot be used.⁶⁸ For the purposes of CNA, a ruse would be communication of incorrect information on location and manoeuvres, forging the information in the enemy’s reconnaissance database, etc.⁶⁹ Perfidy would be pretending to have a protected status, and for the purposes of CNA this would be deceptive use of codes and signals given to medical transport by the International Civil Aviation Organization.⁷⁰ While the humanitarian law in force is, in general, sufficient to protect individuals and objects from CNA, some uncertainties still exist. Even though it was impossible to predict the occurrence of CNA upon the emergence of current humanitarian law, some general standards are, nevertheless, applicable to CNA. At the same time CNA is characterised by specifics that also represent challenges and problems for the purposes of *jus in bello*: When does one consider CNA as an ‘attack’ in *jus in bello* and when only as a nuisance? But CNA is also a positive tool that allows for achieving military objectives without the causal damages that may result from kinetic attacks. It should also be remembered that CNA is a weapon, and any unlawful use may bring about incrimination for the commitment of war crimes.\n## 4. Possible Future Scenarios for the Regulation of CNA In all probability a new defined structure of international law will not be introduced in the nearest future that would encapsulate all the cases of use of force with regard to cyberspace and the assessment of CNA *vis-à-vis* the right of self-defence. The issue is at the mercy of practical experiences of different States as there seems to be unwillingness to enter into international or regional agreements in this sphere. The *status quo* is useful for States with better CNA capabilities to maintain freedom of action. But there might be will to move towards some foreseeable developments.⁷¹ In 1998 Russia attempted to initiate a United Nations General Assembly resolution dealing with the banning of some highly dangerous information operations.⁷² 149</www.icrc.org> Erki Kodar Unfortunately Russia has not volunteered to continue with this initiative over the last couple of years. The Naval War College in Newport, USA organised a CNA-conference in 1999, where the participants agreed that it would be useful and sensible to intensify international co-operation in the sphere of computer crime and cyber terrorism, but the time has not yet come for introducing a comprehensive regulation or banning in general.73 More extensive co-operation in the sphere of legal assistance was justified with the pretence for the criminalisation of actions threatening the international community to bring the criminals to justice and to simplify the extradition procedure.74 If legal assistance agreements are to serve as an effective instrument to fight cybercrime, it is necessary for them to have an explicit scope including either cybercrime or all crimes in general. If countries have not entered into extradition agreements, this means that such countries have neither a duty nor the domestic legal basis to extradite a person to another State.75 It would also be difficult to sustain the argument that the principle of *aut dedere aut judicare* is customary law with relation to CNA.76 An alternative to extradition would be to administer justice to a person who has committed CNA against another State in the CNA's State of origin.77 Doc.

Estonia's Role in the Development of CNA-related Agreements or Standards?\nProfessor D. Hollis, who studied the cyber attacks against Estonia, suggests the creation of the right of hot pursuit available to a State which is the object of a cyber attack as\"nations could agree to waive sovereignty concerns and permit a direct response in certain cases, such as cyber attacks by terrorists that all nations might want thwarted\".[78] The thought would suggest that it would be appropriate to allow the attacked State to use counter measures to defend itself from an attack with extraterritorial measures even if such countermeasures would violate the sovereignty of the State being the origin of the attacks. Let us assume that hackers from Russia were behind the attacks against Estonia, and they had no connections with either the government or the armed forces. According to the current procedure, Estonia should ask Russia to maintain law and order in its territory as a kinetic counterattack would represent violation of Russia's sovereignty. According to proposed new standards of international law the States could leave aside all the worries related to their sovereignty and allow, in certain cases (as a community value all States should be interested in preventing the activities of cyber terrorists), the implementation of direct countermeasures by a State under attack.[79] While this sounds sensible, the development of an appropriate regulation is highly doubtful as States do not wish to open a Pandora's Box on the use of force, and the described scenario would leave numerous opportunities for serious misconduct and abuse.\nHollis also opines that Estonia wanted to construe cyber attack against the State as military activity (a new paradigm) and not as an act subject to penal power (the former paradigm). It can be assumed that in the future cyberspace will become the battlefield where military power is used, humanitarian law is applied and valid penal power framework may be imposed for combined effect.[80] In a military sense, cyberspace can be treated as an asymmetric field even now as States are not necessarily combating each other; it is rather the case of non-State actors positioning themselves against a State (or joining in with the State).\nThe establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia may represent a progressive step for the purposes of international law. The birth and activities of the centre may provide beneficial practical experiences and legal evidence. In addition, CNA can be regulated under national law, which could Erki Kodar also provide the grounds for the birth of internationally acknowledged standards in the future.\n## 4.2. Possible Developments of International Law in the Sphere of CNA A way ahead could be the conclusion of a multilateral agreement, involving specific and accurate standards applicable to CNA. In the given situation, the conclusion of a framework treaty that prescribes main and essential principles and gives States more freedom for the interpretation of specific aspects is more likely. Regionally, the conclusion of either bilateral or regional agreements (Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime represents a step in this direction) may be possible – provided that there is political will.\nOne way forward would be to draft new counterterrorism measures and agreements dealing with cybercrime and cyber terrorism. Measures preventing cybercrime have been taken both at the regional and global level to supplement national criminal law and international co-operation in the sphere of investigating and prosecuting such crimes. The main problem here is the difference of national law of different States or conflict of legal systems. Also, constitutional restrictions to extradition must be considered here.⁸¹ The format of an agreement for the prevention of cybercrime would be similar to the other agreements related to fighting terrorism wherein a certain type of behaviour shall qualify as terrorist activity and will be subject to a certain procedure between the member States. The aforementioned would provide a universal jurisdictional basis, or quasi-universal jurisdictional bases, for certain types of crime. At the moment, cyber terrorism is not taken seriously enough to be a subject for such agreements, and CNA must breach a high threshold to be considered as an issue worthy of international agreements.⁸² While the events that took place in Estonia in 2007 did not exceed this threshold, they can most certainly be interpreted as something more serious than common vandalism; therefore Estonia could have the opportunity to initiate the procedure for the conclusion of an agreement on the prevention of cyber terrorism. The main problem here is the fact that it is difficult to agree on which activities should be construed as cybercrime and ascertain where the line between common crime and terrorism should be drawn.\nAnother category of potential agreements could restrict the sovereign freedom of States – declarative agreements on lawful principles, armament control agreements and humanitarian law agreements. A declarative agreement would involve the most general principles that States would be willing to observe for the purposes of implementing international law (for example, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, stating that outer space is intended for common peaceful use by mankind). The pre-requisite for ⁸¹ Russia invoked a ‘constitutional ban’ recently in the Litvinenko case and refused to extradite the prime suspect, Andrei Lugovoi.

The crux of the matter is the abrupt and powerful development of information technology as it would be impossible to predict future situations with the required level of accuracy upon the conclusion of such agreements, and consequently States may be hesitant to sign a carte blanche treaty. With armament control agreements States could commit themselves not to develop, acquire or transfer certain CNA capabilities or not to use their capabilities in a way that would be destabilising for the armament control regime or crisis management systems of another State. The pre-requisites and problems encountered when discussing this type of agreements are the same as with declarative agreements. Also, States will not always have a monopoly in CNA capabilities, considering the interests and capacities of hackers and cyber terrorists themselves. Humanitarian law agreements usually restrict the use of certain types of weapons in the case of an armed conflict. The restrictions are justified by stating that the weapon may cause unnecessary suffering. Information technology weapons, adopted in cyber war, may not necessarily fit the criteria on the grounds equivalent to conventional weapons. As general humanitarian law principles and standards can be applied to CNA, the efficiency of such agreements is doubtful. Special standards applicable to CNA would be more useful than agreements attempting to restrict the utilisation thereof.⁸³ The conclusion of multilateral conventions, restricting the liberty of freedom of States, is not considered as realistic in the near future, as only very few countries, if any, have an understanding of the capacities and vulnerabilities related to cyber war, sufficient to promote the long-term national interests of such States.⁸⁴ Bilateral agreements or agreements with a limited number of parties are most useful in a situation where a certain number of governments are directly involved with a concrete and common problem. This type of agreement represents a useful form of co-operation within regional scope. G8, the Council of Europe and the Organization of American States have used this to enter into regional conventions on cybercrime (and the NATO process is, potentially through cyber defence policy, moving in this direction). There still will be potential risks related to cases exceeding the limits of regional agreements or where the organisations are dominated by some of the member States, thus turning the convention into a dead letter agreement.⁸⁵ On an organisational plane the United Nations General Assembly has often shown initiative for the adoption of resolutions that request or invite the member States to pursue certain principles in their activities. While resolutions are not strictly ⁸³ Ibid., pp. 446–450; D. Hollis, ‘New Tools, New Rules: International Law and Information Operations’, *Temple University Legal Studies Research Paper* No. 2007-15, <ssrn.com abstract=\"1009224\">, visited 28 March 2009, pp. 16–17.\n⁸⁴ G.

Unfortunately, at the moment, the General Assembly seems to be lacking the initiative. Considering the novelty of legal problems related to CNA, the adoption of resolutions on cyber war is probably not realistic over the next decade.⁸⁶ One alternative is represented by codification of customary law as a ‘manual’, as was done with the law of naval warfare by the International Institute of Humanitarian Law, or to enthuse progress by way of custom, codes of conduct or rules of engagement where codification would be based on experience.⁸⁷ Unfortunately, the summoning of the experts of the given sphere is highly unlikely for the lack of customary law to be codified for the purposes of cyber war. Adoption of best-practices guidelines seems to be realistic.⁸⁸ The current mindset of States seems to be more domestic than international as States have identified that CNA prevention and control is closely connected with regular home and private users. Estonia adopted in 2008 the Cyber Security Strategy,⁸⁹ and President Obama’s administration is conducting at the moment a 60-day cyber security review to ascertain how to apply cyber security policy.⁹⁰ The Center of Strategic and International Studies Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency released a report on the same issues 8 December 2008.⁹¹ The aim of both documents is to raise the awareness of private computer users and the private sector to take responsibility for their computers and secure them against unwanted uses. Some authors argue that there exists a civic duty to secure private machines against becoming a part of botnet.⁹² Responsible civil conduct would minimise the risk of exploitation for the users but also for the State concerned as it enables the State to exercise diligence on its own territory and control, to a certain extent, that its sovereign territory is not used for conducting CNAs against other states. Thus States are trying to get their houses in order before moving towards international measures.\nIn general, future perspectives for the regulation of CNA are stuck behind several obstacles. Firstly, legislative problems related to CNA are not fully understood, mainly because of technological unpredictability. Secondly, traditional armament control agreements and humanitarian law conventions cannot be adapted for CNA ⁸⁶ Ibid., p. 452.\n⁸⁷ J.

Thirdly, States have no explicit picture of the form of an international law regime that would promote their national interests in the best possible way in a long-term perspective with regard to CNA.\n# 5. Conclusion CNA is a challenge for international law because at the moment the law applies by way of analogy and interpretation in *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*. There are no express norms or customs that would regulate the uncertainty of CNA. The current framework of international law tries to fit the odd-shaped peg of CNA into a predetermined context, but this is not a satisfactory long-term solution. But some applicable rules and principles are better than no rules, better than a legal vacuum that would leave CNA out of legal reality. States and individuals with CNA capabilities will use the ambiguity to their advantage, but this will also bring State practice and more clarity to law, albeit through actions and consequences that may be harmful and unforeseen.\nWhen Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed that the life of law has not been of logic but of experience, he meant both the aforementioned and the possible future. The law is always behind the present, either by a step or two. Due to its flexible norm-creating procedure, international law only has to encounter a number of CNA incidents that will change the paradigm and give the required incentive to create legal regulation concerning the use of information weapons. Until then States need to cope with the existing law. Where it regards the use of CNA as use of force we can paraphrase Justice Stewart that we will know it when we see it or, in other words, law will recognise certain forms of CNA as the use of force only after it has been factually established that it has been the use of force.\nWhile the more capable States have adopted either ambivalent or even an attitude of ignorance with regard to the regulation of CNA over the last decade, some forms of co-operation may still be realistic, as demonstrated by the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. Estonia's contribution to NATO's cyber defence policy and the establishment of the Centre of Excellence may lead NATO towards another agreement, which may expand the member States' understanding of cyber law and cyber war and influence other States.\n155"

The relocation of the Bronze Soldier monument from Tallinn city centre resulted in two nights of rioting and looting in Tallinn and besieging of the Estonian embassy in Moscow.

These cyber attacks, or computer network attacks (CNA), crippled the web pages and computer systems of ministries, banks, broadcasters, newspapers and emergency services with the possible aim of reducing the media coverage and dissemination of public information regarding the consequences of the relocation of the Bronze Soldier.² Some Estonian officials accused that the attacks were orchestrated or tolerated by the administration of the Russian Federation.³ The latter denied strongly any involvement in such acts and no definite attribution has been made in this case.⁴\nThe cyber attack on Estonia’s critical IT-systems was not unprecedented, but the combination of crude (ping floods, defacement) and sophisticated (DDoS, use of botnets) measures used in the attack delineated a new standard in cyber attacks against a State.⁵ Both qualitatively and quantitatively the attacks perpetrated were the largest of any known cyber attacks that have taken place in the world recently.\nEstonia’s case might be the best example to demonstrate that globalisation is in the modern world accompanied by an increased number of attacks against computer networks, and that the attacks may be launched by States, representatives of States, terrorists, criminals and/or cyber hooligans. Thus CNA is an asymmetric weapon ideal for use by powerful States that harness the required capability but also by clever individuals with harmful intents.\nConsidering the powerful technical advancements that have been made by information technology over the last three or four decades, it would be logical to assume\n2 NATO has produced a short documentary on the attacks called ‘Six Colours: War In Cyberspace’, <www.nato.int ebookshop=\"\" eix_colours=\"\" six_colours.html=\"\" video=\"\">, visited 30 March 2009.\n3 Daily Telegraph, ‘Russia Accused over Estonian “Cyber-Terrorism”’, 18 May 2007, <www.telegraph.co.uk 1551850=\"\" news=\"\" Russia-accused-over-Estonian-cyber-terrorism.html=\"\" worldnews=\"\" worldnews,=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009; Times Online, ‘Estonia Accuses Russia of “Waging Cyber War”’, 17 May 2007, <www.timesonline.co.uk 28=\"\" article1802959.ece=\"\" europe=\"\" et=\"\" tol=\"\" www.world=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009.\n4 The Guardian, ‘Russia Accused of Unleashing Cyberwar to Disable Estonia’, 17 May 2007, <www.guardian.co.uk 17=\"\" 2007=\"\" may=\"\" topstories3.russia=\"\" world=\"\" way=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009; RIA Novosti, ‘Estonia Has No Evidence of Kremlin Involvement in Cyber Attacks’, 6 September 2007, <en.rian.ru 20070906=\"\" 76959190.html=\"\" world=\"\">, visited 28 March 2009.\n5 In 2005 the US Defence Department reported that Chinese web sites had been heavily used to target its computer networks.

This assumption is wrong. When discussing cyber attacks in terms of public international law and humanitarian law, we are faced with a relatively new phenomenon, which does not fit into any global legal framework regulating IT activities. There has been progress on a regional level – the Council of Europe has adopted the Convention on Cybercrime and the United States of America is keen to regulate cybercrime issues in legal assistance agreements. $^{6}$  Nevertheless, these advancements are mostly confined to the realm of domestic criminal law and do not address the issues of international law. At the current time it would appear that the lack of sufficient State practice and opinio juris has not allowed international customary law to develop that would concisely deal with cyber attacks.\nThere are several reasons for the lack of a comprehensive legal regulation – various development levels of countries (third world versus developed countries); predictable benefits accompanying the absence of specific frameworks (maintenance of sovereign freedom of action); and the understanding that cyber attacks represent a new legal phenomenon. There does not exist a notable selection of legal materials that would analyse the issue. I. Detter concurs that “[t]he problem has not been approached in any systematic way although numerous institutions and governments have expressed concern about the problem. ... However, there has been little, if any, academic comment.”7 Research publications or books have dealt with problem briefly or not with sufficient in-depth analysis.8 The US Naval War College’s so-called “Blue Book”9 and the 1999 US Department of Defense study remain the foundational materials in this field.10 Despite the ambiguity of the legal situation, more than 30 different countries worldwide, including USA, China, India and Russia, have publicly admitted\n6 The 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n7 I.

Conclusion\n\nCNA is a challenge for international law because at the moment the law applies by way of analogy and interpretation in *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*. There are no express norms or customs that would regulate the uncertainty of CNA. The current framework of international law tries to fit the odd-shaped peg of CNA into a predetermined context, but this is not a satisfactory long-term solution. But some applicable rules and principles are better than no rules, better than a legal vacuum that would leave CNA out of legal reality. States and individuals with CNA capabilities will use the ambiguity to their advantage, but this will also bring State practice and more clarity to law, albeit through actions and consequences that may be harmful and unforeseen.\nWhen Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed that the life of law has not been of logic but of experience, he meant both the aforementioned and the possible future. The law is always behind the present, either by a step or two. Due to its flexible norm-creating procedure, international law only has to encounter a number of CNA incidents that will change the paradigm and give the required incentive to create legal regulation concerning the use of information weapons. Until then States need to cope with the existing law. Where it regards the use of CNA as use of force we can paraphrase Justice Stewart that we will know it when we see it or, in other words, law will recognise certain forms of CNA as the use of force only after it has been factually established that it has been the use of force.\nWhile the more capable States have adopted either ambivalent or even an attitude of ignorance with regard to the regulation of CNA over the last decade, some forms of co-operation may still be realistic, as demonstrated by the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. Estonia's contribution to NATO's cyber defence policy and the establishment of the Centre of Excellence may lead NATO towards another agreement, which may expand the member States' understanding of cyber law and cyber war and influence other States.\n155",

These cyber attacks, or computer network attacks (CNA), crippled the web pages and computer systems of ministries, banks, broadcasters, newspapers and emergency services with the possible aim of reducing the media coverage and dissemination of public information regarding the consequences of the relocation of the Bronze Soldier.² Some Estonian officials accused that the attacks were orchestrated or tolerated by the administration of the Russian Federation.³ The latter denied strongly any involvement in such acts and no definite attribution has been made in this case.⁴\n\nThe cyber attack on Estonia’s critical IT-systems was not unprecedented, but the combination of crude (ping floods, defacement) and sophisticated (DDoS, use of botnets) measures used in the attack delineated a new standard in cyber attacks against a State.⁵ Both qualitatively and quantitatively the attacks perpetrated were the largest of any known cyber attacks that have taken place in the world recently.\n\nEstonia’s case might be the best example to demonstrate that globalisation is in the modern world accompanied by an increased number of attacks against computer networks, and that the attacks may be launched by States, representatives of States, terrorists, criminals and/or cyber hooligans.

    "Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\n\nthat a uniform and existing legal regulation has been imposed on both cyber attacks and IT-crime. This assumption is wrong. When discussing cyber attacks in terms of public international law and humanitarian law, we are faced with a relatively new phenomenon, which does not fit into any global legal framework regulating IT activities. There has been progress on a regional level – the Council of Europe has adopted the Convention on Cybercrime and the United States of America is keen to regulate cybercrime issues in legal assistance agreements. $^{6}$  Nevertheless, these advancements are mostly confined to the realm of domestic criminal law and do not address the issues of international law. At the current time it would appear that the lack of sufficient State practice and opinio juris has not allowed international customary law to develop that would concisely deal with cyber attacks.\n\nThere are several reasons for the lack of a comprehensive legal regulation – various development levels of countries (third world versus developed countries); predictable benefits accompanying the absence of specific frameworks (maintenance of sovereign freedom of action); and the understanding that cyber attacks represent a new legal phenomenon. There does not exist a notable selection of legal materials that would analyse the issue. I. Detter concurs that “[t]he problem has not been approached in any systematic way although numerous institutions and governments have expressed concern about the problem. ... However, there has been little, if any, academic comment.”7 Research publications or books have dealt with problem briefly or not with sufficient in-depth analysis.8 The US Naval War College’s so-called “Blue Book”9 and the 1999 US Department of Defense study remain the foundational materials in this field.10 Despite the ambiguity of the legal situation, more than 30 different countries worldwide, including USA, China, India and Russia, have publicly admitted\n\n6 The 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n7 I.

Jus ad Bellum and CNA\n\nThe foundation for the contemporary jus ad bellum, the law regarding the use of force, is the Charter of the United Nations.^[20]^ According to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter,\n\n17 Ibid.\n\n18 Ibid.\n\n19 By conducting a CNA with a ‘botnet’, the attacking computers may reside in different jurisdictions and the data stream may cross State borders by way of masking the initial source of the attack. Therefore the target may have to counter attacks that come from different jurisdictions and may have a concise centre of origin, but tracking the origin can be difficult, if not impossible.\n\n20 Hereinafter also ‘UN Charter’.",
    "Erki Kodar\n\n“[a]ll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations”. Such a ban of the use of force is regarded as an imperative norm of international law, *jus cogens*, from which no deviation is allowed, and it is binding for all States in the world community.”²¹\n\nFor further analysis, it is important to know the two UN Charter exceptions from the ban of using force, namely, the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State (Article 51 of UN Charter) and use of force within the framework of a collective security system (Articles 39 and 42 of UN Charter).\n\n## 2.1. Applying the UN Charter to CNA – Can CNA Constitute Use of Force?\n\nThe first obstacle to the implementation of the regulation regarding the use of force is the following question: Could CNA be treated as an armed attack? Although Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does not elaborate on what could be interpreted as a threat or use of force, the *travaux préparatoires* of the Charter indicate that this must be an armed attack.²² More so, the Charter mentions that each State has the inherent right of an individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a State. The competence of the Security Council in relation to acting upon CNA matters will raise fewer problems, as it is possible for the Security Council to treat CNA as a threat to peace or violation of peace (it is doubtful whether CNA can cross the threshold established for aggression), provided that there is political will between the Permanent Members.²³\n\nCNA represents a challenge to the valid paradigm related to the use of force as its consequences cannot easily be classified as activities that threaten the values of the international community or as consequences that are of the severity equal to the use of physical force. The consequences can be spread over a broad spectrum from everyday IT disruption to widespread physical damages. In the former category would be for example the temporary paralysation of computer networks without any direct or indirect physical effects. The latter category could entail attacks against critical infrastructure systems with intent to cause physical damages to objects or even loss of life. Disruption of IT systems will most probably not equate to an armed attack as they would be more of nuisance if any anything else and can be dealt with in the domestic legal system with Computer Emergency Response Teams, judicial system and mutual assistance agreements, if applicable. In the case of physical damages and loss of life\n\n21 M. Shaw, *International Law*, 5th ed. (Cambridge University Press, 2006) p. 1018.\n\n22 On the interpretation of the term ‘armed attack’ in light of CNA, see M. Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’, 37 *Columbia Journal of Transnational Law* (1999) pp. 900–908. On the issue what constitutes a ‘force’, see Shaw, *supra* note 21, pp. 1019–1021.\n\n23 Schmitt, *supra* note 22, pp. 924–927.",
    "Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\n\nthe State has to evaluate whether the CNA caused the damages and are the damages analogous to an armed attack and would give right to resort to self-defence.\n\nA majority of acknowledged international law scholars are of the opinion that CNA can be regarded as an armed attack only if certain stringent criteria have been fulfilled, but mainly the consequences of the CNA must be equal to the consequences of a physical armed attack.[24] For example, economic and political measures of pressure will not constitute the violation of the ban to use force even though CNA is a very useful tool for disrupting commerce communications, etc. Thus, CNA will oscillate between measures adopted to apply political and economic pressure and the use of armed force. Incurrence of physical damage as a result of CNA is the pre-requisite to regard it as an armed attack. Unfortunately, this criterion cannot be treated as an absolute and it largely depends on the evaluation of the situation. The consequences of CNA should be assessed case-by-case to ascertain whether they are similar to the consequences of an armed attack or whether consequences stay below the level of threshold for use of force.\n\nThis categorisation is critical because upon it determines which type of countermeasures the defending State may choose in the given case. Professor M. Schmitt gives two explanatory examples: In the first case, \"computer network attacks disable a busy air traffic control system during horrendous weather. An airliner crashes and deaths result. No kinetic force has been used to destroy the airliner, but CNA was plainly the proximate cause of the tragedy.\"25 Causal relation between the CNA and the airplane crash is established. Opposite of this spectrum, CNA is used to attack \"a university computer network, designed to disrupt military related research occurring in campus laboratories\".26 This attack interferes with the conduct of research related to armed forces.\n\nLeaving aside the questions of attribution and State involvement in the attacks, Schmitt posits that the first case can be construed as use of force as it results in a loss of life, physical destruction and the consequences are comparable to the use of armed force.[27] Thus it would be lawful for the injured State to act in self-defence after such an incident even though no physical attack infringed its borders. In the second case, the consequences of CNA are less serious than in the first example and represent an assumed unlawful invasion into a computer network and the consequences of this\n\n24 D. Silver, ‘Computer Network Attack as a Use of Force under Article 2(4)’, 76 International Law Studies (2002) pp. 84–92; Y. Dinstein, ‘Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defense’, 76 International Law Studies (2002) pp. 102–105; Schmitt, supra note 22, pp. 914–915; An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations, Department of Defense, Office of General Counsel, <www.au.af.mil au=\"\" awc=\"\" doc-io-legal=\"\" dwc=\"\" www.au.af.mil=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009, pp. 18–25.\n\n25 Schmitt, supra note 22, p. 916.\n\n26 Ibid.\n\n27 Ibid.\n\n139</www.au.af.mil>",
    "Erki Kodar\n\nactivity cannot be equal to the use of armed force, although scientific work related to the activities of armed forces has been disrupted.\n\nIf CNA can constitute use of armed force, the canonical restrictions established for the response to an armed attack in self-defence must be also applied thereto – that is, countermeasures taken to deal with a threat must be proportional and necessary to the threat. Another contentious issue is whether a State under a CNA attack can counter in self-defence with only CNA or with physical force. Law regarding use of force does not prescribe the measures to be adopted in self-defence as long as they are proportionate and necessary against the attack. Therefore it would be lawful for the injured State to resort to physical force if the aforementioned criteria are fulfilled.\n\nWithout concise legal regulation, it will be up to State practice to decide whether CNA will qualify as use of force or not. Such a case-based approach will not necessarily contribute to completely uniform practice but, if we are to look for a better consensus, the UN Security Council has the competence to qualify CNA as a threat to peace as provided by Article 39 of the UN Charter. The involvement of the Security Council would be beneficial for the Permanent Members or for larger countries that have sufficient clout to influence Permanent Members.\n\nThe involvement of the Security Council would be most probably of little use for non-members when the suspected or alleged acts of one of the Permanent Members are in question. In such cases the Security Council will most probably find itself in a veto deadlock. However, the Security Council could give more specific guidelines with regard to CNA incidents that fall into the 'grey area' of use of force or not. Then again this scenario could be counterproductive and against the self-interests of the Permanent Members because they are also potentially the most capable States for conducting such acts and gaining from such behaviour.\n\n## 2.2. Problems Related to Attribution of Responsibility in Case of CNA\n\nThe above lack of legal distinction should not be interpreted as a situation where everything explicitly not forbidden is permissible if the use of CNA does not violate *jus cogens* norms, customary law or treaty law. Unlawful or indiscriminate uses of CNA can violate generally recognised principles of international law (for example, the principle of non-intervention in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of a State). The injured State may demand reparations for injuries from the responsible State according to the principles of State responsibility. Nevertheless, the matter of State responsibility is especially complicated in the case of CNA as its source can be concealed. The subject of attack may be acting on false impressions of the attack coming from another State that is not necessarily responsible for the attack (for example, the responsible State D may launch CNA against State A through unbeknownst State C and masking the origin of the attack as to convey the impression that CNA comes from State B).\n\nThe relative ease of use of CNA has the potential to make States complacent with regard to State responsibility. If CNA has been State orchestrated, carried out by the agents of State, then the attribution of State responsibility is not complicated.",
    "Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\n\nNowadays laptops have more computing power than a room full of supercomputers in the 1970s and private individuals and organisations have access to high-speed internet connections from which to conduct multiple CNAs of different severity unbeknownst to their State of residence. This can create situations where State A knowingly or unknowingly tolerates CNA activities against State B and the attacks cross the threshold of armed attack. In this case State B regards itself as being under attack and starts to defend itself against the actions coming from State A. Therefore State A may unwillingly violate international law. By the text of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts²⁸ the acts individuals of State A are attributable to it and the acts in question breach international obligation (prohibition of use of force, prohibition of non-intervention).²⁹ State B can prove the support of State A with either signal or human reconnaissance (for example, identifying that the attack is being launched from a computer network of a government agency) or from official pronouncements of government officials.\n\nIf an individual living in State A is violating the rights of State B from the territory of the same State, State B may require the punishment of that respective individual from State A or initiation of extradition proceedings. Under aggravating circumstances, State B may adopt self-defence measures against an attack coming from State A in the territory of State A, but only if State A does not wish or is unable to avoid the appropriate actions against State B. Professor Y. Dinstein has classified the attribution of responsibility related to CNA originating from State A and directed against State B into four categories:³⁰\n\nThe first category consists of cases where citizens of State A launch CNA on their own initiative and for reasons only known to them. Their activities cannot be attributed to the government of State A. In the given case, State A should exercise sufficient executive duress against the individuals concerned so that they would either end or avoid launching the attacks against State B from the territory of State A.³¹\n\nThe second category consists of cases when certain individuals or terrorists residing in State A launch CNA against State B for certain ideological, etc. reasons and the terrorists are not supported by State A. The obligations of State A are the same that were described under the first category.³²\n\nIn the third category terrorists supported by the State A launch CNA against State B. If the actions can be attributed to terrorists supported by State A, the terrorists could be treated as de facto representatives of State A as provided by the principles of State\n\n28 Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-third Session, UN Doc.

This represents the most complicated category as the actions of representatives of a State within the CNA sphere may have a number of forms – like espionage (which cannot be construed as the use of force), interruption of communication systems with no harm to humans (not grave enough to exceed the threshold of use of force) and cyber attacks that result in harm done to persons. The latter is treated as CNA that oversteps the threshold established for the use of force, but all the cases described in this category can be ascribed to State A.³⁵\n\n‘Active defence’ is also possible as a counter-measure against CNA, meaning that a State under CNA attack will attack the computer system of another State being the source of the CNA, considering that it will be later forced to apologise, in public, for the ‘counterattack’ or pay compensation.\n\nAt the current moment, launching a cyber attack by a State against another State represents the exception and not the rule.³⁶ Most CNAs are perpetrated by individuals and non-State actors, but the attribution of such acts to them or the State harbouring them is complicated as evidence is hard to get or evidence can be misleading in the case of a sophisticated attack.\n\n## 2.3. Jus ad Bellum and CNA – Future Trends\n\nIn the near future, jus ad bellum will still be subject to an understanding that the use of force or threat of force within cyberspace will remain a fact to be identified separately in each case. The majority of cyber attacks will not exceed the threshold of use of force, but the valid paradigm may be subject to change if clear-cut cases emerge. For example, some scholars are of the opinion that the USA may decide to respond with armed force if a cyber attack launched by another State destroys the informa\n\n33 Article 8 of 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n34 Dinstein, supra note 24, p. 104.\n35 Ibid., p. 105.\n36 Currently the use of CNA against a State occurs in an armed conflict as an additional measure to classical kinetic force. The conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008 also had occurrences of CNA use but it is open whether these were carried out by Russia or ‘voluntary hackers’.

The non liquet position, adopted by the Department of Defense of the USA in 1999, was the following:\n\nAs in all cases when a nation considers acting in self-defense, the nation considering such action will have to make its best judgment on how world opinion, or perhaps a body such as the International Court of Justice or the United Nations Security Council, is likely to apply the doctrine of self-defence to electronic attacks. As with many novel legal issues, we are likely to discover the answer only from experience.³⁸\n\nThis decade old position would seem to be still valid prima facie as there have been no clarifying developments in international law in this regard. If we are dealing with a situation where State A is supporting the activities of criminals and therefore CNA is launched against State B, responding with CNA to CNA is probably acceptable and justified. If CNA exceeds the threshold for the use of force, the traditional kinetic self-defence capabilities may be employed. But at the moment there does not exist a defined yardstick – CNA with grave consequences can be treated as the use of force in the future, while consequences that do not meet the threshold will not be treated as use of force.\n\nIn the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), CNA with consequences equal to use of force might be in some extreme cases regarded as events that may trigger the collective self-defence provision of Article 5 in the North Atlantic Treaty, although this seems doubtful. NATO’s own rhetoric has been in this field cautious, if not in the negative.³⁹ This is due to the fact that current and previous attacks have not exceeded the threshold mentioned, and thus it is hard to predict the consequence of future CNA. Most probably the only article applicable in the NATO framework would be Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, in which case members will enter into consultations if the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the members is threatened.

Jus in Bello and CNA\n\n*Jus in bello* or international humanitarian law is a set of legal norms applicable in case of an armed conflict. When CNA is used in an armed conflict as a weapon then legal restrictions arising that regulate the use of weapons are applicable to CNA. These restrictions must be adhered to in self-defence operations when countering CNA with CNA or when responding to a physical attack with CNA. Also, in cases of use of CNA as an offensive weapon there is a need to understand the legal restrictions that regulate the selection of targets and the precautions in attack to be adopted.\n\n## 3.1. Legal Assumptions for the Implementation of Humanitarian Law in the Case of CNA\n\nIn international humanitarian law, there is no explicit provision that deals with either CNA or IO or cyber war. Nevertheless, the Martens Clause, which is regarded as customary law,⁴⁰ states that “in cases not included in the [Hague] Regulations adopted by them, populations and belligerents remain under the protection and empire of the principles of international law, as they result from the usages established between civilised nations, from the laws of humanity and the requirements of the public conscience”.⁴¹ The modernised Martens Clause is contained in Article 1(2) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which states that “[i] n cases not covered by this Protocol or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of the principles of international law derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience”.⁴² The purpose of the Martens Clause is to affirm that the belligerents’ choice of methods or means of warfare is not unlimited and to eliminate any incidents in armed conflicts that are not covered by treaty regulation or customary law. Therefore, these principles reaffirm that even without explicit mention of CNA in modern treaties or customs, certain restrictions still apply.\n\nThe ICJ has reaffirmed that for weapons two customary law restrictions apply. Firstly, “[s]tates must never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military\n\n⁴⁰ “The Court points to the Martens Clause, whose continuing existence and applicability is not to be doubted, as an affirmation that the principles and rules of humanitarian law apply to nuclear weapons”, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, 8 July 1996, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 87, <www.icj-cij.org 7495.pdf=\"\" 95=\"\" docket=\"\" files=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n\n⁴¹ Preamble of the 1899 Hague Convention (II) and 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land.\n\n⁴² 1977 Additional Protocol 1, Article 1(2).</www.icj-cij.org>",

[S]tates do not have unlimited freedom of choice of means in the weapons they use.\"44 All of the above and the restrictions applicable to weapons must be taken into account if using CNA in an armed conflict.45\n\nCNA must be capable of fulfilling the requirement set for weapons – that it can be used in an attack and aimed against specific targets. According to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its Additional Protocols of 1977, an attack is an act of violence,[46] which raises the question: Is CNA out-of-bounds for international humanitarian law because CNA is not a use of violence in the strictest sense of the word? The answer to this question is ‘no’ as for the purposes of humanitarian law an ‘attack’ shall represent a generic and a broad definition.[47] ‘Violence’ therefore in humanitarian law is defined through the consequence of physical (in case of objects and physical persons) or mental (in case of physical persons only) damage. CNA does most probably bring the described consequences, and therefore the use of CNA should be treated as an attack.\n\nStates also have an obligation when adopting a new weapon to conduct an assessment process to determine whether the use of such new weapon would under some or all conditions be prohibited or restricted under the standards of humanitarian or some other category of international law.[48] Unfortunately States have no obligation to publicise these findings, and thus the majority of these analyses are off the record and not available to the general public.\n\nThe discussion below is based on an assumption that there is an established armed conflict governed by the norms and principles prescribed in international humanitarian law. International humanitarian law will only apply to CNA if CNA's consequences are not just sporadic and isolated cases and are aimed to cause injuries, death, damages and destruction and where such consequences are predictable or desired. Humanitarian law is not applicable to CNA if these consequences do not include the causing of injuries, death, damages and destruction during an armed conflict (for example, the failure of a university intranet, downloading of financial information, temporary closing of access to internet or being involved in cyber espionage).\n\n43 Nuclear Weapons case, supra note 40, para. 78.\n44 Ibid.\n45 It has been argued that “[i]t is perfectly reasonable to assume that also the new forms of CNA, which do not involve the use of traditional weapons, are subject to IHL just as any new weapon or delivery system has been so far when used in an armed conflict”, in Dörmann, supra note 13.\n46 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 49(1).\n47 Commentary of the 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 49, <www.icrc.org 470-750062?opendocument=\"\" ihl.nsf=\"\" com=\"\">, visited on 28 March 2009.\n48 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 36.</www.icrc.org>",
    "Erki Kodar\n\n## 3.2. CNA and Legitimate Targets\n\nIf CNA constitutes an attack or the use of violence in an armed conflict, the next question arises: What can be attacked with the weapon and what are the legitimate targets? For analytical purposes M. Schmitt divides targets into four categories: combatants and military targets; civilians, who directly participate in hostilities; objects used by both military and civilians; specifically protected objects.^[49]^\n\nCombatants and military targets are legitimate targets^[50]^ and can be targeted as long as the means and methods of attack comply with the restrictions established by humanitarian law.^[51]^ Therefore, aiming a CNA against combatants is permissible (for example, falsifying military air traffic control system navigational information that results in a military transport crash).^[52]^ When attacking military targets, the attack against a target must considerably contribute to military action and provide for a definite military advantage.^[53]^ Attack against the enemy's command and control networks, etc. does not create difficulties. However, which principles should be adopted in case of contestable targets: Can CNA be aimed against a banking system as the sustainability of armed forces depends on wealth? If a State is disproportionately dependent upon a specific industry (for example, oil), can CNA be used to stop production and distribution?^[54]^ Is it important that the attack is accompanied by physical destruction, not just inconvenience? If the purpose is only to cause inconvenience, this does not exceed the threshold of a military attack.\n\nCivilians represent individuals who are not considered combatants and civilian targets are targets that are not military targets. Therefore the armed forces have an obligation to direct their attacks against military objectives.^[55]^ Notwithstanding legitimate collateral damage, the ban on attacking civilians and civilian targets is practically absolute. Civilians lose their immunity when participating directly in hostilities by causing damages to the members or supplies of the enemy's armed forces.^[56]^ The use of civilians to launch CNA, as sub-contractors or civil servants, is full of legal problems and issues.^[57]^ The main problem with CNA is that it encompasses activities\n\n^[49]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, pp. 379–387.\n\n^[50]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52 notes that civilian objects shall not be the object of attack and that attacks shall be limited to military objectives.\n\n^[51]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(i) demands that the attackers must do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are not civilian objects, but military objectives.\n\n^[52]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 380.\n\n^[53]^ 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 52(3).\n\n^[54]^ Schmitt, *supra* note 13, p. 381.

If civilians are directly involved in conducting CNA resulting in physical damages, such persons may be treated as unlawful combatants as they are participating directly in hostilities. Thus the IT-support personnel who are contributing to a CNA operation are at the risk of being considered targets. Civilians employed for the purpose of CNA represent a challenge for humanitarian law as they would not fit under the category of lawful combatants. When it is impossible to restrict the participation of civilians in military activities, this may endanger the civilian population as the enemy cannot make a clear distinction between combatants and civilians. Considering the skill-sets required for CNA it is more than reasonable to assume civilian involvement in such attacks, but the correct course of action should be that the members of armed forces conduct CNA.\n\nDual-use targets have both military and civil purposes (airports, railways, electrical systems, communication systems, factories producing material for both the civilian population and armed forces, etc.).58 If an object is being used for military purposes, it will be construed as a military target that can be attacked with all the permissible methods, including CNA. The aforementioned is also valid in a situation where the military objectives of a target are only secondary to the civilian objectives.\n\nHumanitarian law grants special protection to certain objects like dykes, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.59 Objects under special protection are defined as hazardous facilities as attacking them may launch dangerous forces and cause serious losses among the civilian population. As a general rule, such targets should not be attacked if the emission of dangerous forces cannot be controlled, but in the case of CNA it would be possible to neutralise these targets without launching any dangerous forces (which is an advantage, compared to kinetic weapons).60\n\n# 3.3. CNA's Compatibility with General Principles of Humanitarian Law\n\nOnce it has been determined that a target is lawful, the concordance of attack with general principles (and norms regarding targeting) of humanitarian law should be assessed before the attack is launched. These principles are the principle of distinction, prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, principle of proportionality and the prohibition of perfidy.\n\nHostilities under International Humanitarian Law, <www.icrc.org eng=\"\" direct%20participation-hostilities-ihl-311205=\"\" siteeng0.nsf=\"\" siteeng0.nsf/=\"\" /=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\" /participation%20in%20hostilities-sept%202003.pdf=\"\">, visited on 24 March 2009; K.

    "Erki Kodar\n\nAccording to the principle of distinction, the participants to a conflict must always be capable of making a distinction between civil population and combatants and civil objects and military targets.⁶¹ Therefore, only military targets may be attacked. While CNA can be used in compliance with the principle of distinction, it can also be, like conventional weapons, used indiscriminately. No matter how attractive the idea of launching one extensive CNA campaign against the infrastructures of the State as a whole would be, including attacks against the civil sector, all CNA attacks must be aimed against military targets. The principle entails an obligation to minimise collateral damage and to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be disproportionate to the value of the military objective to be attacked.\n\nThe principle of distinction is closely knitted with the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks. Indiscriminate attack stands for attacks that are not aimed against a specific military objective, employing the methods and means of warfare, which cannot be aimed against a military target or employing the methods and means of warfare the consequence of which cannot be restricted.⁶² With CNA, the main threat is posed by the fact that it can be used for launching indiscriminate attacks, either deliberately or inadvertently. If malicious code CNA is employed that is uncontrollable and spreading through civilian systems, then such CNA is prohibited as an indiscriminate weapon.⁶³ Taking into account that civilian and military networks are closely intertwined, the launched CNA must be of such sophistication that it conforms to the prohibition.\n\nThe principle of proportionality demands that conflicting interests must be weighed against each other – sufferings and damages versus military advantage.⁶⁴ If military advantage outweighs incidental loss of life or damages to civilians or civilian objects, the attack is construed to be in compliance with the principle of proportionality (although the principle seems to be rather simple, its implementation in practice is extremely complicated). The majority of the problems of CNA in this equation are caused by knock-on effects that are “not directly and immediately caused by the attack, but nevertheless the product thereof – it is the problem of the effects caused by the effects of an attack”.⁶⁵ As CNA may result in consequences which are initially unpredictable, one must always assess when planning an attack whether CNA would be accompanied by endangering the civil population or not. As the CNA attacks are complicated and may, with great probability, affect civilian systems, one must assess the causal damages and possible consequences during the planning stage of any operation prior to launching an attack and seek ways to mitigate these effects. Then again, CNA as a method may help to diminish collateral damage as it allows, instead of physical destruction, to ‘switch off’ the target (for example, instead of bombing an\n\n61 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 48.\n62 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 51(4).\n63 Schmitt, supra note 13, p. 389.\n64 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 57(2)(a)(iii).\n65 Schmitt, supra note 13, p. 392.",
    "Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\n\nairport it is possible to disturb the operation of flight control systems).⁶⁶ CNA allows the attacker to directly control the consequences and minimise the risk to civilian population when the attained military advantage has been achieved.\n\nPerfidy is the feigning of protected status with the intent to kill, injure or capture an adversary.⁶⁷ The prohibition of perfidy does not mean that ruses of war cannot be used.⁶⁸ For the purposes of CNA, a ruse would be communication of incorrect information on location and manoeuvres, forging the information in the enemy’s reconnaissance database, etc.⁶⁹ Perfidy would be pretending to have a protected status, and for the purposes of CNA this would be deceptive use of codes and signals given to medical transport by the International Civil Aviation Organization.⁷⁰\n\nWhile the humanitarian law in force is, in general, sufficient to protect individuals and objects from CNA, some uncertainties still exist. Even though it was impossible to predict the occurrence of CNA upon the emergence of current humanitarian law, some general standards are, nevertheless, applicable to CNA. At the same time CNA is characterised by specifics that also represent challenges and problems for the purposes of *jus in bello*: When does one consider CNA as an ‘attack’ in *jus in bello* and when only as a nuisance? But CNA is also a positive tool that allows for achieving military objectives without the causal damages that may result from kinetic attacks. It should also be remembered that CNA is a weapon, and any unlawful use may bring about incrimination for the commitment of war crimes.\n\n## 4. Possible Future Scenarios for the Regulation of CNA\n\nIn all probability a new defined structure of international law will not be introduced in the nearest future that would encapsulate all the cases of use of force with regard to cyberspace and the assessment of CNA *vis-à-vis* the right of self-defence. The issue is at the mercy of practical experiences of different States as there seems to be unwillingness to enter into international or regional agreements in this sphere. The *status quo* is useful for States with better CNA capabilities to maintain freedom of action. But there might be will to move towards some foreseeable developments.⁷¹\n\nIn 1998 Russia attempted to initiate a United Nations General Assembly resolution dealing with the banning of some highly dangerous information operations.⁷²\n\n66 *Ibid.*, p. 394.\n\n67 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 37(1).\n\n68 1977 Additional Protocol I, Article 37(2).\n\n69 K.

The Naval War College in Newport, USA organised a CNA-conference in 1999, where the participants agreed that it would be useful and sensible to intensify international co-operation in the sphere of computer crime and cyber terrorism, but the time has not yet come for introducing a comprehensive regulation or banning in general.73 More extensive co-operation in the sphere of legal assistance was justified with the pretence for the criminalisation of actions threatening the international community to bring the criminals to justice and to simplify the extradition procedure.74\n\nIf legal assistance agreements are to serve as an effective instrument to fight cybercrime, it is necessary for them to have an explicit scope including either cybercrime or all crimes in general. If countries have not entered into extradition agreements, this means that such countries have neither a duty nor the domestic legal basis to extradite a person to another State.75 It would also be difficult to sustain the argument that the principle of *aut dedere aut judicare* is customary law with relation to CNA.76 An alternative to extradition would be to administer justice to a person who has committed CNA against another State in the CNA's State of origin.77\n\nDoc.

    "Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\n\n# 4.1. Estonia's Role in the Development of CNA-related Agreements or Standards?\n\nProfessor D. Hollis, who studied the cyber attacks against Estonia, suggests the creation of the right of hot pursuit available to a State which is the object of a cyber attack as \"nations could agree to waive sovereignty concerns and permit a direct response in certain cases, such as cyber attacks by terrorists that all nations might want thwarted\".[78] The thought would suggest that it would be appropriate to allow the attacked State to use counter measures to defend itself from an attack with extraterritorial measures even if such countermeasures would violate the sovereignty of the State being the origin of the attacks. Let us assume that hackers from Russia were behind the attacks against Estonia, and they had no connections with either the government or the armed forces. According to the current procedure, Estonia should ask Russia to maintain law and order in its territory as a kinetic counterattack would represent violation of Russia's sovereignty. According to proposed new standards of international law the States could leave aside all the worries related to their sovereignty and allow, in certain cases (as a community value all States should be interested in preventing the activities of cyber terrorists), the implementation of direct countermeasures by a State under attack.[79] While this sounds sensible, the development of an appropriate regulation is highly doubtful as States do not wish to open a Pandora's Box on the use of force, and the described scenario would leave numerous opportunities for serious misconduct and abuse.\n\nHollis also opines that Estonia wanted to construe cyber attack against the State as military activity (a new paradigm) and not as an act subject to penal power (the former paradigm). It can be assumed that in the future cyberspace will become the battlefield where military power is used, humanitarian law is applied and valid penal power framework may be imposed for combined effect.[80] In a military sense, cyberspace can be treated as an asymmetric field even now as States are not necessarily combating each other; it is rather the case of non-State actors positioning themselves against a State (or joining in with the State).\n\nThe establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia may represent a progressive step for the purposes of international law. The birth and activities of the centre may provide beneficial practical experiences and legal evidence. In addition, CNA can be regulated under national law, which could",

Possible Developments of International Law in the Sphere of CNA\n\nA way ahead could be the conclusion of a multilateral agreement, involving specific and accurate standards applicable to CNA. In the given situation, the conclusion of a framework treaty that prescribes main and essential principles and gives States more freedom for the interpretation of specific aspects is more likely. Regionally, the conclusion of either bilateral or regional agreements (Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime represents a step in this direction) may be possible – provided that there is political will.\n\nOne way forward would be to draft new counterterrorism measures and agreements dealing with cybercrime and cyber terrorism. Measures preventing cybercrime have been taken both at the regional and global level to supplement national criminal law and international co-operation in the sphere of investigating and prosecuting such crimes. The main problem here is the difference of national law of different States or conflict of legal systems. Also, constitutional restrictions to extradition must be considered here.⁸¹ The format of an agreement for the prevention of cybercrime would be similar to the other agreements related to fighting terrorism wherein a certain type of behaviour shall qualify as terrorist activity and will be subject to a certain procedure between the member States. The aforementioned would provide a universal jurisdictional basis, or quasi-universal jurisdictional bases, for certain types of crime. At the moment, cyber terrorism is not taken seriously enough to be a subject for such agreements, and CNA must breach a high threshold to be considered as an issue worthy of international agreements.⁸² While the events that took place in Estonia in 2007 did not exceed this threshold, they can most certainly be interpreted as something more serious than common vandalism; therefore Estonia could have the opportunity to initiate the procedure for the conclusion of an agreement on the prevention of cyber terrorism. The main problem here is the fact that it is difficult to agree on which activities should be construed as cybercrime and ascertain where the line between common crime and terrorism should be drawn.\n\nAnother category of potential agreements could restrict the sovereign freedom of States – declarative agreements on lawful principles, armament control agreements and humanitarian law agreements. A declarative agreement would involve the most general principles that States would be willing to observe for the purposes of implementing international law (for example, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, stating that outer space is intended for common peaceful use by mankind). The pre-requisite for\n\n⁸¹ Russia invoked a ‘constitutional ban’ recently in the Litvinenko case and refused to extradite the prime suspect, Andrei Lugovoi.

    "Computer Network Attacks in the Grey Areas of Jus ad Bellum and Jus in Bello\n\nthe conclusion of any declarative agreements would be a State’s evaluation of long-term national interests concerning CNA. The crux of the matter is the abrupt and powerful development of information technology as it would be impossible to predict future situations with the required level of accuracy upon the conclusion of such agreements, and consequently States may be hesitant to sign a carte blanche treaty. With armament control agreements States could commit themselves not to develop, acquire or transfer certain CNA capabilities or not to use their capabilities in a way that would be destabilising for the armament control regime or crisis management systems of another State. The pre-requisites and problems encountered when discussing this type of agreements are the same as with declarative agreements. Also, States will not always have a monopoly in CNA capabilities, considering the interests and capacities of hackers and cyber terrorists themselves. Humanitarian law agreements usually restrict the use of certain types of weapons in the case of an armed conflict. The restrictions are justified by stating that the weapon may cause unnecessary suffering. Information technology weapons, adopted in cyber war, may not necessarily fit the criteria on the grounds equivalent to conventional weapons. As general humanitarian law principles and standards can be applied to CNA, the efficiency of such agreements is doubtful. Special standards applicable to CNA would be more useful than agreements attempting to restrict the utilisation thereof.⁸³\n\nThe conclusion of multilateral conventions, restricting the liberty of freedom of States, is not considered as realistic in the near future, as only very few countries, if any, have an understanding of the capacities and vulnerabilities related to cyber war, sufficient to promote the long-term national interests of such States.⁸⁴\n\nBilateral agreements or agreements with a limited number of parties are most useful in a situation where a certain number of governments are directly involved with a concrete and common problem. This type of agreement represents a useful form of co-operation within regional scope. G8, the Council of Europe and the Organization of American States have used this to enter into regional conventions on cybercrime (and the NATO process is, potentially through cyber defence policy, moving in this direction). There still will be potential risks related to cases exceeding the limits of regional agreements or where the organisations are dominated by some of the member States, thus turning the convention into a dead letter agreement.⁸⁵\n\nOn an organisational plane the United Nations General Assembly has often shown initiative for the adoption of resolutions that request or invite the member States to pursue certain principles in their activities. While resolutions are not strictly\n\n⁸³ Ibid., pp. 446–450; D.

Unfortunately, at the moment, the General Assembly seems to be lacking the initiative. Considering the novelty of legal problems related to CNA, the adoption of resolutions on cyber war is probably not realistic over the next decade.⁸⁶\n\nOne alternative is represented by codification of customary law as a ‘manual’, as was done with the law of naval warfare by the International Institute of Humanitarian Law, or to enthuse progress by way of custom, codes of conduct or rules of engagement where codification would be based on experience.⁸⁷ Unfortunately, the summoning of the experts of the given sphere is highly unlikely for the lack of customary law to be codified for the purposes of cyber war. Adoption of best-practices guidelines seems to be realistic.⁸⁸\n\nThe current mindset of States seems to be more domestic than international as States have identified that CNA prevention and control is closely connected with regular home and private users. Estonia adopted in 2008 the Cyber Security Strategy,⁸⁹ and President Obama’s administration is conducting at the moment a 60-day cyber security review to ascertain how to apply cyber security policy.⁹⁰ The Center of Strategic and International Studies Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency released a report on the same issues 8 December 2008.⁹¹ The aim of both documents is to raise the awareness of private computer users and the private sector to take responsibility for their computers and secure them against unwanted uses. Some authors argue that there exists a civic duty to secure private machines against becoming a part of botnet.⁹² Responsible civil conduct would minimise the risk of exploitation for the users but also for the State concerned as it enables the State to exercise diligence on its own territory and control, to a certain extent, that its sovereign territory is not used for conducting CNAs against other states. Thus States are trying to get their houses in order before moving towards international measures.\n\nIn general, future perspectives for the regulation of CNA are stuck behind several obstacles. Firstly, legislative problems related to CNA are not fully understood, mainly because of technological unpredictability. Secondly, traditional armament control agreements and humanitarian law conventions cannot be adapted for CNA\n\n⁸⁶ Ibid., p. 452.\n\n⁸⁷ J.

Thirdly, States have no explicit picture of the form of an international law regime that would promote their national interests in the best possible way in a long-term perspective with regard to CNA.\n\n# 5. Conclusion\n\nCNA is a challenge for international law because at the moment the law applies by way of analogy and interpretation in *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*. There are no express norms or customs that would regulate the uncertainty of CNA. The current framework of international law tries to fit the odd-shaped peg of CNA into a predetermined context, but this is not a satisfactory long-term solution. But some applicable rules and principles are better than no rules, better than a legal vacuum that would leave CNA out of legal reality. States and individuals with CNA capabilities will use the ambiguity to their advantage, but this will also bring State practice and more clarity to law, albeit through actions and consequences that may be harmful and unforeseen.\n\nWhen Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed that the life of law has not been of logic but of experience, he meant both the aforementioned and the possible future. The law is always behind the present, either by a step or two. Due to its flexible norm-creating procedure, international law only has to encounter a number of CNA incidents that will change the paradigm and give the required incentive to create legal regulation concerning the use of information weapons. Until then States need to cope with the existing law. Where it regards the use of CNA as use of force we can paraphrase Justice Stewart that we will know it when we see it or, in other words, law will recognise certain forms of CNA as the use of force only after it has been factually established that it has been the use of force.\n\nWhile the more capable States have adopted either ambivalent or even an attitude of ignorance with regard to the regulation of CNA over the last decade, some forms of co-operation may still be realistic, as demonstrated by the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. Estonia's contribution to NATO's cyber defence policy and the establishment of the Centre of Excellence may lead NATO towards another agreement, which may expand the member States' understanding of cyber law and cyber war and influence other States.\n\n155"
