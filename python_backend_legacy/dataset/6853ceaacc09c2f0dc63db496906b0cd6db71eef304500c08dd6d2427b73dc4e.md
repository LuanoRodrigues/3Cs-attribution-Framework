In some ways cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine, and policy are developed and put to use even before corresponding theories are properly understood. This article analyses how American cyber deterrence has been implemented over the past two decades in order to inform ongoing debates within the academic study of deterrence, and to provide insights from practice for how cyber deterrence theory can be better conceived and refined.\nWhile President Donald Trump upbraided the previous administration's apparent weakness in cyberspace – ‘We’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing’ – his administration has itself struggled to table a coherent cyber deterrence strategy, despite repeated promises to do so quickly.¹ As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to ‘develop the offensive cyber capabilities we need to deter attacks by both state and non-state actors’.² Two weeks following his November 2017 election, President-elect Trump went on to explain further – that he would build ‘a comprehensive plan to protect America’s vital infrastructure against cyberattacks’.³ And months later still, as President, he signed Executive Order (EO) 13800 in May 2017 – an updated draft of a January 2017 EO that had been scraped at the last minute – on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. The EO describes a plan to reassess all elements of US cybersecurity across and beyond the government. In terms of cyber deterrence specifically, EO 13800 calls on various agencies and departments – including the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security, along with the Director of\nCONTACT Alex S.

A public version of the report eventually appeared in May 2018. $^{5}$\nPresident Trump was also slow to appoint or approve several top-level federal cybersecurity and technology positions – including, notably, Federal Chief Information Security Officer, and the head of DHS's cybersecurity and infrastructure protection division. $^{6}$ These positions are critical to guiding US cybersecurity policy and planning, including in the area of cyber deterrence. Despite all of this, (former) White House Homeland Security advisor, Thomas Bossert – who helped craft cybersecurity policy under US President George W. Bush – revealed in October 2017, that the Trump Administration was determined to eventually publish a new cybersecurity strategy based on EO 13800. $^{7}$ And in his January 2017 Confirmation Hearing, General James Mattis, President Trump's (former) Secretary of Defense, suggested that a comprehensive 'cyber doctrine' might be ready by July 2018. $^{8}$ The new National Cyber Strategy was eventually published in September 2018, after an earlier public summary was held back in May 2018. $^{9}$\nAlthough a US cyber deterrence strategy distinct from a broader cyber doctrine has yet to be established or fully leveraged, bits and pieces of the strategy exist, peppered about in different government departments and agencies. Indeed, US cyber deterrence has evolved a great deal since the mid-2000s. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, to better anticipate where US cyber deterrence is heading in practice by exploring the manner in which it has evolved through different presidential administrations. And second, to trace the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date to explore cyber deterrence in theory.

By the standards of deterrence theory, which has a robust and cumulative pedigree dating back over a century, cyber deterrence is an innovative but imperfectly understood idea. The bulk of the academic literature on cyber deterrence was produced only very recently, over the past fifteen years or so. Moreover, in some important ways, US cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine and policy have been developed, unveiled and put to use even before corresponding theories from academia are properly understood, tested and refined.\nIf practice precedes theory, then a reflection of how this practice progressed over time may help inform theory more broadly. Combined, these circumstances leave scholars with a unique opportunity to evaluate an example of cyber deterrence practice in order to explain and better describe cyber deterrence theory. In methodological terms, this article explores how American cyber deterrence has been implemented in order to better highlight theory more broadly. The United States, by dint of its size, pre-eminence in cyberspace and decades of experience operationalising deterrence theory in other domains, represents a crucial case. Moreover, in empirical terms, the US government openly discusses cybersecurity, and has made various iterations of its cyber deterrence strategy and doctrine publicly available. While a comprehensive US cyber deterrence strategy has yet to be tabled, fragments of the strategy can be patched together, piecemeal, from various US government bodies. A record of thought and practice exists; wading through it provides insights for theory.\nThe article begins with a summary of the academic literature on deterrence theory dating back to the beginning of the Cold War. The rationale here is to outline the nuts and bolts of deterrence theory, highlight conceptual prerequisites, illustrate the many ways deterrence has been operationalised, and briefly assess the ‘four waves' of deterrence scholarship. Next, the article takes a broad look at cyber deterrence theory in particular. The purpose is to discuss the core debates and research clusters embedded within this particular sub-field of the literature. Doing so will provide a theoretical foundation against which the empirical work can be paired against. An exploration of US cyber deterrence then follows. This section will provide a detailed and linear reflection of US cyber deterrence strategy, doctrine and policy stretching back to the early 2000s. The analysis will piece together how US strategy has unfolded and evolved over time, and help identify specific concepts, trends and assumptions baked into strategic\n#\nA. S. WILNER\ndiscourse. Highlights from the US example will then be analysed in the conclusion of the article. The way the United States has put cyber deterrence into practice over time provides lessons and insights for how cyber deterrence theory might be better conceived, approached and refined.\n# Deterrence in theory: Concepts and debates\nDeterrence is an enduring concept. It has repeatedly proven its flexibility in responding to, and evolving from, shifting international and interstate dynamics. Deterrence, at its theoretical core, entails using threats to manipulate an adversary's behaviour.[11] More concretely, it rests on convincing another actor to forgo an unwanted action. Compellence – a related concept – flips the process around, prompting an adversary to pursue an action it might otherwise have avoided. Compellence encourages behaviour, whereas deterrence restrains it. Both are subsumed within the logic of coercion. In all cases of deterrence and compellence, a minimum of two actors are involved. Defenders issue threats to alter an opponent's behaviour; challengers consider these threats, weigh their options, and decide whether or not to acquiesce. In some cases, a third actor is involved. With extended deterrence, for instance, a proxy, partner, or ally is also included in the process, either on the side of the defender or the challenger. Threats of punishment – usually in the form of retaliation – and promises of denial – usually in the form of depriving an adversary the expected benefits of a particular behaviour – form the basis for most deterrent and compellent engagements, though normative and ideological considerations that inform behaviour have also been recently developed within the context of delegitimisation. Each of these three coercive processes is linked to the logic of deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial, and deterrence by delegitimisation, respectively.[12]\nDeterrence works by informing a challenger's cost-benefit calculus. Importantly, it does so by weighing upon another's strategic choice.[13] Militarily crushing an adversary, as Thomas Schelling reminds us, such that it has no alternative but to accept demands made of it is not deterrence, but rather defeat.[14] The same can be said in the realm of denial. Developing a perfect, foolproof defence, while rare, does not deter by denial but rather deters by defeat; an adversary does not penetrate a target or conduct a certain attack because it is prevented from doing so, not because it decides\n[11] Moving beyond theory and strategy, Amir Lupovici contends that deterrence is also an idea, internalized within the identity of those who rely on it. Lupvici, *The Power of Deterrence* (Cambridge 2016).\n[12] On the latter, see for instance, Jerry Mark Long and Alex Wilner, 'Delegitimizing al-Qaida: Defeating an \"Army Whose Men Love Death\"', *International Security* 39/1 (2014).\n[13] Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge: Polity Press 2004), 26.\n[14] Thomas Schelling, *Arms and Influence* (1966), 1–34.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n249\nagainst doing so.¹⁵ In deterrence, changes in behaviour are an option, not a necessity. Finally, though studies of deterrence in international affairs are naturally anchored to International Relations theory, deterrence is not reserved for states alone. It functions just as well among non-state actors, including between individuals, groups, and other organisations. Indeed, criminological deterrence has an especially rich literature on deterring violence and crime within communities, well below the level of the state.¹⁶ And the field of psychology, too, has provided deterrence scholars with avenues for exploring the cognitive side of deterrence across disciplines.¹⁷\nPut into practice, deterrence theory rests on a number of pre-requisites. First, actors must exhibit a degree of rationality, such that some combination of threats will suffice to alter behaviour. Second, overlapping preferences short of open conflict must be shared by all parties; deterrence requires that adversaries accept the feasibility of non-violence. Third, threats, expected changes in behaviour and a willingness to punish violations must be communicated. Defenders must likewise reassure challengers that threats will not be carried out in the event demands are met. Fourth, defenders must have the perceived capability, and the resolve to punish or deny as threatened. Finally, deterrence works best again a known or suspected adversary; anonymity robs deterrence of its potency.\nBuilding off these prerequisites and core conceptual tenets, deterrence theory has evolved in new and exciting ways over the past several decades. This process of theoretical rejuvenation and praxis has been the result of both changing geostrategic realities (from bipolarity to unipolarity and back, for instance), and because of the emergence of new technology (from nuclear weapons to artificial intelligence) and security domains (including air, space and cyberspace). For illustration of this evolution, consider these various concepts. Central deterrence – which functions to protect a defender's assets – stands against extended (or triadic) deterrence – which functions to protect a third party's assets. Broad deterrence – which deters aggression writ large – stands against narrow deterrence – which deters a specific, and often limited, behaviour. Similarly, general deterrence seeks to\n¹⁵ Alex Wilner, ‘Contemporary Deterrence Theory Counterterrorism: A Bridge too Far?’ NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 47/2 (2015).\n¹⁶ The literature is expansive. For a reference point, consider these various meta-analyses of the empirical record: Anthony Braga and David Weisburd, ‘The Effects of Focused Deterrence Strategies on Crime’, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency 49 (2012); Rob Guerette and Kate Bowers, ‘Assessing the Extent of Crime Displacement and Diffusion of Benefits’, Criminology 47/4 (2009); Trevor Bennett, Katy Holloway, and David Farrington, ‘Does Neighborhood Watch Reduce Crime?’ Journal of Experimental Criminology 2/4 (2006); David Farrington, et al., ‘The Effects of Closed-Circuit Television on Crime’, Journal of Experimental Criminology 3 (2007).\n¹⁷ See, for illustration Kevin Woods and Mark Stout, ‘Saddam’s Perceptions and Misperceptions’, Journal of Strategic Studies 33/1 (2010); Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein, ‘Rational Deterrence Theory: I Think, Therefore I Deter’, World Politics 41/2 (1989); Robert Jervis, Richard Ned Lebow, and Janice Gross Stein, Psychology and Deterrence (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 1985); Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (Random House 2011).\nregulate and uphold accepted, status quo relations, whereas immediate deterrence functions within periods of crisis and against expected anti-status quo behaviour. Intra-war deterrence shapes certain behaviour within an ongoing hot war, after other forms of deterrence have already failed; the goal here is to influence an adversary's warfighting behaviour itself. Cumulative or serial deterrence is iterative; it functions by adding up the effects of repeated coercive interactions. Moving beyond threats, inducements, deflection, dissuasion, entanglement and influence have each been added to deterrence theory, too, broadening the manner in which defenders secure their interests and shape adversarial behaviour.\nWithin IR, deterrence scholarship has evolved within the context of ‘four waves', borrowing insights from other disciplines, namely criminology, terrorism studies, and psychology. The first wave emerged around the end of the Second World War, and corresponded to the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology within a US-dominated strategic backdrop. The second wave began in the early days of the Cold War. US-Soviet dynamics and alliance structures shaped the wave's research agenda, as did the limited proliferation of nuclear weapons to US allies, like France and the UK, and rivals, like China. The second wave used game theory and scientific modelling to explore how rivals could manage nuclear escalation and alliances. Focus was placed on strategic and conventional deterrence by punishment -- and to a much lesser degree on conventional deterrence by denial in Europe and Asia -- and on major power conflict pitting mutually rational and unitary state actors. The third wave began in the 1970s. Its focus was on empiricism, on qualitatively and quantitatively testing the concepts, frameworks and theories previously proposed. Findings suggested the importance of commitment, communication, and resolve in using both central and extended deterrence, and illustrated the variance embedded within the concept of expected utility. The psychology of coercion (e.g. human cognition and thought, bias, fatigue, decision-making, misperception, and error), along with notions of strategic culture, bureaucracy and leadership also emerged.\nThe fourth wave followed the end of the Cold War and continues today. A traditional focus on bipolarity, strategic weapons, and great power rivalries gave way to a diffusion of interests, both between and below state actors. In terms of scholarship, the fourth wave is both especially dynamic, and slightly chaotic: everything and everyone under the sun is in focus. Included here is work on deterring rogue states -- traditionally weak states and militaries often in possession of limited nuclear or chemical and biological weapons, like Iraq, Iran,\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nSerbia, North Korea, Syria, and Libya. $^{19}$  Violent non-state actors have likewise been the focus of fourth wave scholarship, from pirates to ISIS and everyone in between, along with the processes of radicalisation, rebellion, insurgency, and political violence. $^{20}$  And while deterrence in space was a concern during the Cold War, it largely featured a limited number of actors, the US and USSR. But in the fourth wave, space deterrence features new entrants, like India, China, Israel, and private sector actors, including SpaceX and Blue Origin, and rapidly diffusing technology, including new forms of anti-satellite weaponry (ASAT), miniature satellites, and privately owned, reusable mega-rockets. As the scope of deterrence has broadened, so, too, has the practice of deterrence: the logic of denial has been expanded beyond its conventional limits, as has extended deterrence. $^{21}$  And altogether novel concepts, like cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace, have been proposed and tested. $^{22}$\n# Cyber deterrence in theory: Core research clusters\nResearch on cyber deterrence is largely rooted to the classical literature on deterrence stemming from IR. Several thematic clusters populate the cyber deterrence literature.[23]\n$^{19}$ T. V. Paul, Patrick M. Morgan, and James J.

The 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace defines it as a 'nervous system' or 'control system' for US critical infrastructure, comprised of 'hundreds of thousands of interconnected computers, servers, routers, switches, and fiber optic cables'. The 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations later defined cyberspace as a 'domain', characterized by 'the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures'. And in a 2008 memo, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England defined cyberspace as 'a global domain', consisting of 'the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'. While definitions of cyberspace continue to evolve, for the purposes of this paper, cyberspace is understood as a global, interconnected domain constituting hardware, digital data, and related infrastructrue in which electronic devices are used to create, save and disseminate information. The phrase 'cyber deterrence' also lacks a precise definition. At its broadest, cyber deterrence is a field of study - as deterring terrorism might be thought of - that involves applying and exploring the logic, theory, and practice of deterrence within cyberspace. More narrowly, cyber deterrence might be understood as the deterrence of attacks within or using cyberspace, or conversely, the use of cyberspace to accomplish deterrence in other domains. This paper relies on the broader definition but highlights the narrow use of the term where necessary.\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nThe largest cluster explores the manner in which the prerequisites of IR deterrence apply to cyberspace. By these standards some scholars conclude that the architecture of cyberspace – anonymity, complexity, interconnectivity, jurisdictional diffusion, open access – makes cyber deterrence inherently weak.[24] The fundamental prerequisites are not easily met. Herein, the attribution dilemma receives greatest attention.[25] The ease of digital obfuscation,[26] complexity of 'multi-stage' cyberattacks,[27] difficulty in signalling or communicating threats and deterrent capabilities,[28] and challenge of uncovering the physical source of a cyberattack,[29] can complicate how defenders construct and communicate credible coercive threats. If cyber adversaries believe that their identities are protected, retaliatory threats will fall short. A range of tentative solutions have been proposed. More sophisticated attribution capabilities, processes, and standards might be developed.[30] Or, the Internet could be reengineered as an attributed network.[31] Or, sources of a cyberattack might be better deduced weighing known capabilities, interests, and motivation of likely adversaries.[32] Or, third party enablers of cyberattacks (i.e., owners of cyber infrastructure, and other private sector actors) might be held better accountable.[33] Or, the threshold of 'certain identification' when contemplating retaliation can be lowered.[34] Still other authors illustrate how cyber attribution is not, in fact, as potent a\n24The Economist (Benjamin Sutherland, ed.)

Weak states and non-state adversaries with fewer cyber platforms, conversely, have less to fear from cyberwar and much to gain by escalating a confrontation to digital space, where they may have advantages over traditionally stronger powers. That asymmetry may destabilise cyber deterrence.³⁷ Skirting this particular paradox may involve combining cyber threats with more traditional kinetic and non-kinetic threats, effectively adding military punishment, law enforcement, diplomatic and financial sanctions, and public shaming to the cyber mix. This cross-domain deterrent approach addresses cyber credibility by tackling on traditional forms of retaliation to the equation.³⁸ Robert Mandel suggests further that defenders use ‘unorthodox’ means to enhance the potency of their deterrence in cyberspace, including, for instance, ‘subtle political and diplomatic pressure on cyberattackers or their supporters, sponsor or patrons’, like public exposure, reputational embarrassment, shaming, condemnation, embassy closures, expulsion and other forms of humiliation.³⁹ Some authors caution, though, that skipping between the digital and physical (or kinetic) realms risks escalating a conflict in unanticipated ways.⁴⁰ Other experts counter that some cyberattacks, like those that disrupt financial or political systems by degrading software or targeting data rather than hardware, are unlikely to escalate to the kinetic domain at all.⁴¹ Still others argue that cyber and\n³⁵ Glaser, ‘Deterrence’; Will Goodman, ‘Cyber Deterrence’, Strategic Studies Quarterly, 2010; Lindsay, ‘Tipping’; Ben Buchanan, The Cybersecurity Dilemma (Oxford 2016), 145; Joseph Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, International Security 41/3 (2017), 51–52.\n³⁶ Richard Harknett, et. al. ‘Leaving Deterrence Behind’, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management 7/1 (2010); Adam Liff, ‘Cyberwar: A New “Absolute Weapon?”’ Journal of Strategic Studies 35/3 (2012).\n³⁷ Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Paul Rosenzweig, ‘The Organization of the United States Government and Private Sector for Achieving Cyber Deterrence’, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2010); Mike McConnell, ‘Cyberwar is the New Atomic Age’, New Perspectives Quarterly 26/3 (2009); James Adams, ‘Virtual Defense’, Foreign Affairs 80/3 (2001); Martin Libicki, Conquest in Cyberspace (Cambridge 2007), Chapter 11; Libicki, Cyberdeterrence (2009), Chapter Three; Libicki, ‘Cyberwar as a Confidence Game’, Strategic Studies Quarterly (Spring 2011); Martin Libicki, Cyberspace in Peace and War (Naval Institute Press 2016), Chapter 16 &amp; 17; Harknett, ‘Information Warfare’.\n³⁸ James Lewis, ‘Cross-Domain Deterrence and Credible Threats’, CSIS Working Paper (July 2010); Jon Lindsay and Erik Gartzke (eds.), Cross-Domain Deterrence (under review 2018); Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff, ‘Cyberwar’; Herbert Lin, ‘Laying an Intellectual Foundation for Cyberdeterrence’, in Kruger et al., (eds.), The Secure Information Society (Springer-Verlag 2013).\n³⁹ Mandel, Optimizing, 199–201.\n⁴⁰ Lewis ‘Cross-Domain’; Anthony Cordesman and Justin Cordesman, Cyberthreats, Information Warfare, and Critical Infrastructure Protection (Praeger 2002), Chapter One; Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff ‘Cyberwar’; Lin ‘Laying’.\n⁴¹ Harknett et al., ‘Leaving’; Rid ‘Cyber War’; Thomas Rid, ‘More Attacks, Less Violence’, Journal of Strategic Studies 36/1 (2013).\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nkinetic deterrence are not intrinsically separate: they intersect, compliment, and influence each other, such that retaliation in cyberspace may have unintended side-effects in non-cyber domains, like in international finance and diplomacy.[42] Conversely, successful deterrence in one domain may trigger deterrence failure in another, as occurs when successful kinetic deterrence compels an adversary to shift to cyberattacks.[43]\nA second research cluster centres on whether cyberspace favours offensive behaviour over defensive behaviour.[44] For instance, while the number of cyber targets grows exponentially and the process of safeguarding them more complex, the ease of conducting cyberattacks remains relatively stable and inexpensive. Nor can defenders expect forewarning of an imminent cyberattack, eliminating their ability to mount an immediate deterrent response. On the contrary: cyberattacks often go unnoticed, for months, even years. Other forms of cyberattack that rely on the logic of strategic surprise, Jim Writz warns, may compel a weaker adversary to present a traditionally strong defender, like the United States, with a 'fait accompli', such that the defender then faces the prospects of a costly response in returning to the status quo.[45] And traditional factors that mitigate offensive power in other domains of warfare – like the geographic distance between adversaries or resilient offensive weapons, including second strike capabilities – are much less evident in cyberwarfare, favouring intruders over defenders.[46] Relatedly, the sheer number of potential cyber adversaries complicates coercive calculations, creating a potential asymmetry in intent, capability, and resolve that favors aggressors.[47] Indeed, cyberspace augments the destructive power of weaker actors, including small, sub-state and non-sate networks.[48] Some authors conclude that cyber deterrence is a 'mirage', and that a warfighting framework is the only way to address 'cyberaggression'.[49] Still, other scholars caution against alarmism, noting that\n42Amir Lupovici, 'The \"Attribution Problem\" and the Social construction of \"Violence\"', International Studies Perspectives 17/3 (2016); Goodman, 'Cyber Deterrence'; Ronald Deibert and Rafal Rohozinkis, 'Risking Security', International Political Sociology 4 (2010); Joseph Nye, 'Cyber Power', Belfer Center, Harvard Kennedy School Working Paper, 2011.\n43Jon Lindsay, 'Stuxnet and the Limits of Cyber Wafare', Security Studies 22/3 (2013).\n44John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!'

Frustrating the preparation phase of a cyberattack may be especially valuable.[53] Associated concepts like cyber resilience or resistance, in which compromised digital systems continue to function, or adapt and heal themselves, may further augment cyber denial.[54] However, some scholars retort that adversaries incur very low costs when their cyberattacks fail, especially when attribution is uncertain, and are able to continue trying, even unsuccessfully, without incurring further costs, suggesting that denial, decoupled from attribution and punishment, may provide few coercive benefits.[55] A fourth and final subset of the literature explores whether norms, regimes, and stigmatisation might delegitimise certain cyberattacks and shape individual and collective behaviour accordingly.[56] For example, Joseph Nye, borrowing logic developed for intra-war deterrence during the Cold War that deterred the use of certain weapons,\n50 P.W.

Multiple poles within the research community exist. And much of the field is a conceptual extension of the literature on cyber warfare. Conflating warfare and deterrence makes a certain amount of sense given that deterrence is often a consequence of projecting military power. Yet this development has skewed the nascent literature on cyber deterrence in particular ways. First, IR deterrence is favoured, to the exclusion of the literature derived from criminology, psychology or other domains that have informed previous deterrence debates. Second, deterrence by punishment is overemphasised, such that denial, dissuasion, influence, delegitimisation and other concepts are often overlooked. Third, state actors figure prominently, to the near exclusion of the role non- and sub-state actors might have in deterring attacks in cyberspace. The coercive leverage of non-state cyber actors is rarely considered. Fourth, deterring high-end cyber threats dominates the research agenda. Deterring the far more common attributes of cyber insecurity, like cyber-crime, identity and property theft, data breaches and exfiltration, hacking (DDOS, malware, spear/phishing, whaling, ransomware), digital espionage, sabotage, bullying, and other concerns, goes largely unexplored. Fifth, policy prescription seems to dominate, while theoretical, methodological and empirical developments lag behind. Properly situating cyber deterrence within the larger IR literature, or within strategic studies, or political science, is wanting. Finally, few empirical evaluations of cyber deterrence have taken place, with the exceptions largely focusing on digital coercion among states actively involved in armed conflict.\nWhat follows is an exploration of how US cyber deterrence in practice has evolved over the past decades; lessons therein will help inform our theoretical understanding of how deterrence theory and cyberspace interact.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n257\n# US cyber deterrence strategy: Evolution in practice\nAmerican cybersecurity strategy dates back to 2003, with the publication under President George W. Bush of the first standalone strategic document on cybersecurity – The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.⁶⁰ [Figure 1 provides a timeline of relevant US cyber deterrence and cyber security doctrine.] At its core, the strategy is guided by three objectives: preventing cyberattacks against critical infrastructure; reducing vulnerability to cyberattacks; and mitigating damage from cyberattacks. The document further defines the distinct roles and responsibilities held by different cyber actors – from individual-level users of cyberspace, to institutions, businesses, and innovators, and the critical infrastructure sectors. ‘Protecting the widely distributed assets of cyberspace’, the strategy reads, ‘requires the efforts of many Americans. The federal government alone cannot sufficiently defend America’s cyberspace’.⁶¹ It also describes the national and international issues and concerns that require US Government leadership, including, for instance, building a national response system that identifies threats, promotes information exchange, advises on remediation, diminishes cyber vulnerabilities, and establishes international initiatives and multilateral endeavours with other states and non-state partners to collaboratively bolster cybersecurity at the global level.\nIn terms of deterrence specifically, the strategy weds various aspects of denial and punishment together, though the latter is mostly focused on domestic criminal prosecution. For illustration, at the local-level, touting roles for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the 2003 strategy lays bare the utility of using detection, apprehension, and prosecution of cyber-criminals (at home and, if possible, abroad) as a way to punish violations of domestic and international law. Here, some aspects of cyber aggression are treated to the logic of criminological deterrence (e.g., swift, certain and severe punishment). Bush’s 2003 National Strategy does not, however, overtly address cyber punishment or retaliation among states or at the international level. Only the oblique suggestion that the US response ‘need not be limited to criminal prosecution’, and that the US ‘reserves the right to respond in an appropriate manner’, hint at any larger retaliatory global strategy.⁶² While these pronouncements may have been obligatory, for the purposes of coercion they are also inherently weak. As the\n⁶⁰The 2003 document was, however, preceded by several antecedent publications that outlined how the US envisioned cybersecurity, including, a Clinton-era Presidential Commission report (1997) and a 2000 National Plan on information security.

S. WILNER\n# U.S. CYBER DETERRENCE STRATEGY TIMELINE (1997-PRESENT)\nFigure 1. US cyber deterrence strategy timeline.\nprerequisites of deterrence theory suggest, deterrence works best when threats are clearly communicated and credible.\nIn terms of deterrence by denial, the 2003 National Strategy links mitigating the effects of cyberattacks, building less-vulnerable cyber systems and fostering cybersecurity awareness among all Americans, as a way to limit the feasibility and utility of conducting cyberattacks, making them less attractive as a result. Herein, the Strategy builds off preliminary recommendations President Bush established previously in 2001 in EO 13231 that provided\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n259\nthe impetus for better coordinating public and private sector critical infrastructure protection 'in the information age'.63 President Bush subsequently further refined the 2003 Strategy with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (2003), which called upon DHS, which had only just been established following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, to develop the concepts, frameworks, and processes for protecting American critical infrastructure and key resources.64 DHS published the first National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) in 2006.65 [Subsequent NIPPs were published in 2009 and 2013, while related Quadrennial Homeland Security Reviews were published in 2010, 2014, and 2018.] The NIPP's core builds off the three-part approach outlined in the 2003 National Strategy – prevent attacks; reduce vulnerability; mitigate damage – but it also attempts to provide a much more robust definition of deterrence: 'Cause the potential attacker to perceive that the risk of failure is greater than that which they find acceptable'. Reducing a 'target's value', 'preventing and delaying' an attack, minimising and 'mitigating' an attack's effect, and recovering from attack, are added to this definition.66 Of importance, the logic baked into the NIPP's definition of deterrence is wholly based on deterrence by denial. This makes a certain amount of sense, given DHS's mandate, but it also reflects a larger trend in the way the United States approached cybersecurity in the early days: defence (and denial) trumped offense (and punishment). The balance between denial and punishment would start to shift only under President Barack Obama.\nIndeed, Obama's legacy is marked by the rise of cyber offensive measures in US cyber deterrence doctrine.67 Upon taking office in January 2009, Obama ordered a review of US cybersecurity efforts, which largely subsumed an earlier review launched by President Bush in 2008, during his last year of office – the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) as developed by National Security Presidential Directive 54.68 The CNCI, started by Bush and completed by Obama as part of his Cyber Space Policy Review, broadened the scope of cyber security beyond what had been defined in the 2003 Strategy. CNCI established a dozen tasks for the US\n63 The White House, Executive Order 13231, Critical Infrastructure Protection in the Information Age, October 2001.\n64 Homeland Security Presidential Directive No. 7, Directive on Critical Infrastructure, Prioritization, and Protection, 2003.\n65 Department of Homeland Security, National Infrastructure Protection Plan, 2006. The 2006 NIIP includes an expansive appendix on 'Cross-Sector Cyber Security'. Follow-up NIPPs were published in 2009, 2013, and 2015. President Obama also issued EO 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in 2013, and the Cybersecurity National Action Plan in 2016.

Though several sections of Presidential Directive 54 are redacted, what is left includes specific provisions relating to the roles the Department of Defence (DoD) and the US Intelligence Community have in securing, and deterring attacks within, cyberspace. For instance, the FBI was to establish the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, which would coordinate and integrate information from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), the US Secret Service, and other agencies, to augment criminal investigation and prosecution both in the US and overseas. DHS, with an assist from various other departments, was to establish the National Cybersecurity Center, to improve coordination in protecting and defending US Government communication, cyber, and information networks. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was instructed to develop a ‘cyber counterintelligence plan' to augment the 2007 National Counterintelligence Strategy (which mentioned ‘cyber' only a handful of times). The Secretaries of State, Defense, Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the DNI were to develop, jointly, a plan ‘for the coordination and application of offensive capabilities to defend U.S. information systems'. And, most importantly for our purposes, several agencies were called upon to ‘define and develop a comprehensive and coordinating strategy to deter interference and attacks in cyberspace'. Obama reiterated this latter goal in 2009 when he expanded the CNCI's objective. ‘Senior policymakers', the White House warned, ‘must think through the long-range strategic options available to the United States'. Cyber deterrence rested on improving ‘warning capabilities', articulating ‘roles for private sector and international partners', and developing ‘appropriate responses for both state and non-state actors'.\nObama moved quickly to implement and showcase the new US cyber deterrence posture. He began in 2009 by creating and filling a new position, the Executive Branch Cybersecurity Coordinator (aka, the White House cyber czar). Howard Schmidt, a former head of security at Microsoft, was tapped for the role, tasked with harmonising the various strategies and efforts that were being explored and enacted across the US government. Within the same year, the Department of Defense, in partnership with the NSA, established US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM, or Cybercom). Subordinate to US Strategic Command, housed at the NSA, and led by the director of the NSA, Cybercom was to use NSA networks to protect DoD computer and\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n261\ninformation infrastructure. Importantly, Cybercom was also eventually tasked with developing offensive cyber capabilities for deterrent purposes.\nDoD's cyber posture was initially defined in a relatively short 2011 document, DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, which built off the May 2010 National Security Strategy and February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The document provides five strategic initiatives relating to cyberspace, including that DoD will treat cyberspace as an 'operational domain' of warfare, and will 'organize, train, and equip' itself to 'take full advantage of cyberspace's potential'.[73] The core of DoD's new cyber offensive posture is Cybercom's 133 Cyber Mission Force (CMF) teams. Each team is tasked with supporting a specific component of DoD's comprehensive cyber mission. For example, twenty-seven distinct 'Combat Mission' teams provide 'cyberspace effects' in support of military and operational plans.[74] Other 'National Mission' and 'Protection Force' teams defend DoD and public networks and infrastructure by 'seeing adversary activity, blocking attacks, and maneuvering to defeat them'.[75] A subsequent 2011 DoD report provided to Congress, DoD Cyberspace Policy Report, provides much greater detail as to how the Pentagon's evolving cyber posture provides a cyber deterrent effect. The report clearly relates offensive cyber capabilities with deterrence: 'should the \"deny objectives\" element of deterrence not prove adequate, DoD maintains ... the ability to respond militarily in cyberspace and in other domains ... using cyber and/or kinetic capabilities'.[76] The report also highlights several other cyber deterrent issues and dilemmas the US will continue to face. They included: i) how to develop a US 'declaratory deterrence posture for cyberspace'; ii) the ways in which DoD will address the 'attribution' dilemma inherent to cyber deterrence by building 'cyber forensic capabilities' and 'behavior-based algorithms' for tracing the source of a cyberattack; iii) the dilemma DoD faces in demonstrating cyber capabilities and communicating plans for deterrent purposes without revealing sensitive tools, intelligence or techniques; and iv) how DoD will 'maintain control' of cyber escalation in times of crisis and war.\nThis last dilemma was subsequently tackled in a 2013 DoD Task Force Report, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, produced by the Defense Science Board. The report is perhaps most notable for openly suggesting that DoD cyber deterrence be anchored to offensive capabilities up to and including nuclear retaliation in the event of 'existential cyber attack'. The 2013 report goes on to chastise Obama's 2010 National\n73 US Department of Defense, Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, 2011, 5–6.\n74 In October 2016, in Obama’s last months in office, Cybercom finally reached its full operating capability, translating into a force of roughly 6,000 cyber-warriors. US Cyber Command News Release, ‘All Cyber Mission Force Teams Achieve Initial Operating Capability’, 24 October 2016.\n75 Ibid., 1.\n76 DoD Cyberspace Policy Report, 2011, 2–4.\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nPosture Review (NPR) – which provided the President with guidance in nuclear policy – because it did ‘not explicitly mention’ and otherwise remained ‘essentially silent on [the] relationship between the U.S. nuclear deterrent … and the domain of cyber warfare’.77 Navy Admiral Michael Rogers, the chief of Cybercom and director of the NSA, later repurposed the nuclear analogy in his March 2015 testimony before the Senate Committee on Armed Services. ‘I liken our historical moment’, Rogers argued, ‘to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the [t]riad [sic] and underpinned by … policy structures including a declared deterrence posture’. On cyber offense, Rogers continues, the US must ‘commit time, effort, and resources to understanding our historical situation and building cyber military capabilities’.78 A month following Rogers’ testimony, DoD published The DoD Cyber Strategy (2015) its first such strategic document.\nThe 2015 Strategy enshrined Cybercom's expanding offensive purpose. The document, an expansive overview of cyberwarfare and cyber defence, helps guide the development and use of the CMF teams, going quite a distance in illustrating their ability, purpose, and potency. The document also defines deterrence by emphasising punishment, rather than denial, in cyberspace: 'The United States will continue to respond to cyberattacks against U.S. interests at a time, in a manner, and in a place of our choosing, using appropriate instruments of U.S. power'. By October 2016, all of Cybercom's CMF teams reached initial operating capability, translating into a force of roughly 6,000 cyber-warriors. A little over a year later, in January 2018, Cyber Command's headquarters - Joint Force Headquarters Department of Defense Information Network (JFHQ-DODIN) - itself became fully operational.\nSeparately, DoD again tasked the Defense Science Board to sharpen US cyber deterrence options, policy, and strategy, especially in the realm of deterrence by punishment. The DSB Task Force on Cyber Deterrence was established in October 2014; it published its final report in February 2017. Asked to explore the 'requirements for effective deterrence of cyber attacks' against the United States and its allies, and to identify digital and non-digital capabilities 'needed to support deterrence, war-fighting, and escalation control against a highly cyber-capable adversary', the Task Force focused\n77DoD Defense Science Board, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, 2013, 41.

Nancy Norton took command of the Headquarters in February 2018. US Cyber Command News Release, 'DoD's Network Defense Headquarters Achieves Full Operational Capability', 31 January 2018; Defense Information Systems Agency News, 'Norton Assumes Command of JFHQ-DODIN and Directorship of DISA', 1 February 2018.\nprimarily on deterring high-end cyber threats emanating from major and ‘lesser' powers and sophisticated non-state actors. The DSB makes several important suggestions. First, it introduces the term ‘deterrence by cost imposition' to replace the more commonly used term deterrence by punishment. The rationale, it would seem, is to broaden punishment's scope in keeping with the emerging logic of cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace. ‘Cost imposition' better captures the kinetic, diplomatic, economic, law enforcement, and digital forms of punishment that the US might use in responding to cyberattacks and exploitations. Second, the DSB bridges the divide between denial and punishment in cyberspace. ‘DoD must create a second-strike cyber resilient “Thin Line”' of critical US offensive systems (cyber, nuclear and conventional) and related infrastructure in order to ensure that the US can credibly threaten retaliation in response to a potentially crippling cyber first strike. Good defence and resilience feeds into the potency and certainty of threats of punishment. Third, the DSB affirms, rather bluntly, the continued asymmetry between offense and defence in cyberspace. ‘The unfortunate reality', the 2017 DSB report reads, ‘is that, for at least the coming five to ten years, the offensive cyber capabilities of our most capable potential adversaries are likely to far exceed the United Sates' ability to defend and adequately strengthen the resilience of its critical infrastructures'. US cyber offense, then, is needed to correct the perceptions of asymmetry between defenders and challengers. Finally, the DSB links cyber deterrence to reputation, past and future. It warns that not responding to a cyberattack -- once, presumably, US cyber deterrence has failed -- is, with ‘near-certainty ... an invitation to follow-on cyber attacks'. In sum, the DSB Task Force solidifies the primary role offense will have in US cyber deterrence posture and strategy of the emerging decades.\nWith its offensive building blocks in place, the US, first under President Obama and later, under President Trump, began flexing its cyber muscle. It surreptitiously destroyed centrifuges in Iran, sabotaging and delaying the country's nuclear weapons program. It explored using cyberspace to dismantle Libya's air defences leading up to the March 2011 military intervention. The US likewise targeted and sabotaged North Korea's missile development program. Elsewhere, Cybercom was charged with attacking ISIS's online presence and capability in support of US and coalition plans to degrade and defeat the terrorist organisation, and to digitally augment related kinetic operations in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. The US is thought to have also used cyberspace to retaliate against North Korea following its 2014 hack on Sony Pictures. Other forms of punishment were meted out by\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nthe Justice Department. New cyber attribution capabilities allowed DOJ, in 2014, 2016, and 2018 to indict over a dozen Chinese military hackers, seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel, and another two private Iranian citizens for stealing US intellectual property, computer hacking, and launching ransomware attacks, and several Russian military intelligence officers for a string of hacks targeting the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and sporting and anti-doping agencies in the US, Canada and Europe. Via EO 13687, President Obama likewise imposed additional sanctions on North Korea in January 2015 in direct response to the Sony Hack.[84] Finally, in his last days in office, President Obama sanctioned and expelled Russian nationals for their role in hacking the 2016 presidential election. Another 13 Russian nationals and three companies were subsequently charged by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of Special Council Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian's meddling in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Russia was again fingered by American and British officials in April 2018 for targeting and exploiting network infrastructure devices, like routers, for purposes of espionage.[85] The coercive message, all told, is that the US has developed the capability to trace and attribute cyberattacks conducted against it and its allies, and to launch punitive measures in cyberspace and across domains in response.\nIn hand with this shift towards cyber punishment, Obama also developed US declaratory posture for cyberspace and helped establish international norms for cyber engagement. From a deterrence perspective, it is not enough to simply have the tools to harm an adversary: you also need to establish and communicate red lines against which acts of retaliation will be measured. Norms that help identify what is and is not acceptable behaviour in cyberspace further solidify retaliatory threats. Obama's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace is the backbone of this process. 'The digital world is no longer a lawless frontier', President Obama's opening statement to the document reads, 'it is a place where the norms of responsible, just, and peaceful conduct among states and people have begun to take hold'.[86] The strategy outlines how the US would provide leadership in establishing global norms for cyber behaviour. The US State Department, for instance, went on to establish the world's first Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues (S/CCI) in February 2011, dedicated to coordinating the Department's diplomatic work on cyber and developing international cyber rules. Some 20\n84For an exploration of how and why North Korea's hack manipulated Sony's behaviour, which ultimately triggered the US response, see Travis Sharp, 'Theorizing Cyber Coercion: The 2014 North Korean Operation against Sony', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/7 (2017).\n85UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Joint US-UK Statement on Malicious Cyber Activity Carried out by Russian Government', 16 April 2018; UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Advisory: Russian Statesponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices', 16 April 2018.\n86The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace, 2011, 3.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n265\nother states later inaugurated their own, similar, offices. S/CCI’s greatest success was the 2015 US-China agreement on economic cyber espionage – a bilateral arrangement that China subsequently agreed to sign with the UK, Canada, Australia, the G-7, and G-20 – that codified that neither party would conduct ‘cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property’.87 The hope is that these bilateral and multilateral initiatives will curtail particular forms of behaviour in cyberspace that will eventually inform and help establish more comprehensive norms of engagement.\nThe Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues was also instrumental in assisting a UN Group of Government Experts (GGE) establish a rudimentary list of cyber norms in 2015 (though the GGE failed in 2017 to subsequently link those norms to recommendations embedded in international law).88 In terms of cyber deterrence, the 2011 Strategy illustrates that the US will continue to bolster denial – redubbed here as ‘dissuasion’ – to deter attacks, but also strongly signals its ‘right to self-defense’ in conducting cyber retaliation. The US, the document reads, ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any threat to our country … and we recognize that certain hostile acts … could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic’.89 In line with these strategic pronouncements, the Obama Administration tried to make a distinction between cyber espionage for the purposes of statecraft – which was deemed legitimate – and cyber espionage, theft, and attack for the purposes of economic or domestic disruption and infrastructure destruction – all deemed illegitimate. Thus, on the one hand, China’s 2015 exfiltration of over 20 million personnel records from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was deemed ‘not an attack’ by James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, but rather good espionage; ‘[we] would have done the same thing’.90 But on the other hand, Russia’s 2015/16 hack, manipulation, and leak of Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee data during the 2016 presidential election was deemed by CIA Director, John Brennan, as a ‘new level of malicious activity’ meant to undermine and influence the institution of US democracy.91 In January 2017,\n87 Adam Segal, ‘The Top Five Cyber Policy Developments of 2015’, Council on Foreign Relations blog, 4 January 2016.\n88 UN General Assembly, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, Seventieth Session, Item 93, 2015.\n89 The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World, May 2011, 13–14.\n90 The 2017 DSB report does however argue, rather cryptically, that ‘some would view’ the OPM heist as an example of ‘egregious behavior’ that crossed the ‘unwritten rules of traditional espionage’, DSB 2017, 7, 11–12. See also, David Sanger, ‘US Wrestles with how to fight back against Cyberattacks’, NY Times, 30 July 2016; Mike Levine, ‘China is “Leading Suspect” in Massive Hack of US Government Networks’, ABC News, 25 June 2016.\n91 Sanger, ‘Wrestles’.\n#\nA. S. WILNER\ntwo weeks before Trump's inauguration, DHS took the unprecedented step of classifying 'election infrastructure' as a critical infrastructure subsector, providing it with priority protection within the NIPP.[92]\nWhile the Trump Administration's cyberspace and cyber deterrence strategies are still being patched together, given the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date, and given what we know about Trump's leanings in international affairs, three things are likely to occur under his watch.\nFirst, threats of cyber retaliation and the logic of deterrence by punishment will continue to grow in importance. Pentagon officials have long sought more leeway from congress to engage in cyber offense. In 2017, Admiral Rogers, Cybercom's chief, lamented that 'offensive cyber is almost treated like nuclear weapons, in the sense that their application ... is controlled at the chief executive level and not delegated down. What I would like to see, over the next five to 10 years', is that US cyber weapons are viewed 'as another tool for the commanders' at the tactical level.[93] Signaling his acceptance of Rogers' position, President Trump, in August 2017, initiated the elevation of Cybercom to the status of a Unified Combatant Command (a step long-debated, but never taken, under Obama).[94] The transition places Cybercom at par with other unified commands, like US Strategic Command or US European Command, establishing a direct line of communication between Cybercom's director and the Secretary of Defense. And a year later, in August 2018, President Trump rescinded a 2012 Obama-era directive - Presidential Policy Directive 20 - that governed the manner in which cyberattacks were approved.[95] The reversal loosens the (somewhat onerous) restrictions that Obama had placed on conducting offensive cyber operations.\nFurthermore, Trump's February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (the first tabled since 2010), goes to some length in closing the cross-domain gap between nuclear weapons, nuclear retaliation, and cyber deterrence. Just as DoD's aforementioned Defense Science Board report recommended in 2013, the 2018 NPR expands the scope conditions that might lead to a US nuclear response as a result of a cyberattack. While US nuclear retaliation will continue to be reserved for 'extreme circumstances', the 2018 NPR significantly broadens these circumstances themselves to include 'significant non-nuclear strategic attacks', on 'civilian population or infrastructure'.

Additionally, perhaps cognizant that technology risks advancing more quickly than strategic policy, the NPR further warns that ‘the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of non-nuclear strategic attack technologies and U.S. capabilities to counter that threat'. Lest anyone misinterpret the document, DoD simultaneously published the NPR's Executive Summary in several languages, including Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Russian.\nThe logic of all of this was rolled into the State Department's ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats', a three-page brief published in May 2018 in direct response to EO 13800, and DoD's new Cyber Strategy, published in September 2018. The ‘Recommendations' report suggests that existing efforts at deterrence in cyberspace are ‘necessary but not sufficient': ‘network defense alone' is not enough. Calling for a ‘fundamental rethinking' of existing frameworks and a ‘new US vision' for cyber deterrence, the report recommends the development of a ‘broader menu of consequences' that the US can impose against state and non-state actors below ‘the threshold of the use of force'. With reference to the perennial issues of attribution and coercive credibility, the document calls for the US to openly demonstrate its ability to identify threats by imposing ‘swift, costly, and transparent consequences' on adversaries. Action will stand for credibility and might have ‘downstream deterrence effects'. Cyber offense is likewise paramount in DoD's 2018 Cyber Strategy. While the strategy itself is not publicity available, a 7-page summary is. And while this new strategy supersedes DoD's 2015 Strategy it compliments DoD's 2018 National Defense Strategy and the 2017 National Security Strategy. The document warns specific adversaries that the US will ‘build a more lethal force', conduct pre-emptive operations, ‘prepare for war', and collect cyber intelligence so as to field the ‘military cyber capabilities' the US needs to ‘defend forward'. A fuzzy term, defending forward implies terminating attacks at their (foreign) source, and ‘leveraging [US] focus outward to stop threats before they reach their targets'. By persistently engaging cyber competitors and aggressors on a daily basis, and by employing the Pentagon's full range of offensive capabilities, the US, the Strategy submits, will deter malicious cyber activities over time.\nSecond, and somewhat relatedly, under Trump, non-state actors may be encouraged to conduct cyber punishment and cyber offense themselves. The idea is to permit victims of cyber aggression and crime -- companies,\nA. S. WILNER\ninstitutions, NGOs, and individuals – to ‘hack back’ or counterattack via ‘active defense’ against their perpetrators. Under the current US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, it is illegal for individuals to gain entry into another’s computer system without permission. Though several US tech firms, including Google and Microsoft, have voiced concerns, Congress has nonetheless explored exceptions as part of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (first proposed in March 2017), and Georgia’s General Assembly passed a bill (later vetoed by the Governor) that would have made provisions for non-state active defence in cyberspace.⁹⁹ Despite the controversy, some companies, including major US banks, have been reported to have surveyed the utility of hack backs to protect their servers, data, and assets.¹⁰⁰ In a telling episode, Bossert, the former White House security advisor, and Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra, the chief cybersecurity official at DHS, heaped rare praise on Facebook and Microsoft during their lengthy December 2017 press-briefing in which the US officially blamed North Korea for conducting the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks. The attacks encrypted data on hundreds of thousands of public and private sector computers in over 150 countries. ‘We applaud our corporate partners’, Bossert asserted, ‘for acting on their own initiative … without any direction by the U.S. government … to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers. They shut down accounts … used to launch attacks and patched systems’.¹⁰¹ The destructive power and frequency of cyber hacking only grew under Obama. This trend will continue under Trump. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and wirelessly tethered Internet of Things (IoT) devices, along with new types of malicious activity like ransomware and sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, both of which can now be bought and sold on the Dark Web, will reshape the cyber threat landscape for individuals, communities, NGOs, and public and private-sector actors.¹⁰² Under the right conditions, non-state hack backs and other disruptive actions – the twenty-first century’s version of digital vigilantism – may prove useful for establishing a whole-of-society – rather than a whole-of-government – US cyber deterrence doctrine.\nFinally, in keeping with Trump’s general weariness of multilateralism and the United Nations in particular, the US is likely to downplay its role in establishing global cyber norms and focus instead on communicating its own red lines and bolstering the cyber deterrent posture of like-mined allied\n⁹⁹Zaid Shoorbajee, ‘Google and Microsoft ask Georgia Governor to Veto “Hack Back” Bill’, *CyberScoop*, 27 April 2018; Ryan Johnston, ‘After Widespread outcry, Georgia Governor Vetoes “Hack Back” Bill’, *State Scoop*, 8 May 2018.\n¹⁰⁰Dan Lohrmann, ‘Hack Back Law’, *Government Technology*, September 2017; Nicholas Schmidle, ‘The Digital Vigilantes who Hack Back’, *New Yorker*, 7 May 2018.\n¹⁰¹The White House, ‘Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea’, 19 December 2017.\n¹⁰²Bruce Schneier, ‘Botnets of Things’, *MIT Technology Review*, March/April 2017.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nstates. The 2018 'Recommendations' report, for illustration, calls on the US to first establish criteria for US retaliation and to then communicate the policy both 'publicly and privately' so as to generate a deterrent effect. Separately, Trump shuttered the State Department's cyber coordinator's office, effectively degrading America's role in UN negotiations, though the Administration did test the waters for restarting the process of norm building in October 2018, following a ministerial meeting with US allies.[103] What appears more certain, however, is that the US is likely to seek bilateral cyber relations with other states and groups of states. At the Cyber Week 2017 gathering in Israel in June, for instance, the ever-present Bossert announced the US-Israel bilateral cyber working group – which was to be led by White House cyber czar, Rob Joyce, before his departure and the elimination his position – signalling Washington's preference for establishing cyber coalitions of the willing. '[W]e must', Bossert warned, 'hold those who violate [cyber] norms accountable. This may not be achievable through a UN effort. Likeminded states should work to develop options for imposing consequences within a coalition structure'.[104] In a similar vein, the US, in partnership with the UK, Germany and other NATO allies, aims to establish cyber warfare principles for 2019.[105] And, as the White House articulates in its 2018 Cyber Strategy, the US has plans to build a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative' that will convene a coalition of 'like-minded states' that can collectively develop 'tailored strategies' and jointly impose 'consequences against malign actors'.[106]\n# Conclusion: Evolution in theory\nUS cyber deterrence has come a long way since 2003. Definitions of deterrence – and core concepts linked to punishment and denial – have been revisited, reconceptualised, and broadened in scope. New government positions, institutions, agencies, and organisations have been created, staffed, trained, and tasked with operationalising core concepts. New technology, including software and hardware, has been developed and deployed. Partnerships across the US government, the private sector, and civil society have been established. And allies and international organisations have been leveraged. The footprints of all of these changes are evident in the record: US strategic doctrine allows us to trace the direction of this evolution. From a theoretical perspective, the way in which US cyber deterrence has been adapted since its inception provides\n103Sean Lyngaas, 'US Looks to Restart Talks on Global Cyber Norms', CyberScoop, October 2018.\n104The White House, 'Remarks by Homeland Security Advisor Thomas P. Bossert at Cyber Week 2017', 26 June 2017.\n105Robin Emmott, 'NATO mulls \"Offensive Defense\" with Cyber Warfare Rules', Reuters, 30 November 2017.\n106 National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America, September 2018, 21.\nscholars with insight as to how deterrence theory itself might respond to the promises and paradoxes of cyber deterrence. Several lessons stand out.\nFirst, US cyber deterrence has shifted from an almost exclusive focus on defence and deterrence by denial under President Bush to a punishment-based strategy under Presidents Obama and Trump. Part of the reason threats of retaliation and ‘deterrence by cost imposition' are currently emphasised is that recent technological advancements have allowed the US to improve its ability to monitor cyberattacks, identify perpetrators, and administer retaliatory actions, both within and outside cyberspace. Simply put, punishment strategies are increasingly feasible. Technological advancements have led to the adoption and use of new offensive coercive strategies. If so, theorists themselves should better situate technology into their own work of deterrence. How might the prerequisites of deterrence theory, and the concepts derived from them, adapt to novel, emerging, and disruptive technology within and beyond cyberspace?\nSecond, and relatedly, a separate reason US cyber punishment strategies have come to overshadow denial strategies has to do with the perception that deterrence by denial is not working, or rather, that the threat of denial used alone and separately from the threat of punishment, is not working. The number, severity and complexity of cyberattacks targeting US government and private sector facilities and assets has continued to rise over the past 15 years despite the US government's communicated threat of defence and denial. In response, US doctrine and strategy has evolved such that punishment is being used hand-in-glove with denial. For illustration, synchronising their efforts to defend the 2018 US midterm elections, DoD-DHS collaboration saw the former (via Cyber Command) target Russian operatives overseas to disrupt their actions all the while the latter worked with social media companies to counter disinformation. In practice, the two approaches reinforce each other. Recalibrating the effect punishment and denial have on each other in practice, suggests that theories of deterrence must better relate how the logic of punishment augments, or otherwise corresponds to, the logic of denial. Too often punishment and denial are considered poles apart, distinct levers applied separately to the cost-benefit calculus that underpins rational behaviour and coercion. In theory, how do punishment and denial relate and overlap; in cyberspace when does one stop and the other start?\nThird, the US has come to equate attribution as a distinct form of punishment that appears logically linked to denial. In fielding a question during the 2017 WannaCry press briefing, Bossert suggested, for instance, that ‘it's not about holding a country accountable; it's about simple culpability. We've determined who was behind the [WannaCry] attack, and we're saying it. ...\nWe're going to hold them accountable ... And we're going to shame them for it. ... And I think it's going to improve our security'. By identifying North Korea, the US denied it the benefit of anonymity in cyberspace; by publically outing North Korea, the US put the regime on notice for future punishment. From a theoretical perspective, however, attribution is largely understood as a mechanism, a crucial step that allows a defender to retaliate by identifying a challenger, rather than as a functional punishment in its own right. If so, and in light of perceptual changes in practice, deterrence theory must better explore whether, how, and under what conditions public attribution -- and the threat of shaming -- function as a source of cyber deterrence at the different levels of analysis. How might public and private attribution of an attack deter, coerce, or otherwise influence individual, non-state, and state cyber challengers?\nFourth, US cyber deterrence is not chiefly about military coercion. Notwithstanding Cybercom's emerging role in providing the US government with offensive and military options to punish cyber aggressors globally, US cyber deterrence strategy has emphasised the importance of several other departments and agencies, including DOJ, DHS, FBI, State Department and various others, for both denying and punishing cyberattacks. The goal is to equip the US government with as wide a set of coercive levers as possible, crossing domains as needed, to provide a truly whole of government approach to cybersecurity and cyber deterrence. The role of the DOJ (and the FBI by extension) is especially enlightening. By publicly indicting foreign nationals for cyberattacks conducted on American computer systems, the US government underscores the fact that contemporary cyber deterrence transcends traditional defence policy and military doctrine. By establishing the DOJ as a core pillar of its punishment strategy, the US signals its intention to use criminal justice tools to deter not just criminal attacks but attacks conducted by nation state adversaries. In doing so, the US further blurs the line between state institutions and individuals, by sanctioning the latter for actions they perpetrated while working for or on behalf of foreign governments, militaries, or intelligence agencies. For deterrence theory, the burgeoning role non-military and non-kinetic coercion have had in US cyber deterrence posture suggests that academics must redouble their efforts at multidisciplinarity. Academic silos still exist in the manner in which deterrence theory is developed and tested. To some degree, deterrence from within IR theory is privileged over that stemming from criminology, psychology, and terrorism and intelligence studies. This is especially the case when it comes to deterrence in national security and international affairs. Though the fourth wave of deterrence scholarship has gone to\nsome length to bridge the disciplinary divide, more cross-fertilisation is needed among disciplines to better reflect and speak to developments taking place in practice. What theoretical lessons do non-IR approaches to deterrence hold for how IR theories of cyber deterrence are developed and improved?\nFifth, US cyber deterrence is not solely about states, either. Rather, non-state actors figure prominently in American strategic doctrine as both potential perpetrators of cyberattacks targeting US infrastructure, and, more importantly for our purposes, as potential partners that amplify US cyber deterrence. For instance, private sector and individual victims of cyberattack share information, voluntarily, about attacks with law enforcement and intelligence. This provides governments with a better understanding of the nature, prevalence and evolution of certain types of attack, which can lead to improvements in defence and denial. In other cases, as highlighted by Facebook, Microsoft, and Marcus Hutchins -- a private British citizen who noticed a ‘kill switch' within WannaCry's code and took action to temporarily shut the attack down -- non-state actors can track and impede attacks without government oversight, further denying perpetrators the fruits of their labour. In still other cases, non-state actors, including companies, individuals, academics, NGOs, and other such groups, can augment US cyber security and deterrence by denial efforts by practicing better cyber hygiene -- i.e. updating passwords or patching software. This functions to further deny challengers easy opportunities to conduct successful attacks. On this front, Washington is exploring how it might compel (or, even, demand) private sector partners, contractors, and suppliers to do more to defend and secure their own networks, data and assets, as a precondition for working with and on behalf of the US government. In February 2018, for instance, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, in discussing the 2018 National Defense Strategy at a conference, warned that DoD wanted the cyber security ‘bar to be set so high, it will become the condition of doing business' with the Pentagon; for industry, cybersecurity will be ‘foundational to business with DoD'. The point, in this case, is to develop a whole of society deterrence posture, rather than simply a whole of government approach. The logic of all of this goes back to a statement made in President Bush's opening letter to the first 2003 cybersecurity strategy, oft repeated since: ‘Securing cyberspace is an extraordinarily difficult strategic challenge that requires a coordinated and focused effort from our entire society -- the federal government, state and local governments, the private sector, and the American people'. ‘Every American', the strategy continues ‘who can contribute to securing part of cyberspace is encouraged\nto do so. The federal government invites the creation of, and participation in, public-private partnerships to raise cybersecurity awareness, train personnel, stimulate market forces, improve technology, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, exchange information and plan recovery operations. Of the many ways in which the US government has previously approached deterrence in the other domains of warfare, this general call to arms is unique to cyberspace and cyber deterrence.\nIn response, scholars of deterrence need to explore the nature and feasibility of non-state cyber deterrence. Cyberspace is not a state-centric environment. On the contrary: states and militaries represent a tiny fraction of all the communities, individuals, and non-state actors that constitute cyberspace. Objects, too, have cyber presence. Projections suggest that 50 billion items -- from smart-homes to smart-cars, and from ‘intelligent' construction materials to wireless medical devices -- will be networked online as part of the IoT through an array of embedded electronics, software and sensors. All to say, the vast majority of interactions and the vast majority of the data created online is non-state in nature. Cyber deterrence theory must move beyond its narrow focus on states to account for the diversity of actors and objects that populate cyberspace. What is the equivalent in cyberspace of businesses, community groups, and homeowners employing storefront lighting, neighbourhood watch programs, and anti-burglary systems to deter physical attacks, theft and robbery? Can non-state actors be agents of their own deterrence in cyberspace?\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.",

In some ways cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine, and policy are developed and put to use even before corresponding theories are properly understood. This article analyses how American cyber deterrence has been implemented over the past two decades in order to inform ongoing debates within the academic study of deterrence, and to provide insights from practice for how cyber deterrence theory can be better conceived and refined.\nWhile President Donald Trump upbraided the previous administration's apparent weakness in cyberspace – ‘We’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing’ – his administration has itself struggled to table a coherent cyber deterrence strategy, despite repeated promises to do so quickly. As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to ‘develop the offensive cyber capabilities we need to deter attacks by both state and non-state actors’. Two weeks following his November 2017 election, President-elect Trump went on to explain further – that he would build ‘a comprehensive plan to protect America’s vital infrastructure against cyberattacks’. And months later still, as President, he signed Executive Order (EO) 13800 in May 2017 – an updated draft of a January 2017 EO that had been scraped at the last minute – on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. The EO describes a plan to reassess all elements of US cybersecurity across and beyond the government. In terms of cyber deterrence specifically, EO 13800 calls on various agencies and departments – including the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security, along with the Director of\nCONTACT Alex S.

A public version of the report eventually appeared in May 2018. $^{5}$\nPresident Trump was also slow to appoint or approve several top-level federal cybersecurity and technology positions – including, notably, Federal Chief Information Security Officer, and the head of DHS's cybersecurity and infrastructure protection division. $^{6}$ These positions are critical to guiding US cybersecurity policy and planning, including in the area of cyber deterrence. Despite all of this, (former) White House Homeland Security advisor, Thomas Bossert – who helped craft cybersecurity policy under US President George W. Bush – revealed in October 2017, that the Trump Administration was determined to eventually publish a new cybersecurity strategy based on EO 13800. $^{7}$ And in his January 2017 Confirmation Hearing, General James Mattis, President Trump's (former) Secretary of Defense, suggested that a comprehensive 'cyber doctrine' might be ready by July 2018. $^{8}$ The new National Cyber Strategy was eventually published in September 2018, after an earlier public summary was held back in May 2018. $^{9}$\nAlthough a US cyber deterrence strategy distinct from a broader cyber doctrine has yet to be established or fully leveraged, bits and pieces of the strategy exist, peppered about in different government departments and agencies. Indeed, US cyber deterrence has evolved a great deal since the mid-2000s. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, to better anticipate where US cyber deterrence is heading in practice by exploring the manner in which it has evolved through different presidential administrations. And second, to trace the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date to explore cyber deterrence in theory.

By the standards of deterrence theory, which has a robust and cumulative pedigree dating back over a century, cyber deterrence is an innovative but imperfectly understood idea. The bulk of the academic literature on cyber deterrence was produced only very recently, over the past fifteen years or so. Moreover, in some important ways, US cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine and policy have been developed, unveiled and put to use even before corresponding theories from academia are properly understood, tested and refined.\nIf practice precedes theory, then a reflection of how this practice progressed over time may help inform theory more broadly. Combined, these circumstances leave scholars with a unique opportunity to evaluate an example of cyber deterrence practice in order to explain and better describe cyber deterrence theory. In methodological terms, this article explores how American cyber deterrence has been implemented in order to better highlight theory more broadly. The United States, by dint of its size, pre-eminence in cyberspace and decades of experience operationalising deterrence theory in other domains, represents a crucial case. Moreover, in empirical terms, the US government openly discusses cybersecurity, and has made various iterations of its cyber deterrence strategy and doctrine publicly available. While a comprehensive US cyber deterrence strategy has yet to be tabled, fragments of the strategy can be patched together, piecemeal, from various US government bodies. A record of thought and practice exists; wading through it provides insights for theory.\nThe article begins with a summary of the academic literature on deterrence theory dating back to the beginning of the Cold War. The rationale here is to outline the nuts and bolts of deterrence theory, highlight conceptual prerequisites, illustrate the many ways deterrence has been operationalised, and briefly assess the ‘four waves' of deterrence scholarship. Next, the article takes a broad look at cyber deterrence theory in particular. The purpose is to discuss the core debates and research clusters embedded within this particular sub-field of the literature. Doing so will provide a theoretical foundation against which the empirical work can be paired against. An exploration of US cyber deterrence then follows. This section will provide a detailed and linear reflection of US cyber deterrence strategy, doctrine and policy stretching back to the early 2000s. The analysis will piece together how US strategy has unfolded and evolved over time, and help identify specific concepts, trends and assumptions baked into strategic\n#\nA. S. WILNER\ndiscourse. Highlights from the US example will then be analysed in the conclusion of the article. The way the United States has put cyber deterrence into practice over time provides lessons and insights for how cyber deterrence theory might be better conceived, approached and refined.\n# Deterrence in theory: Concepts and debates\nDeterrence is an enduring concept. It has repeatedly proven its flexibility in responding to, and evolving from, shifting international and interstate dynamics. Deterrence, at its theoretical core, entails using threats to manipulate an adversary's behaviour.[11] More concretely, it rests on convincing another actor to forgo an unwanted action. Compellence – a related concept – flips the process around, prompting an adversary to pursue an action it might otherwise have avoided. Compellence encourages behaviour, whereas deterrence restrains it. Both are subsumed within the logic of coercion. In all cases of deterrence and compellence, a minimum of two actors are involved. Defenders issue threats to alter an opponent's behaviour; challengers consider these threats, weigh their options, and decide whether or not to acquiesce. In some cases, a third actor is involved. With extended deterrence, for instance, a proxy, partner, or ally is also included in the process, either on the side of the defender or the challenger. Threats of punishment – usually in the form of retaliation – and promises of denial – usually in the form of depriving an adversary the expected benefits of a particular behaviour – form the basis for most deterrent and compellent engagements, though normative and ideological considerations that inform behaviour have also been recently developed within the context of delegitimisation. Each of these three coercive processes is linked to the logic of deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial, and deterrence by delegitimisation, respectively.[12]\nDeterrence works by informing a challenger's cost-benefit calculus. Importantly, it does so by weighing upon another's strategic choice.[13] Militarily crushing an adversary, as Thomas Schelling reminds us, such that it has no alternative but to accept demands made of it is not deterrence, but rather defeat.[14] The same can be said in the realm of denial. Developing a perfect, foolproof defence, while rare, does not deter by denial but rather deters by defeat; an adversary does not penetrate a target or conduct a certain attack because it is prevented from doing so, not because it decides\n[11] Moving beyond theory and strategy, Amir Lupovici contends that deterrence is also an idea, internalized within the identity of those who rely on it. Lupvici, *The Power of Deterrence* (Cambridge 2016).\n[12] On the latter, see for instance, Jerry Mark Long and Alex Wilner, 'Delegitimizing al-Qaida: Defeating an \"Army Whose Men Love Death\"', *International Security* 39/1 (2014).\n[13] Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge: Polity Press 2004), 26.\n[14] Thomas Schelling, *Arms and Influence* (1966), 1–34.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nPut into practice, deterrence theory rests on a number of pre-requisites. First, actors must exhibit a degree of rationality, such that some combination of threats will suffice to alter behaviour. Second, overlapping preferences short of open conflict must be shared by all parties; deterrence requires that adversaries accept the feasibility of non-violence. Third, threats, expected changes in behaviour and a willingness to punish violations must be communicated. Defenders must likewise reassure challengers that threats will not be carried out in the event demands are met. Fourth, defenders must have the perceived capability, and the resolve to punish or deny as threatened. Finally, deterrence works best again a known or suspected adversary; anonymity robs deterrence of its potency.\nBuilding off these prerequisites and core conceptual tenets, deterrence theory has evolved in new and exciting ways over the past several decades. This process of theoretical rejuvenation and praxis has been the result of both changing geostrategic realities (from bipolarity to unipolarity and back, for instance), and because of the emergence of new technology (from nuclear weapons to artificial intelligence) and security domains (including air, space and cyberspace). For illustration of this evolution, consider these various concepts. Central deterrence – which functions to protect a defender's assets – stands against extended (or triadic) deterrence – which functions to protect a third party's assets. Broad deterrence – which deters aggression writ large – stands against narrow deterrence – which deters a specific, and often limited, behaviour. Similarly, general deterrence seeks to\n Alex Wilner, ‘Contemporary Deterrence Theory Counterterrorism: A Bridge too Far?’ NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 47/2 (2015).\n The literature is expansive. For a reference point, consider these various meta-analyses of the empirical record: Anthony Braga and David Weisburd, ‘The Effects of Focused Deterrence Strategies on Crime’, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency 49 (2012); Rob Guerette and Kate Bowers, ‘Assessing the Extent of Crime Displacement and Diffusion of Benefits’, Criminology 47/4 (2009); Trevor Bennett, Katy Holloway, and David Farrington, ‘Does Neighborhood Watch Reduce Crime?’ Journal of Experimental Criminology 2/4 (2006); David Farrington, et al., ‘The Effects of Closed-Circuit Television on Crime’, Journal of Experimental Criminology 3 (2007).\n See, for illustration Kevin Woods and Mark Stout, ‘Saddam’s Perceptions and Misperceptions’, Journal of Strategic Studies 33/1 (2010); Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein, ‘Rational Deterrence Theory: I Think, Therefore I Deter’, World Politics 41/2 (1989); Robert Jervis, Richard Ned Lebow, and Janice Gross Stein, Psychology and Deterrence (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 1985); Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (Random House 2011).\nregulate and uphold accepted, status quo relations, whereas immediate deterrence functions within periods of crisis and against expected anti-status quo behaviour. Intra-war deterrence shapes certain behaviour within an ongoing hot war, after other forms of deterrence have already failed; the goal here is to influence an adversary's warfighting behaviour itself. Cumulative or serial deterrence is iterative; it functions by adding up the effects of repeated coercive interactions. Moving beyond threats, inducements, deflection, dissuasion, entanglement and influence have each been added to deterrence theory, too, broadening the manner in which defenders secure their interests and shape adversarial behaviour.\nWithin IR, deterrence scholarship has evolved within the context of ‘four waves', borrowing insights from other disciplines, namely criminology, terrorism studies, and psychology. The first wave emerged around the end of the Second World War, and corresponded to the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology within a US-dominated strategic backdrop. The second wave began in the early days of the Cold War. US-Soviet dynamics and alliance structures shaped the wave's research agenda, as did the limited proliferation of nuclear weapons to US allies, like France and the UK, and rivals, like China. The second wave used game theory and scientific modelling to explore how rivals could manage nuclear escalation and alliances. Focus was placed on strategic and conventional deterrence by punishment -- and to a much lesser degree on conventional deterrence by denial in Europe and Asia -- and on major power conflict pitting mutually rational and unitary state actors. The third wave began in the 1970s. Its focus was on empiricism, on qualitatively and quantitatively testing the concepts, frameworks and theories previously proposed. Findings suggested the importance of commitment, communication, and resolve in using both central and extended deterrence, and illustrated the variance embedded within the concept of expected utility. The psychology of coercion (e.g. human cognition and thought, bias, fatigue, decision-making, misperception, and error), along with notions of strategic culture, bureaucracy and leadership also emerged.\nThe fourth wave followed the end of the Cold War and continues today. A traditional focus on bipolarity, strategic weapons, and great power rivalries gave way to a diffusion of interests, both between and below state actors. In terms of scholarship, the fourth wave is both especially dynamic, and slightly chaotic: everything and everyone under the sun is in focus. Included here is work on deterring rogue states -- traditionally weak states and militaries often in possession of limited nuclear or chemical and biological weapons, like Iraq, Iran,\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nSerbia, North Korea, Syria, and Libya. $^{19}$  Violent non-state actors have likewise been the focus of fourth wave scholarship, from pirates to ISIS and everyone in between, along with the processes of radicalisation, rebellion, insurgency, and political violence. $^{20}$  And while deterrence in space was a concern during the Cold War, it largely featured a limited number of actors, the US and USSR. But in the fourth wave, space deterrence features new entrants, like India, China, Israel, and private sector actors, including SpaceX and Blue Origin, and rapidly diffusing technology, including new forms of anti-satellite weaponry (ASAT), miniature satellites, and privately owned, reusable mega-rockets. As the scope of deterrence has broadened, so, too, has the practice of deterrence: the logic of denial has been expanded beyond its conventional limits, as has extended deterrence. $^{21}$  And altogether novel concepts, like cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace, have been proposed and tested. $^{22}$\n# Cyber deterrence in theory: Core research clusters\nResearch on cyber deterrence is largely rooted to the classical literature on deterrence stemming from IR.

The 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace defines it as a 'nervous system' or 'control system' for US critical infrastructure, comprised of 'hundreds of thousands of interconnected computers, servers, routers, switches, and fiber optic cables'. The 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations later defined cyberspace as a 'domain', characterized by 'the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures'. And in a 2008 memo, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England defined cyberspace as 'a global domain', consisting of 'the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'. While definitions of cyberspace continue to evolve, for the purposes of this paper, cyberspace is understood as a global, interconnected domain constituting hardware, digital data, and related infrastructrue in which electronic devices are used to create, save and disseminate information. The phrase 'cyber deterrence' also lacks a precise definition. At its broadest, cyber deterrence is a field of study - as deterring terrorism might be thought of - that involves applying and exploring the logic, theory, and practice of deterrence within cyberspace. More narrowly, cyber deterrence might be understood as the deterrence of attacks within or using cyberspace, or conversely, the use of cyberspace to accomplish deterrence in other domains. This paper relies on the broader definition but highlights the narrow use of the term where necessary.\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nThe largest cluster explores the manner in which the prerequisites of IR deterrence apply to cyberspace. By these standards some scholars conclude that the architecture of cyberspace – anonymity, complexity, interconnectivity, jurisdictional diffusion, open access – makes cyber deterrence inherently weak.[24] The fundamental prerequisites are not easily met. Herein, the attribution dilemma receives greatest attention.[25] The ease of digital obfuscation,[26] complexity of 'multi-stage' cyberattacks,[27] difficulty in signalling or communicating threats and deterrent capabilities,[28] and challenge of uncovering the physical source of a cyberattack,[29] can complicate how defenders construct and communicate credible coercive threats. If cyber adversaries believe that their identities are protected, retaliatory threats will fall short. A range of tentative solutions have been proposed. More sophisticated attribution capabilities, processes, and standards might be developed.[30] Or, the Internet could be reengineered as an attributed network.[31] Or, sources of a cyberattack might be better deduced weighing known capabilities, interests, and motivation of likely adversaries.[32] Or, third party enablers of cyberattacks (i.e., owners of cyber infrastructure, and other private sector actors) might be held better accountable.[33] Or, the threshold of 'certain identification' when contemplating retaliation can be lowered.[34] Still other authors illustrate how cyber attribution is not, in fact, as potent a\n24The Economist (Benjamin Sutherland, ed.)

A paradox emerges: technologically advanced states are both the most able to conduct offensive cyberattacks, and the most susceptible to such attacks. Weak states and non-state adversaries with fewer cyber platforms, conversely, have less to fear from cyberwar and much to gain by escalating a confrontation to digital space, where they may have advantages over traditionally stronger powers. That asymmetry may destabilise cyber deterrence. Skirting this particular paradox may involve combining cyber threats with more traditional kinetic and non-kinetic threats, effectively adding military punishment, law enforcement, diplomatic and financial sanctions, and public shaming to the cyber mix. This cross-domain deterrent approach addresses cyber credibility by tackling on traditional forms of retaliation to the equation. Robert Mandel suggests further that defenders use ‘unorthodox’ means to enhance the potency of their deterrence in cyberspace, including, for instance, ‘subtle political and diplomatic pressure on cyberattackers or their supporters, sponsor or patrons’, like public exposure, reputational embarrassment, shaming, condemnation, embassy closures, expulsion and other forms of humiliation. Some authors caution, though, that skipping between the digital and physical (or kinetic) realms risks escalating a conflict in unanticipated ways. Other experts counter that some cyberattacks, like those that disrupt financial or political systems by degrading software or targeting data rather than hardware, are unlikely to escalate to the kinetic domain at all. Still others argue that cyber and\n Glaser, ‘Deterrence’; Will Goodman, ‘Cyber Deterrence’, Strategic Studies Quarterly, 2010; Lindsay, ‘Tipping’; Ben Buchanan, The Cybersecurity Dilemma (Oxford 2016), 145; Joseph Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, International Security 41/3 (2017), 51–52.\n Richard Harknett, et. al. ‘Leaving Deterrence Behind’, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management 7/1 (2010); Adam Liff, ‘Cyberwar: A New “Absolute Weapon?”’ Journal of Strategic Studies 35/3 (2012).\n Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Paul Rosenzweig, ‘The Organization of the United States Government and Private Sector for Achieving Cyber Deterrence’, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2010); Mike McConnell, ‘Cyberwar is the New Atomic Age’, New Perspectives Quarterly 26/3 (2009); James Adams, ‘Virtual Defense’, Foreign Affairs 80/3 (2001); Martin Libicki, Conquest in Cyberspace (Cambridge 2007), Chapter 11; Libicki, Cyberdeterrence (2009), Chapter Three; Libicki, ‘Cyberwar as a Confidence Game’, Strategic Studies Quarterly (Spring 2011); Martin Libicki, Cyberspace in Peace and War (Naval Institute Press 2016), Chapter 16 &amp; 17; Harknett, ‘Information Warfare’.\n James Lewis, ‘Cross-Domain Deterrence and Credible Threats’, CSIS Working Paper (July 2010); Jon Lindsay and Erik Gartzke (eds.), Cross-Domain Deterrence (under review 2018); Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff, ‘Cyberwar’; Herbert Lin, ‘Laying an Intellectual Foundation for Cyberdeterrence’, in Kruger et al., (eds.), The Secure Information Society (Springer-Verlag 2013).\n Mandel, Optimizing, 199–201.\n Lewis ‘Cross-Domain’; Anthony Cordesman and Justin Cordesman, Cyberthreats, Information Warfare, and Critical Infrastructure Protection (Praeger 2002), Chapter One; Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff ‘Cyberwar’; Lin ‘Laying’.\n Harknett et al., ‘Leaving’; Rid ‘Cyber War’; Thomas Rid, ‘More Attacks, Less Violence’, Journal of Strategic Studies 36/1 (2013).\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nkinetic deterrence are not intrinsically separate: they intersect, compliment, and influence each other, such that retaliation in cyberspace may have unintended side-effects in non-cyber domains, like in international finance and diplomacy.[42] Conversely, successful deterrence in one domain may trigger deterrence failure in another, as occurs when successful kinetic deterrence compels an adversary to shift to cyberattacks.[43]\nA second research cluster centres on whether cyberspace favours offensive behaviour over defensive behaviour.[44] For instance, while the number of cyber targets grows exponentially and the process of safeguarding them more complex, the ease of conducting cyberattacks remains relatively stable and inexpensive. Nor can defenders expect forewarning of an imminent cyberattack, eliminating their ability to mount an immediate deterrent response. On the contrary: cyberattacks often go unnoticed, for months, even years. Other forms of cyberattack that rely on the logic of strategic surprise, Jim Writz warns, may compel a weaker adversary to present a traditionally strong defender, like the United States, with a 'fait accompli', such that the defender then faces the prospects of a costly response in returning to the status quo.[45] And traditional factors that mitigate offensive power in other domains of warfare – like the geographic distance between adversaries or resilient offensive weapons, including second strike capabilities – are much less evident in cyberwarfare, favouring intruders over defenders.[46] Relatedly, the sheer number of potential cyber adversaries complicates coercive calculations, creating a potential asymmetry in intent, capability, and resolve that favors aggressors.[47] Indeed, cyberspace augments the destructive power of weaker actors, including small, sub-state and non-sate networks.[48] Some authors conclude that cyber deterrence is a 'mirage', and that a warfighting framework is the only way to address 'cyberaggression'.[49] Still, other scholars caution against alarmism, noting that\n42Amir Lupovici, 'The \"Attribution Problem\" and the Social construction of \"Violence\"', International Studies Perspectives 17/3 (2016); Goodman, 'Cyber Deterrence'; Ronald Deibert and Rafal Rohozinkis, 'Risking Security', International Political Sociology 4 (2010); Joseph Nye, 'Cyber Power', Belfer Center, Harvard Kennedy School Working Paper, 2011.\n43Jon Lindsay, 'Stuxnet and the Limits of Cyber Wafare', Security Studies 22/3 (2013).\n44John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!'

Frustrating the preparation phase of a cyberattack may be especially valuable.[53] Associated concepts like cyber resilience or resistance, in which compromised digital systems continue to function, or adapt and heal themselves, may further augment cyber denial.[54] However, some scholars retort that adversaries incur very low costs when their cyberattacks fail, especially when attribution is uncertain, and are able to continue trying, even unsuccessfully, without incurring further costs, suggesting that denial, decoupled from attribution and punishment, may provide few coercive benefits.[55] A fourth and final subset of the literature explores whether norms, regimes, and stigmatisation might delegitimise certain cyberattacks and shape individual and collective behaviour accordingly.[56] For example, Joseph Nye, borrowing logic developed for intra-war deterrence during the Cold War that deterred the use of certain weapons,\n\nlike chemical and nuclear weapons, suggests that with cyberspace, a similar ‘taboo' might be constructed against certain types of cyberattack during peacetime, like those targeting civilian infrastructure and private sector facilities.\nIn sum, although a growing body of new literature explores the nuance and complexity of applying deterrence theory to cyber conflict, there is yet a great deal of division among scholars. Multiple poles within the research community exist. And much of the field is a conceptual extension of the literature on cyber warfare. Conflating warfare and deterrence makes a certain amount of sense given that deterrence is often a consequence of projecting military power. Yet this development has skewed the nascent literature on cyber deterrence in particular ways. First, IR deterrence is favoured, to the exclusion of the literature derived from criminology, psychology or other domains that have informed previous deterrence debates. Second, deterrence by punishment is overemphasised, such that denial, dissuasion, influence, delegitimisation and other concepts are often overlooked. Third, state actors figure prominently, to the near exclusion of the role non- and sub-state actors might have in deterring attacks in cyberspace. The coercive leverage of non-state cyber actors is rarely considered. Fourth, deterring high-end cyber threats dominates the research agenda. Deterring the far more common attributes of cyber insecurity, like cyber-crime, identity and property theft, data breaches and exfiltration, hacking (DDOS, malware, spear/phishing, whaling, ransomware), digital espionage, sabotage, bullying, and other concerns, goes largely unexplored. Fifth, policy prescription seems to dominate, while theoretical, methodological and empirical developments lag behind. Properly situating cyber deterrence within the larger IR literature, or within strategic studies, or political science, is wanting. Finally, few empirical evaluations of cyber deterrence have taken place, with the exceptions largely focusing on digital coercion among states actively involved in armed conflict.\nWhat follows is an exploration of how US cyber deterrence in practice has evolved over the past decades; lessons therein will help inform our theoretical understanding of how deterrence theory and cyberspace interact.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nAmerican cybersecurity strategy dates back to 2003, with the publication under President George W. Bush of the first standalone strategic document on cybersecurity – The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. [Figure 1 provides a timeline of relevant US cyber deterrence and cyber security doctrine.] At its core, the strategy is guided by three objectives: preventing cyberattacks against critical infrastructure; reducing vulnerability to cyberattacks; and mitigating damage from cyberattacks. The document further defines the distinct roles and responsibilities held by different cyber actors – from individual-level users of cyberspace, to institutions, businesses, and innovators, and the critical infrastructure sectors. ‘Protecting the widely distributed assets of cyberspace’, the strategy reads, ‘requires the efforts of many Americans. The federal government alone cannot sufficiently defend America’s cyberspace’. It also describes the national and international issues and concerns that require US Government leadership, including, for instance, building a national response system that identifies threats, promotes information exchange, advises on remediation, diminishes cyber vulnerabilities, and establishes international initiatives and multilateral endeavours with other states and non-state partners to collaboratively bolster cybersecurity at the global level.\nIn terms of deterrence specifically, the strategy weds various aspects of denial and punishment together, though the latter is mostly focused on domestic criminal prosecution. For illustration, at the local-level, touting roles for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the 2003 strategy lays bare the utility of using detection, apprehension, and prosecution of cyber-criminals (at home and, if possible, abroad) as a way to punish violations of domestic and international law. Here, some aspects of cyber aggression are treated to the logic of criminological deterrence (e.g., swift, certain and severe punishment). Bush’s 2003 National Strategy does not, however, overtly address cyber punishment or retaliation among states or at the international level. Only the oblique suggestion that the US response ‘need not be limited to criminal prosecution’, and that the US ‘reserves the right to respond in an appropriate manner’, hint at any larger retaliatory global strategy. While these pronouncements may have been obligatory, for the purposes of coercion they are also inherently weak. As the\nThe 2003 document was, however, preceded by several antecedent publications that outlined how the US envisioned cybersecurity, including, a Clinton-era Presidential Commission report (1997) and a 2000 National Plan on information security.

US cyber deterrence strategy timeline.\nprerequisites of deterrence theory suggest, deterrence works best when threats are clearly communicated and credible.\nIn terms of deterrence by denial, the 2003 National Strategy links mitigating the effects of cyberattacks, building less-vulnerable cyber systems and fostering cybersecurity awareness among all Americans, as a way to limit the feasibility and utility of conducting cyberattacks, making them less attractive as a result. Herein, the Strategy builds off preliminary recommendations President Bush established previously in 2001 in EO 13231 that provided\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nIndeed, Obama's legacy is marked by the rise of cyber offensive measures in US cyber deterrence doctrine.67 Upon taking office in January 2009, Obama ordered a review of US cybersecurity efforts, which largely subsumed an earlier review launched by President Bush in 2008, during his last year of office – the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) as developed by National Security Presidential Directive 54.68 The CNCI, started by Bush and completed by Obama as part of his Cyber Space Policy Review, broadened the scope of cyber security beyond what had been defined in the 2003 Strategy. CNCI established a dozen tasks for the US\n\nto accomplish over the coming years, including, at number 10: ‘define and develop enduring deterrence strategies and programs'. Though several sections of Presidential Directive 54 are redacted, what is left includes specific provisions relating to the roles the Department of Defence (DoD) and the US Intelligence Community have in securing, and deterring attacks within, cyberspace. For instance, the FBI was to establish the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, which would coordinate and integrate information from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), the US Secret Service, and other agencies, to augment criminal investigation and prosecution both in the US and overseas. DHS, with an assist from various other departments, was to establish the National Cybersecurity Center, to improve coordination in protecting and defending US Government communication, cyber, and information networks. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was instructed to develop a ‘cyber counterintelligence plan' to augment the 2007 National Counterintelligence Strategy (which mentioned ‘cyber' only a handful of times). The Secretaries of State, Defense, Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the DNI were to develop, jointly, a plan ‘for the coordination and application of offensive capabilities to defend U.S. information systems'. And, most importantly for our purposes, several agencies were called upon to ‘define and develop a comprehensive and coordinating strategy to deter interference and attacks in cyberspace'. Obama reiterated this latter goal in 2009 when he expanded the CNCI's objective. ‘Senior policymakers', the White House warned, ‘must think through the long-range strategic options available to the United States'. Cyber deterrence rested on improving ‘warning capabilities', articulating ‘roles for private sector and international partners', and developing ‘appropriate responses for both state and non-state actors'.\nObama moved quickly to implement and showcase the new US cyber deterrence posture. He began in 2009 by creating and filling a new position, the Executive Branch Cybersecurity Coordinator (aka, the White House cyber czar). Howard Schmidt, a former head of security at Microsoft, was tapped for the role, tasked with harmonising the various strategies and efforts that were being explored and enacted across the US government. Within the same year, the Department of Defense, in partnership with the NSA, established US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM, or Cybercom). Subordinate to US Strategic Command, housed at the NSA, and led by the director of the NSA, Cybercom was to use NSA networks to protect DoD computer and\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nDoD's cyber posture was initially defined in a relatively short 2011 document, DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, which built off the May 2010 National Security Strategy and February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The document provides five strategic initiatives relating to cyberspace, including that DoD will treat cyberspace as an 'operational domain' of warfare, and will 'organize, train, and equip' itself to 'take full advantage of cyberspace's potential'.[73] The core of DoD's new cyber offensive posture is Cybercom's 133 Cyber Mission Force (CMF) teams. Each team is tasked with supporting a specific component of DoD's comprehensive cyber mission. For example, twenty-seven distinct 'Combat Mission' teams provide 'cyberspace effects' in support of military and operational plans.[74] Other 'National Mission' and 'Protection Force' teams defend DoD and public networks and infrastructure by 'seeing adversary activity, blocking attacks, and maneuvering to defeat them'.[75] A subsequent 2011 DoD report provided to Congress, DoD Cyberspace Policy Report, provides much greater detail as to how the Pentagon's evolving cyber posture provides a cyber deterrent effect. The report clearly relates offensive cyber capabilities with deterrence: 'should the \"deny objectives\" element of deterrence not prove adequate, DoD maintains ... the ability to respond militarily in cyberspace and in other domains ... using cyber and/or kinetic capabilities'.[76] The report also highlights several other cyber deterrent issues and dilemmas the US will continue to face. They included: i) how to develop a US 'declaratory deterrence posture for cyberspace'; ii) the ways in which DoD will address the 'attribution' dilemma inherent to cyber deterrence by building 'cyber forensic capabilities' and 'behavior-based algorithms' for tracing the source of a cyberattack; iii) the dilemma DoD faces in demonstrating cyber capabilities and communicating plans for deterrent purposes without revealing sensitive tools, intelligence or techniques; and iv) how DoD will 'maintain control' of cyber escalation in times of crisis and war.\nThis last dilemma was subsequently tackled in a 2013 DoD Task Force Report, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, produced by the Defense Science Board. The report is perhaps most notable for openly suggesting that DoD cyber deterrence be anchored to offensive capabilities up to and including nuclear retaliation in the event of 'existential cyber attack'. The 2013 report goes on to chastise Obama's 2010 National\n\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nPosture Review (NPR) – which provided the President with guidance in nuclear policy – because it did ‘not explicitly mention’ and otherwise remained ‘essentially silent on [the] relationship between the U.S. nuclear deterrent … and the domain of cyber warfare’.77 Navy Admiral Michael Rogers, the chief of Cybercom and director of the NSA, later repurposed the nuclear analogy in his March 2015 testimony before the Senate Committee on Armed Services. ‘I liken our historical moment’, Rogers argued, ‘to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the [t]riad [sic] and underpinned by … policy structures including a declared deterrence posture’. On cyber offense, Rogers continues, the US must ‘commit time, effort, and resources to understanding our historical situation and building cyber military capabilities’.78 A month following Rogers’ testimony, DoD published The DoD Cyber Strategy (2015) its first such strategic document.\nThe 2015 Strategy enshrined Cybercom's expanding offensive purpose. The document, an expansive overview of cyberwarfare and cyber defence, helps guide the development and use of the CMF teams, going quite a distance in illustrating their ability, purpose, and potency. The document also defines deterrence by emphasising punishment, rather than denial, in cyberspace: 'The United States will continue to respond to cyberattacks against U.S. interests at a time, in a manner, and in a place of our choosing, using appropriate instruments of U.S. power'. By October 2016, all of Cybercom's CMF teams reached initial operating capability, translating into a force of roughly 6,000 cyber-warriors. A little over a year later, in January 2018, Cyber Command's headquarters - Joint Force Headquarters Department of Defense Information Network (JFHQ-DODIN) - itself became fully operational.\nSeparately, DoD again tasked the Defense Science Board to sharpen US cyber deterrence options, policy, and strategy, especially in the realm of deterrence by punishment. The DSB Task Force on Cyber Deterrence was established in October 2014; it published its final report in February 2017. Asked to explore the 'requirements for effective deterrence of cyber attacks' against the United States and its allies, and to identify digital and non-digital capabilities 'needed to support deterrence, war-fighting, and escalation control against a highly cyber-capable adversary', the Task Force focused\n77DoD Defense Science Board, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, 2013, 41.

The DSB makes several important suggestions. First, it introduces the term ‘deterrence by cost imposition' to replace the more commonly used term deterrence by punishment. The rationale, it would seem, is to broaden punishment's scope in keeping with the emerging logic of cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace. ‘Cost imposition' better captures the kinetic, diplomatic, economic, law enforcement, and digital forms of punishment that the US might use in responding to cyberattacks and exploitations. Second, the DSB bridges the divide between denial and punishment in cyberspace. ‘DoD must create a second-strike cyber resilient “Thin Line”' of critical US offensive systems (cyber, nuclear and conventional) and related infrastructure in order to ensure that the US can credibly threaten retaliation in response to a potentially crippling cyber first strike. Good defence and resilience feeds into the potency and certainty of threats of punishment. Third, the DSB affirms, rather bluntly, the continued asymmetry between offense and defence in cyberspace. ‘The unfortunate reality', the 2017 DSB report reads, ‘is that, for at least the coming five to ten years, the offensive cyber capabilities of our most capable potential adversaries are likely to far exceed the United Sates' ability to defend and adequately strengthen the resilience of its critical infrastructures'. US cyber offense, then, is needed to correct the perceptions of asymmetry between defenders and challengers. Finally, the DSB links cyber deterrence to reputation, past and future. It warns that not responding to a cyberattack -- once, presumably, US cyber deterrence has failed -- is, with ‘near-certainty ... an invitation to follow-on cyber attacks'. In sum, the DSB Task Force solidifies the primary role offense will have in US cyber deterrence posture and strategy of the emerging decades.\nWith its offensive building blocks in place, the US, first under President Obama and later, under President Trump, began flexing its cyber muscle. It surreptitiously destroyed centrifuges in Iran, sabotaging and delaying the country's nuclear weapons program. It explored using cyberspace to dismantle Libya's air defences leading up to the March 2011 military intervention. The US likewise targeted and sabotaged North Korea's missile development program. Elsewhere, Cybercom was charged with attacking ISIS's online presence and capability in support of US and coalition plans to degrade and defeat the terrorist organisation, and to digitally augment related kinetic operations in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. The US is thought to have also used cyberspace to retaliate against North Korea following its 2014 hack on Sony Pictures. Other forms of punishment were meted out by\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nthe Justice Department. New cyber attribution capabilities allowed DOJ, in 2014, 2016, and 2018 to indict over a dozen Chinese military hackers, seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel, and another two private Iranian citizens for stealing US intellectual property, computer hacking, and launching ransomware attacks, and several Russian military intelligence officers for a string of hacks targeting the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and sporting and anti-doping agencies in the US, Canada and Europe. Via EO 13687, President Obama likewise imposed additional sanctions on North Korea in January 2015 in direct response to the Sony Hack.[84] Finally, in his last days in office, President Obama sanctioned and expelled Russian nationals for their role in hacking the 2016 presidential election. Another 13 Russian nationals and three companies were subsequently charged by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of Special Council Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian's meddling in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Russia was again fingered by American and British officials in April 2018 for targeting and exploiting network infrastructure devices, like routers, for purposes of espionage.[85] The coercive message, all told, is that the US has developed the capability to trace and attribute cyberattacks conducted against it and its allies, and to launch punitive measures in cyberspace and across domains in response.\nIn hand with this shift towards cyber punishment, Obama also developed US declaratory posture for cyberspace and helped establish international norms for cyber engagement. From a deterrence perspective, it is not enough to simply have the tools to harm an adversary: you also need to establish and communicate red lines against which acts of retaliation will be measured. Norms that help identify what is and is not acceptable behaviour in cyberspace further solidify retaliatory threats. Obama's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace is the backbone of this process. 'The digital world is no longer a lawless frontier', President Obama's opening statement to the document reads, 'it is a place where the norms of responsible, just, and peaceful conduct among states and people have begun to take hold'.[86] The strategy outlines how the US would provide leadership in establishing global norms for cyber behaviour. The US State Department, for instance, went on to establish the world's first Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues (S/CCI) in February 2011, dedicated to coordinating the Department's diplomatic work on cyber and developing international cyber rules. Some 20\n84For an exploration of how and why North Korea's hack manipulated Sony's behaviour, which ultimately triggered the US response, see Travis Sharp, 'Theorizing Cyber Coercion: The 2014 North Korean Operation against Sony', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/7 (2017).\n85UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Joint US-UK Statement on Malicious Cyber Activity Carried out by Russian Government', 16 April 2018; UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Advisory: Russian Statesponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices', 16 April 2018.\n86The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace, 2011, 3.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nThe Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues was also instrumental in assisting a UN Group of Government Experts (GGE) establish a rudimentary list of cyber norms in 2015 (though the GGE failed in 2017 to subsequently link those norms to recommendations embedded in international law).88 In terms of cyber deterrence, the 2011 Strategy illustrates that the US will continue to bolster denial – redubbed here as ‘dissuasion’ – to deter attacks, but also strongly signals its ‘right to self-defense’ in conducting cyber retaliation. The US, the document reads, ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any threat to our country … and we recognize that certain hostile acts … could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic’.89 In line with these strategic pronouncements, the Obama Administration tried to make a distinction between cyber espionage for the purposes of statecraft – which was deemed legitimate – and cyber espionage, theft, and attack for the purposes of economic or domestic disruption and infrastructure destruction – all deemed illegitimate. Thus, on the one hand, China’s 2015 exfiltration of over 20 million personnel records from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was deemed ‘not an attack’ by James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, but rather good espionage; ‘[we] would have done the same thing’.90 But on the other hand, Russia’s 2015/16 hack, manipulation, and leak of Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee data during the 2016 presidential election was deemed by CIA Director, John Brennan, as a ‘new level of malicious activity’ meant to undermine and influence the institution of US democracy.91 In January 2017,\n\n#\nA. S. WILNER\ntwo weeks before Trump's inauguration, DHS took the unprecedented step of classifying 'election infrastructure' as a critical infrastructure subsector, providing it with priority protection within the NIPP.[92]\nWhile the Trump Administration's cyberspace and cyber deterrence strategies are still being patched together, given the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date, and given what we know about Trump's leanings in international affairs, three things are likely to occur under his watch.\nFirst, threats of cyber retaliation and the logic of deterrence by punishment will continue to grow in importance. Pentagon officials have long sought more leeway from congress to engage in cyber offense. In 2017, Admiral Rogers, Cybercom's chief, lamented that 'offensive cyber is almost treated like nuclear weapons, in the sense that their application ... is controlled at the chief executive level and not delegated down. What I would like to see, over the next five to 10 years', is that US cyber weapons are viewed 'as another tool for the commanders' at the tactical level.[93] Signaling his acceptance of Rogers' position, President Trump, in August 2017, initiated the elevation of Cybercom to the status of a Unified Combatant Command (a step long-debated, but never taken, under Obama).[94] The transition places Cybercom at par with other unified commands, like US Strategic Command or US European Command, establishing a direct line of communication between Cybercom's director and the Secretary of Defense. And a year later, in August 2018, President Trump rescinded a 2012 Obama-era directive - Presidential Policy Directive 20 - that governed the manner in which cyberattacks were approved.[95] The reversal loosens the (somewhat onerous) restrictions that Obama had placed on conducting offensive cyber operations.\nFurthermore, Trump's February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (the first tabled since 2010), goes to some length in closing the cross-domain gap between nuclear weapons, nuclear retaliation, and cyber deterrence. Just as DoD's aforementioned Defense Science Board report recommended in 2013, the 2018 NPR expands the scope conditions that might lead to a US nuclear response as a result of a cyberattack. While US nuclear retaliation will continue to be reserved for 'extreme circumstances', the 2018 NPR significantly broadens these circumstances themselves to include 'significant non-nuclear strategic attacks', on 'civilian population or infrastructure'. Read:\n92Department of Homeland Security, 'Statement by Secretary Jeh Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector', 6 January 2017.\n93Cheryl Pellerin, 'Rogers Discusses near Future of U.S. Cyber Command', DoD News, 24 February 2017.\n94Separately, in February 2018, the White House signaled its intention to nominate Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone as Rogers' replacement at the helm of the NSA and Cybercom. The White House, Statement by President Donald J. Trump on the Elevation of Cyber Command, 18 August 2017; Chris Bing, 'White House Official: Paul Nakasone Nominated for NSA Director', CyberScoop, 13 February 2018.\n95Sean Lyngass, 'PPD-20 Elimination opens arguments over how US should Conduct Offensive Hacking Operations', CyberScoop, 16 August 2018.\ncrippling cyberattack. Additionally, perhaps cognizant that technology risks advancing more quickly than strategic policy, the NPR further warns that ‘the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of non-nuclear strategic attack technologies and U.S. capabilities to counter that threat'. Lest anyone misinterpret the document, DoD simultaneously published the NPR's Executive Summary in several languages, including Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Russian.\nThe logic of all of this was rolled into the State Department's ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats', a three-page brief published in May 2018 in direct response to EO 13800, and DoD's new Cyber Strategy, published in September 2018. The ‘Recommendations' report suggests that existing efforts at deterrence in cyberspace are ‘necessary but not sufficient': ‘network defense alone' is not enough. Calling for a ‘fundamental rethinking' of existing frameworks and a ‘new US vision' for cyber deterrence, the report recommends the development of a ‘broader menu of consequences' that the US can impose against state and non-state actors below ‘the threshold of the use of force'. With reference to the perennial issues of attribution and coercive credibility, the document calls for the US to openly demonstrate its ability to identify threats by imposing ‘swift, costly, and transparent consequences' on adversaries. Action will stand for credibility and might have ‘downstream deterrence effects'. Cyber offense is likewise paramount in DoD's 2018 Cyber Strategy. While the strategy itself is not publicity available, a 7-page summary is. And while this new strategy supersedes DoD's 2015 Strategy it compliments DoD's 2018 National Defense Strategy and the 2017 National Security Strategy. The document warns specific adversaries that the US will ‘build a more lethal force', conduct pre-emptive operations, ‘prepare for war', and collect cyber intelligence so as to field the ‘military cyber capabilities' the US needs to ‘defend forward'. A fuzzy term, defending forward implies terminating attacks at their (foreign) source, and ‘leveraging [US] focus outward to stop threats before they reach their targets'. By persistently engaging cyber competitors and aggressors on a daily basis, and by employing the Pentagon's full range of offensive capabilities, the US, the Strategy submits, will deter malicious cyber activities over time.\nSecond, and somewhat relatedly, under Trump, non-state actors may be encouraged to conduct cyber punishment and cyber offense themselves. The idea is to permit victims of cyber aggression and crime -- companies,\nA. S. WILNER\ninstitutions, NGOs, and individuals – to ‘hack back’ or counterattack via ‘active defense’ against their perpetrators. Under the current US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, it is illegal for individuals to gain entry into another’s computer system without permission. Though several US tech firms, including Google and Microsoft, have voiced concerns, Congress has nonetheless explored exceptions as part of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (first proposed in March 2017), and Georgia’s General Assembly passed a bill (later vetoed by the Governor) that would have made provisions for non-state active defence in cyberspace. Despite the controversy, some companies, including major US banks, have been reported to have surveyed the utility of hack backs to protect their servers, data, and assets. In a telling episode, Bossert, the former White House security advisor, and Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra, the chief cybersecurity official at DHS, heaped rare praise on Facebook and Microsoft during their lengthy December 2017 press-briefing in which the US officially blamed North Korea for conducting the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks. The attacks encrypted data on hundreds of thousands of public and private sector computers in over 150 countries. ‘We applaud our corporate partners’, Bossert asserted, ‘for acting on their own initiative … without any direction by the U.S. government … to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers. They shut down accounts … used to launch attacks and patched systems’. The destructive power and frequency of cyber hacking only grew under Obama. This trend will continue under Trump. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and wirelessly tethered Internet of Things (IoT) devices, along with new types of malicious activity like ransomware and sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, both of which can now be bought and sold on the Dark Web, will reshape the cyber threat landscape for individuals, communities, NGOs, and public and private-sector actors. Under the right conditions, non-state hack backs and other disruptive actions – the twenty-first century’s version of digital vigilantism – may prove useful for establishing a whole-of-society – rather than a whole-of-government – US cyber deterrence doctrine.\nFinally, in keeping with Trump’s general weariness of multilateralism and the United Nations in particular, the US is likely to downplay its role in establishing global cyber norms and focus instead on communicating its own red lines and bolstering the cyber deterrent posture of like-mined allied\nZaid Shoorbajee, ‘Google and Microsoft ask Georgia Governor to Veto “Hack Back” Bill’, *CyberScoop*, 27 April 2018; Ryan Johnston, ‘After Widespread outcry, Georgia Governor Vetoes “Hack Back” Bill’, *State Scoop*, 8 May 2018.\nDan Lohrmann, ‘Hack Back Law’, *Government Technology*, September 2017; Nicholas Schmidle, ‘The Digital Vigilantes who Hack Back’, *New Yorker*, 7 May 2018.\nThe White House, ‘Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea’, 19 December 2017.\nBruce Schneier, ‘Botnets of Things’, *MIT Technology Review*, March/April 2017.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nstates. The 2018 'Recommendations' report, for illustration, calls on the US to first establish criteria for US retaliation and to then communicate the policy both 'publicly and privately' so as to generate a deterrent effect. Separately, Trump shuttered the State Department's cyber coordinator's office, effectively degrading America's role in UN negotiations, though the Administration did test the waters for restarting the process of norm building in October 2018, following a ministerial meeting with US allies.[103] What appears more certain, however, is that the US is likely to seek bilateral cyber relations with other states and groups of states. At the Cyber Week 2017 gathering in Israel in June, for instance, the ever-present Bossert announced the US-Israel bilateral cyber working group – which was to be led by White House cyber czar, Rob Joyce, before his departure and the elimination his position – signalling Washington's preference for establishing cyber coalitions of the willing. '[W]e must', Bossert warned, 'hold those who violate [cyber] norms accountable. This may not be achievable through a UN effort. Likeminded states should work to develop options for imposing consequences within a coalition structure'.[104] In a similar vein, the US, in partnership with the UK, Germany and other NATO allies, aims to establish cyber warfare principles for 2019.[105] And, as the White House articulates in its 2018 Cyber Strategy, the US has plans to build a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative' that will convene a coalition of 'like-minded states' that can collectively develop 'tailored strategies' and jointly impose 'consequences against malign actors'.[106]\n# Conclusion: Evolution in theory\nUS cyber deterrence has come a long way since 2003. Definitions of deterrence – and core concepts linked to punishment and denial – have been revisited, reconceptualised, and broadened in scope. New government positions, institutions, agencies, and organisations have been created, staffed, trained, and tasked with operationalising core concepts. New technology, including software and hardware, has been developed and deployed. Partnerships across the US government, the private sector, and civil society have been established. And allies and international organisations have been leveraged. The footprints of all of these changes are evident in the record: US strategic doctrine allows us to trace the direction of this evolution. From a theoretical perspective, the way in which US cyber deterrence has been adapted since its inception provides\n103Sean Lyngaas, 'US Looks to Restart Talks on Global Cyber Norms', CyberScoop, October 2018.\n104The White House, 'Remarks by Homeland Security Advisor Thomas P. Bossert at Cyber Week 2017', 26 June 2017.\n105Robin Emmott, 'NATO mulls \"Offensive Defense\" with Cyber Warfare Rules', Reuters, 30 November 2017.\n\nscholars with insight as to how deterrence theory itself might respond to the promises and paradoxes of cyber deterrence. Several lessons stand out.\nFirst, US cyber deterrence has shifted from an almost exclusive focus on defence and deterrence by denial under President Bush to a punishment-based strategy under Presidents Obama and Trump. Part of the reason threats of retaliation and ‘deterrence by cost imposition' are currently emphasised is that recent technological advancements have allowed the US to improve its ability to monitor cyberattacks, identify perpetrators, and administer retaliatory actions, both within and outside cyberspace. Simply put, punishment strategies are increasingly feasible. Technological advancements have led to the adoption and use of new offensive coercive strategies. If so, theorists themselves should better situate technology into their own work of deterrence. How might the prerequisites of deterrence theory, and the concepts derived from them, adapt to novel, emerging, and disruptive technology within and beyond cyberspace?\nSecond, and relatedly, a separate reason US cyber punishment strategies have come to overshadow denial strategies has to do with the perception that deterrence by denial is not working, or rather, that the threat of denial used alone and separately from the threat of punishment, is not working. The number, severity and complexity of cyberattacks targeting US government and private sector facilities and assets has continued to rise over the past 15 years despite the US government's communicated threat of defence and denial. In response, US doctrine and strategy has evolved such that punishment is being used hand-in-glove with denial. For illustration, synchronising their efforts to defend the 2018 US midterm elections, DoD-DHS collaboration saw the former (via Cyber Command) target Russian operatives overseas to disrupt their actions all the while the latter worked with social media companies to counter disinformation. In practice, the two approaches reinforce each other. Recalibrating the effect punishment and denial have on each other in practice, suggests that theories of deterrence must better relate how the logic of punishment augments, or otherwise corresponds to, the logic of denial. Too often punishment and denial are considered poles apart, distinct levers applied separately to the cost-benefit calculus that underpins rational behaviour and coercion. In theory, how do punishment and denial relate and overlap; in cyberspace when does one stop and the other start?\nThird, the US has come to equate attribution as a distinct form of punishment that appears logically linked to denial. In fielding a question during the 2017 WannaCry press briefing, Bossert suggested, for instance, that ‘it's not about holding a country accountable; it's about simple culpability. We've determined who was behind the [WannaCry] attack, and we're saying it. ...\nWe're going to hold them accountable ... And we're going to shame them for it. ... And I think it's going to improve our security'. By identifying North Korea, the US denied it the benefit of anonymity in cyberspace; by publically outing North Korea, the US put the regime on notice for future punishment. From a theoretical perspective, however, attribution is largely understood as a mechanism, a crucial step that allows a defender to retaliate by identifying a challenger, rather than as a functional punishment in its own right. If so, and in light of perceptual changes in practice, deterrence theory must better explore whether, how, and under what conditions public attribution -- and the threat of shaming -- function as a source of cyber deterrence at the different levels of analysis. How might public and private attribution of an attack deter, coerce, or otherwise influence individual, non-state, and state cyber challengers?\nFourth, US cyber deterrence is not chiefly about military coercion. Notwithstanding Cybercom's emerging role in providing the US government with offensive and military options to punish cyber aggressors globally, US cyber deterrence strategy has emphasised the importance of several other departments and agencies, including DOJ, DHS, FBI, State Department and various others, for both denying and punishing cyberattacks. The goal is to equip the US government with as wide a set of coercive levers as possible, crossing domains as needed, to provide a truly whole of government approach to cybersecurity and cyber deterrence. The role of the DOJ (and the FBI by extension) is especially enlightening. By publicly indicting foreign nationals for cyberattacks conducted on American computer systems, the US government underscores the fact that contemporary cyber deterrence transcends traditional defence policy and military doctrine. By establishing the DOJ as a core pillar of its punishment strategy, the US signals its intention to use criminal justice tools to deter not just criminal attacks but attacks conducted by nation state adversaries. In doing so, the US further blurs the line between state institutions and individuals, by sanctioning the latter for actions they perpetrated while working for or on behalf of foreign governments, militaries, or intelligence agencies. For deterrence theory, the burgeoning role non-military and non-kinetic coercion have had in US cyber deterrence posture suggests that academics must redouble their efforts at multidisciplinarity. Academic silos still exist in the manner in which deterrence theory is developed and tested. To some degree, deterrence from within IR theory is privileged over that stemming from criminology, psychology, and terrorism and intelligence studies. This is especially the case when it comes to deterrence in national security and international affairs. Though the fourth wave of deterrence scholarship has gone to\nsome length to bridge the disciplinary divide, more cross-fertilisation is needed among disciplines to better reflect and speak to developments taking place in practice. What theoretical lessons do non-IR approaches to deterrence hold for how IR theories of cyber deterrence are developed and improved?\nFifth, US cyber deterrence is not solely about states, either. Rather, non-state actors figure prominently in American strategic doctrine as both potential perpetrators of cyberattacks targeting US infrastructure, and, more importantly for our purposes, as potential partners that amplify US cyber deterrence. For instance, private sector and individual victims of cyberattack share information, voluntarily, about attacks with law enforcement and intelligence. This provides governments with a better understanding of the nature, prevalence and evolution of certain types of attack, which can lead to improvements in defence and denial. In other cases, as highlighted by Facebook, Microsoft, and Marcus Hutchins -- a private British citizen who noticed a ‘kill switch' within WannaCry's code and took action to temporarily shut the attack down -- non-state actors can track and impede attacks without government oversight, further denying perpetrators the fruits of their labour. In still other cases, non-state actors, including companies, individuals, academics, NGOs, and other such groups, can augment US cyber security and deterrence by denial efforts by practicing better cyber hygiene -- i.e. updating passwords or patching software. This functions to further deny challengers easy opportunities to conduct successful attacks. On this front, Washington is exploring how it might compel (or, even, demand) private sector partners, contractors, and suppliers to do more to defend and secure their own networks, data and assets, as a precondition for working with and on behalf of the US government. In February 2018, for instance, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, in discussing the 2018 National Defense Strategy at a conference, warned that DoD wanted the cyber security ‘bar to be set so high, it will become the condition of doing business' with the Pentagon; for industry, cybersecurity will be ‘foundational to business with DoD'. The point, in this case, is to develop a whole of society deterrence posture, rather than simply a whole of government approach. The logic of all of this goes back to a statement made in President Bush's opening letter to the first 2003 cybersecurity strategy, oft repeated since: ‘Securing cyberspace is an extraordinarily difficult strategic challenge that requires a coordinated and focused effort from our entire society -- the federal government, state and local governments, the private sector, and the American people'. ‘Every American', the strategy continues ‘who can contribute to securing part of cyberspace is encouraged\nto do so. The federal government invites the creation of, and participation in, public-private partnerships to raise cybersecurity awareness, train personnel, stimulate market forces, improve technology, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, exchange information and plan recovery operations. Of the many ways in which the US government has previously approached deterrence in the other domains of warfare, this general call to arms is unique to cyberspace and cyber deterrence.\nIn response, scholars of deterrence need to explore the nature and feasibility of non-state cyber deterrence. Cyberspace is not a state-centric environment. On the contrary: states and militaries represent a tiny fraction of all the communities, individuals, and non-state actors that constitute cyberspace. Objects, too, have cyber presence. Projections suggest that 50 billion items -- from smart-homes to smart-cars, and from ‘intelligent' construction materials to wireless medical devices -- will be networked online as part of the IoT through an array of embedded electronics, software and sensors. All to say, the vast majority of interactions and the vast majority of the data created online is non-state in nature. Cyber deterrence theory must move beyond its narrow focus on states to account for the diversity of actors and objects that populate cyberspace. What is the equivalent in cyberspace of businesses, community groups, and homeowners employing storefront lighting, neighbourhood watch programs, and anti-burglary systems to deter physical attacks, theft and robbery? Can non-state actors be agents of their own deterrence in cyberspace?\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.",

      "# Deterrence in theory: Concepts and debates Deterrence is an enduring concept. It has repeatedly proven its flexibility in responding to, and evolving from, shifting international and interstate dynamics. Deterrence, at its theoretical core, entails using threats to manipulate an adversary's behaviour.[11] More concretely, it rests on convincing another actor to forgo an unwanted action. Compellence – a related concept – flips the process around, prompting an adversary to pursue an action it might otherwise have avoided. Compellence encourages behaviour, whereas deterrence restrains it. Both are subsumed within the logic of coercion. In all cases of deterrence and compellence, a minimum of two actors are involved. Defenders issue threats to alter an opponent's behaviour; challengers consider these threats, weigh their options, and decide whether or not to acquiesce. In some cases, a third actor is involved. With extended deterrence, for instance, a proxy, partner, or ally is also included in the process, either on the side of the defender or the challenger. Threats of punishment – usually in the form of retaliation – and promises of denial – usually in the form of depriving an adversary the expected benefits of a particular behaviour – form the basis for most deterrent and compellent engagements, though normative and ideological considerations that inform behaviour have also been recently developed within the context of delegitimisation. Each of these three coercive processes is linked to the logic of deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial, and deterrence by delegitimisation, respectively.[12] Deterrence works by informing a challenger's cost-benefit calculus. Importantly, it does so by weighing upon another's strategic choice.[13] Militarily crushing an adversary, as Thomas Schelling reminds us, such that it has no alternative but to accept demands made of it is not deterrence, but rather defeat.[14] The same can be said in the realm of denial. Developing a perfect, foolproof defence, while rare, does not deter by denial but rather deters by defeat; an adversary does not penetrate a target or conduct a certain attack because it is prevented from doing so, not because it decides [11] Moving beyond theory and strategy, Amir Lupovici contends that deterrence is also an idea, internalized within the identity of those who rely on it.

By these standards some scholars conclude that the architecture of cyberspace – anonymity, complexity, interconnectivity, jurisdictional diffusion, open access – makes cyber deterrence inherently weak.[24] The fundamental prerequisites are not easily met. Herein, the attribution dilemma receives greatest attention.[25] The ease of digital obfuscation,[26] complexity of 'multi-stage' cyberattacks,[27] difficulty in signalling or communicating threats and deterrent capabilities,[28] and challenge of uncovering the physical source of a cyberattack,[29] can complicate how defenders construct and communicate credible coercive threats. If cyber adversaries believe that their identities are protected, retaliatory threats will fall short. A range of tentative solutions have been proposed. More sophisticated attribution capabilities, processes, and standards might be developed.[30] Or, the Internet could be reengineered as an attributed network.[31] Or, sources of a cyberattack might be better deduced weighing known capabilities, interests, and motivation of likely adversaries.[32] Or, third party enablers of cyberattacks (i.e., owners of cyber infrastructure, and other private sector actors) might be held better accountable.[33] Or, the threshold of 'certain identification' when contemplating retaliation can be lowered.[34] Still other authors illustrate how cyber attribution is not, in fact, as potent a 24The Economist (Benjamin Sutherland, ed.)

      "# A. S. WILNER kinetic deterrence are not intrinsically separate: they intersect, compliment, and influence each other, such that retaliation in cyberspace may have unintended side-effects in non-cyber domains, like in international finance and diplomacy.[42] Conversely, successful deterrence in one domain may trigger deterrence failure in another, as occurs when successful kinetic deterrence compels an adversary to shift to cyberattacks.[43] A second research cluster centres on whether cyberspace favours offensive behaviour over defensive behaviour.[44] For instance, while the number of cyber targets grows exponentially and the process of safeguarding them more complex, the ease of conducting cyberattacks remains relatively stable and inexpensive. Nor can defenders expect forewarning of an imminent cyberattack, eliminating their ability to mount an immediate deterrent response. On the contrary: cyberattacks often go unnoticed, for months, even years. Other forms of cyberattack that rely on the logic of strategic surprise, Jim Writz warns, may compel a weaker adversary to present a traditionally strong defender, like the United States, with a 'fait accompli', such that the defender then faces the prospects of a costly response in returning to the status quo.[45] And traditional factors that mitigate offensive power in other domains of warfare – like the geographic distance between adversaries or resilient offensive weapons, including second strike capabilities – are much less evident in cyberwarfare, favouring intruders over defenders.[46] Relatedly, the sheer number of potential cyber adversaries complicates coercive calculations, creating a potential asymmetry in intent, capability, and resolve that favors aggressors.[47] Indeed, cyberspace augments the destructive power of weaker actors, including small, sub-state and non-sate networks.[48] Some authors conclude that cyber deterrence is a 'mirage', and that a warfighting framework is the only way to address 'cyberaggression'.[49] Still, other scholars caution against alarmism, noting that 42Amir Lupovici, 'The\"Attribution Problem\"and the Social construction of\"Violence\"', International Studies Perspectives 17/3 (2016); Goodman, 'Cyber Deterrence'; Ronald Deibert and Rafal Rohozinkis, 'Risking Security', International Political Sociology 4 (2010); Joseph Nye, 'Cyber Power', Belfer Center, Harvard Kennedy School Working Paper, 2011."

WILNER Posture Review (NPR) – which provided the President with guidance in nuclear policy – because it did ‘not explicitly mention’ and otherwise remained ‘essentially silent on [the] relationship between the U.S. nuclear deterrent … and the domain of cyber warfare’.77 Navy Admiral Michael Rogers, the chief of Cybercom and director of the NSA, later repurposed the nuclear analogy in his March 2015 testimony before the Senate Committee on Armed Services. ‘I liken our historical moment’, Rogers argued, ‘to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the [t]riad [sic] and underpinned by … policy structures including a declared deterrence posture’. On cyber offense, Rogers continues, the US must ‘commit time, effort, and resources to understanding our historical situation and building cyber military capabilities’.78 A month following Rogers’ testimony, DoD published The DoD Cyber Strategy (2015) its first such strategic document."

Wilner Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada # ABSTRACT When compared to advancements in conceptualising deterrence in other domains, cyber deterrence is still in it messy infancy. In some ways cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine, and policy are developed and put to use even before corresponding theories are properly understood. This article analyses how American cyber deterrence has been implemented over the past two decades in order to inform ongoing debates within the academic study of deterrence, and to provide insights from practice for how cyber deterrence theory can be better conceived and refined.\nWhile President Donald Trump upbraided the previous administration's apparent weakness in cyberspace – ‘We’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing’ – his administration has itself struggled to table a coherent cyber deterrence strategy, despite repeated promises to do so quickly.¹ As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to ‘develop the offensive cyber capabilities we need to deter attacks by both state and non-state actors’.² Two weeks following his November 2017 election, President-elect Trump went on to explain further – that he would build ‘a comprehensive plan to protect America’s vital infrastructure against cyberattacks’.³ And months later still, as President, he signed Executive Order (EO) 13800 in May 2017 – an updated draft of a January 2017 EO that had been scraped at the last minute – on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. The EO describes a plan to reassess all elements of US cybersecurity across and beyond the government. In terms of cyber deterrence specifically, EO 13800 calls on various agencies and departments – including the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security, along with the Director of CONTACT Alex S.

S. WILNER National Intelligence – to jointly submit a report ‘on the Nation’s strategic options for deterring adversaries’ in cyberspace. The report was to be submitted within 90 days (August 2017). A public version of the report eventually appeared in May 2018. \nPresident Trump was also slow to appoint or approve several top-level federal cybersecurity and technology positions – including, notably, Federal Chief Information Security Officer, and the head of DHS's cybersecurity and infrastructure protection division. These positions are critical to guiding US cybersecurity policy and planning, including in the area of cyber deterrence. Despite all of this, (former) White House Homeland Security advisor, Thomas Bossert – who helped craft cybersecurity policy under US President George W. Bush – revealed in October 2017, that the Trump Administration was determined to eventually publish a new cybersecurity strategy based on EO 13800. And in his January 2017 Confirmation Hearing, General James Mattis, President Trump's (former) Secretary of Defense, suggested that a comprehensive 'cyber doctrine' might be ready by July 2018. The new National Cyber Strategy was eventually published in September 2018, after an earlier public summary was held back in May 2018. \nAlthough a US cyber deterrence strategy distinct from a broader cyber doctrine has yet to be established or fully leveraged, bits and pieces of the strategy exist, peppered about in different government departments and agencies. Indeed, US cyber deterrence has evolved a great deal since the mid-2000s. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, to better anticipate where US cyber deterrence is heading in practice by exploring the manner in which it has evolved through different presidential administrations. And second, to trace the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date to explore cyber deterrence in theory. When compared to theoretical advancements in conceptualising and implementing deterrence in other domains, including, The White House, Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical infrastructure, 11 May 2017.\nUS Department of State, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats’, 31 May 2018.\nJoseph Marks, ‘Many Top Cybersecurity Posts Remain Empty – and Not on Purpose’, DefenseOne, 10 November 2017; Mohana Ravindranath, ‘Many CFO Act federal Agencies are Still being Lead by Acting Chief Information Officers’, Nextgov, 17 November 2017.\nIn a moment of further intrigue, Bossert resigned his post in April 2018, on the request of John Bolton, Trump’s newly-appointed national security advisor. Bossert’s departure was followed a week later by Rob Joyce’s, the White House cybersecurity coordinator. President Trump later eliminated Joyce’s position altogether, in May 2018.

By the standards of deterrence theory, which has a robust and cumulative pedigree dating back over a century, cyber deterrence is an innovative but imperfectly understood idea. The bulk of the academic literature on cyber deterrence was produced only very recently, over the past fifteen years or so. Moreover, in some important ways, US cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine and policy have been developed, unveiled and put to use even before corresponding theories from academia are properly understood, tested and refined.\nIf practice precedes theory, then a reflection of how this practice progressed over time may help inform theory more broadly. Combined, these circumstances leave scholars with a unique opportunity to evaluate an example of cyber deterrence practice in order to explain and better describe cyber deterrence theory. In methodological terms, this article explores how American cyber deterrence has been implemented in order to better highlight theory more broadly. The United States, by dint of its size, pre-eminence in cyberspace and decades of experience operationalising deterrence theory in other domains, represents a crucial case. Moreover, in empirical terms, the US government openly discusses cybersecurity, and has made various iterations of its cyber deterrence strategy and doctrine publicly available. While a comprehensive US cyber deterrence strategy has yet to be tabled, fragments of the strategy can be patched together, piecemeal, from various US government bodies. A record of thought and practice exists; wading through it provides insights for theory.\nThe article begins with a summary of the academic literature on deterrence theory dating back to the beginning of the Cold War. The rationale here is to outline the nuts and bolts of deterrence theory, highlight conceptual prerequisites, illustrate the many ways deterrence has been operationalised, and briefly assess the ‘four waves' of deterrence scholarship. Next, the article takes a broad look at cyber deterrence theory in particular. The purpose is to discuss the core debates and research clusters embedded within this particular sub-field of the literature. Doing so will provide a theoretical foundation against which the empirical work can be paired against. An exploration of US cyber deterrence then follows. This section will provide a detailed and linear reflection of US cyber deterrence strategy, doctrine and policy stretching back to the early 2000s. The analysis will piece together how US strategy has unfolded and evolved over time, and help identify specific concepts, trends and assumptions baked into strategic # A. S. WILNER discourse. Highlights from the US example will then be analysed in the conclusion of the article. The way the United States has put cyber deterrence into practice over time provides lessons and insights for how cyber deterrence theory might be better conceived, approached and refined.",
    "# Deterrence in theory: Concepts and debates Deterrence is an enduring concept. It has repeatedly proven its flexibility in responding to, and evolving from, shifting international and interstate dynamics. Deterrence, at its theoretical core, entails using threats to manipulate an adversary's behaviour.[11] More concretely, it rests on convincing another actor to forgo an unwanted action. Compellence – a related concept – flips the process around, prompting an adversary to pursue an action it might otherwise have avoided. Compellence encourages behaviour, whereas deterrence restrains it. Both are subsumed within the logic of coercion. In all cases of deterrence and compellence, a minimum of two actors are involved. Defenders issue threats to alter an opponent's behaviour; challengers consider these threats, weigh their options, and decide whether or not to acquiesce. In some cases, a third actor is involved. With extended deterrence, for instance, a proxy, partner, or ally is also included in the process, either on the side of the defender or the challenger. Threats of punishment – usually in the form of retaliation – and promises of denial – usually in the form of depriving an adversary the expected benefits of a particular behaviour – form the basis for most deterrent and compellent engagements, though normative and ideological considerations that inform behaviour have also been recently developed within the context of delegitimisation. Each of these three coercive processes is linked to the logic of deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial, and deterrence by delegitimisation, respectively.[12] Deterrence works by informing a challenger's cost-benefit calculus. Importantly, it does so by weighing upon another's strategic choice.[13] Militarily crushing an adversary, as Thomas Schelling reminds us, such that it has no alternative but to accept demands made of it is not deterrence, but rather defeat.[14] The same can be said in the realm of denial. Developing a perfect, foolproof defence, while rare, does not deter by denial but rather deters by defeat; an adversary does not penetrate a target or conduct a certain attack because it is prevented from doing so, not because it decides [11] Moving beyond theory and strategy, Amir Lupovici contends that deterrence is also an idea, internalized within the identity of those who rely on it. Lupvici, *The Power of Deterrence* (Cambridge 2016).": "[12] On the latter, see for instance, Jerry Mark Long and Alex Wilner, 'Delegitimizing al-Qaida: Defeating an\"Army Whose Men Love Death\"', *International Security* 39/1 (2014).\n[13] Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge: Polity Press 2004), 26.\n[14] Thomas Schelling, *Arms and Influence* (1966), 1–34.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES Put into practice, deterrence theory rests on a number of pre-requisites. First, actors must exhibit a degree of rationality, such that some combination of threats will suffice to alter behaviour. Second, overlapping preferences short of open conflict must be shared by all parties; deterrence requires that adversaries accept the feasibility of non-violence. Third, threats, expected changes in behaviour and a willingness to punish violations must be communicated. Defenders must likewise reassure challengers that threats will not be carried out in the event demands are met. Fourth, defenders must have the perceived capability, and the resolve to punish or deny as threatened. Finally, deterrence works best again a known or suspected adversary; anonymity robs deterrence of its potency.\nBuilding off these prerequisites and core conceptual tenets, deterrence theory has evolved in new and exciting ways over the past several decades. This process of theoretical rejuvenation and praxis has been the result of both changing geostrategic realities (from bipolarity to unipolarity and back, for instance), and because of the emergence of new technology (from nuclear weapons to artificial intelligence) and security domains (including air, space and cyberspace). For illustration of this evolution, consider these various concepts. Central deterrence – which functions to protect a defender's assets – stands against extended (or triadic) deterrence – which functions to protect a third party's assets. Broad deterrence – which deters aggression writ large – stands against narrow deterrence – which deters a specific, and often limited, behaviour. Similarly, general deterrence seeks to ¹⁵ Alex Wilner, ‘Contemporary Deterrence Theory Counterterrorism: A Bridge too Far?’ NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 47/2 (2015).\n¹⁶ The literature is expansive. For a reference point, consider these various meta-analyses of the empirical record: Anthony Braga and David Weisburd, ‘The Effects of Focused Deterrence Strategies on Crime’, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency 49 (2012); Rob Guerette and Kate Bowers, ‘Assessing the Extent of Crime Displacement and Diffusion of Benefits’, Criminology 47/4 (2009); Trevor Bennett, Katy Holloway, and David Farrington, ‘Does Neighborhood Watch Reduce Crime?’ Journal of Experimental Criminology 2/4 (2006); David Farrington, et al., ‘The Effects of Closed-Circuit Television on Crime’, Journal of Experimental Criminology 3 (2007).\n¹⁷ See, for illustration Kevin Woods and Mark Stout, ‘Saddam’s Perceptions and Misperceptions’, Journal of Strategic Studies 33/1 (2010); Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein, ‘Rational Deterrence Theory: I Think, Therefore I Deter’, World Politics 41/2 (1989); Robert Jervis, Richard Ned Lebow, and Janice Gross Stein, Psychology and Deterrence (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 1985); Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (Random House 2011).\nregulate and uphold accepted, status quo relations, whereas immediate deterrence functions within periods of crisis and against expected anti-status quo behaviour. Intra-war deterrence shapes certain behaviour within an ongoing hot war, after other forms of deterrence have already failed; the goal here is to influence an adversary's warfighting behaviour itself. Cumulative or serial deterrence is iterative; it functions by adding up the effects of repeated coercive interactions. Moving beyond threats, inducements, deflection, dissuasion, entanglement and influence have each been added to deterrence theory, too, broadening the manner in which defenders secure their interests and shape adversarial behaviour.\nWithin IR, deterrence scholarship has evolved within the context of ‘four waves', borrowing insights from other disciplines, namely criminology, terrorism studies, and psychology. The first wave emerged around the end of the Second World War, and corresponded to the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology within a US-dominated strategic backdrop. The second wave began in the early days of the Cold War. US-Soviet dynamics and alliance structures shaped the wave's research agenda, as did the limited proliferation of nuclear weapons to US allies, like France and the UK, and rivals, like China. The second wave used game theory and scientific modelling to explore how rivals could manage nuclear escalation and alliances. Focus was placed on strategic and conventional deterrence by punishment -- and to a much lesser degree on conventional deterrence by denial in Europe and Asia -- and on major power conflict pitting mutually rational and unitary state actors. The third wave began in the 1970s. Its focus was on empiricism, on qualitatively and quantitatively testing the concepts, frameworks and theories previously proposed. Findings suggested the importance of commitment, communication, and resolve in using both central and extended deterrence, and illustrated the variance embedded within the concept of expected utility. The psychology of coercion (e.g. human cognition and thought, bias, fatigue, decision-making, misperception, and error), along with notions of strategic culture, bureaucracy and leadership also emerged.\nThe fourth wave followed the end of the Cold War and continues today. A traditional focus on bipolarity, strategic weapons, and great power rivalries gave way to a diffusion of interests, both between and below state actors. In terms of scholarship, the fourth wave is both especially dynamic, and slightly chaotic: everything and everyone under the sun is in focus. Included here is work on deterring rogue states -- traditionally weak states and militaries often in possession of limited nuclear or chemical and biological weapons, like Iraq, Iran, THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # Serbia, North Korea, Syria, and Libya. Violent non-state actors have likewise been the focus of fourth wave scholarship, from pirates to ISIS and everyone in between, along with the processes of radicalisation, rebellion, insurgency, and political violence. And while deterrence in space was a concern during the Cold War, it largely featured a limited number of actors, the US and USSR. But in the fourth wave, space deterrence features new entrants, like India, China, Israel, and private sector actors, including SpaceX and Blue Origin, and rapidly diffusing technology, including new forms of anti-satellite weaponry (ASAT), miniature satellites, and privately owned, reusable mega-rockets. As the scope of deterrence has broadened, so, too, has the practice of deterrence: the logic of denial has been expanded beyond its conventional limits, as has extended deterrence. And altogether novel concepts, like cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace, have been proposed and tested.",
    "# Cyber deterrence in theory: Core research clusters Research on cyber deterrence is largely rooted to the classical literature on deterrence stemming from IR. Several thematic clusters populate the cyber deterrence literature.[23] T. V. Paul, Patrick M. Morgan, and James J.

Deterring Terrorism (Stanford 2012); Alex Wilner, Deterring Rational Fanatics (Penn Press 2015); Daniel Sobelman, 'Learning to Deter', International Security 41/3 (2016/17).\n21Alex Wilner and Andreas Wenger (eds.)

The 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace defines it as a 'nervous system' or 'control system' for US critical infrastructure, comprised of 'hundreds of thousands of interconnected computers, servers, routers, switches, and fiber optic cables'. The 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations later defined cyberspace as a 'domain', characterized by 'the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures'. And in a 2008 memo, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England defined cyberspace as 'a global domain', consisting of 'the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'. While definitions of cyberspace continue to evolve, for the purposes of this paper, cyberspace is understood as a global, interconnected domain constituting hardware, digital data, and related infrastructrue in which electronic devices are used to create, save and disseminate information. The phrase 'cyber deterrence' also lacks a precise definition. At its broadest, cyber deterrence is a field of study - as deterring terrorism might be thought of - that involves applying and exploring the logic, theory, and practice of deterrence within cyberspace. More narrowly, cyber deterrence might be understood as the deterrence of attacks within or using cyberspace, or conversely, the use of cyberspace to accomplish deterrence in other domains. This paper relies on the broader definition but highlights the narrow use of the term where necessary.",
    "# A. S. WILNER The largest cluster explores the manner in which the prerequisites of IR deterrence apply to cyberspace. By these standards some scholars conclude that the architecture of cyberspace – anonymity, complexity, interconnectivity, jurisdictional diffusion, open access – makes cyber deterrence inherently weak.[24] The fundamental prerequisites are not easily met. Herein, the attribution dilemma receives greatest attention.[25] The ease of digital obfuscation,[26] complexity of 'multi-stage' cyberattacks,[27] difficulty in signalling or communicating threats and deterrent capabilities,[28] and challenge of uncovering the physical source of a cyberattack,[29] can complicate how defenders construct and communicate credible coercive threats. If cyber adversaries believe that their identities are protected, retaliatory threats will fall short. A range of tentative solutions have been proposed. More sophisticated attribution capabilities, processes, and standards might be developed.[30] Or, the Internet could be reengineered as an attributed network.[31] Or, sources of a cyberattack might be better deduced weighing known capabilities, interests, and motivation of likely adversaries.[32] Or, third party enablers of cyberattacks (i.e., owners of cyber infrastructure, and other private sector actors) might be held better accountable.[33] Or, the threshold of 'certain identification' when contemplating retaliation can be lowered.[34] Still other authors illustrate how cyber attribution is not, in fact, as potent a 24The Economist (Benjamin Sutherland, ed.)

Weak states and non-state adversaries with fewer cyber platforms, conversely, have less to fear from cyberwar and much to gain by escalating a confrontation to digital space, where they may have advantages over traditionally stronger powers. That asymmetry may destabilise cyber deterrence.³⁷ Skirting this particular paradox may involve combining cyber threats with more traditional kinetic and non-kinetic threats, effectively adding military punishment, law enforcement, diplomatic and financial sanctions, and public shaming to the cyber mix. This cross-domain deterrent approach addresses cyber credibility by tackling on traditional forms of retaliation to the equation.³⁸ Robert Mandel suggests further that defenders use ‘unorthodox’ means to enhance the potency of their deterrence in cyberspace, including, for instance, ‘subtle political and diplomatic pressure on cyberattackers or their supporters, sponsor or patrons’, like public exposure, reputational embarrassment, shaming, condemnation, embassy closures, expulsion and other forms of humiliation.³⁹ Some authors caution, though, that skipping between the digital and physical (or kinetic) realms risks escalating a conflict in unanticipated ways.⁴⁰ Other experts counter that some cyberattacks, like those that disrupt financial or political systems by degrading software or targeting data rather than hardware, are unlikely to escalate to the kinetic domain at all.⁴¹ Still others argue that cyber and ³⁵ Glaser, ‘Deterrence’; Will Goodman, ‘Cyber Deterrence’, Strategic Studies Quarterly, 2010; Lindsay, ‘Tipping’; Ben Buchanan, The Cybersecurity Dilemma (Oxford 2016), 145; Joseph Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, International Security 41/3 (2017), 51–52.\n³⁶ Richard Harknett, et. al. ‘Leaving Deterrence Behind’, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management 7/1 (2010); Adam Liff, ‘Cyberwar: A New “Absolute Weapon?”’ Journal of Strategic Studies 35/3 (2012).\n³⁷ Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Paul Rosenzweig, ‘The Organization of the United States Government and Private Sector for Achieving Cyber Deterrence’, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2010); Mike McConnell, ‘Cyberwar is the New Atomic Age’, New Perspectives Quarterly 26/3 (2009); James Adams, ‘Virtual Defense’, Foreign Affairs 80/3 (2001); Martin Libicki, Conquest in Cyberspace (Cambridge 2007), Chapter 11; Libicki, Cyberdeterrence (2009), Chapter Three; Libicki, ‘Cyberwar as a Confidence Game’, Strategic Studies Quarterly (Spring 2011); Martin Libicki, Cyberspace in Peace and War (Naval Institute Press 2016), Chapter 16 &amp; 17; Harknett, ‘Information Warfare’.\n³⁸ James Lewis, ‘Cross-Domain Deterrence and Credible Threats’, CSIS Working Paper (July 2010); Jon Lindsay and Erik Gartzke (eds.), Cross-Domain Deterrence (under review 2018); Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff, ‘Cyberwar’; Herbert Lin, ‘Laying an Intellectual Foundation for Cyberdeterrence’, in Kruger et al., (eds.), The Secure Information Society (Springer-Verlag 2013).\n³⁹ Mandel, Optimizing, 199–201.\n⁴⁰ Lewis ‘Cross-Domain’; Anthony Cordesman and Justin Cordesman, Cyberthreats, Information Warfare, and Critical Infrastructure Protection (Praeger 2002), Chapter One; Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff ‘Cyberwar’; Lin ‘Laying’.\n⁴¹ Harknett et al., ‘Leaving’; Rid ‘Cyber War’; Thomas Rid, ‘More Attacks, Less Violence’, Journal of Strategic Studies 36/1 (2013).",
    "# A. S. WILNER kinetic deterrence are not intrinsically separate: they intersect, compliment, and influence each other, such that retaliation in cyberspace may have unintended side-effects in non-cyber domains, like in international finance and diplomacy.[42] Conversely, successful deterrence in one domain may trigger deterrence failure in another, as occurs when successful kinetic deterrence compels an adversary to shift to cyberattacks.[43] A second research cluster centres on whether cyberspace favours offensive behaviour over defensive behaviour.[44] For instance, while the number of cyber targets grows exponentially and the process of safeguarding them more complex, the ease of conducting cyberattacks remains relatively stable and inexpensive. Nor can defenders expect forewarning of an imminent cyberattack, eliminating their ability to mount an immediate deterrent response. On the contrary: cyberattacks often go unnoticed, for months, even years. Other forms of cyberattack that rely on the logic of strategic surprise, Jim Writz warns, may compel a weaker adversary to present a traditionally strong defender, like the United States, with a 'fait accompli', such that the defender then faces the prospects of a costly response in returning to the status quo.[45] And traditional factors that mitigate offensive power in other domains of warfare – like the geographic distance between adversaries or resilient offensive weapons, including second strike capabilities – are much less evident in cyberwarfare, favouring intruders over defenders.[46] Relatedly, the sheer number of potential cyber adversaries complicates coercive calculations, creating a potential asymmetry in intent, capability, and resolve that favors aggressors.[47] Indeed, cyberspace augments the destructive power of weaker actors, including small, sub-state and non-sate networks.[48] Some authors conclude that cyber deterrence is a 'mirage', and that a warfighting framework is the only way to address 'cyberaggression'.[49] Still, other scholars caution against alarmism, noting that 42Amir Lupovici, 'The\"Attribution Problem\"and the Social construction of\"Violence\"', International Studies Perspectives 17/3 (2016); Goodman, 'Cyber Deterrence'; Ronald Deibert and Rafal Rohozinkis, 'Risking Security', International Political Sociology 4 (2010); Joseph Nye, 'Cyber Power', Belfer Center, Harvard Kennedy School Working Paper, 2011.": "43Jon Lindsay, 'Stuxnet and the Limits of Cyber Wafare', Security Studies 22/3 (2013).\n44John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!'

Frustrating the preparation phase of a cyberattack may be especially valuable.[53] Associated concepts like cyber resilience or resistance, in which compromised digital systems continue to function, or adapt and heal themselves, may further augment cyber denial.[54] However, some scholars retort that adversaries incur very low costs when their cyberattacks fail, especially when attribution is uncertain, and are able to continue trying, even unsuccessfully, without incurring further costs, suggesting that denial, decoupled from attribution and punishment, may provide few coercive benefits.[55] A fourth and final subset of the literature explores whether norms, regimes, and stigmatisation might delegitimise certain cyberattacks and shape individual and collective behaviour accordingly.[56] For example, Joseph Nye, borrowing logic developed for intra-war deterrence during the Cold War that deterred the use of certain weapons, like chemical and nuclear weapons, suggests that with cyberspace, a similar ‘taboo' might be constructed against certain types of cyberattack during peacetime, like those targeting civilian infrastructure and private sector facilities.\nIn sum, although a growing body of new literature explores the nuance and complexity of applying deterrence theory to cyber conflict, there is yet a great deal of division among scholars. Multiple poles within the research community exist. And much of the field is a conceptual extension of the literature on cyber warfare. Conflating warfare and deterrence makes a certain amount of sense given that deterrence is often a consequence of projecting military power. Yet this development has skewed the nascent literature on cyber deterrence in particular ways. First, IR deterrence is favoured, to the exclusion of the literature derived from criminology, psychology or other domains that have informed previous deterrence debates. Second, deterrence by punishment is overemphasised, such that denial, dissuasion, influence, delegitimisation and other concepts are often overlooked. Third, state actors figure prominently, to the near exclusion of the role non- and sub-state actors might have in deterring attacks in cyberspace. The coercive leverage of non-state cyber actors is rarely considered. Fourth, deterring high-end cyber threats dominates the research agenda. Deterring the far more common attributes of cyber insecurity, like cyber-crime, identity and property theft, data breaches and exfiltration, hacking (DDOS, malware, spear/phishing, whaling, ransomware), digital espionage, sabotage, bullying, and other concerns, goes largely unexplored. Fifth, policy prescription seems to dominate, while theoretical, methodological and empirical developments lag behind. Properly situating cyber deterrence within the larger IR literature, or within strategic studies, or political science, is wanting. Finally, few empirical evaluations of cyber deterrence have taken place, with the exceptions largely focusing on digital coercion among states actively involved in armed conflict.\nWhat follows is an exploration of how US cyber deterrence in practice has evolved over the past decades; lessons therein will help inform our theoretical understanding of how deterrence theory and cyberspace interact.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\nAmerican cybersecurity strategy dates back to 2003, with the publication under President George W. Bush of the first standalone strategic document on cybersecurity – The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.⁶⁰ [Figure 1 provides a timeline of relevant US cyber deterrence and cyber security doctrine.] At its core, the strategy is guided by three objectives: preventing cyberattacks against critical infrastructure; reducing vulnerability to cyberattacks; and mitigating damage from cyberattacks. The document further defines the distinct roles and responsibilities held by different cyber actors – from individual-level users of cyberspace, to institutions, businesses, and innovators, and the critical infrastructure sectors. ‘Protecting the widely distributed assets of cyberspace’, the strategy reads, ‘requires the efforts of many Americans. The federal government alone cannot sufficiently defend America’s cyberspace’.⁶¹ It also describes the national and international issues and concerns that require US Government leadership, including, for instance, building a national response system that identifies threats, promotes information exchange, advises on remediation, diminishes cyber vulnerabilities, and establishes international initiatives and multilateral endeavours with other states and non-state partners to collaboratively bolster cybersecurity at the global level.\nIn terms of deterrence specifically, the strategy weds various aspects of denial and punishment together, though the latter is mostly focused on domestic criminal prosecution. For illustration, at the local-level, touting roles for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the 2003 strategy lays bare the utility of using detection, apprehension, and prosecution of cyber-criminals (at home and, if possible, abroad) as a way to punish violations of domestic and international law. Here, some aspects of cyber aggression are treated to the logic of criminological deterrence (e.g., swift, certain and severe punishment). Bush’s 2003 National Strategy does not, however, overtly address cyber punishment or retaliation among states or at the international level. Only the oblique suggestion that the US response ‘need not be limited to criminal prosecution’, and that the US ‘reserves the right to respond in an appropriate manner’, hint at any larger retaliatory global strategy.⁶² While these pronouncements may have been obligatory, for the purposes of coercion they are also inherently weak. As the\n⁶⁰The 2003 document was, however, preceded by several antecedent publications that outlined how the US envisioned cybersecurity, including, a Clinton-era Presidential Commission report (1997) and a 2000 National Plan on information security.

US cyber deterrence strategy timeline.\nprerequisites of deterrence theory suggest, deterrence works best when threats are clearly communicated and credible.\nIn terms of deterrence by denial, the 2003 National Strategy links mitigating the effects of cyberattacks, building less-vulnerable cyber systems and fostering cybersecurity awareness among all Americans, as a way to limit the feasibility and utility of conducting cyberattacks, making them less attractive as a result. Herein, the Strategy builds off preliminary recommendations President Bush established previously in 2001 in EO 13231 that provided\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\nIndeed, Obama's legacy is marked by the rise of cyber offensive measures in US cyber deterrence doctrine.67 Upon taking office in January 2009, Obama ordered a review of US cybersecurity efforts, which largely subsumed an earlier review launched by President Bush in 2008, during his last year of office – the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) as developed by National Security Presidential Directive 54.68 The CNCI, started by Bush and completed by Obama as part of his Cyber Space Policy Review, broadened the scope of cyber security beyond what had been defined in the 2003 Strategy. CNCI established a dozen tasks for the US to accomplish over the coming years, including, at number 10: ‘define and develop enduring deterrence strategies and programs'. Though several sections of Presidential Directive 54 are redacted, what is left includes specific provisions relating to the roles the Department of Defence (DoD) and the US Intelligence Community have in securing, and deterring attacks within, cyberspace. For instance, the FBI was to establish the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, which would coordinate and integrate information from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), the US Secret Service, and other agencies, to augment criminal investigation and prosecution both in the US and overseas. DHS, with an assist from various other departments, was to establish the National Cybersecurity Center, to improve coordination in protecting and defending US Government communication, cyber, and information networks. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was instructed to develop a ‘cyber counterintelligence plan' to augment the 2007 National Counterintelligence Strategy (which mentioned ‘cyber' only a handful of times). The Secretaries of State, Defense, Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the DNI were to develop, jointly, a plan ‘for the coordination and application of offensive capabilities to defend U.S. information systems'. And, most importantly for our purposes, several agencies were called upon to ‘define and develop a comprehensive and coordinating strategy to deter interference and attacks in cyberspace'. Obama reiterated this latter goal in 2009 when he expanded the CNCI's objective. ‘Senior policymakers', the White House warned, ‘must think through the long-range strategic options available to the United States'. Cyber deterrence rested on improving ‘warning capabilities', articulating ‘roles for private sector and international partners', and developing ‘appropriate responses for both state and non-state actors'.\nObama moved quickly to implement and showcase the new US cyber deterrence posture. He began in 2009 by creating and filling a new position, the Executive Branch Cybersecurity Coordinator (aka, the White House cyber czar). Howard Schmidt, a former head of security at Microsoft, was tapped for the role, tasked with harmonising the various strategies and efforts that were being explored and enacted across the US government. Within the same year, the Department of Defense, in partnership with the NSA, established US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM, or Cybercom). Subordinate to US Strategic Command, housed at the NSA, and led by the director of the NSA, Cybercom was to use NSA networks to protect DoD computer and THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES DoD's cyber posture was initially defined in a relatively short 2011 document, DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, which built off the May 2010 National Security Strategy and February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The document provides five strategic initiatives relating to cyberspace, including that DoD will treat cyberspace as an 'operational domain' of warfare, and will 'organize, train, and equip' itself to 'take full advantage of cyberspace's potential'.[73] The core of DoD's new cyber offensive posture is Cybercom's 133 Cyber Mission Force (CMF) teams. Each team is tasked with supporting a specific component of DoD's comprehensive cyber mission. For example, twenty-seven distinct 'Combat Mission' teams provide 'cyberspace effects' in support of military and operational plans.[74] Other 'National Mission' and 'Protection Force' teams defend DoD and public networks and infrastructure by 'seeing adversary activity, blocking attacks, and maneuvering to defeat them'.[75] A subsequent 2011 DoD report provided to Congress, DoD Cyberspace Policy Report, provides much greater detail as to how the Pentagon's evolving cyber posture provides a cyber deterrent effect. The report clearly relates offensive cyber capabilities with deterrence: 'should the\"deny objectives\"element of deterrence not prove adequate, DoD maintains... the ability to respond militarily in cyberspace and in other domains... using cyber and/or kinetic capabilities'.[76] The report also highlights several other cyber deterrent issues and dilemmas the US will continue to face. They included: i) how to develop a US 'declaratory deterrence posture for cyberspace'; ii) the ways in which DoD will address the 'attribution' dilemma inherent to cyber deterrence by building 'cyber forensic capabilities' and 'behavior-based algorithms' for tracing the source of a cyberattack; iii) the dilemma DoD faces in demonstrating cyber capabilities and communicating plans for deterrent purposes without revealing sensitive tools, intelligence or techniques; and iv) how DoD will 'maintain control' of cyber escalation in times of crisis and war.\nThis last dilemma was subsequently tackled in a 2013 DoD Task Force Report, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, produced by the Defense Science Board. The report is perhaps most notable for openly suggesting that DoD cyber deterrence be anchored to offensive capabilities up to and including nuclear retaliation in the event of 'existential cyber attack'. The 2013 report goes on to chastise Obama's 2010 National",
    "# A. S. WILNER Posture Review (NPR) – which provided the President with guidance in nuclear policy – because it did ‘not explicitly mention’ and otherwise remained ‘essentially silent on [the] relationship between the U.S. nuclear deterrent … and the domain of cyber warfare’.77 Navy Admiral Michael Rogers, the chief of Cybercom and director of the NSA, later repurposed the nuclear analogy in his March 2015 testimony before the Senate Committee on Armed Services. ‘I liken our historical moment’, Rogers argued, ‘to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the [t]riad [sic] and underpinned by … policy structures including a declared deterrence posture’. On cyber offense, Rogers continues, the US must ‘commit time, effort, and resources to understanding our historical situation and building cyber military capabilities’.78 A month following Rogers’ testimony, DoD published The DoD Cyber Strategy (2015) its first such strategic document.": "The 2015 Strategy enshrined Cybercom's expanding offensive purpose. The document, an expansive overview of cyberwarfare and cyber defence, helps guide the development and use of the CMF teams, going quite a distance in illustrating their ability, purpose, and potency. The document also defines deterrence by emphasising punishment, rather than denial, in cyberspace: 'The United States will continue to respond to cyberattacks against U.S. interests at a time, in a manner, and in a place of our choosing, using appropriate instruments of U.S. power'. By October 2016, all of Cybercom's CMF teams reached initial operating capability, translating into a force of roughly 6,000 cyber-warriors. A little over a year later, in January 2018, Cyber Command's headquarters - Joint Force Headquarters Department of Defense Information Network (JFHQ-DODIN) - itself became fully operational.\nSeparately, DoD again tasked the Defense Science Board to sharpen US cyber deterrence options, policy, and strategy, especially in the realm of deterrence by punishment. The DSB Task Force on Cyber Deterrence was established in October 2014; it published its final report in February 2017. Asked to explore the 'requirements for effective deterrence of cyber attacks' against the United States and its allies, and to identify digital and non-digital capabilities 'needed to support deterrence, war-fighting, and escalation control against a highly cyber-capable adversary', the Task Force focused 77DoD Defense Science Board, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, 2013, 41. The 2010 NPR references 'cyber' exactly once; see DoD Nuclear Posture Review, 2010.\n78Admiral Michael Rogers, Statement before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, March 2015.\n79DoD Cyber Strategy, 2015, 10-11.\n80Navy Vice Adm. Nancy Norton took command of the Headquarters in February 2018. US Cyber Command News Release, 'DoD's Network Defense Headquarters Achieves Full Operational Capability', 31 January 2018; Defense Information Systems Agency News, 'Norton Assumes Command of JFHQ-DODIN and Directorship of DISA', 1 February 2018.\nprimarily on deterring high-end cyber threats emanating from major and ‘lesser' powers and sophisticated non-state actors. The DSB makes several important suggestions. First, it introduces the term ‘deterrence by cost imposition' to replace the more commonly used term deterrence by punishment. The rationale, it would seem, is to broaden punishment's scope in keeping with the emerging logic of cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace. ‘Cost imposition' better captures the kinetic, diplomatic, economic, law enforcement, and digital forms of punishment that the US might use in responding to cyberattacks and exploitations. Second, the DSB bridges the divide between denial and punishment in cyberspace. ‘DoD must create a second-strike cyber resilient “Thin Line”' of critical US offensive systems (cyber, nuclear and conventional) and related infrastructure in order to ensure that the US can credibly threaten retaliation in response to a potentially crippling cyber first strike. Good defence and resilience feeds into the potency and certainty of threats of punishment. Third, the DSB affirms, rather bluntly, the continued asymmetry between offense and defence in cyberspace. ‘The unfortunate reality', the 2017 DSB report reads, ‘is that, for at least the coming five to ten years, the offensive cyber capabilities of our most capable potential adversaries are likely to far exceed the United Sates' ability to defend and adequately strengthen the resilience of its critical infrastructures'. US cyber offense, then, is needed to correct the perceptions of asymmetry between defenders and challengers. Finally, the DSB links cyber deterrence to reputation, past and future. It warns that not responding to a cyberattack -- once, presumably, US cyber deterrence has failed -- is, with ‘near-certainty... an invitation to follow-on cyber attacks'. In sum, the DSB Task Force solidifies the primary role offense will have in US cyber deterrence posture and strategy of the emerging decades.\nWith its offensive building blocks in place, the US, first under President Obama and later, under President Trump, began flexing its cyber muscle. It surreptitiously destroyed centrifuges in Iran, sabotaging and delaying the country's nuclear weapons program. It explored using cyberspace to dismantle Libya's air defences leading up to the March 2011 military intervention. The US likewise targeted and sabotaged North Korea's missile development program. Elsewhere, Cybercom was charged with attacking ISIS's online presence and capability in support of US and coalition plans to degrade and defeat the terrorist organisation, and to digitally augment related kinetic operations in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. The US is thought to have also used cyberspace to retaliate against North Korea following its 2014 hack on Sony Pictures. Other forms of punishment were meted out by # A. S. WILNER the Justice Department. New cyber attribution capabilities allowed DOJ, in 2014, 2016, and 2018 to indict over a dozen Chinese military hackers, seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel, and another two private Iranian citizens for stealing US intellectual property, computer hacking, and launching ransomware attacks, and several Russian military intelligence officers for a string of hacks targeting the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and sporting and anti-doping agencies in the US, Canada and Europe. Via EO 13687, President Obama likewise imposed additional sanctions on North Korea in January 2015 in direct response to the Sony Hack.[84] Finally, in his last days in office, President Obama sanctioned and expelled Russian nationals for their role in hacking the 2016 presidential election. Another 13 Russian nationals and three companies were subsequently charged by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of Special Council Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian's meddling in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Russia was again fingered by American and British officials in April 2018 for targeting and exploiting network infrastructure devices, like routers, for purposes of espionage.[85] The coercive message, all told, is that the US has developed the capability to trace and attribute cyberattacks conducted against it and its allies, and to launch punitive measures in cyberspace and across domains in response.\nIn hand with this shift towards cyber punishment, Obama also developed US declaratory posture for cyberspace and helped establish international norms for cyber engagement. From a deterrence perspective, it is not enough to simply have the tools to harm an adversary: you also need to establish and communicate red lines against which acts of retaliation will be measured. Norms that help identify what is and is not acceptable behaviour in cyberspace further solidify retaliatory threats. Obama's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace is the backbone of this process. 'The digital world is no longer a lawless frontier', President Obama's opening statement to the document reads, 'it is a place where the norms of responsible, just, and peaceful conduct among states and people have begun to take hold'.[86] The strategy outlines how the US would provide leadership in establishing global norms for cyber behaviour. The US State Department, for instance, went on to establish the world's first Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues (S/CCI) in February 2011, dedicated to coordinating the Department's diplomatic work on cyber and developing international cyber rules. Some 20 84For an exploration of how and why North Korea's hack manipulated Sony's behaviour, which ultimately triggered the US response, see Travis Sharp, 'Theorizing Cyber Coercion: The 2014 North Korean Operation against Sony', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/7 (2017).\n85UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Joint US-UK Statement on Malicious Cyber Activity Carried out by Russian Government', 16 April 2018; UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Advisory: Russian Statesponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices', 16 April 2018.\n86The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace, 2011, 3.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\nThe Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues was also instrumental in assisting a UN Group of Government Experts (GGE) establish a rudimentary list of cyber norms in 2015 (though the GGE failed in 2017 to subsequently link those norms to recommendations embedded in international law).88 In terms of cyber deterrence, the 2011 Strategy illustrates that the US will continue to bolster denial – redubbed here as ‘dissuasion’ – to deter attacks, but also strongly signals its ‘right to self-defense’ in conducting cyber retaliation. The US, the document reads, ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any threat to our country … and we recognize that certain hostile acts … could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic’.89 In line with these strategic pronouncements, the Obama Administration tried to make a distinction between cyber espionage for the purposes of statecraft – which was deemed legitimate – and cyber espionage, theft, and attack for the purposes of economic or domestic disruption and infrastructure destruction – all deemed illegitimate. Thus, on the one hand, China’s 2015 exfiltration of over 20 million personnel records from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was deemed ‘not an attack’ by James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, but rather good espionage; ‘[we] would have done the same thing’.90 But on the other hand, Russia’s 2015/16 hack, manipulation, and leak of Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee data during the 2016 presidential election was deemed by CIA Director, John Brennan, as a ‘new level of malicious activity’ meant to undermine and influence the institution of US democracy.91 In January 2017,",
    "# A. S. WILNER two weeks before Trump's inauguration, DHS took the unprecedented step of classifying 'election infrastructure' as a critical infrastructure subsector, providing it with priority protection within the NIPP.[92] While the Trump Administration's cyberspace and cyber deterrence strategies are still being patched together, given the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date, and given what we know about Trump's leanings in international affairs, three things are likely to occur under his watch.": "First, threats of cyber retaliation and the logic of deterrence by punishment will continue to grow in importance. Pentagon officials have long sought more leeway from congress to engage in cyber offense. In 2017, Admiral Rogers, Cybercom's chief, lamented that 'offensive cyber is almost treated like nuclear weapons, in the sense that their application... is controlled at the chief executive level and not delegated down. What I would like to see, over the next five to 10 years', is that US cyber weapons are viewed 'as another tool for the commanders' at the tactical level.[93] Signaling his acceptance of Rogers' position, President Trump, in August 2017, initiated the elevation of Cybercom to the status of a Unified Combatant Command (a step long-debated, but never taken, under Obama).[94] The transition places Cybercom at par with other unified commands, like US Strategic Command or US European Command, establishing a direct line of communication between Cybercom's director and the Secretary of Defense. And a year later, in August 2018, President Trump rescinded a 2012 Obama-era directive - Presidential Policy Directive 20 - that governed the manner in which cyberattacks were approved.[95] The reversal loosens the (somewhat onerous) restrictions that Obama had placed on conducting offensive cyber operations.\nFurthermore, Trump's February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (the first tabled since 2010), goes to some length in closing the cross-domain gap between nuclear weapons, nuclear retaliation, and cyber deterrence. Just as DoD's aforementioned Defense Science Board report recommended in 2013, the 2018 NPR expands the scope conditions that might lead to a US nuclear response as a result of a cyberattack. While US nuclear retaliation will continue to be reserved for 'extreme circumstances', the 2018 NPR significantly broadens these circumstances themselves to include 'significant non-nuclear strategic attacks', on 'civilian population or infrastructure'. Read: 92Department of Homeland Security, 'Statement by Secretary Jeh Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector', 6 January 2017.\n93Cheryl Pellerin, 'Rogers Discusses near Future of U.S. Cyber Command', DoD News, 24 February 2017.\n94Separately, in February 2018, the White House signaled its intention to nominate Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone as Rogers' replacement at the helm of the NSA and Cybercom. The White House, Statement by President Donald J. Trump on the Elevation of Cyber Command, 18 August 2017; Chris Bing, 'White House Official: Paul Nakasone Nominated for NSA Director', CyberScoop, 13 February 2018.\n95Sean Lyngass, 'PPD-20 Elimination opens arguments over how US should Conduct Offensive Hacking Operations', CyberScoop, 16 August 2018.\ncrippling cyberattack. Additionally, perhaps cognizant that technology risks advancing more quickly than strategic policy, the NPR further warns that ‘the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of non-nuclear strategic attack technologies and U.S. capabilities to counter that threat'. Lest anyone misinterpret the document, DoD simultaneously published the NPR's Executive Summary in several languages, including Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Russian.\nThe logic of all of this was rolled into the State Department's ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats', a three-page brief published in May 2018 in direct response to EO 13800, and DoD's new Cyber Strategy, published in September 2018. The ‘Recommendations' report suggests that existing efforts at deterrence in cyberspace are ‘necessary but not sufficient': ‘network defense alone' is not enough. Calling for a ‘fundamental rethinking' of existing frameworks and a ‘new US vision' for cyber deterrence, the report recommends the development of a ‘broader menu of consequences' that the US can impose against state and non-state actors below ‘the threshold of the use of force'. With reference to the perennial issues of attribution and coercive credibility, the document calls for the US to openly demonstrate its ability to identify threats by imposing ‘swift, costly, and transparent consequences' on adversaries. Action will stand for credibility and might have ‘downstream deterrence effects'. Cyber offense is likewise paramount in DoD's 2018 Cyber Strategy. While the strategy itself is not publicity available, a 7-page summary is. And while this new strategy supersedes DoD's 2015 Strategy it compliments DoD's 2018 National Defense Strategy and the 2017 National Security Strategy. The document warns specific adversaries that the US will ‘build a more lethal force', conduct pre-emptive operations, ‘prepare for war', and collect cyber intelligence so as to field the ‘military cyber capabilities' the US needs to ‘defend forward'. A fuzzy term, defending forward implies terminating attacks at their (foreign) source, and ‘leveraging [US] focus outward to stop threats before they reach their targets'. By persistently engaging cyber competitors and aggressors on a daily basis, and by employing the Pentagon's full range of offensive capabilities, the US, the Strategy submits, will deter malicious cyber activities over time.\nSecond, and somewhat relatedly, under Trump, non-state actors may be encouraged to conduct cyber punishment and cyber offense themselves. The idea is to permit victims of cyber aggression and crime -- companies, A. S. WILNER institutions, NGOs, and individuals – to ‘hack back’ or counterattack via ‘active defense’ against their perpetrators. Under the current US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, it is illegal for individuals to gain entry into another’s computer system without permission. Though several US tech firms, including Google and Microsoft, have voiced concerns, Congress has nonetheless explored exceptions as part of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (first proposed in March 2017), and Georgia’s General Assembly passed a bill (later vetoed by the Governor) that would have made provisions for non-state active defence in cyberspace.⁹⁹ Despite the controversy, some companies, including major US banks, have been reported to have surveyed the utility of hack backs to protect their servers, data, and assets.¹⁰⁰ In a telling episode, Bossert, the former White House security advisor, and Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra, the chief cybersecurity official at DHS, heaped rare praise on Facebook and Microsoft during their lengthy December 2017 press-briefing in which the US officially blamed North Korea for conducting the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks. The attacks encrypted data on hundreds of thousands of public and private sector computers in over 150 countries. ‘We applaud our corporate partners’, Bossert asserted, ‘for acting on their own initiative … without any direction by the U.S. government … to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers. They shut down accounts … used to launch attacks and patched systems’.¹⁰¹ The destructive power and frequency of cyber hacking only grew under Obama. This trend will continue under Trump. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and wirelessly tethered Internet of Things (IoT) devices, along with new types of malicious activity like ransomware and sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, both of which can now be bought and sold on the Dark Web, will reshape the cyber threat landscape for individuals, communities, NGOs, and public and private-sector actors.¹⁰² Under the right conditions, non-state hack backs and other disruptive actions – the twenty-first century’s version of digital vigilantism – may prove useful for establishing a whole-of-society – rather than a whole-of-government – US cyber deterrence doctrine.\nFinally, in keeping with Trump’s general weariness of multilateralism and the United Nations in particular, the US is likely to downplay its role in establishing global cyber norms and focus instead on communicating its own red lines and bolstering the cyber deterrent posture of like-mined allied ⁹⁹Zaid Shoorbajee, ‘Google and Microsoft ask Georgia Governor to Veto “Hack Back” Bill’, *CyberScoop*, 27 April 2018; Ryan Johnston, ‘After Widespread outcry, Georgia Governor Vetoes “Hack Back” Bill’, *State Scoop*, 8 May 2018.\n¹⁰⁰Dan Lohrmann, ‘Hack Back Law’, *Government Technology*, September 2017; Nicholas Schmidle, ‘The Digital Vigilantes who Hack Back’, *New Yorker*, 7 May 2018.\n¹⁰¹The White House, ‘Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea’, 19 December 2017.\n¹⁰²Bruce Schneier, ‘Botnets of Things’, *MIT Technology Review*, March/April 2017.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # states. The 2018 'Recommendations' report, for illustration, calls on the US to first establish criteria for US retaliation and to then communicate the policy both 'publicly and privately' so as to generate a deterrent effect. Separately, Trump shuttered the State Department's cyber coordinator's office, effectively degrading America's role in UN negotiations, though the Administration did test the waters for restarting the process of norm building in October 2018, following a ministerial meeting with US allies.[103] What appears more certain, however, is that the US is likely to seek bilateral cyber relations with other states and groups of states. At the Cyber Week 2017 gathering in Israel in June, for instance, the ever-present Bossert announced the US-Israel bilateral cyber working group – which was to be led by White House cyber czar, Rob Joyce, before his departure and the elimination his position – signalling Washington's preference for establishing cyber coalitions of the willing. '[W]e must', Bossert warned, 'hold those who violate [cyber] norms accountable. This may not be achievable through a UN effort. Likeminded states should work to develop options for imposing consequences within a coalition structure'.[104] In a similar vein, the US, in partnership with the UK, Germany and other NATO allies, aims to establish cyber warfare principles for 2019.[105] And, as the White House articulates in its 2018 Cyber Strategy, the US has plans to build a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative' that will convene a coalition of 'like-minded states' that can collectively develop 'tailored strategies' and jointly impose 'consequences against malign actors'.[106] # Conclusion: Evolution in theory US cyber deterrence has come a long way since 2003. Definitions of deterrence – and core concepts linked to punishment and denial – have been revisited, reconceptualised, and broadened in scope. New government positions, institutions, agencies, and organisations have been created, staffed, trained, and tasked with operationalising core concepts. New technology, including software and hardware, has been developed and deployed. Partnerships across the US government, the private sector, and civil society have been established. And allies and international organisations have been leveraged. The footprints of all of these changes are evident in the record: US strategic doctrine allows us to trace the direction of this evolution. From a theoretical perspective, the way in which US cyber deterrence has been adapted since its inception provides 103Sean Lyngaas, 'US Looks to Restart Talks on Global Cyber Norms', CyberScoop, October 2018.\n104The White House, 'Remarks by Homeland Security Advisor Thomas P. Bossert at Cyber Week 2017', 26 June 2017.\n105Robin Emmott, 'NATO mulls\"Offensive Defense\"with Cyber Warfare Rules', Reuters, 30 November 2017.\nscholars with insight as to how deterrence theory itself might respond to the promises and paradoxes of cyber deterrence. Several lessons stand out.\nFirst, US cyber deterrence has shifted from an almost exclusive focus on defence and deterrence by denial under President Bush to a punishment-based strategy under Presidents Obama and Trump. Part of the reason threats of retaliation and ‘deterrence by cost imposition' are currently emphasised is that recent technological advancements have allowed the US to improve its ability to monitor cyberattacks, identify perpetrators, and administer retaliatory actions, both within and outside cyberspace. Simply put, punishment strategies are increasingly feasible. Technological advancements have led to the adoption and use of new offensive coercive strategies. If so, theorists themselves should better situate technology into their own work of deterrence. How might the prerequisites of deterrence theory, and the concepts derived from them, adapt to novel, emerging, and disruptive technology within and beyond cyberspace?\nSecond, and relatedly, a separate reason US cyber punishment strategies have come to overshadow denial strategies has to do with the perception that deterrence by denial is not working, or rather, that the threat of denial used alone and separately from the threat of punishment, is not working. The number, severity and complexity of cyberattacks targeting US government and private sector facilities and assets has continued to rise over the past 15 years despite the US government's communicated threat of defence and denial. In response, US doctrine and strategy has evolved such that punishment is being used hand-in-glove with denial. For illustration, synchronising their efforts to defend the 2018 US midterm elections, DoD-DHS collaboration saw the former (via Cyber Command) target Russian operatives overseas to disrupt their actions all the while the latter worked with social media companies to counter disinformation. In practice, the two approaches reinforce each other. Recalibrating the effect punishment and denial have on each other in practice, suggests that theories of deterrence must better relate how the logic of punishment augments, or otherwise corresponds to, the logic of denial. Too often punishment and denial are considered poles apart, distinct levers applied separately to the cost-benefit calculus that underpins rational behaviour and coercion. In theory, how do punishment and denial relate and overlap; in cyberspace when does one stop and the other start?\nThird, the US has come to equate attribution as a distinct form of punishment that appears logically linked to denial. In fielding a question during the 2017 WannaCry press briefing, Bossert suggested, for instance, that ‘it's not about holding a country accountable; it's about simple culpability. We've determined who was behind the [WannaCry] attack, and we're saying it....\nWe're going to hold them accountable... And we're going to shame them for it.... And I think it's going to improve our security'. By identifying North Korea, the US denied it the benefit of anonymity in cyberspace; by publically outing North Korea, the US put the regime on notice for future punishment. From a theoretical perspective, however, attribution is largely understood as a mechanism, a crucial step that allows a defender to retaliate by identifying a challenger, rather than as a functional punishment in its own right. If so, and in light of perceptual changes in practice, deterrence theory must better explore whether, how, and under what conditions public attribution -- and the threat of shaming -- function as a source of cyber deterrence at the different levels of analysis. How might public and private attribution of an attack deter, coerce, or otherwise influence individual, non-state, and state cyber challengers?\nFourth, US cyber deterrence is not chiefly about military coercion. Notwithstanding Cybercom's emerging role in providing the US government with offensive and military options to punish cyber aggressors globally, US cyber deterrence strategy has emphasised the importance of several other departments and agencies, including DOJ, DHS, FBI, State Department and various others, for both denying and punishing cyberattacks. The goal is to equip the US government with as wide a set of coercive levers as possible, crossing domains as needed, to provide a truly whole of government approach to cybersecurity and cyber deterrence. The role of the DOJ (and the FBI by extension) is especially enlightening. By publicly indicting foreign nationals for cyberattacks conducted on American computer systems, the US government underscores the fact that contemporary cyber deterrence transcends traditional defence policy and military doctrine. By establishing the DOJ as a core pillar of its punishment strategy, the US signals its intention to use criminal justice tools to deter not just criminal attacks but attacks conducted by nation state adversaries. In doing so, the US further blurs the line between state institutions and individuals, by sanctioning the latter for actions they perpetrated while working for or on behalf of foreign governments, militaries, or intelligence agencies. For deterrence theory, the burgeoning role non-military and non-kinetic coercion have had in US cyber deterrence posture suggests that academics must redouble their efforts at multidisciplinarity. Academic silos still exist in the manner in which deterrence theory is developed and tested. To some degree, deterrence from within IR theory is privileged over that stemming from criminology, psychology, and terrorism and intelligence studies. This is especially the case when it comes to deterrence in national security and international affairs. Though the fourth wave of deterrence scholarship has gone to some length to bridge the disciplinary divide, more cross-fertilisation is needed among disciplines to better reflect and speak to developments taking place in practice. What theoretical lessons do non-IR approaches to deterrence hold for how IR theories of cyber deterrence are developed and improved?\nFifth, US cyber deterrence is not solely about states, either. Rather, non-state actors figure prominently in American strategic doctrine as both potential perpetrators of cyberattacks targeting US infrastructure, and, more importantly for our purposes, as potential partners that amplify US cyber deterrence. For instance, private sector and individual victims of cyberattack share information, voluntarily, about attacks with law enforcement and intelligence. This provides governments with a better understanding of the nature, prevalence and evolution of certain types of attack, which can lead to improvements in defence and denial. In other cases, as highlighted by Facebook, Microsoft, and Marcus Hutchins -- a private British citizen who noticed a ‘kill switch' within WannaCry's code and took action to temporarily shut the attack down -- non-state actors can track and impede attacks without government oversight, further denying perpetrators the fruits of their labour. In still other cases, non-state actors, including companies, individuals, academics, NGOs, and other such groups, can augment US cyber security and deterrence by denial efforts by practicing better cyber hygiene -- i.e. updating passwords or patching software. This functions to further deny challengers easy opportunities to conduct successful attacks. On this front, Washington is exploring how it might compel (or, even, demand) private sector partners, contractors, and suppliers to do more to defend and secure their own networks, data and assets, as a precondition for working with and on behalf of the US government. In February 2018, for instance, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, in discussing the 2018 National Defense Strategy at a conference, warned that DoD wanted the cyber security ‘bar to be set so high, it will become the condition of doing business' with the Pentagon; for industry, cybersecurity will be ‘foundational to business with DoD'. The point, in this case, is to develop a whole of society deterrence posture, rather than simply a whole of government approach. The logic of all of this goes back to a statement made in President Bush's opening letter to the first 2003 cybersecurity strategy, oft repeated since: ‘Securing cyberspace is an extraordinarily difficult strategic challenge that requires a coordinated and focused effort from our entire society -- the federal government, state and local governments, the private sector, and the American people'. ‘Every American', the strategy continues ‘who can contribute to securing part of cyberspace is encouraged to do so. The federal government invites the creation of, and participation in, public-private partnerships to raise cybersecurity awareness, train personnel, stimulate market forces, improve technology, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, exchange information and plan recovery operations. Of the many ways in which the US government has previously approached deterrence in the other domains of warfare, this general call to arms is unique to cyberspace and cyber deterrence.\nIn response, scholars of deterrence need to explore the nature and feasibility of non-state cyber deterrence. Cyberspace is not a state-centric environment. On the contrary: states and militaries represent a tiny fraction of all the communities, individuals, and non-state actors that constitute cyberspace. Objects, too, have cyber presence. Projections suggest that 50 billion items -- from smart-homes to smart-cars, and from ‘intelligent' construction materials to wireless medical devices -- will be networked online as part of the IoT through an array of embedded electronics, software and sensors. All to say, the vast majority of interactions and the vast majority of the data created online is non-state in nature. Cyber deterrence theory must move beyond its narrow focus on states to account for the diversity of actors and objects that populate cyberspace. What is the equivalent in cyberspace of businesses, community groups, and homeowners employing storefront lighting, neighbourhood watch programs, and anti-burglary systems to deter physical attacks, theft and robbery? Can non-state actors be agents of their own deterrence in cyberspace?\n## Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."

In some ways cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine, and policy are developed and put to use even before corresponding theories are properly understood. This article analyses how American cyber deterrence has been implemented over the past two decades in order to inform ongoing debates within the academic study of deterrence, and to provide insights from practice for how cyber deterrence theory can be better conceived and refined.\nWhile President Donald Trump upbraided the previous administration's apparent weakness in cyberspace – ‘We’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing’ – his administration has itself struggled to table a coherent cyber deterrence strategy, despite repeated promises to do so quickly. As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to ‘develop the offensive cyber capabilities we need to deter attacks by both state and non-state actors’. Two weeks following his November 2017 election, President-elect Trump went on to explain further – that he would build ‘a comprehensive plan to protect America’s vital infrastructure against cyberattacks’. And months later still, as President, he signed Executive Order (EO) 13800 in May 2017 – an updated draft of a January 2017 EO that had been scraped at the last minute – on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. The EO describes a plan to reassess all elements of US cybersecurity across and beyond the government. In terms of cyber deterrence specifically, EO 13800 calls on various agencies and departments – including the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security, along with the Director of\nCONTACT Alex S.

A public version of the report eventually appeared in May 2018. $^{5}$\nPresident Trump was also slow to appoint or approve several top-level federal cybersecurity and technology positions – including, notably, Federal Chief Information Security Officer, and the head of DHS's cybersecurity and infrastructure protection division. $^{6}$ These positions are critical to guiding US cybersecurity policy and planning, including in the area of cyber deterrence. Despite all of this, (former) White House Homeland Security advisor, Thomas Bossert – who helped craft cybersecurity policy under US President George W. Bush – revealed in October 2017, that the Trump Administration was determined to eventually publish a new cybersecurity strategy based on EO 13800. $^{7}$ And in his January 2017 Confirmation Hearing, General James Mattis, President Trump's (former) Secretary of Defense, suggested that a comprehensive 'cyber doctrine' might be ready by July 2018. $^{8}$ The new National Cyber Strategy was eventually published in September 2018, after an earlier public summary was held back in May 2018. $^{9}$\nAlthough a US cyber deterrence strategy distinct from a broader cyber doctrine has yet to be established or fully leveraged, bits and pieces of the strategy exist, peppered about in different government departments and agencies. Indeed, US cyber deterrence has evolved a great deal since the mid-2000s. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, to better anticipate where US cyber deterrence is heading in practice by exploring the manner in which it has evolved through different presidential administrations. And second, to trace the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date to explore cyber deterrence in theory.

By the standards of deterrence theory, which has a robust and cumulative pedigree dating back over a century, cyber deterrence is an innovative but imperfectly understood idea. The bulk of the academic literature on cyber deterrence was produced only very recently, over the past fifteen years or so. Moreover, in some important ways, US cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine and policy have been developed, unveiled and put to use even before corresponding theories from academia are properly understood, tested and refined.\nIf practice precedes theory, then a reflection of how this practice progressed over time may help inform theory more broadly. Combined, these circumstances leave scholars with a unique opportunity to evaluate an example of cyber deterrence practice in order to explain and better describe cyber deterrence theory. In methodological terms, this article explores how American cyber deterrence has been implemented in order to better highlight theory more broadly. The United States, by dint of its size, pre-eminence in cyberspace and decades of experience operationalising deterrence theory in other domains, represents a crucial case. Moreover, in empirical terms, the US government openly discusses cybersecurity, and has made various iterations of its cyber deterrence strategy and doctrine publicly available. While a comprehensive US cyber deterrence strategy has yet to be tabled, fragments of the strategy can be patched together, piecemeal, from various US government bodies. A record of thought and practice exists; wading through it provides insights for theory.\nThe article begins with a summary of the academic literature on deterrence theory dating back to the beginning of the Cold War. The rationale here is to outline the nuts and bolts of deterrence theory, highlight conceptual prerequisites, illustrate the many ways deterrence has been operationalised, and briefly assess the ‘four waves' of deterrence scholarship. Next, the article takes a broad look at cyber deterrence theory in particular. The purpose is to discuss the core debates and research clusters embedded within this particular sub-field of the literature. Doing so will provide a theoretical foundation against which the empirical work can be paired against. An exploration of US cyber deterrence then follows. This section will provide a detailed and linear reflection of US cyber deterrence strategy, doctrine and policy stretching back to the early 2000s. The analysis will piece together how US strategy has unfolded and evolved over time, and help identify specific concepts, trends and assumptions baked into strategic\n#\nA. S. WILNER\ndiscourse. Highlights from the US example will then be analysed in the conclusion of the article. The way the United States has put cyber deterrence into practice over time provides lessons and insights for how cyber deterrence theory might be better conceived, approached and refined.\n# Deterrence in theory: Concepts and debates\nDeterrence is an enduring concept. It has repeatedly proven its flexibility in responding to, and evolving from, shifting international and interstate dynamics. Deterrence, at its theoretical core, entails using threats to manipulate an adversary's behaviour.[11] More concretely, it rests on convincing another actor to forgo an unwanted action. Compellence – a related concept – flips the process around, prompting an adversary to pursue an action it might otherwise have avoided. Compellence encourages behaviour, whereas deterrence restrains it. Both are subsumed within the logic of coercion. In all cases of deterrence and compellence, a minimum of two actors are involved. Defenders issue threats to alter an opponent's behaviour; challengers consider these threats, weigh their options, and decide whether or not to acquiesce. In some cases, a third actor is involved. With extended deterrence, for instance, a proxy, partner, or ally is also included in the process, either on the side of the defender or the challenger. Threats of punishment – usually in the form of retaliation – and promises of denial – usually in the form of depriving an adversary the expected benefits of a particular behaviour – form the basis for most deterrent and compellent engagements, though normative and ideological considerations that inform behaviour have also been recently developed within the context of delegitimisation. Each of these three coercive processes is linked to the logic of deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial, and deterrence by delegitimisation, respectively.[12]\nDeterrence works by informing a challenger's cost-benefit calculus. Importantly, it does so by weighing upon another's strategic choice.[13] Militarily crushing an adversary, as Thomas Schelling reminds us, such that it has no alternative but to accept demands made of it is not deterrence, but rather defeat.[14] The same can be said in the realm of denial. Developing a perfect, foolproof defence, while rare, does not deter by denial but rather deters by defeat; an adversary does not penetrate a target or conduct a certain attack because it is prevented from doing so, not because it decides\n[11] Moving beyond theory and strategy, Amir Lupovici contends that deterrence is also an idea, internalized within the identity of those who rely on it. Lupvici, *The Power of Deterrence* (Cambridge 2016).\n[12] On the latter, see for instance, Jerry Mark Long and Alex Wilner, 'Delegitimizing al-Qaida: Defeating an \"Army Whose Men Love Death\"', *International Security* 39/1 (2014).\n[13] Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge: Polity Press 2004), 26.\n[14] Thomas Schelling, *Arms and Influence* (1966), 1–34.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nPut into practice, deterrence theory rests on a number of pre-requisites. First, actors must exhibit a degree of rationality, such that some combination of threats will suffice to alter behaviour. Second, overlapping preferences short of open conflict must be shared by all parties; deterrence requires that adversaries accept the feasibility of non-violence. Third, threats, expected changes in behaviour and a willingness to punish violations must be communicated. Defenders must likewise reassure challengers that threats will not be carried out in the event demands are met. Fourth, defenders must have the perceived capability, and the resolve to punish or deny as threatened. Finally, deterrence works best again a known or suspected adversary; anonymity robs deterrence of its potency.\nBuilding off these prerequisites and core conceptual tenets, deterrence theory has evolved in new and exciting ways over the past several decades. This process of theoretical rejuvenation and praxis has been the result of both changing geostrategic realities (from bipolarity to unipolarity and back, for instance), and because of the emergence of new technology (from nuclear weapons to artificial intelligence) and security domains (including air, space and cyberspace). For illustration of this evolution, consider these various concepts. Central deterrence – which functions to protect a defender's assets – stands against extended (or triadic) deterrence – which functions to protect a third party's assets. Broad deterrence – which deters aggression writ large – stands against narrow deterrence – which deters a specific, and often limited, behaviour. Similarly, general deterrence seeks to\n Alex Wilner, ‘Contemporary Deterrence Theory Counterterrorism: A Bridge too Far?’ NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 47/2 (2015).\n The literature is expansive. For a reference point, consider these various meta-analyses of the empirical record: Anthony Braga and David Weisburd, ‘The Effects of Focused Deterrence Strategies on Crime’, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency 49 (2012); Rob Guerette and Kate Bowers, ‘Assessing the Extent of Crime Displacement and Diffusion of Benefits’, Criminology 47/4 (2009); Trevor Bennett, Katy Holloway, and David Farrington, ‘Does Neighborhood Watch Reduce Crime?’ Journal of Experimental Criminology 2/4 (2006); David Farrington, et al., ‘The Effects of Closed-Circuit Television on Crime’, Journal of Experimental Criminology 3 (2007).\n See, for illustration Kevin Woods and Mark Stout, ‘Saddam’s Perceptions and Misperceptions’, Journal of Strategic Studies 33/1 (2010); Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein, ‘Rational Deterrence Theory: I Think, Therefore I Deter’, World Politics 41/2 (1989); Robert Jervis, Richard Ned Lebow, and Janice Gross Stein, Psychology and Deterrence (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 1985); Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (Random House 2011).\nregulate and uphold accepted, status quo relations, whereas immediate deterrence functions within periods of crisis and against expected anti-status quo behaviour. Intra-war deterrence shapes certain behaviour within an ongoing hot war, after other forms of deterrence have already failed; the goal here is to influence an adversary's warfighting behaviour itself. Cumulative or serial deterrence is iterative; it functions by adding up the effects of repeated coercive interactions. Moving beyond threats, inducements, deflection, dissuasion, entanglement and influence have each been added to deterrence theory, too, broadening the manner in which defenders secure their interests and shape adversarial behaviour.\nWithin IR, deterrence scholarship has evolved within the context of ‘four waves', borrowing insights from other disciplines, namely criminology, terrorism studies, and psychology. The first wave emerged around the end of the Second World War, and corresponded to the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology within a US-dominated strategic backdrop. The second wave began in the early days of the Cold War. US-Soviet dynamics and alliance structures shaped the wave's research agenda, as did the limited proliferation of nuclear weapons to US allies, like France and the UK, and rivals, like China. The second wave used game theory and scientific modelling to explore how rivals could manage nuclear escalation and alliances. Focus was placed on strategic and conventional deterrence by punishment -- and to a much lesser degree on conventional deterrence by denial in Europe and Asia -- and on major power conflict pitting mutually rational and unitary state actors. The third wave began in the 1970s. Its focus was on empiricism, on qualitatively and quantitatively testing the concepts, frameworks and theories previously proposed. Findings suggested the importance of commitment, communication, and resolve in using both central and extended deterrence, and illustrated the variance embedded within the concept of expected utility. The psychology of coercion (e.g. human cognition and thought, bias, fatigue, decision-making, misperception, and error), along with notions of strategic culture, bureaucracy and leadership also emerged.\nThe fourth wave followed the end of the Cold War and continues today. A traditional focus on bipolarity, strategic weapons, and great power rivalries gave way to a diffusion of interests, both between and below state actors. In terms of scholarship, the fourth wave is both especially dynamic, and slightly chaotic: everything and everyone under the sun is in focus. Included here is work on deterring rogue states -- traditionally weak states and militaries often in possession of limited nuclear or chemical and biological weapons, like Iraq, Iran,\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nSerbia, North Korea, Syria, and Libya. $^{19}$  Violent non-state actors have likewise been the focus of fourth wave scholarship, from pirates to ISIS and everyone in between, along with the processes of radicalisation, rebellion, insurgency, and political violence. $^{20}$  And while deterrence in space was a concern during the Cold War, it largely featured a limited number of actors, the US and USSR. But in the fourth wave, space deterrence features new entrants, like India, China, Israel, and private sector actors, including SpaceX and Blue Origin, and rapidly diffusing technology, including new forms of anti-satellite weaponry (ASAT), miniature satellites, and privately owned, reusable mega-rockets. As the scope of deterrence has broadened, so, too, has the practice of deterrence: the logic of denial has been expanded beyond its conventional limits, as has extended deterrence. $^{21}$  And altogether novel concepts, like cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace, have been proposed and tested. $^{22}$\n# Cyber deterrence in theory: Core research clusters\nResearch on cyber deterrence is largely rooted to the classical literature on deterrence stemming from IR. Several thematic clusters populate the cyber deterrence literature.[23]\n$^{19}$ T. V. Paul, Patrick M. Morgan, and James J.

The 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace defines it as a 'nervous system' or 'control system' for US critical infrastructure, comprised of 'hundreds of thousands of interconnected computers, servers, routers, switches, and fiber optic cables'. The 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations later defined cyberspace as a 'domain', characterized by 'the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures'. And in a 2008 memo, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England defined cyberspace as 'a global domain', consisting of 'the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'. While definitions of cyberspace continue to evolve, for the purposes of this paper, cyberspace is understood as a global, interconnected domain constituting hardware, digital data, and related infrastructrue in which electronic devices are used to create, save and disseminate information. The phrase 'cyber deterrence' also lacks a precise definition. At its broadest, cyber deterrence is a field of study - as deterring terrorism might be thought of - that involves applying and exploring the logic, theory, and practice of deterrence within cyberspace. More narrowly, cyber deterrence might be understood as the deterrence of attacks within or using cyberspace, or conversely, the use of cyberspace to accomplish deterrence in other domains. This paper relies on the broader definition but highlights the narrow use of the term where necessary.\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nThe largest cluster explores the manner in which the prerequisites of IR deterrence apply to cyberspace. By these standards some scholars conclude that the architecture of cyberspace – anonymity, complexity, interconnectivity, jurisdictional diffusion, open access – makes cyber deterrence inherently weak.[24] The fundamental prerequisites are not easily met. Herein, the attribution dilemma receives greatest attention.[25] The ease of digital obfuscation,[26] complexity of 'multi-stage' cyberattacks,[27] difficulty in signalling or communicating threats and deterrent capabilities,[28] and challenge of uncovering the physical source of a cyberattack,[29] can complicate how defenders construct and communicate credible coercive threats. If cyber adversaries believe that their identities are protected, retaliatory threats will fall short. A range of tentative solutions have been proposed. More sophisticated attribution capabilities, processes, and standards might be developed.[30] Or, the Internet could be reengineered as an attributed network.[31] Or, sources of a cyberattack might be better deduced weighing known capabilities, interests, and motivation of likely adversaries.[32] Or, third party enablers of cyberattacks (i.e., owners of cyber infrastructure, and other private sector actors) might be held better accountable.[33] Or, the threshold of 'certain identification' when contemplating retaliation can be lowered.[34] Still other authors illustrate how cyber attribution is not, in fact, as potent a\n24The Economist (Benjamin Sutherland, ed.)

A paradox emerges: technologically advanced states are both the most able to conduct offensive cyberattacks, and the most susceptible to such attacks. Weak states and non-state adversaries with fewer cyber platforms, conversely, have less to fear from cyberwar and much to gain by escalating a confrontation to digital space, where they may have advantages over traditionally stronger powers. That asymmetry may destabilise cyber deterrence. Skirting this particular paradox may involve combining cyber threats with more traditional kinetic and non-kinetic threats, effectively adding military punishment, law enforcement, diplomatic and financial sanctions, and public shaming to the cyber mix. This cross-domain deterrent approach addresses cyber credibility by tackling on traditional forms of retaliation to the equation. Robert Mandel suggests further that defenders use ‘unorthodox’ means to enhance the potency of their deterrence in cyberspace, including, for instance, ‘subtle political and diplomatic pressure on cyberattackers or their supporters, sponsor or patrons’, like public exposure, reputational embarrassment, shaming, condemnation, embassy closures, expulsion and other forms of humiliation. Some authors caution, though, that skipping between the digital and physical (or kinetic) realms risks escalating a conflict in unanticipated ways. Other experts counter that some cyberattacks, like those that disrupt financial or political systems by degrading software or targeting data rather than hardware, are unlikely to escalate to the kinetic domain at all. Still others argue that cyber and\n Glaser, ‘Deterrence’; Will Goodman, ‘Cyber Deterrence’, Strategic Studies Quarterly, 2010; Lindsay, ‘Tipping’; Ben Buchanan, The Cybersecurity Dilemma (Oxford 2016), 145; Joseph Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, International Security 41/3 (2017), 51–52.\n Richard Harknett, et. al. ‘Leaving Deterrence Behind’, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management 7/1 (2010); Adam Liff, ‘Cyberwar: A New “Absolute Weapon?”’ Journal of Strategic Studies 35/3 (2012).\n Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Paul Rosenzweig, ‘The Organization of the United States Government and Private Sector for Achieving Cyber Deterrence’, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2010); Mike McConnell, ‘Cyberwar is the New Atomic Age’, New Perspectives Quarterly 26/3 (2009); James Adams, ‘Virtual Defense’, Foreign Affairs 80/3 (2001); Martin Libicki, Conquest in Cyberspace (Cambridge 2007), Chapter 11; Libicki, Cyberdeterrence (2009), Chapter Three; Libicki, ‘Cyberwar as a Confidence Game’, Strategic Studies Quarterly (Spring 2011); Martin Libicki, Cyberspace in Peace and War (Naval Institute Press 2016), Chapter 16 &amp; 17; Harknett, ‘Information Warfare’.\n James Lewis, ‘Cross-Domain Deterrence and Credible Threats’, CSIS Working Paper (July 2010); Jon Lindsay and Erik Gartzke (eds.), Cross-Domain Deterrence (under review 2018); Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff, ‘Cyberwar’; Herbert Lin, ‘Laying an Intellectual Foundation for Cyberdeterrence’, in Kruger et al., (eds.), The Secure Information Society (Springer-Verlag 2013).\n Mandel, Optimizing, 199–201.\n Lewis ‘Cross-Domain’; Anthony Cordesman and Justin Cordesman, Cyberthreats, Information Warfare, and Critical Infrastructure Protection (Praeger 2002), Chapter One; Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff ‘Cyberwar’; Lin ‘Laying’.\n Harknett et al., ‘Leaving’; Rid ‘Cyber War’; Thomas Rid, ‘More Attacks, Less Violence’, Journal of Strategic Studies 36/1 (2013).\n#\nA.

WILNER\nkinetic deterrence are not intrinsically separate: they intersect, compliment, and influence each other, such that retaliation in cyberspace may have unintended side-effects in non-cyber domains, like in international finance and diplomacy.[42] Conversely, successful deterrence in one domain may trigger deterrence failure in another, as occurs when successful kinetic deterrence compels an adversary to shift to cyberattacks.[43]\nA second research cluster centres on whether cyberspace favours offensive behaviour over defensive behaviour.[44] For instance, while the number of cyber targets grows exponentially and the process of safeguarding them more complex, the ease of conducting cyberattacks remains relatively stable and inexpensive. Nor can defenders expect forewarning of an imminent cyberattack, eliminating their ability to mount an immediate deterrent response. On the contrary: cyberattacks often go unnoticed, for months, even years. Other forms of cyberattack that rely on the logic of strategic surprise, Jim Writz warns, may compel a weaker adversary to present a traditionally strong defender, like the United States, with a 'fait accompli', such that the defender then faces the prospects of a costly response in returning to the status quo.[45] And traditional factors that mitigate offensive power in other domains of warfare – like the geographic distance between adversaries or resilient offensive weapons, including second strike capabilities – are much less evident in cyberwarfare, favouring intruders over defenders.[46] Relatedly, the sheer number of potential cyber adversaries complicates coercive calculations, creating a potential asymmetry in intent, capability, and resolve that favors aggressors.[47] Indeed, cyberspace augments the destructive power of weaker actors, including small, sub-state and non-sate networks.[48] Some authors conclude that cyber deterrence is a 'mirage', and that a warfighting framework is the only way to address 'cyberaggression'.[49] Still, other scholars caution against alarmism, noting that\n42Amir Lupovici, 'The \"Attribution Problem\" and the Social construction of \"Violence\"', International Studies Perspectives 17/3 (2016); Goodman, 'Cyber Deterrence'; Ronald Deibert and Rafal Rohozinkis, 'Risking Security', International Political Sociology 4 (2010); Joseph Nye, 'Cyber Power', Belfer Center, Harvard Kennedy School Working Paper, 2011.\n43Jon Lindsay, 'Stuxnet and the Limits of Cyber Wafare', Security Studies 22/3 (2013).\n44John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!'

Frustrating the preparation phase of a cyberattack may be especially valuable.[53] Associated concepts like cyber resilience or resistance, in which compromised digital systems continue to function, or adapt and heal themselves, may further augment cyber denial.[54] However, some scholars retort that adversaries incur very low costs when their cyberattacks fail, especially when attribution is uncertain, and are able to continue trying, even unsuccessfully, without incurring further costs, suggesting that denial, decoupled from attribution and punishment, may provide few coercive benefits.[55] A fourth and final subset of the literature explores whether norms, regimes, and stigmatisation might delegitimise certain cyberattacks and shape individual and collective behaviour accordingly.[56] For example, Joseph Nye, borrowing logic developed for intra-war deterrence during the Cold War that deterred the use of certain weapons,\n\nlike chemical and nuclear weapons, suggests that with cyberspace, a similar ‘taboo' might be constructed against certain types of cyberattack during peacetime, like those targeting civilian infrastructure and private sector facilities.\nIn sum, although a growing body of new literature explores the nuance and complexity of applying deterrence theory to cyber conflict, there is yet a great deal of division among scholars. Multiple poles within the research community exist. And much of the field is a conceptual extension of the literature on cyber warfare. Conflating warfare and deterrence makes a certain amount of sense given that deterrence is often a consequence of projecting military power. Yet this development has skewed the nascent literature on cyber deterrence in particular ways. First, IR deterrence is favoured, to the exclusion of the literature derived from criminology, psychology or other domains that have informed previous deterrence debates. Second, deterrence by punishment is overemphasised, such that denial, dissuasion, influence, delegitimisation and other concepts are often overlooked. Third, state actors figure prominently, to the near exclusion of the role non- and sub-state actors might have in deterring attacks in cyberspace. The coercive leverage of non-state cyber actors is rarely considered. Fourth, deterring high-end cyber threats dominates the research agenda. Deterring the far more common attributes of cyber insecurity, like cyber-crime, identity and property theft, data breaches and exfiltration, hacking (DDOS, malware, spear/phishing, whaling, ransomware), digital espionage, sabotage, bullying, and other concerns, goes largely unexplored. Fifth, policy prescription seems to dominate, while theoretical, methodological and empirical developments lag behind. Properly situating cyber deterrence within the larger IR literature, or within strategic studies, or political science, is wanting. Finally, few empirical evaluations of cyber deterrence have taken place, with the exceptions largely focusing on digital coercion among states actively involved in armed conflict.\nWhat follows is an exploration of how US cyber deterrence in practice has evolved over the past decades; lessons therein will help inform our theoretical understanding of how deterrence theory and cyberspace interact.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nAmerican cybersecurity strategy dates back to 2003, with the publication under President George W. Bush of the first standalone strategic document on cybersecurity – The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. [Figure 1 provides a timeline of relevant US cyber deterrence and cyber security doctrine.] At its core, the strategy is guided by three objectives: preventing cyberattacks against critical infrastructure; reducing vulnerability to cyberattacks; and mitigating damage from cyberattacks. The document further defines the distinct roles and responsibilities held by different cyber actors – from individual-level users of cyberspace, to institutions, businesses, and innovators, and the critical infrastructure sectors. ‘Protecting the widely distributed assets of cyberspace’, the strategy reads, ‘requires the efforts of many Americans. The federal government alone cannot sufficiently defend America’s cyberspace’. It also describes the national and international issues and concerns that require US Government leadership, including, for instance, building a national response system that identifies threats, promotes information exchange, advises on remediation, diminishes cyber vulnerabilities, and establishes international initiatives and multilateral endeavours with other states and non-state partners to collaboratively bolster cybersecurity at the global level.\nIn terms of deterrence specifically, the strategy weds various aspects of denial and punishment together, though the latter is mostly focused on domestic criminal prosecution. For illustration, at the local-level, touting roles for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the 2003 strategy lays bare the utility of using detection, apprehension, and prosecution of cyber-criminals (at home and, if possible, abroad) as a way to punish violations of domestic and international law. Here, some aspects of cyber aggression are treated to the logic of criminological deterrence (e.g., swift, certain and severe punishment). Bush’s 2003 National Strategy does not, however, overtly address cyber punishment or retaliation among states or at the international level. Only the oblique suggestion that the US response ‘need not be limited to criminal prosecution’, and that the US ‘reserves the right to respond in an appropriate manner’, hint at any larger retaliatory global strategy. While these pronouncements may have been obligatory, for the purposes of coercion they are also inherently weak. As the\nThe 2003 document was, however, preceded by several antecedent publications that outlined how the US envisioned cybersecurity, including, a Clinton-era Presidential Commission report (1997) and a 2000 National Plan on information security.

US cyber deterrence strategy timeline.\nprerequisites of deterrence theory suggest, deterrence works best when threats are clearly communicated and credible.\nIn terms of deterrence by denial, the 2003 National Strategy links mitigating the effects of cyberattacks, building less-vulnerable cyber systems and fostering cybersecurity awareness among all Americans, as a way to limit the feasibility and utility of conducting cyberattacks, making them less attractive as a result. Herein, the Strategy builds off preliminary recommendations President Bush established previously in 2001 in EO 13231 that provided\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nIndeed, Obama's legacy is marked by the rise of cyber offensive measures in US cyber deterrence doctrine.67 Upon taking office in January 2009, Obama ordered a review of US cybersecurity efforts, which largely subsumed an earlier review launched by President Bush in 2008, during his last year of office – the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) as developed by National Security Presidential Directive 54.68 The CNCI, started by Bush and completed by Obama as part of his Cyber Space Policy Review, broadened the scope of cyber security beyond what had been defined in the 2003 Strategy. CNCI established a dozen tasks for the US\n\nto accomplish over the coming years, including, at number 10: ‘define and develop enduring deterrence strategies and programs'. Though several sections of Presidential Directive 54 are redacted, what is left includes specific provisions relating to the roles the Department of Defence (DoD) and the US Intelligence Community have in securing, and deterring attacks within, cyberspace. For instance, the FBI was to establish the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, which would coordinate and integrate information from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), the US Secret Service, and other agencies, to augment criminal investigation and prosecution both in the US and overseas. DHS, with an assist from various other departments, was to establish the National Cybersecurity Center, to improve coordination in protecting and defending US Government communication, cyber, and information networks. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was instructed to develop a ‘cyber counterintelligence plan' to augment the 2007 National Counterintelligence Strategy (which mentioned ‘cyber' only a handful of times). The Secretaries of State, Defense, Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the DNI were to develop, jointly, a plan ‘for the coordination and application of offensive capabilities to defend U.S. information systems'. And, most importantly for our purposes, several agencies were called upon to ‘define and develop a comprehensive and coordinating strategy to deter interference and attacks in cyberspace'. Obama reiterated this latter goal in 2009 when he expanded the CNCI's objective. ‘Senior policymakers', the White House warned, ‘must think through the long-range strategic options available to the United States'. Cyber deterrence rested on improving ‘warning capabilities', articulating ‘roles for private sector and international partners', and developing ‘appropriate responses for both state and non-state actors'.\nObama moved quickly to implement and showcase the new US cyber deterrence posture. He began in 2009 by creating and filling a new position, the Executive Branch Cybersecurity Coordinator (aka, the White House cyber czar). Howard Schmidt, a former head of security at Microsoft, was tapped for the role, tasked with harmonising the various strategies and efforts that were being explored and enacted across the US government. Within the same year, the Department of Defense, in partnership with the NSA, established US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM, or Cybercom). Subordinate to US Strategic Command, housed at the NSA, and led by the director of the NSA, Cybercom was to use NSA networks to protect DoD computer and\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nDoD's cyber posture was initially defined in a relatively short 2011 document, DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, which built off the May 2010 National Security Strategy and February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The document provides five strategic initiatives relating to cyberspace, including that DoD will treat cyberspace as an 'operational domain' of warfare, and will 'organize, train, and equip' itself to 'take full advantage of cyberspace's potential'.[73] The core of DoD's new cyber offensive posture is Cybercom's 133 Cyber Mission Force (CMF) teams. Each team is tasked with supporting a specific component of DoD's comprehensive cyber mission. For example, twenty-seven distinct 'Combat Mission' teams provide 'cyberspace effects' in support of military and operational plans.[74] Other 'National Mission' and 'Protection Force' teams defend DoD and public networks and infrastructure by 'seeing adversary activity, blocking attacks, and maneuvering to defeat them'.[75] A subsequent 2011 DoD report provided to Congress, DoD Cyberspace Policy Report, provides much greater detail as to how the Pentagon's evolving cyber posture provides a cyber deterrent effect. The report clearly relates offensive cyber capabilities with deterrence: 'should the \"deny objectives\" element of deterrence not prove adequate, DoD maintains ... the ability to respond militarily in cyberspace and in other domains ... using cyber and/or kinetic capabilities'.[76] The report also highlights several other cyber deterrent issues and dilemmas the US will continue to face. They included: i) how to develop a US 'declaratory deterrence posture for cyberspace'; ii) the ways in which DoD will address the 'attribution' dilemma inherent to cyber deterrence by building 'cyber forensic capabilities' and 'behavior-based algorithms' for tracing the source of a cyberattack; iii) the dilemma DoD faces in demonstrating cyber capabilities and communicating plans for deterrent purposes without revealing sensitive tools, intelligence or techniques; and iv) how DoD will 'maintain control' of cyber escalation in times of crisis and war.\nThis last dilemma was subsequently tackled in a 2013 DoD Task Force Report, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, produced by the Defense Science Board. The report is perhaps most notable for openly suggesting that DoD cyber deterrence be anchored to offensive capabilities up to and including nuclear retaliation in the event of 'existential cyber attack'. The 2013 report goes on to chastise Obama's 2010 National\n\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nPosture Review (NPR) – which provided the President with guidance in nuclear policy – because it did ‘not explicitly mention’ and otherwise remained ‘essentially silent on [the] relationship between the U.S. nuclear deterrent … and the domain of cyber warfare’.77 Navy Admiral Michael Rogers, the chief of Cybercom and director of the NSA, later repurposed the nuclear analogy in his March 2015 testimony before the Senate Committee on Armed Services. ‘I liken our historical moment’, Rogers argued, ‘to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the [t]riad [sic] and underpinned by … policy structures including a declared deterrence posture’. On cyber offense, Rogers continues, the US must ‘commit time, effort, and resources to understanding our historical situation and building cyber military capabilities’.78 A month following Rogers’ testimony, DoD published The DoD Cyber Strategy (2015) its first such strategic document.\nThe 2015 Strategy enshrined Cybercom's expanding offensive purpose. The document, an expansive overview of cyberwarfare and cyber defence, helps guide the development and use of the CMF teams, going quite a distance in illustrating their ability, purpose, and potency. The document also defines deterrence by emphasising punishment, rather than denial, in cyberspace: 'The United States will continue to respond to cyberattacks against U.S. interests at a time, in a manner, and in a place of our choosing, using appropriate instruments of U.S. power'. By October 2016, all of Cybercom's CMF teams reached initial operating capability, translating into a force of roughly 6,000 cyber-warriors. A little over a year later, in January 2018, Cyber Command's headquarters - Joint Force Headquarters Department of Defense Information Network (JFHQ-DODIN) - itself became fully operational.\nSeparately, DoD again tasked the Defense Science Board to sharpen US cyber deterrence options, policy, and strategy, especially in the realm of deterrence by punishment. The DSB Task Force on Cyber Deterrence was established in October 2014; it published its final report in February 2017. Asked to explore the 'requirements for effective deterrence of cyber attacks' against the United States and its allies, and to identify digital and non-digital capabilities 'needed to support deterrence, war-fighting, and escalation control against a highly cyber-capable adversary', the Task Force focused\n77DoD Defense Science Board, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, 2013, 41.

The DSB makes several important suggestions. First, it introduces the term ‘deterrence by cost imposition' to replace the more commonly used term deterrence by punishment. The rationale, it would seem, is to broaden punishment's scope in keeping with the emerging logic of cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace. ‘Cost imposition' better captures the kinetic, diplomatic, economic, law enforcement, and digital forms of punishment that the US might use in responding to cyberattacks and exploitations. Second, the DSB bridges the divide between denial and punishment in cyberspace. ‘DoD must create a second-strike cyber resilient “Thin Line”' of critical US offensive systems (cyber, nuclear and conventional) and related infrastructure in order to ensure that the US can credibly threaten retaliation in response to a potentially crippling cyber first strike. Good defence and resilience feeds into the potency and certainty of threats of punishment. Third, the DSB affirms, rather bluntly, the continued asymmetry between offense and defence in cyberspace. ‘The unfortunate reality', the 2017 DSB report reads, ‘is that, for at least the coming five to ten years, the offensive cyber capabilities of our most capable potential adversaries are likely to far exceed the United Sates' ability to defend and adequately strengthen the resilience of its critical infrastructures'. US cyber offense, then, is needed to correct the perceptions of asymmetry between defenders and challengers. Finally, the DSB links cyber deterrence to reputation, past and future. It warns that not responding to a cyberattack -- once, presumably, US cyber deterrence has failed -- is, with ‘near-certainty ... an invitation to follow-on cyber attacks'. In sum, the DSB Task Force solidifies the primary role offense will have in US cyber deterrence posture and strategy of the emerging decades.\nWith its offensive building blocks in place, the US, first under President Obama and later, under President Trump, began flexing its cyber muscle. It surreptitiously destroyed centrifuges in Iran, sabotaging and delaying the country's nuclear weapons program. It explored using cyberspace to dismantle Libya's air defences leading up to the March 2011 military intervention. The US likewise targeted and sabotaged North Korea's missile development program. Elsewhere, Cybercom was charged with attacking ISIS's online presence and capability in support of US and coalition plans to degrade and defeat the terrorist organisation, and to digitally augment related kinetic operations in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. The US is thought to have also used cyberspace to retaliate against North Korea following its 2014 hack on Sony Pictures. Other forms of punishment were meted out by\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nthe Justice Department. New cyber attribution capabilities allowed DOJ, in 2014, 2016, and 2018 to indict over a dozen Chinese military hackers, seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel, and another two private Iranian citizens for stealing US intellectual property, computer hacking, and launching ransomware attacks, and several Russian military intelligence officers for a string of hacks targeting the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and sporting and anti-doping agencies in the US, Canada and Europe. Via EO 13687, President Obama likewise imposed additional sanctions on North Korea in January 2015 in direct response to the Sony Hack.[84] Finally, in his last days in office, President Obama sanctioned and expelled Russian nationals for their role in hacking the 2016 presidential election. Another 13 Russian nationals and three companies were subsequently charged by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of Special Council Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian's meddling in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Russia was again fingered by American and British officials in April 2018 for targeting and exploiting network infrastructure devices, like routers, for purposes of espionage.[85] The coercive message, all told, is that the US has developed the capability to trace and attribute cyberattacks conducted against it and its allies, and to launch punitive measures in cyberspace and across domains in response.\nIn hand with this shift towards cyber punishment, Obama also developed US declaratory posture for cyberspace and helped establish international norms for cyber engagement. From a deterrence perspective, it is not enough to simply have the tools to harm an adversary: you also need to establish and communicate red lines against which acts of retaliation will be measured. Norms that help identify what is and is not acceptable behaviour in cyberspace further solidify retaliatory threats. Obama's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace is the backbone of this process. 'The digital world is no longer a lawless frontier', President Obama's opening statement to the document reads, 'it is a place where the norms of responsible, just, and peaceful conduct among states and people have begun to take hold'.[86] The strategy outlines how the US would provide leadership in establishing global norms for cyber behaviour. The US State Department, for instance, went on to establish the world's first Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues (S/CCI) in February 2011, dedicated to coordinating the Department's diplomatic work on cyber and developing international cyber rules. Some 20\n84For an exploration of how and why North Korea's hack manipulated Sony's behaviour, which ultimately triggered the US response, see Travis Sharp, 'Theorizing Cyber Coercion: The 2014 North Korean Operation against Sony', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/7 (2017).\n85UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Joint US-UK Statement on Malicious Cyber Activity Carried out by Russian Government', 16 April 2018; UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Advisory: Russian Statesponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices', 16 April 2018.\n86The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace, 2011, 3.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nThe Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues was also instrumental in assisting a UN Group of Government Experts (GGE) establish a rudimentary list of cyber norms in 2015 (though the GGE failed in 2017 to subsequently link those norms to recommendations embedded in international law).88 In terms of cyber deterrence, the 2011 Strategy illustrates that the US will continue to bolster denial – redubbed here as ‘dissuasion’ – to deter attacks, but also strongly signals its ‘right to self-defense’ in conducting cyber retaliation. The US, the document reads, ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any threat to our country … and we recognize that certain hostile acts … could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic’.89 In line with these strategic pronouncements, the Obama Administration tried to make a distinction between cyber espionage for the purposes of statecraft – which was deemed legitimate – and cyber espionage, theft, and attack for the purposes of economic or domestic disruption and infrastructure destruction – all deemed illegitimate. Thus, on the one hand, China’s 2015 exfiltration of over 20 million personnel records from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was deemed ‘not an attack’ by James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, but rather good espionage; ‘[we] would have done the same thing’.90 But on the other hand, Russia’s 2015/16 hack, manipulation, and leak of Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee data during the 2016 presidential election was deemed by CIA Director, John Brennan, as a ‘new level of malicious activity’ meant to undermine and influence the institution of US democracy.91 In January 2017,\n\n#\nA.

WILNER\ntwo weeks before Trump's inauguration, DHS took the unprecedented step of classifying 'election infrastructure' as a critical infrastructure subsector, providing it with priority protection within the NIPP.[92]\nWhile the Trump Administration's cyberspace and cyber deterrence strategies are still being patched together, given the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date, and given what we know about Trump's leanings in international affairs, three things are likely to occur under his watch.\nFirst, threats of cyber retaliation and the logic of deterrence by punishment will continue to grow in importance. Pentagon officials have long sought more leeway from congress to engage in cyber offense. In 2017, Admiral Rogers, Cybercom's chief, lamented that 'offensive cyber is almost treated like nuclear weapons, in the sense that their application ... is controlled at the chief executive level and not delegated down. What I would like to see, over the next five to 10 years', is that US cyber weapons are viewed 'as another tool for the commanders' at the tactical level.[93] Signaling his acceptance of Rogers' position, President Trump, in August 2017, initiated the elevation of Cybercom to the status of a Unified Combatant Command (a step long-debated, but never taken, under Obama).[94] The transition places Cybercom at par with other unified commands, like US Strategic Command or US European Command, establishing a direct line of communication between Cybercom's director and the Secretary of Defense. And a year later, in August 2018, President Trump rescinded a 2012 Obama-era directive - Presidential Policy Directive 20 - that governed the manner in which cyberattacks were approved.[95] The reversal loosens the (somewhat onerous) restrictions that Obama had placed on conducting offensive cyber operations.\nFurthermore, Trump's February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (the first tabled since 2010), goes to some length in closing the cross-domain gap between nuclear weapons, nuclear retaliation, and cyber deterrence. Just as DoD's aforementioned Defense Science Board report recommended in 2013, the 2018 NPR expands the scope conditions that might lead to a US nuclear response as a result of a cyberattack. While US nuclear retaliation will continue to be reserved for 'extreme circumstances', the 2018 NPR significantly broadens these circumstances themselves to include 'significant non-nuclear strategic attacks', on 'civilian population or infrastructure'. Read:\n92Department of Homeland Security, 'Statement by Secretary Jeh Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector', 6 January 2017.\n93Cheryl Pellerin, 'Rogers Discusses near Future of U.S. Cyber Command', DoD News, 24 February 2017.\n94Separately, in February 2018, the White House signaled its intention to nominate Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone as Rogers' replacement at the helm of the NSA and Cybercom. The White House, Statement by President Donald J. Trump on the Elevation of Cyber Command, 18 August 2017; Chris Bing, 'White House Official: Paul Nakasone Nominated for NSA Director', CyberScoop, 13 February 2018.\n95Sean Lyngass, 'PPD-20 Elimination opens arguments over how US should Conduct Offensive Hacking Operations', CyberScoop, 16 August 2018.\ncrippling cyberattack. Additionally, perhaps cognizant that technology risks advancing more quickly than strategic policy, the NPR further warns that ‘the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of non-nuclear strategic attack technologies and U.S. capabilities to counter that threat'. Lest anyone misinterpret the document, DoD simultaneously published the NPR's Executive Summary in several languages, including Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Russian.\nThe logic of all of this was rolled into the State Department's ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats', a three-page brief published in May 2018 in direct response to EO 13800, and DoD's new Cyber Strategy, published in September 2018. The ‘Recommendations' report suggests that existing efforts at deterrence in cyberspace are ‘necessary but not sufficient': ‘network defense alone' is not enough. Calling for a ‘fundamental rethinking' of existing frameworks and a ‘new US vision' for cyber deterrence, the report recommends the development of a ‘broader menu of consequences' that the US can impose against state and non-state actors below ‘the threshold of the use of force'. With reference to the perennial issues of attribution and coercive credibility, the document calls for the US to openly demonstrate its ability to identify threats by imposing ‘swift, costly, and transparent consequences' on adversaries. Action will stand for credibility and might have ‘downstream deterrence effects'. Cyber offense is likewise paramount in DoD's 2018 Cyber Strategy. While the strategy itself is not publicity available, a 7-page summary is. And while this new strategy supersedes DoD's 2015 Strategy it compliments DoD's 2018 National Defense Strategy and the 2017 National Security Strategy. The document warns specific adversaries that the US will ‘build a more lethal force', conduct pre-emptive operations, ‘prepare for war', and collect cyber intelligence so as to field the ‘military cyber capabilities' the US needs to ‘defend forward'. A fuzzy term, defending forward implies terminating attacks at their (foreign) source, and ‘leveraging [US] focus outward to stop threats before they reach their targets'. By persistently engaging cyber competitors and aggressors on a daily basis, and by employing the Pentagon's full range of offensive capabilities, the US, the Strategy submits, will deter malicious cyber activities over time.\nSecond, and somewhat relatedly, under Trump, non-state actors may be encouraged to conduct cyber punishment and cyber offense themselves. The idea is to permit victims of cyber aggression and crime -- companies,\nA. S. WILNER\ninstitutions, NGOs, and individuals – to ‘hack back’ or counterattack via ‘active defense’ against their perpetrators. Under the current US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, it is illegal for individuals to gain entry into another’s computer system without permission. Though several US tech firms, including Google and Microsoft, have voiced concerns, Congress has nonetheless explored exceptions as part of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (first proposed in March 2017), and Georgia’s General Assembly passed a bill (later vetoed by the Governor) that would have made provisions for non-state active defence in cyberspace. Despite the controversy, some companies, including major US banks, have been reported to have surveyed the utility of hack backs to protect their servers, data, and assets. In a telling episode, Bossert, the former White House security advisor, and Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra, the chief cybersecurity official at DHS, heaped rare praise on Facebook and Microsoft during their lengthy December 2017 press-briefing in which the US officially blamed North Korea for conducting the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks. The attacks encrypted data on hundreds of thousands of public and private sector computers in over 150 countries. ‘We applaud our corporate partners’, Bossert asserted, ‘for acting on their own initiative … without any direction by the U.S. government … to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers. They shut down accounts … used to launch attacks and patched systems’. The destructive power and frequency of cyber hacking only grew under Obama. This trend will continue under Trump. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and wirelessly tethered Internet of Things (IoT) devices, along with new types of malicious activity like ransomware and sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, both of which can now be bought and sold on the Dark Web, will reshape the cyber threat landscape for individuals, communities, NGOs, and public and private-sector actors. Under the right conditions, non-state hack backs and other disruptive actions – the twenty-first century’s version of digital vigilantism – may prove useful for establishing a whole-of-society – rather than a whole-of-government – US cyber deterrence doctrine.\nFinally, in keeping with Trump’s general weariness of multilateralism and the United Nations in particular, the US is likely to downplay its role in establishing global cyber norms and focus instead on communicating its own red lines and bolstering the cyber deterrent posture of like-mined allied\nZaid Shoorbajee, ‘Google and Microsoft ask Georgia Governor to Veto “Hack Back” Bill’, *CyberScoop*, 27 April 2018; Ryan Johnston, ‘After Widespread outcry, Georgia Governor Vetoes “Hack Back” Bill’, *State Scoop*, 8 May 2018.\nDan Lohrmann, ‘Hack Back Law’, *Government Technology*, September 2017; Nicholas Schmidle, ‘The Digital Vigilantes who Hack Back’, *New Yorker*, 7 May 2018.\nThe White House, ‘Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea’, 19 December 2017.\nBruce Schneier, ‘Botnets of Things’, *MIT Technology Review*, March/April 2017.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nstates. The 2018 'Recommendations' report, for illustration, calls on the US to first establish criteria for US retaliation and to then communicate the policy both 'publicly and privately' so as to generate a deterrent effect. Separately, Trump shuttered the State Department's cyber coordinator's office, effectively degrading America's role in UN negotiations, though the Administration did test the waters for restarting the process of norm building in October 2018, following a ministerial meeting with US allies.[103] What appears more certain, however, is that the US is likely to seek bilateral cyber relations with other states and groups of states. At the Cyber Week 2017 gathering in Israel in June, for instance, the ever-present Bossert announced the US-Israel bilateral cyber working group – which was to be led by White House cyber czar, Rob Joyce, before his departure and the elimination his position – signalling Washington's preference for establishing cyber coalitions of the willing. '[W]e must', Bossert warned, 'hold those who violate [cyber] norms accountable. This may not be achievable through a UN effort. Likeminded states should work to develop options for imposing consequences within a coalition structure'.[104] In a similar vein, the US, in partnership with the UK, Germany and other NATO allies, aims to establish cyber warfare principles for 2019.[105] And, as the White House articulates in its 2018 Cyber Strategy, the US has plans to build a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative' that will convene a coalition of 'like-minded states' that can collectively develop 'tailored strategies' and jointly impose 'consequences against malign actors'.[106]\n# Conclusion: Evolution in theory\nUS cyber deterrence has come a long way since 2003. Definitions of deterrence – and core concepts linked to punishment and denial – have been revisited, reconceptualised, and broadened in scope. New government positions, institutions, agencies, and organisations have been created, staffed, trained, and tasked with operationalising core concepts. New technology, including software and hardware, has been developed and deployed. Partnerships across the US government, the private sector, and civil society have been established. And allies and international organisations have been leveraged. The footprints of all of these changes are evident in the record: US strategic doctrine allows us to trace the direction of this evolution. From a theoretical perspective, the way in which US cyber deterrence has been adapted since its inception provides\n103Sean Lyngaas, 'US Looks to Restart Talks on Global Cyber Norms', CyberScoop, October 2018.\n104The White House, 'Remarks by Homeland Security Advisor Thomas P. Bossert at Cyber Week 2017', 26 June 2017.\n105Robin Emmott, 'NATO mulls \"Offensive Defense\" with Cyber Warfare Rules', Reuters, 30 November 2017.\n\nscholars with insight as to how deterrence theory itself might respond to the promises and paradoxes of cyber deterrence. Several lessons stand out.\nFirst, US cyber deterrence has shifted from an almost exclusive focus on defence and deterrence by denial under President Bush to a punishment-based strategy under Presidents Obama and Trump. Part of the reason threats of retaliation and ‘deterrence by cost imposition' are currently emphasised is that recent technological advancements have allowed the US to improve its ability to monitor cyberattacks, identify perpetrators, and administer retaliatory actions, both within and outside cyberspace. Simply put, punishment strategies are increasingly feasible. Technological advancements have led to the adoption and use of new offensive coercive strategies. If so, theorists themselves should better situate technology into their own work of deterrence. How might the prerequisites of deterrence theory, and the concepts derived from them, adapt to novel, emerging, and disruptive technology within and beyond cyberspace?\nSecond, and relatedly, a separate reason US cyber punishment strategies have come to overshadow denial strategies has to do with the perception that deterrence by denial is not working, or rather, that the threat of denial used alone and separately from the threat of punishment, is not working. The number, severity and complexity of cyberattacks targeting US government and private sector facilities and assets has continued to rise over the past 15 years despite the US government's communicated threat of defence and denial. In response, US doctrine and strategy has evolved such that punishment is being used hand-in-glove with denial. For illustration, synchronising their efforts to defend the 2018 US midterm elections, DoD-DHS collaboration saw the former (via Cyber Command) target Russian operatives overseas to disrupt their actions all the while the latter worked with social media companies to counter disinformation. In practice, the two approaches reinforce each other. Recalibrating the effect punishment and denial have on each other in practice, suggests that theories of deterrence must better relate how the logic of punishment augments, or otherwise corresponds to, the logic of denial. Too often punishment and denial are considered poles apart, distinct levers applied separately to the cost-benefit calculus that underpins rational behaviour and coercion. In theory, how do punishment and denial relate and overlap; in cyberspace when does one stop and the other start?\nThird, the US has come to equate attribution as a distinct form of punishment that appears logically linked to denial. In fielding a question during the 2017 WannaCry press briefing, Bossert suggested, for instance, that ‘it's not about holding a country accountable; it's about simple culpability. We've determined who was behind the [WannaCry] attack, and we're saying it. ...\nWe're going to hold them accountable ... And we're going to shame them for it. ... And I think it's going to improve our security'. By identifying North Korea, the US denied it the benefit of anonymity in cyberspace; by publically outing North Korea, the US put the regime on notice for future punishment. From a theoretical perspective, however, attribution is largely understood as a mechanism, a crucial step that allows a defender to retaliate by identifying a challenger, rather than as a functional punishment in its own right. If so, and in light of perceptual changes in practice, deterrence theory must better explore whether, how, and under what conditions public attribution -- and the threat of shaming -- function as a source of cyber deterrence at the different levels of analysis. How might public and private attribution of an attack deter, coerce, or otherwise influence individual, non-state, and state cyber challengers?\nFourth, US cyber deterrence is not chiefly about military coercion. Notwithstanding Cybercom's emerging role in providing the US government with offensive and military options to punish cyber aggressors globally, US cyber deterrence strategy has emphasised the importance of several other departments and agencies, including DOJ, DHS, FBI, State Department and various others, for both denying and punishing cyberattacks. The goal is to equip the US government with as wide a set of coercive levers as possible, crossing domains as needed, to provide a truly whole of government approach to cybersecurity and cyber deterrence. The role of the DOJ (and the FBI by extension) is especially enlightening. By publicly indicting foreign nationals for cyberattacks conducted on American computer systems, the US government underscores the fact that contemporary cyber deterrence transcends traditional defence policy and military doctrine. By establishing the DOJ as a core pillar of its punishment strategy, the US signals its intention to use criminal justice tools to deter not just criminal attacks but attacks conducted by nation state adversaries. In doing so, the US further blurs the line between state institutions and individuals, by sanctioning the latter for actions they perpetrated while working for or on behalf of foreign governments, militaries, or intelligence agencies. For deterrence theory, the burgeoning role non-military and non-kinetic coercion have had in US cyber deterrence posture suggests that academics must redouble their efforts at multidisciplinarity. Academic silos still exist in the manner in which deterrence theory is developed and tested. To some degree, deterrence from within IR theory is privileged over that stemming from criminology, psychology, and terrorism and intelligence studies. This is especially the case when it comes to deterrence in national security and international affairs. Though the fourth wave of deterrence scholarship has gone to\nsome length to bridge the disciplinary divide, more cross-fertilisation is needed among disciplines to better reflect and speak to developments taking place in practice. What theoretical lessons do non-IR approaches to deterrence hold for how IR theories of cyber deterrence are developed and improved?\nFifth, US cyber deterrence is not solely about states, either. Rather, non-state actors figure prominently in American strategic doctrine as both potential perpetrators of cyberattacks targeting US infrastructure, and, more importantly for our purposes, as potential partners that amplify US cyber deterrence. For instance, private sector and individual victims of cyberattack share information, voluntarily, about attacks with law enforcement and intelligence. This provides governments with a better understanding of the nature, prevalence and evolution of certain types of attack, which can lead to improvements in defence and denial. In other cases, as highlighted by Facebook, Microsoft, and Marcus Hutchins -- a private British citizen who noticed a ‘kill switch' within WannaCry's code and took action to temporarily shut the attack down -- non-state actors can track and impede attacks without government oversight, further denying perpetrators the fruits of their labour. In still other cases, non-state actors, including companies, individuals, academics, NGOs, and other such groups, can augment US cyber security and deterrence by denial efforts by practicing better cyber hygiene -- i.e. updating passwords or patching software. This functions to further deny challengers easy opportunities to conduct successful attacks. On this front, Washington is exploring how it might compel (or, even, demand) private sector partners, contractors, and suppliers to do more to defend and secure their own networks, data and assets, as a precondition for working with and on behalf of the US government. In February 2018, for instance, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, in discussing the 2018 National Defense Strategy at a conference, warned that DoD wanted the cyber security ‘bar to be set so high, it will become the condition of doing business' with the Pentagon; for industry, cybersecurity will be ‘foundational to business with DoD'. The point, in this case, is to develop a whole of society deterrence posture, rather than simply a whole of government approach. The logic of all of this goes back to a statement made in President Bush's opening letter to the first 2003 cybersecurity strategy, oft repeated since: ‘Securing cyberspace is an extraordinarily difficult strategic challenge that requires a coordinated and focused effort from our entire society -- the federal government, state and local governments, the private sector, and the American people'. ‘Every American', the strategy continues ‘who can contribute to securing part of cyberspace is encouraged\nto do so. The federal government invites the creation of, and participation in, public-private partnerships to raise cybersecurity awareness, train personnel, stimulate market forces, improve technology, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, exchange information and plan recovery operations. Of the many ways in which the US government has previously approached deterrence in the other domains of warfare, this general call to arms is unique to cyberspace and cyber deterrence.\nIn response, scholars of deterrence need to explore the nature and feasibility of non-state cyber deterrence. Cyberspace is not a state-centric environment. On the contrary: states and militaries represent a tiny fraction of all the communities, individuals, and non-state actors that constitute cyberspace. Objects, too, have cyber presence. Projections suggest that 50 billion items -- from smart-homes to smart-cars, and from ‘intelligent' construction materials to wireless medical devices -- will be networked online as part of the IoT through an array of embedded electronics, software and sensors. All to say, the vast majority of interactions and the vast majority of the data created online is non-state in nature. Cyber deterrence theory must move beyond its narrow focus on states to account for the diversity of actors and objects that populate cyberspace. What is the equivalent in cyberspace of businesses, community groups, and homeowners employing storefront lighting, neighbourhood watch programs, and anti-burglary systems to deter physical attacks, theft and robbery? Can non-state actors be agents of their own deterrence in cyberspace?\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.",

In some ways cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine, and policy are developed and put to use even before corresponding theories are properly understood. This article analyses how American cyber deterrence has been implemented over the past two decades in order to inform ongoing debates within the academic study of deterrence, and to provide insights from practice for how cyber deterrence theory can be better conceived and refined.\nWhile President Donald Trump upbraided the previous administration's apparent weakness in cyberspace – ‘We’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing’ – his administration has itself struggled to table a coherent cyber deterrence strategy, despite repeated promises to do so quickly. As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to ‘develop the offensive cyber capabilities we need to deter attacks by both state and non-state actors’. Two weeks following his November 2017 election, President-elect Trump went on to explain further – that he would build ‘a comprehensive plan to protect America’s vital infrastructure against cyberattacks’. And months later still, as President, he signed Executive Order (EO) 13800 in May 2017 – an updated draft of a January 2017 EO that had been scraped at the last minute – on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. The EO describes a plan to reassess all elements of US cybersecurity across and beyond the government. In terms of cyber deterrence specifically, EO 13800 calls on various agencies and departments – including the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security, along with the Director of\nCONTACT Alex S.

A public version of the report eventually appeared in May 2018. $^{5}$\nPresident Trump was also slow to appoint or approve several top-level federal cybersecurity and technology positions – including, notably, Federal Chief Information Security Officer, and the head of DHS's cybersecurity and infrastructure protection division. $^{6}$ These positions are critical to guiding US cybersecurity policy and planning, including in the area of cyber deterrence. Despite all of this, (former) White House Homeland Security advisor, Thomas Bossert – who helped craft cybersecurity policy under US President George W. Bush – revealed in October 2017, that the Trump Administration was determined to eventually publish a new cybersecurity strategy based on EO 13800. $^{7}$ And in his January 2017 Confirmation Hearing, General James Mattis, President Trump's (former) Secretary of Defense, suggested that a comprehensive 'cyber doctrine' might be ready by July 2018. $^{8}$ The new National Cyber Strategy was eventually published in September 2018, after an earlier public summary was held back in May 2018. $^{9}$\nAlthough a US cyber deterrence strategy distinct from a broader cyber doctrine has yet to be established or fully leveraged, bits and pieces of the strategy exist, peppered about in different government departments and agencies. Indeed, US cyber deterrence has evolved a great deal since the mid-2000s. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, to better anticipate where US cyber deterrence is heading in practice by exploring the manner in which it has evolved through different presidential administrations. And second, to trace the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date to explore cyber deterrence in theory.

By the standards of deterrence theory, which has a robust and cumulative pedigree dating back over a century, cyber deterrence is an innovative but imperfectly understood idea. The bulk of the academic literature on cyber deterrence was produced only very recently, over the past fifteen years or so. Moreover, in some important ways, US cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine and policy have been developed, unveiled and put to use even before corresponding theories from academia are properly understood, tested and refined.\nIf practice precedes theory, then a reflection of how this practice progressed over time may help inform theory more broadly. Combined, these circumstances leave scholars with a unique opportunity to evaluate an example of cyber deterrence practice in order to explain and better describe cyber deterrence theory. In methodological terms, this article explores how American cyber deterrence has been implemented in order to better highlight theory more broadly. The United States, by dint of its size, pre-eminence in cyberspace and decades of experience operationalising deterrence theory in other domains, represents a crucial case. Moreover, in empirical terms, the US government openly discusses cybersecurity, and has made various iterations of its cyber deterrence strategy and doctrine publicly available. While a comprehensive US cyber deterrence strategy has yet to be tabled, fragments of the strategy can be patched together, piecemeal, from various US government bodies. A record of thought and practice exists; wading through it provides insights for theory.\nThe article begins with a summary of the academic literature on deterrence theory dating back to the beginning of the Cold War. The rationale here is to outline the nuts and bolts of deterrence theory, highlight conceptual prerequisites, illustrate the many ways deterrence has been operationalised, and briefly assess the ‘four waves' of deterrence scholarship. Next, the article takes a broad look at cyber deterrence theory in particular. The purpose is to discuss the core debates and research clusters embedded within this particular sub-field of the literature. Doing so will provide a theoretical foundation against which the empirical work can be paired against. An exploration of US cyber deterrence then follows. This section will provide a detailed and linear reflection of US cyber deterrence strategy, doctrine and policy stretching back to the early 2000s. The analysis will piece together how US strategy has unfolded and evolved over time, and help identify specific concepts, trends and assumptions baked into strategic\n#\nA. S. WILNER\ndiscourse. Highlights from the US example will then be analysed in the conclusion of the article. The way the United States has put cyber deterrence into practice over time provides lessons and insights for how cyber deterrence theory might be better conceived, approached and refined.\n# Deterrence in theory: Concepts and debates\nDeterrence is an enduring concept. It has repeatedly proven its flexibility in responding to, and evolving from, shifting international and interstate dynamics. Deterrence, at its theoretical core, entails using threats to manipulate an adversary's behaviour.[11] More concretely, it rests on convincing another actor to forgo an unwanted action. Compellence – a related concept – flips the process around, prompting an adversary to pursue an action it might otherwise have avoided. Compellence encourages behaviour, whereas deterrence restrains it. Both are subsumed within the logic of coercion. In all cases of deterrence and compellence, a minimum of two actors are involved. Defenders issue threats to alter an opponent's behaviour; challengers consider these threats, weigh their options, and decide whether or not to acquiesce. In some cases, a third actor is involved. With extended deterrence, for instance, a proxy, partner, or ally is also included in the process, either on the side of the defender or the challenger. Threats of punishment – usually in the form of retaliation – and promises of denial – usually in the form of depriving an adversary the expected benefits of a particular behaviour – form the basis for most deterrent and compellent engagements, though normative and ideological considerations that inform behaviour have also been recently developed within the context of delegitimisation. Each of these three coercive processes is linked to the logic of deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial, and deterrence by delegitimisation, respectively.[12]\nDeterrence works by informing a challenger's cost-benefit calculus. Importantly, it does so by weighing upon another's strategic choice.[13] Militarily crushing an adversary, as Thomas Schelling reminds us, such that it has no alternative but to accept demands made of it is not deterrence, but rather defeat.[14] The same can be said in the realm of denial. Developing a perfect, foolproof defence, while rare, does not deter by denial but rather deters by defeat; an adversary does not penetrate a target or conduct a certain attack because it is prevented from doing so, not because it decides\n[11] Moving beyond theory and strategy, Amir Lupovici contends that deterrence is also an idea, internalized within the identity of those who rely on it. Lupvici, *The Power of Deterrence* (Cambridge 2016).\n[12] On the latter, see for instance, Jerry Mark Long and Alex Wilner, 'Delegitimizing al-Qaida: Defeating an \"Army Whose Men Love Death\"', *International Security* 39/1 (2014).\n[13] Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge: Polity Press 2004), 26.\n[14] Thomas Schelling, *Arms and Influence* (1966), 1–34.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nPut into practice, deterrence theory rests on a number of pre-requisites. First, actors must exhibit a degree of rationality, such that some combination of threats will suffice to alter behaviour. Second, overlapping preferences short of open conflict must be shared by all parties; deterrence requires that adversaries accept the feasibility of non-violence. Third, threats, expected changes in behaviour and a willingness to punish violations must be communicated. Defenders must likewise reassure challengers that threats will not be carried out in the event demands are met. Fourth, defenders must have the perceived capability, and the resolve to punish or deny as threatened. Finally, deterrence works best again a known or suspected adversary; anonymity robs deterrence of its potency.\nBuilding off these prerequisites and core conceptual tenets, deterrence theory has evolved in new and exciting ways over the past several decades. This process of theoretical rejuvenation and praxis has been the result of both changing geostrategic realities (from bipolarity to unipolarity and back, for instance), and because of the emergence of new technology (from nuclear weapons to artificial intelligence) and security domains (including air, space and cyberspace). For illustration of this evolution, consider these various concepts. Central deterrence – which functions to protect a defender's assets – stands against extended (or triadic) deterrence – which functions to protect a third party's assets. Broad deterrence – which deters aggression writ large – stands against narrow deterrence – which deters a specific, and often limited, behaviour. Similarly, general deterrence seeks to\n Alex Wilner, ‘Contemporary Deterrence Theory Counterterrorism: A Bridge too Far?’ NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 47/2 (2015).\n The literature is expansive. For a reference point, consider these various meta-analyses of the empirical record: Anthony Braga and David Weisburd, ‘The Effects of Focused Deterrence Strategies on Crime’, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency 49 (2012); Rob Guerette and Kate Bowers, ‘Assessing the Extent of Crime Displacement and Diffusion of Benefits’, Criminology 47/4 (2009); Trevor Bennett, Katy Holloway, and David Farrington, ‘Does Neighborhood Watch Reduce Crime?’ Journal of Experimental Criminology 2/4 (2006); David Farrington, et al., ‘The Effects of Closed-Circuit Television on Crime’, Journal of Experimental Criminology 3 (2007).\n See, for illustration Kevin Woods and Mark Stout, ‘Saddam’s Perceptions and Misperceptions’, Journal of Strategic Studies 33/1 (2010); Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein, ‘Rational Deterrence Theory: I Think, Therefore I Deter’, World Politics 41/2 (1989); Robert Jervis, Richard Ned Lebow, and Janice Gross Stein, Psychology and Deterrence (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 1985); Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (Random House 2011).\nregulate and uphold accepted, status quo relations, whereas immediate deterrence functions within periods of crisis and against expected anti-status quo behaviour. Intra-war deterrence shapes certain behaviour within an ongoing hot war, after other forms of deterrence have already failed; the goal here is to influence an adversary's warfighting behaviour itself. Cumulative or serial deterrence is iterative; it functions by adding up the effects of repeated coercive interactions. Moving beyond threats, inducements, deflection, dissuasion, entanglement and influence have each been added to deterrence theory, too, broadening the manner in which defenders secure their interests and shape adversarial behaviour.\nWithin IR, deterrence scholarship has evolved within the context of ‘four waves', borrowing insights from other disciplines, namely criminology, terrorism studies, and psychology. The first wave emerged around the end of the Second World War, and corresponded to the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology within a US-dominated strategic backdrop. The second wave began in the early days of the Cold War. US-Soviet dynamics and alliance structures shaped the wave's research agenda, as did the limited proliferation of nuclear weapons to US allies, like France and the UK, and rivals, like China. The second wave used game theory and scientific modelling to explore how rivals could manage nuclear escalation and alliances. Focus was placed on strategic and conventional deterrence by punishment -- and to a much lesser degree on conventional deterrence by denial in Europe and Asia -- and on major power conflict pitting mutually rational and unitary state actors. The third wave began in the 1970s. Its focus was on empiricism, on qualitatively and quantitatively testing the concepts, frameworks and theories previously proposed. Findings suggested the importance of commitment, communication, and resolve in using both central and extended deterrence, and illustrated the variance embedded within the concept of expected utility. The psychology of coercion (e.g. human cognition and thought, bias, fatigue, decision-making, misperception, and error), along with notions of strategic culture, bureaucracy and leadership also emerged.\nThe fourth wave followed the end of the Cold War and continues today. A traditional focus on bipolarity, strategic weapons, and great power rivalries gave way to a diffusion of interests, both between and below state actors. In terms of scholarship, the fourth wave is both especially dynamic, and slightly chaotic: everything and everyone under the sun is in focus. Included here is work on deterring rogue states -- traditionally weak states and militaries often in possession of limited nuclear or chemical and biological weapons, like Iraq, Iran,\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nSerbia, North Korea, Syria, and Libya. $^{19}$  Violent non-state actors have likewise been the focus of fourth wave scholarship, from pirates to ISIS and everyone in between, along with the processes of radicalisation, rebellion, insurgency, and political violence. $^{20}$  And while deterrence in space was a concern during the Cold War, it largely featured a limited number of actors, the US and USSR. But in the fourth wave, space deterrence features new entrants, like India, China, Israel, and private sector actors, including SpaceX and Blue Origin, and rapidly diffusing technology, including new forms of anti-satellite weaponry (ASAT), miniature satellites, and privately owned, reusable mega-rockets. As the scope of deterrence has broadened, so, too, has the practice of deterrence: the logic of denial has been expanded beyond its conventional limits, as has extended deterrence. $^{21}$  And altogether novel concepts, like cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace, have been proposed and tested. $^{22}$\n# Cyber deterrence in theory: Core research clusters\nResearch on cyber deterrence is largely rooted to the classical literature on deterrence stemming from IR.

The 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace defines it as a 'nervous system' or 'control system' for US critical infrastructure, comprised of 'hundreds of thousands of interconnected computers, servers, routers, switches, and fiber optic cables'. The 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations later defined cyberspace as a 'domain', characterized by 'the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures'. And in a 2008 memo, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England defined cyberspace as 'a global domain', consisting of 'the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'. While definitions of cyberspace continue to evolve, for the purposes of this paper, cyberspace is understood as a global, interconnected domain constituting hardware, digital data, and related infrastructrue in which electronic devices are used to create, save and disseminate information. The phrase 'cyber deterrence' also lacks a precise definition. At its broadest, cyber deterrence is a field of study - as deterring terrorism might be thought of - that involves applying and exploring the logic, theory, and practice of deterrence within cyberspace. More narrowly, cyber deterrence might be understood as the deterrence of attacks within or using cyberspace, or conversely, the use of cyberspace to accomplish deterrence in other domains. This paper relies on the broader definition but highlights the narrow use of the term where necessary.\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nThe largest cluster explores the manner in which the prerequisites of IR deterrence apply to cyberspace. By these standards some scholars conclude that the architecture of cyberspace – anonymity, complexity, interconnectivity, jurisdictional diffusion, open access – makes cyber deterrence inherently weak.[24] The fundamental prerequisites are not easily met. Herein, the attribution dilemma receives greatest attention.[25] The ease of digital obfuscation,[26] complexity of 'multi-stage' cyberattacks,[27] difficulty in signalling or communicating threats and deterrent capabilities,[28] and challenge of uncovering the physical source of a cyberattack,[29] can complicate how defenders construct and communicate credible coercive threats. If cyber adversaries believe that their identities are protected, retaliatory threats will fall short. A range of tentative solutions have been proposed. More sophisticated attribution capabilities, processes, and standards might be developed.[30] Or, the Internet could be reengineered as an attributed network.[31] Or, sources of a cyberattack might be better deduced weighing known capabilities, interests, and motivation of likely adversaries.[32] Or, third party enablers of cyberattacks (i.e., owners of cyber infrastructure, and other private sector actors) might be held better accountable.[33] Or, the threshold of 'certain identification' when contemplating retaliation can be lowered.[34] Still other authors illustrate how cyber attribution is not, in fact, as potent a\n24The Economist (Benjamin Sutherland, ed.)

A paradox emerges: technologically advanced states are both the most able to conduct offensive cyberattacks, and the most susceptible to such attacks. Weak states and non-state adversaries with fewer cyber platforms, conversely, have less to fear from cyberwar and much to gain by escalating a confrontation to digital space, where they may have advantages over traditionally stronger powers. That asymmetry may destabilise cyber deterrence. Skirting this particular paradox may involve combining cyber threats with more traditional kinetic and non-kinetic threats, effectively adding military punishment, law enforcement, diplomatic and financial sanctions, and public shaming to the cyber mix. This cross-domain deterrent approach addresses cyber credibility by tackling on traditional forms of retaliation to the equation. Robert Mandel suggests further that defenders use ‘unorthodox’ means to enhance the potency of their deterrence in cyberspace, including, for instance, ‘subtle political and diplomatic pressure on cyberattackers or their supporters, sponsor or patrons’, like public exposure, reputational embarrassment, shaming, condemnation, embassy closures, expulsion and other forms of humiliation. Some authors caution, though, that skipping between the digital and physical (or kinetic) realms risks escalating a conflict in unanticipated ways. Other experts counter that some cyberattacks, like those that disrupt financial or political systems by degrading software or targeting data rather than hardware, are unlikely to escalate to the kinetic domain at all. Still others argue that cyber and\n Glaser, ‘Deterrence’; Will Goodman, ‘Cyber Deterrence’, Strategic Studies Quarterly, 2010; Lindsay, ‘Tipping’; Ben Buchanan, The Cybersecurity Dilemma (Oxford 2016), 145; Joseph Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, International Security 41/3 (2017), 51–52.\n Richard Harknett, et. al. ‘Leaving Deterrence Behind’, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management 7/1 (2010); Adam Liff, ‘Cyberwar: A New “Absolute Weapon?”’ Journal of Strategic Studies 35/3 (2012).\n Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Paul Rosenzweig, ‘The Organization of the United States Government and Private Sector for Achieving Cyber Deterrence’, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2010); Mike McConnell, ‘Cyberwar is the New Atomic Age’, New Perspectives Quarterly 26/3 (2009); James Adams, ‘Virtual Defense’, Foreign Affairs 80/3 (2001); Martin Libicki, Conquest in Cyberspace (Cambridge 2007), Chapter 11; Libicki, Cyberdeterrence (2009), Chapter Three; Libicki, ‘Cyberwar as a Confidence Game’, Strategic Studies Quarterly (Spring 2011); Martin Libicki, Cyberspace in Peace and War (Naval Institute Press 2016), Chapter 16 &amp; 17; Harknett, ‘Information Warfare’.\n James Lewis, ‘Cross-Domain Deterrence and Credible Threats’, CSIS Working Paper (July 2010); Jon Lindsay and Erik Gartzke (eds.), Cross-Domain Deterrence (under review 2018); Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff, ‘Cyberwar’; Herbert Lin, ‘Laying an Intellectual Foundation for Cyberdeterrence’, in Kruger et al., (eds.), The Secure Information Society (Springer-Verlag 2013).\n Mandel, Optimizing, 199–201.\n Lewis ‘Cross-Domain’; Anthony Cordesman and Justin Cordesman, Cyberthreats, Information Warfare, and Critical Infrastructure Protection (Praeger 2002), Chapter One; Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff ‘Cyberwar’; Lin ‘Laying’.\n Harknett et al., ‘Leaving’; Rid ‘Cyber War’; Thomas Rid, ‘More Attacks, Less Violence’, Journal of Strategic Studies 36/1 (2013).\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nkinetic deterrence are not intrinsically separate: they intersect, compliment, and influence each other, such that retaliation in cyberspace may have unintended side-effects in non-cyber domains, like in international finance and diplomacy.[42] Conversely, successful deterrence in one domain may trigger deterrence failure in another, as occurs when successful kinetic deterrence compels an adversary to shift to cyberattacks.[43]\nA second research cluster centres on whether cyberspace favours offensive behaviour over defensive behaviour.[44] For instance, while the number of cyber targets grows exponentially and the process of safeguarding them more complex, the ease of conducting cyberattacks remains relatively stable and inexpensive. Nor can defenders expect forewarning of an imminent cyberattack, eliminating their ability to mount an immediate deterrent response. On the contrary: cyberattacks often go unnoticed, for months, even years. Other forms of cyberattack that rely on the logic of strategic surprise, Jim Writz warns, may compel a weaker adversary to present a traditionally strong defender, like the United States, with a 'fait accompli', such that the defender then faces the prospects of a costly response in returning to the status quo.[45] And traditional factors that mitigate offensive power in other domains of warfare – like the geographic distance between adversaries or resilient offensive weapons, including second strike capabilities – are much less evident in cyberwarfare, favouring intruders over defenders.[46] Relatedly, the sheer number of potential cyber adversaries complicates coercive calculations, creating a potential asymmetry in intent, capability, and resolve that favors aggressors.[47] Indeed, cyberspace augments the destructive power of weaker actors, including small, sub-state and non-sate networks.[48] Some authors conclude that cyber deterrence is a 'mirage', and that a warfighting framework is the only way to address 'cyberaggression'.[49] Still, other scholars caution against alarmism, noting that\n42Amir Lupovici, 'The \"Attribution Problem\" and the Social construction of \"Violence\"', International Studies Perspectives 17/3 (2016); Goodman, 'Cyber Deterrence'; Ronald Deibert and Rafal Rohozinkis, 'Risking Security', International Political Sociology 4 (2010); Joseph Nye, 'Cyber Power', Belfer Center, Harvard Kennedy School Working Paper, 2011.\n43Jon Lindsay, 'Stuxnet and the Limits of Cyber Wafare', Security Studies 22/3 (2013).\n44John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!'

Frustrating the preparation phase of a cyberattack may be especially valuable.[53] Associated concepts like cyber resilience or resistance, in which compromised digital systems continue to function, or adapt and heal themselves, may further augment cyber denial.[54] However, some scholars retort that adversaries incur very low costs when their cyberattacks fail, especially when attribution is uncertain, and are able to continue trying, even unsuccessfully, without incurring further costs, suggesting that denial, decoupled from attribution and punishment, may provide few coercive benefits.[55] A fourth and final subset of the literature explores whether norms, regimes, and stigmatisation might delegitimise certain cyberattacks and shape individual and collective behaviour accordingly.[56] For example, Joseph Nye, borrowing logic developed for intra-war deterrence during the Cold War that deterred the use of certain weapons,\n\nlike chemical and nuclear weapons, suggests that with cyberspace, a similar ‘taboo' might be constructed against certain types of cyberattack during peacetime, like those targeting civilian infrastructure and private sector facilities.\nIn sum, although a growing body of new literature explores the nuance and complexity of applying deterrence theory to cyber conflict, there is yet a great deal of division among scholars. Multiple poles within the research community exist. And much of the field is a conceptual extension of the literature on cyber warfare. Conflating warfare and deterrence makes a certain amount of sense given that deterrence is often a consequence of projecting military power. Yet this development has skewed the nascent literature on cyber deterrence in particular ways. First, IR deterrence is favoured, to the exclusion of the literature derived from criminology, psychology or other domains that have informed previous deterrence debates. Second, deterrence by punishment is overemphasised, such that denial, dissuasion, influence, delegitimisation and other concepts are often overlooked. Third, state actors figure prominently, to the near exclusion of the role non- and sub-state actors might have in deterring attacks in cyberspace. The coercive leverage of non-state cyber actors is rarely considered. Fourth, deterring high-end cyber threats dominates the research agenda. Deterring the far more common attributes of cyber insecurity, like cyber-crime, identity and property theft, data breaches and exfiltration, hacking (DDOS, malware, spear/phishing, whaling, ransomware), digital espionage, sabotage, bullying, and other concerns, goes largely unexplored. Fifth, policy prescription seems to dominate, while theoretical, methodological and empirical developments lag behind. Properly situating cyber deterrence within the larger IR literature, or within strategic studies, or political science, is wanting. Finally, few empirical evaluations of cyber deterrence have taken place, with the exceptions largely focusing on digital coercion among states actively involved in armed conflict.\nWhat follows is an exploration of how US cyber deterrence in practice has evolved over the past decades; lessons therein will help inform our theoretical understanding of how deterrence theory and cyberspace interact.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nAmerican cybersecurity strategy dates back to 2003, with the publication under President George W. Bush of the first standalone strategic document on cybersecurity – The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. [Figure 1 provides a timeline of relevant US cyber deterrence and cyber security doctrine.] At its core, the strategy is guided by three objectives: preventing cyberattacks against critical infrastructure; reducing vulnerability to cyberattacks; and mitigating damage from cyberattacks. The document further defines the distinct roles and responsibilities held by different cyber actors – from individual-level users of cyberspace, to institutions, businesses, and innovators, and the critical infrastructure sectors. ‘Protecting the widely distributed assets of cyberspace’, the strategy reads, ‘requires the efforts of many Americans. The federal government alone cannot sufficiently defend America’s cyberspace’. It also describes the national and international issues and concerns that require US Government leadership, including, for instance, building a national response system that identifies threats, promotes information exchange, advises on remediation, diminishes cyber vulnerabilities, and establishes international initiatives and multilateral endeavours with other states and non-state partners to collaboratively bolster cybersecurity at the global level.\nIn terms of deterrence specifically, the strategy weds various aspects of denial and punishment together, though the latter is mostly focused on domestic criminal prosecution. For illustration, at the local-level, touting roles for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the 2003 strategy lays bare the utility of using detection, apprehension, and prosecution of cyber-criminals (at home and, if possible, abroad) as a way to punish violations of domestic and international law. Here, some aspects of cyber aggression are treated to the logic of criminological deterrence (e.g., swift, certain and severe punishment). Bush’s 2003 National Strategy does not, however, overtly address cyber punishment or retaliation among states or at the international level. Only the oblique suggestion that the US response ‘need not be limited to criminal prosecution’, and that the US ‘reserves the right to respond in an appropriate manner’, hint at any larger retaliatory global strategy. While these pronouncements may have been obligatory, for the purposes of coercion they are also inherently weak. As the\nThe 2003 document was, however, preceded by several antecedent publications that outlined how the US envisioned cybersecurity, including, a Clinton-era Presidential Commission report (1997) and a 2000 National Plan on information security.

US cyber deterrence strategy timeline.\nprerequisites of deterrence theory suggest, deterrence works best when threats are clearly communicated and credible.\nIn terms of deterrence by denial, the 2003 National Strategy links mitigating the effects of cyberattacks, building less-vulnerable cyber systems and fostering cybersecurity awareness among all Americans, as a way to limit the feasibility and utility of conducting cyberattacks, making them less attractive as a result. Herein, the Strategy builds off preliminary recommendations President Bush established previously in 2001 in EO 13231 that provided\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nIndeed, Obama's legacy is marked by the rise of cyber offensive measures in US cyber deterrence doctrine.67 Upon taking office in January 2009, Obama ordered a review of US cybersecurity efforts, which largely subsumed an earlier review launched by President Bush in 2008, during his last year of office – the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) as developed by National Security Presidential Directive 54.68 The CNCI, started by Bush and completed by Obama as part of his Cyber Space Policy Review, broadened the scope of cyber security beyond what had been defined in the 2003 Strategy. CNCI established a dozen tasks for the US\n\nto accomplish over the coming years, including, at number 10: ‘define and develop enduring deterrence strategies and programs'. Though several sections of Presidential Directive 54 are redacted, what is left includes specific provisions relating to the roles the Department of Defence (DoD) and the US Intelligence Community have in securing, and deterring attacks within, cyberspace. For instance, the FBI was to establish the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, which would coordinate and integrate information from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), the US Secret Service, and other agencies, to augment criminal investigation and prosecution both in the US and overseas. DHS, with an assist from various other departments, was to establish the National Cybersecurity Center, to improve coordination in protecting and defending US Government communication, cyber, and information networks. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was instructed to develop a ‘cyber counterintelligence plan' to augment the 2007 National Counterintelligence Strategy (which mentioned ‘cyber' only a handful of times). The Secretaries of State, Defense, Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the DNI were to develop, jointly, a plan ‘for the coordination and application of offensive capabilities to defend U.S. information systems'. And, most importantly for our purposes, several agencies were called upon to ‘define and develop a comprehensive and coordinating strategy to deter interference and attacks in cyberspace'. Obama reiterated this latter goal in 2009 when he expanded the CNCI's objective. ‘Senior policymakers', the White House warned, ‘must think through the long-range strategic options available to the United States'. Cyber deterrence rested on improving ‘warning capabilities', articulating ‘roles for private sector and international partners', and developing ‘appropriate responses for both state and non-state actors'.\nObama moved quickly to implement and showcase the new US cyber deterrence posture. He began in 2009 by creating and filling a new position, the Executive Branch Cybersecurity Coordinator (aka, the White House cyber czar). Howard Schmidt, a former head of security at Microsoft, was tapped for the role, tasked with harmonising the various strategies and efforts that were being explored and enacted across the US government. Within the same year, the Department of Defense, in partnership with the NSA, established US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM, or Cybercom). Subordinate to US Strategic Command, housed at the NSA, and led by the director of the NSA, Cybercom was to use NSA networks to protect DoD computer and\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nDoD's cyber posture was initially defined in a relatively short 2011 document, DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, which built off the May 2010 National Security Strategy and February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The document provides five strategic initiatives relating to cyberspace, including that DoD will treat cyberspace as an 'operational domain' of warfare, and will 'organize, train, and equip' itself to 'take full advantage of cyberspace's potential'.[73] The core of DoD's new cyber offensive posture is Cybercom's 133 Cyber Mission Force (CMF) teams. Each team is tasked with supporting a specific component of DoD's comprehensive cyber mission. For example, twenty-seven distinct 'Combat Mission' teams provide 'cyberspace effects' in support of military and operational plans.[74] Other 'National Mission' and 'Protection Force' teams defend DoD and public networks and infrastructure by 'seeing adversary activity, blocking attacks, and maneuvering to defeat them'.[75] A subsequent 2011 DoD report provided to Congress, DoD Cyberspace Policy Report, provides much greater detail as to how the Pentagon's evolving cyber posture provides a cyber deterrent effect. The report clearly relates offensive cyber capabilities with deterrence: 'should the \"deny objectives\" element of deterrence not prove adequate, DoD maintains ... the ability to respond militarily in cyberspace and in other domains ... using cyber and/or kinetic capabilities'.[76] The report also highlights several other cyber deterrent issues and dilemmas the US will continue to face. They included: i) how to develop a US 'declaratory deterrence posture for cyberspace'; ii) the ways in which DoD will address the 'attribution' dilemma inherent to cyber deterrence by building 'cyber forensic capabilities' and 'behavior-based algorithms' for tracing the source of a cyberattack; iii) the dilemma DoD faces in demonstrating cyber capabilities and communicating plans for deterrent purposes without revealing sensitive tools, intelligence or techniques; and iv) how DoD will 'maintain control' of cyber escalation in times of crisis and war.\nThis last dilemma was subsequently tackled in a 2013 DoD Task Force Report, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, produced by the Defense Science Board. The report is perhaps most notable for openly suggesting that DoD cyber deterrence be anchored to offensive capabilities up to and including nuclear retaliation in the event of 'existential cyber attack'. The 2013 report goes on to chastise Obama's 2010 National\n\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nPosture Review (NPR) – which provided the President with guidance in nuclear policy – because it did ‘not explicitly mention’ and otherwise remained ‘essentially silent on [the] relationship between the U.S. nuclear deterrent … and the domain of cyber warfare’.77 Navy Admiral Michael Rogers, the chief of Cybercom and director of the NSA, later repurposed the nuclear analogy in his March 2015 testimony before the Senate Committee on Armed Services. ‘I liken our historical moment’, Rogers argued, ‘to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the [t]riad [sic] and underpinned by … policy structures including a declared deterrence posture’. On cyber offense, Rogers continues, the US must ‘commit time, effort, and resources to understanding our historical situation and building cyber military capabilities’.78 A month following Rogers’ testimony, DoD published The DoD Cyber Strategy (2015) its first such strategic document.\nThe 2015 Strategy enshrined Cybercom's expanding offensive purpose. The document, an expansive overview of cyberwarfare and cyber defence, helps guide the development and use of the CMF teams, going quite a distance in illustrating their ability, purpose, and potency. The document also defines deterrence by emphasising punishment, rather than denial, in cyberspace: 'The United States will continue to respond to cyberattacks against U.S. interests at a time, in a manner, and in a place of our choosing, using appropriate instruments of U.S. power'. By October 2016, all of Cybercom's CMF teams reached initial operating capability, translating into a force of roughly 6,000 cyber-warriors. A little over a year later, in January 2018, Cyber Command's headquarters - Joint Force Headquarters Department of Defense Information Network (JFHQ-DODIN) - itself became fully operational.\nSeparately, DoD again tasked the Defense Science Board to sharpen US cyber deterrence options, policy, and strategy, especially in the realm of deterrence by punishment. The DSB Task Force on Cyber Deterrence was established in October 2014; it published its final report in February 2017. Asked to explore the 'requirements for effective deterrence of cyber attacks' against the United States and its allies, and to identify digital and non-digital capabilities 'needed to support deterrence, war-fighting, and escalation control against a highly cyber-capable adversary', the Task Force focused\n77DoD Defense Science Board, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, 2013, 41.

Nancy Norton took command of the Headquarters in February 2018.

The DSB makes several important suggestions. First, it introduces the term ‘deterrence by cost imposition' to replace the more commonly used term deterrence by punishment. The rationale, it would seem, is to broaden punishment's scope in keeping with the emerging logic of cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace. ‘Cost imposition' better captures the kinetic, diplomatic, economic, law enforcement, and digital forms of punishment that the US might use in responding to cyberattacks and exploitations. Second, the DSB bridges the divide between denial and punishment in cyberspace. ‘DoD must create a second-strike cyber resilient “Thin Line”' of critical US offensive systems (cyber, nuclear and conventional) and related infrastructure in order to ensure that the US can credibly threaten retaliation in response to a potentially crippling cyber first strike. Good defence and resilience feeds into the potency and certainty of threats of punishment. Third, the DSB affirms, rather bluntly, the continued asymmetry between offense and defence in cyberspace. ‘The unfortunate reality', the 2017 DSB report reads, ‘is that, for at least the coming five to ten years, the offensive cyber capabilities of our most capable potential adversaries are likely to far exceed the United Sates' ability to defend and adequately strengthen the resilience of its critical infrastructures'. US cyber offense, then, is needed to correct the perceptions of asymmetry between defenders and challengers. Finally, the DSB links cyber deterrence to reputation, past and future. It warns that not responding to a cyberattack -- once, presumably, US cyber deterrence has failed -- is, with ‘near-certainty ... an invitation to follow-on cyber attacks'. In sum, the DSB Task Force solidifies the primary role offense will have in US cyber deterrence posture and strategy of the emerging decades.\nWith its offensive building blocks in place, the US, first under President Obama and later, under President Trump, began flexing its cyber muscle. It surreptitiously destroyed centrifuges in Iran, sabotaging and delaying the country's nuclear weapons program. It explored using cyberspace to dismantle Libya's air defences leading up to the March 2011 military intervention. The US likewise targeted and sabotaged North Korea's missile development program. Elsewhere, Cybercom was charged with attacking ISIS's online presence and capability in support of US and coalition plans to degrade and defeat the terrorist organisation, and to digitally augment related kinetic operations in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. The US is thought to have also used cyberspace to retaliate against North Korea following its 2014 hack on Sony Pictures. Other forms of punishment were meted out by\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nthe Justice Department. New cyber attribution capabilities allowed DOJ, in 2014, 2016, and 2018 to indict over a dozen Chinese military hackers, seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel, and another two private Iranian citizens for stealing US intellectual property, computer hacking, and launching ransomware attacks, and several Russian military intelligence officers for a string of hacks targeting the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and sporting and anti-doping agencies in the US, Canada and Europe. Via EO 13687, President Obama likewise imposed additional sanctions on North Korea in January 2015 in direct response to the Sony Hack.[84] Finally, in his last days in office, President Obama sanctioned and expelled Russian nationals for their role in hacking the 2016 presidential election. Another 13 Russian nationals and three companies were subsequently charged by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of Special Council Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian's meddling in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Russia was again fingered by American and British officials in April 2018 for targeting and exploiting network infrastructure devices, like routers, for purposes of espionage.[85] The coercive message, all told, is that the US has developed the capability to trace and attribute cyberattacks conducted against it and its allies, and to launch punitive measures in cyberspace and across domains in response.\nIn hand with this shift towards cyber punishment, Obama also developed US declaratory posture for cyberspace and helped establish international norms for cyber engagement. From a deterrence perspective, it is not enough to simply have the tools to harm an adversary: you also need to establish and communicate red lines against which acts of retaliation will be measured. Norms that help identify what is and is not acceptable behaviour in cyberspace further solidify retaliatory threats. Obama's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace is the backbone of this process. 'The digital world is no longer a lawless frontier', President Obama's opening statement to the document reads, 'it is a place where the norms of responsible, just, and peaceful conduct among states and people have begun to take hold'.[86] The strategy outlines how the US would provide leadership in establishing global norms for cyber behaviour. The US State Department, for instance, went on to establish the world's first Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues (S/CCI) in February 2011, dedicated to coordinating the Department's diplomatic work on cyber and developing international cyber rules.

The US, the document reads, ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any threat to our country … and we recognize that certain hostile acts … could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic’.89 In line with these strategic pronouncements, the Obama Administration tried to make a distinction between cyber espionage for the purposes of statecraft – which was deemed legitimate – and cyber espionage, theft, and attack for the purposes of economic or domestic disruption and infrastructure destruction – all deemed illegitimate. Thus, on the one hand, China’s 2015 exfiltration of over 20 million personnel records from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was deemed ‘not an attack’ by James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, but rather good espionage; ‘[we] would have done the same thing’.90 But on the other hand, Russia’s 2015/16 hack, manipulation, and leak of Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee data during the 2016 presidential election was deemed by CIA Director, John Brennan, as a ‘new level of malicious activity’ meant to undermine and influence the institution of US democracy.91 In January 2017,\n\n#\nA. S. WILNER\ntwo weeks before Trump's inauguration, DHS took the unprecedented step of classifying 'election infrastructure' as a critical infrastructure subsector, providing it with priority protection within the NIPP.[92]\nWhile the Trump Administration's cyberspace and cyber deterrence strategies are still being patched together, given the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date, and given what we know about Trump's leanings in international affairs, three things are likely to occur under his watch.\nFirst, threats of cyber retaliation and the logic of deterrence by punishment will continue to grow in importance. Pentagon officials have long sought more leeway from congress to engage in cyber offense. In 2017, Admiral Rogers, Cybercom's chief, lamented that 'offensive cyber is almost treated like nuclear weapons, in the sense that their application ... is controlled at the chief executive level and not delegated down. What I would like to see, over the next five to 10 years', is that US cyber weapons are viewed 'as another tool for the commanders' at the tactical level.[93] Signaling his acceptance of Rogers' position, President Trump, in August 2017, initiated the elevation of Cybercom to the status of a Unified Combatant Command (a step long-debated, but never taken, under Obama).[94] The transition places Cybercom at par with other unified commands, like US Strategic Command or US European Command, establishing a direct line of communication between Cybercom's director and the Secretary of Defense. And a year later, in August 2018, President Trump rescinded a 2012 Obama-era directive - Presidential Policy Directive 20 - that governed the manner in which cyberattacks were approved.[95] The reversal loosens the (somewhat onerous) restrictions that Obama had placed on conducting offensive cyber operations.\nFurthermore, Trump's February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (the first tabled since 2010), goes to some length in closing the cross-domain gap between nuclear weapons, nuclear retaliation, and cyber deterrence. Just as DoD's aforementioned Defense Science Board report recommended in 2013, the 2018 NPR expands the scope conditions that might lead to a US nuclear response as a result of a cyberattack. While US nuclear retaliation will continue to be reserved for 'extreme circumstances', the 2018 NPR significantly broadens these circumstances themselves to include 'significant non-nuclear strategic attacks', on 'civilian population or infrastructure'. Read:\n92Department of Homeland Security, 'Statement by Secretary Jeh Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector', 6 January 2017.\n93Cheryl Pellerin, 'Rogers Discusses near Future of U.S. Cyber Command', DoD News, 24 February 2017.\n94Separately, in February 2018, the White House signaled its intention to nominate Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone as Rogers' replacement at the helm of the NSA and Cybercom. The White House, Statement by President Donald J. Trump on the Elevation of Cyber Command, 18 August 2017; Chris Bing, 'White House Official: Paul Nakasone Nominated for NSA Director', CyberScoop, 13 February 2018.\n95Sean Lyngass, 'PPD-20 Elimination opens arguments over how US should Conduct Offensive Hacking Operations', CyberScoop, 16 August 2018.\ncrippling cyberattack. Additionally, perhaps cognizant that technology risks advancing more quickly than strategic policy, the NPR further warns that ‘the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of non-nuclear strategic attack technologies and U.S. capabilities to counter that threat'. Lest anyone misinterpret the document, DoD simultaneously published the NPR's Executive Summary in several languages, including Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Russian.\nThe logic of all of this was rolled into the State Department's ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats', a three-page brief published in May 2018 in direct response to EO 13800, and DoD's new Cyber Strategy, published in September 2018. The ‘Recommendations' report suggests that existing efforts at deterrence in cyberspace are ‘necessary but not sufficient': ‘network defense alone' is not enough. Calling for a ‘fundamental rethinking' of existing frameworks and a ‘new US vision' for cyber deterrence, the report recommends the development of a ‘broader menu of consequences' that the US can impose against state and non-state actors below ‘the threshold of the use of force'. With reference to the perennial issues of attribution and coercive credibility, the document calls for the US to openly demonstrate its ability to identify threats by imposing ‘swift, costly, and transparent consequences' on adversaries. Action will stand for credibility and might have ‘downstream deterrence effects'. Cyber offense is likewise paramount in DoD's 2018 Cyber Strategy. While the strategy itself is not publicity available, a 7-page summary is. And while this new strategy supersedes DoD's 2015 Strategy it compliments DoD's 2018 National Defense Strategy and the 2017 National Security Strategy. The document warns specific adversaries that the US will ‘build a more lethal force', conduct pre-emptive operations, ‘prepare for war', and collect cyber intelligence so as to field the ‘military cyber capabilities' the US needs to ‘defend forward'. A fuzzy term, defending forward implies terminating attacks at their (foreign) source, and ‘leveraging [US] focus outward to stop threats before they reach their targets'. By persistently engaging cyber competitors and aggressors on a daily basis, and by employing the Pentagon's full range of offensive capabilities, the US, the Strategy submits, will deter malicious cyber activities over time.\nSecond, and somewhat relatedly, under Trump, non-state actors may be encouraged to conduct cyber punishment and cyber offense themselves. The idea is to permit victims of cyber aggression and crime -- companies,\nA. S. WILNER\ninstitutions, NGOs, and individuals – to ‘hack back’ or counterattack via ‘active defense’ against their perpetrators. Under the current US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, it is illegal for individuals to gain entry into another’s computer system without permission. Though several US tech firms, including Google and Microsoft, have voiced concerns, Congress has nonetheless explored exceptions as part of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (first proposed in March 2017), and Georgia’s General Assembly passed a bill (later vetoed by the Governor) that would have made provisions for non-state active defence in cyberspace. Despite the controversy, some companies, including major US banks, have been reported to have surveyed the utility of hack backs to protect their servers, data, and assets. In a telling episode, Bossert, the former White House security advisor, and Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra, the chief cybersecurity official at DHS, heaped rare praise on Facebook and Microsoft during their lengthy December 2017 press-briefing in which the US officially blamed North Korea for conducting the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks. The attacks encrypted data on hundreds of thousands of public and private sector computers in over 150 countries. ‘We applaud our corporate partners’, Bossert asserted, ‘for acting on their own initiative … without any direction by the U.S. government … to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers. They shut down accounts … used to launch attacks and patched systems’. The destructive power and frequency of cyber hacking only grew under Obama. This trend will continue under Trump. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and wirelessly tethered Internet of Things (IoT) devices, along with new types of malicious activity like ransomware and sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, both of which can now be bought and sold on the Dark Web, will reshape the cyber threat landscape for individuals, communities, NGOs, and public and private-sector actors. Under the right conditions, non-state hack backs and other disruptive actions – the twenty-first century’s version of digital vigilantism – may prove useful for establishing a whole-of-society – rather than a whole-of-government – US cyber deterrence doctrine.\nFinally, in keeping with Trump’s general weariness of multilateralism and the United Nations in particular, the US is likely to downplay its role in establishing global cyber norms and focus instead on communicating its own red lines and bolstering the cyber deterrent posture of like-mined allied\nZaid Shoorbajee, ‘Google and Microsoft ask Georgia Governor to Veto “Hack Back” Bill’, *CyberScoop*, 27 April 2018; Ryan Johnston, ‘After Widespread outcry, Georgia Governor Vetoes “Hack Back” Bill’, *State Scoop*, 8 May 2018.\nDan Lohrmann, ‘Hack Back Law’, *Government Technology*, September 2017; Nicholas Schmidle, ‘The Digital Vigilantes who Hack Back’, *New Yorker*, 7 May 2018.\nThe White House, ‘Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea’, 19 December 2017.\nBruce Schneier, ‘Botnets of Things’, *MIT Technology Review*, March/April 2017.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nstates. The 2018 'Recommendations' report, for illustration, calls on the US to first establish criteria for US retaliation and to then communicate the policy both 'publicly and privately' so as to generate a deterrent effect. Separately, Trump shuttered the State Department's cyber coordinator's office, effectively degrading America's role in UN negotiations, though the Administration did test the waters for restarting the process of norm building in October 2018, following a ministerial meeting with US allies.[103] What appears more certain, however, is that the US is likely to seek bilateral cyber relations with other states and groups of states. At the Cyber Week 2017 gathering in Israel in June, for instance, the ever-present Bossert announced the US-Israel bilateral cyber working group – which was to be led by White House cyber czar, Rob Joyce, before his departure and the elimination his position – signalling Washington's preference for establishing cyber coalitions of the willing. '[W]e must', Bossert warned, 'hold those who violate [cyber] norms accountable. This may not be achievable through a UN effort. Likeminded states should work to develop options for imposing consequences within a coalition structure'.[104] In a similar vein, the US, in partnership with the UK, Germany and other NATO allies, aims to establish cyber warfare principles for 2019.[105] And, as the White House articulates in its 2018 Cyber Strategy, the US has plans to build a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative' that will convene a coalition of 'like-minded states' that can collectively develop 'tailored strategies' and jointly impose 'consequences against malign actors'.[106]\n# Conclusion: Evolution in theory\nUS cyber deterrence has come a long way since 2003. Definitions of deterrence – and core concepts linked to punishment and denial – have been revisited, reconceptualised, and broadened in scope. New government positions, institutions, agencies, and organisations have been created, staffed, trained, and tasked with operationalising core concepts. New technology, including software and hardware, has been developed and deployed. Partnerships across the US government, the private sector, and civil society have been established. And allies and international organisations have been leveraged. The footprints of all of these changes are evident in the record: US strategic doctrine allows us to trace the direction of this evolution. From a theoretical perspective, the way in which US cyber deterrence has been adapted since its inception provides\n103Sean Lyngaas, 'US Looks to Restart Talks on Global Cyber Norms', CyberScoop, October 2018.\n104The White House, 'Remarks by Homeland Security Advisor Thomas P. Bossert at Cyber Week 2017', 26 June 2017.\n105Robin Emmott, 'NATO mulls \"Offensive Defense\" with Cyber Warfare Rules', Reuters, 30 November 2017.\n\nscholars with insight as to how deterrence theory itself might respond to the promises and paradoxes of cyber deterrence. Several lessons stand out.\nFirst, US cyber deterrence has shifted from an almost exclusive focus on defence and deterrence by denial under President Bush to a punishment-based strategy under Presidents Obama and Trump. Part of the reason threats of retaliation and ‘deterrence by cost imposition' are currently emphasised is that recent technological advancements have allowed the US to improve its ability to monitor cyberattacks, identify perpetrators, and administer retaliatory actions, both within and outside cyberspace. Simply put, punishment strategies are increasingly feasible. Technological advancements have led to the adoption and use of new offensive coercive strategies. If so, theorists themselves should better situate technology into their own work of deterrence. How might the prerequisites of deterrence theory, and the concepts derived from them, adapt to novel, emerging, and disruptive technology within and beyond cyberspace?\nSecond, and relatedly, a separate reason US cyber punishment strategies have come to overshadow denial strategies has to do with the perception that deterrence by denial is not working, or rather, that the threat of denial used alone and separately from the threat of punishment, is not working. The number, severity and complexity of cyberattacks targeting US government and private sector facilities and assets has continued to rise over the past 15 years despite the US government's communicated threat of defence and denial. In response, US doctrine and strategy has evolved such that punishment is being used hand-in-glove with denial. For illustration, synchronising their efforts to defend the 2018 US midterm elections, DoD-DHS collaboration saw the former (via Cyber Command) target Russian operatives overseas to disrupt their actions all the while the latter worked with social media companies to counter disinformation. In practice, the two approaches reinforce each other. Recalibrating the effect punishment and denial have on each other in practice, suggests that theories of deterrence must better relate how the logic of punishment augments, or otherwise corresponds to, the logic of denial. Too often punishment and denial are considered poles apart, distinct levers applied separately to the cost-benefit calculus that underpins rational behaviour and coercion. In theory, how do punishment and denial relate and overlap; in cyberspace when does one stop and the other start?\nThird, the US has come to equate attribution as a distinct form of punishment that appears logically linked to denial. In fielding a question during the 2017 WannaCry press briefing, Bossert suggested, for instance, that ‘it's not about holding a country accountable; it's about simple culpability. We've determined who was behind the [WannaCry] attack, and we're saying it. ...\nWe're going to hold them accountable ... And we're going to shame them for it. ... And I think it's going to improve our security'. By identifying North Korea, the US denied it the benefit of anonymity in cyberspace; by publically outing North Korea, the US put the regime on notice for future punishment. From a theoretical perspective, however, attribution is largely understood as a mechanism, a crucial step that allows a defender to retaliate by identifying a challenger, rather than as a functional punishment in its own right. If so, and in light of perceptual changes in practice, deterrence theory must better explore whether, how, and under what conditions public attribution -- and the threat of shaming -- function as a source of cyber deterrence at the different levels of analysis. How might public and private attribution of an attack deter, coerce, or otherwise influence individual, non-state, and state cyber challengers?\nFourth, US cyber deterrence is not chiefly about military coercion. Notwithstanding Cybercom's emerging role in providing the US government with offensive and military options to punish cyber aggressors globally, US cyber deterrence strategy has emphasised the importance of several other departments and agencies, including DOJ, DHS, FBI, State Department and various others, for both denying and punishing cyberattacks. The goal is to equip the US government with as wide a set of coercive levers as possible, crossing domains as needed, to provide a truly whole of government approach to cybersecurity and cyber deterrence. The role of the DOJ (and the FBI by extension) is especially enlightening. By publicly indicting foreign nationals for cyberattacks conducted on American computer systems, the US government underscores the fact that contemporary cyber deterrence transcends traditional defence policy and military doctrine. By establishing the DOJ as a core pillar of its punishment strategy, the US signals its intention to use criminal justice tools to deter not just criminal attacks but attacks conducted by nation state adversaries. In doing so, the US further blurs the line between state institutions and individuals, by sanctioning the latter for actions they perpetrated while working for or on behalf of foreign governments, militaries, or intelligence agencies. For deterrence theory, the burgeoning role non-military and non-kinetic coercion have had in US cyber deterrence posture suggests that academics must redouble their efforts at multidisciplinarity. Academic silos still exist in the manner in which deterrence theory is developed and tested. To some degree, deterrence from within IR theory is privileged over that stemming from criminology, psychology, and terrorism and intelligence studies. This is especially the case when it comes to deterrence in national security and international affairs. Though the fourth wave of deterrence scholarship has gone to\nsome length to bridge the disciplinary divide, more cross-fertilisation is needed among disciplines to better reflect and speak to developments taking place in practice. What theoretical lessons do non-IR approaches to deterrence hold for how IR theories of cyber deterrence are developed and improved?\nFifth, US cyber deterrence is not solely about states, either. Rather, non-state actors figure prominently in American strategic doctrine as both potential perpetrators of cyberattacks targeting US infrastructure, and, more importantly for our purposes, as potential partners that amplify US cyber deterrence. For instance, private sector and individual victims of cyberattack share information, voluntarily, about attacks with law enforcement and intelligence. This provides governments with a better understanding of the nature, prevalence and evolution of certain types of attack, which can lead to improvements in defence and denial. In other cases, as highlighted by Facebook, Microsoft, and Marcus Hutchins -- a private British citizen who noticed a ‘kill switch' within WannaCry's code and took action to temporarily shut the attack down -- non-state actors can track and impede attacks without government oversight, further denying perpetrators the fruits of their labour. In still other cases, non-state actors, including companies, individuals, academics, NGOs, and other such groups, can augment US cyber security and deterrence by denial efforts by practicing better cyber hygiene -- i.e. updating passwords or patching software. This functions to further deny challengers easy opportunities to conduct successful attacks. On this front, Washington is exploring how it might compel (or, even, demand) private sector partners, contractors, and suppliers to do more to defend and secure their own networks, data and assets, as a precondition for working with and on behalf of the US government. In February 2018, for instance, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, in discussing the 2018 National Defense Strategy at a conference, warned that DoD wanted the cyber security ‘bar to be set so high, it will become the condition of doing business' with the Pentagon; for industry, cybersecurity will be ‘foundational to business with DoD'. The point, in this case, is to develop a whole of society deterrence posture, rather than simply a whole of government approach. The logic of all of this goes back to a statement made in President Bush's opening letter to the first 2003 cybersecurity strategy, oft repeated since: ‘Securing cyberspace is an extraordinarily difficult strategic challenge that requires a coordinated and focused effort from our entire society -- the federal government, state and local governments, the private sector, and the American people'. ‘Every American', the strategy continues ‘who can contribute to securing part of cyberspace is encouraged\nto do so. The federal government invites the creation of, and participation in, public-private partnerships to raise cybersecurity awareness, train personnel, stimulate market forces, improve technology, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, exchange information and plan recovery operations. Of the many ways in which the US government has previously approached deterrence in the other domains of warfare, this general call to arms is unique to cyberspace and cyber deterrence.\nIn response, scholars of deterrence need to explore the nature and feasibility of non-state cyber deterrence. Cyberspace is not a state-centric environment. On the contrary: states and militaries represent a tiny fraction of all the communities, individuals, and non-state actors that constitute cyberspace. Objects, too, have cyber presence. Projections suggest that 50 billion items -- from smart-homes to smart-cars, and from ‘intelligent' construction materials to wireless medical devices -- will be networked online as part of the IoT through an array of embedded electronics, software and sensors. All to say, the vast majority of interactions and the vast majority of the data created online is non-state in nature. Cyber deterrence theory must move beyond its narrow focus on states to account for the diversity of actors and objects that populate cyberspace. What is the equivalent in cyberspace of businesses, community groups, and homeowners employing storefront lighting, neighbourhood watch programs, and anti-burglary systems to deter physical attacks, theft and robbery? Can non-state actors be agents of their own deterrence in cyberspace?\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."

Wilner\nNorman Paterson School of International Affairs, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada\n# ABSTRACT\nWhen compared to advancements in conceptualising deterrence in other domains, cyber deterrence is still in it messy infancy. In some ways cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine, and policy are developed and put to use even before corresponding theories are properly understood. This article analyses how American cyber deterrence has been implemented over the past two decades in order to inform ongoing debates within the academic study of deterrence, and to provide insights from practice for how cyber deterrence theory can be better conceived and refined.\nWhile President Donald Trump upbraided the previous administration's apparent weakness in cyberspace – ‘We’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing’ – his administration has itself struggled to table a coherent cyber deterrence strategy, despite repeated promises to do so quickly.¹ As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to ‘develop the offensive cyber capabilities we need to deter attacks by both state and non-state actors’.² Two weeks following his November 2017 election, President-elect Trump went on to explain further – that he would build ‘a comprehensive plan to protect America’s vital infrastructure against cyberattacks’.³ And months later still, as President, he signed Executive Order (EO) 13800 in May 2017 – an updated draft of a January 2017 EO that had been scraped at the last minute – on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. The EO describes a plan to reassess all elements of US cybersecurity across and beyond the government. In terms of cyber deterrence specifically, EO 13800 calls on various agencies and departments – including the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security, along with the Director of\nCONTACT Alex S.

A public version of the report eventually appeared in May 2018. $^{5}$\nPresident Trump was also slow to appoint or approve several top-level federal cybersecurity and technology positions – including, notably, Federal Chief Information Security Officer, and the head of DHS's cybersecurity and infrastructure protection division. $^{6}$ These positions are critical to guiding US cybersecurity policy and planning, including in the area of cyber deterrence. Despite all of this, (former) White House Homeland Security advisor, Thomas Bossert – who helped craft cybersecurity policy under US President George W. Bush – revealed in October 2017, that the Trump Administration was determined to eventually publish a new cybersecurity strategy based on EO 13800. $^{7}$ And in his January 2017 Confirmation Hearing, General James Mattis, President Trump's (former) Secretary of Defense, suggested that a comprehensive 'cyber doctrine' might be ready by July 2018. $^{8}$ The new National Cyber Strategy was eventually published in September 2018, after an earlier public summary was held back in May 2018. $^{9}$\nAlthough a US cyber deterrence strategy distinct from a broader cyber doctrine has yet to be established or fully leveraged, bits and pieces of the strategy exist, peppered about in different government departments and agencies. Indeed, US cyber deterrence has evolved a great deal since the mid-2000s. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, to better anticipate where US cyber deterrence is heading in practice by exploring the manner in which it has evolved through different presidential administrations. And second, to trace the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date to explore cyber deterrence in theory.

Bossert’s departure was followed a week later by Rob Joyce’s, the White House cybersecurity coordinator. President Trump later eliminated Joyce’s position altogether, in May 2018.

By the standards of deterrence theory, which has a robust and cumulative pedigree dating back over a century, cyber deterrence is an innovative but imperfectly understood idea. The bulk of the academic literature on cyber deterrence was produced only very recently, over the past fifteen years or so. Moreover, in some important ways, US cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine and policy have been developed, unveiled and put to use even before corresponding theories from academia are properly understood, tested and refined.\nIf practice precedes theory, then a reflection of how this practice progressed over time may help inform theory more broadly. Combined, these circumstances leave scholars with a unique opportunity to evaluate an example of cyber deterrence practice in order to explain and better describe cyber deterrence theory. In methodological terms, this article explores how American cyber deterrence has been implemented in order to better highlight theory more broadly. The United States, by dint of its size, pre-eminence in cyberspace and decades of experience operationalising deterrence theory in other domains, represents a crucial case. Moreover, in empirical terms, the US government openly discusses cybersecurity, and has made various iterations of its cyber deterrence strategy and doctrine publicly available. While a comprehensive US cyber deterrence strategy has yet to be tabled, fragments of the strategy can be patched together, piecemeal, from various US government bodies. A record of thought and practice exists; wading through it provides insights for theory.\nThe article begins with a summary of the academic literature on deterrence theory dating back to the beginning of the Cold War. The rationale here is to outline the nuts and bolts of deterrence theory, highlight conceptual prerequisites, illustrate the many ways deterrence has been operationalised, and briefly assess the ‘four waves' of deterrence scholarship. Next, the article takes a broad look at cyber deterrence theory in particular. The purpose is to discuss the core debates and research clusters embedded within this particular sub-field of the literature. Doing so will provide a theoretical foundation against which the empirical work can be paired against. An exploration of US cyber deterrence then follows. This section will provide a detailed and linear reflection of US cyber deterrence strategy, doctrine and policy stretching back to the early 2000s. The analysis will piece together how US strategy has unfolded and evolved over time, and help identify specific concepts, trends and assumptions baked into strategic\n#\nA. S. WILNER\ndiscourse. Highlights from the US example will then be analysed in the conclusion of the article. The way the United States has put cyber deterrence into practice over time provides lessons and insights for how cyber deterrence theory might be better conceived, approached and refined.\n# Deterrence in theory: Concepts and debates\nDeterrence is an enduring concept. It has repeatedly proven its flexibility in responding to, and evolving from, shifting international and interstate dynamics. Deterrence, at its theoretical core, entails using threats to manipulate an adversary's behaviour. More concretely, it rests on convincing another actor to forgo an unwanted action. Compellence – a related concept – flips the process around, prompting an adversary to pursue an action it might otherwise have avoided. Compellence encourages behaviour, whereas deterrence restrains it. Both are subsumed within the logic of coercion. In all cases of deterrence and compellence, a minimum of two actors are involved. Defenders issue threats to alter an opponent's behaviour; challengers consider these threats, weigh their options, and decide whether or not to acquiesce. In some cases, a third actor is involved. With extended deterrence, for instance, a proxy, partner, or ally is also included in the process, either on the side of the defender or the challenger. Threats of punishment – usually in the form of retaliation – and promises of denial – usually in the form of depriving an adversary the expected benefits of a particular behaviour – form the basis for most deterrent and compellent engagements, though normative and ideological considerations that inform behaviour have also been recently developed within the context of delegitimisation. Each of these three coercive processes is linked to the logic of deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial, and deterrence by delegitimisation, respectively.\nDeterrence works by informing a challenger's cost-benefit calculus. Importantly, it does so by weighing upon another's strategic choice. Militarily crushing an adversary, as Thomas Schelling reminds us, such that it has no alternative but to accept demands made of it is not deterrence, but rather defeat. The same can be said in the realm of denial. Developing a perfect, foolproof defence, while rare, does not deter by denial but rather deters by defeat; an adversary does not penetrate a target or conduct a certain attack because it is prevented from doing so, not because it decides\n Moving beyond theory and strategy, Amir Lupovici contends that deterrence is also an idea, internalized within the identity of those who rely on it. Lupvici, *The Power of Deterrence* (Cambridge 2016).\n On the latter, see for instance, Jerry Mark Long and Alex Wilner, 'Delegitimizing al-Qaida: Defeating an \"Army Whose Men Love Death\"', *International Security* 39/1 (2014).\n Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge: Polity Press 2004), 26.\n Thomas Schelling, *Arms and Influence* (1966), 1–34.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n249\nagainst doing so.¹⁵ In deterrence, changes in behaviour are an option, not a necessity. Finally, though studies of deterrence in international affairs are naturally anchored to International Relations theory, deterrence is not reserved for states alone. It functions just as well among non-state actors, including between individuals, groups, and other organisations. Indeed, criminological deterrence has an especially rich literature on deterring violence and crime within communities, well below the level of the state.¹⁶ And the field of psychology, too, has provided deterrence scholars with avenues for exploring the cognitive side of deterrence across disciplines.¹⁷\nPut into practice, deterrence theory rests on a number of pre-requisites. First, actors must exhibit a degree of rationality, such that some combination of threats will suffice to alter behaviour. Second, overlapping preferences short of open conflict must be shared by all parties; deterrence requires that adversaries accept the feasibility of non-violence. Third, threats, expected changes in behaviour and a willingness to punish violations must be communicated. Defenders must likewise reassure challengers that threats will not be carried out in the event demands are met. Fourth, defenders must have the perceived capability, and the resolve to punish or deny as threatened. Finally, deterrence works best again a known or suspected adversary; anonymity robs deterrence of its potency.\nBuilding off these prerequisites and core conceptual tenets, deterrence theory has evolved in new and exciting ways over the past several decades. This process of theoretical rejuvenation and praxis has been the result of both changing geostrategic realities (from bipolarity to unipolarity and back, for instance), and because of the emergence of new technology (from nuclear weapons to artificial intelligence) and security domains (including air, space and cyberspace). For illustration of this evolution, consider these various concepts. Central deterrence – which functions to protect a defender's assets – stands against extended (or triadic) deterrence – which functions to protect a third party's assets. Broad deterrence – which deters aggression writ large – stands against narrow deterrence – which deters a specific, and often limited, behaviour. Similarly, general deterrence seeks to\n¹⁵ Alex Wilner, ‘Contemporary Deterrence Theory Counterterrorism: A Bridge too Far?’ NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 47/2 (2015).\n¹⁶ The literature is expansive. For a reference point, consider these various meta-analyses of the empirical record: Anthony Braga and David Weisburd, ‘The Effects of Focused Deterrence Strategies on Crime’, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency 49 (2012); Rob Guerette and Kate Bowers, ‘Assessing the Extent of Crime Displacement and Diffusion of Benefits’, Criminology 47/4 (2009); Trevor Bennett, Katy Holloway, and David Farrington, ‘Does Neighborhood Watch Reduce Crime?’ Journal of Experimental Criminology 2/4 (2006); David Farrington, et al., ‘The Effects of Closed-Circuit Television on Crime’, Journal of Experimental Criminology 3 (2007).\n¹⁷ See, for illustration Kevin Woods and Mark Stout, ‘Saddam’s Perceptions and Misperceptions’, Journal of Strategic Studies 33/1 (2010); Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein, ‘Rational Deterrence Theory: I Think, Therefore I Deter’, World Politics 41/2 (1989); Robert Jervis, Richard Ned Lebow, and Janice Gross Stein, Psychology and Deterrence (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 1985); Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (Random House 2011).\nregulate and uphold accepted, status quo relations, whereas immediate deterrence functions within periods of crisis and against expected anti-status quo behaviour. Intra-war deterrence shapes certain behaviour within an ongoing hot war, after other forms of deterrence have already failed; the goal here is to influence an adversary's warfighting behaviour itself. Cumulative or serial deterrence is iterative; it functions by adding up the effects of repeated coercive interactions. Moving beyond threats, inducements, deflection, dissuasion, entanglement and influence have each been added to deterrence theory, too, broadening the manner in which defenders secure their interests and shape adversarial behaviour.\nWithin IR, deterrence scholarship has evolved within the context of ‘four waves', borrowing insights from other disciplines, namely criminology, terrorism studies, and psychology. The first wave emerged around the end of the Second World War, and corresponded to the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology within a US-dominated strategic backdrop. The second wave began in the early days of the Cold War. US-Soviet dynamics and alliance structures shaped the wave's research agenda, as did the limited proliferation of nuclear weapons to US allies, like France and the UK, and rivals, like China. The second wave used game theory and scientific modelling to explore how rivals could manage nuclear escalation and alliances. Focus was placed on strategic and conventional deterrence by punishment -- and to a much lesser degree on conventional deterrence by denial in Europe and Asia -- and on major power conflict pitting mutually rational and unitary state actors. The third wave began in the 1970s. Its focus was on empiricism, on qualitatively and quantitatively testing the concepts, frameworks and theories previously proposed. Findings suggested the importance of commitment, communication, and resolve in using both central and extended deterrence, and illustrated the variance embedded within the concept of expected utility. The psychology of coercion (e.g. human cognition and thought, bias, fatigue, decision-making, misperception, and error), along with notions of strategic culture, bureaucracy and leadership also emerged.\nThe fourth wave followed the end of the Cold War and continues today. A traditional focus on bipolarity, strategic weapons, and great power rivalries gave way to a diffusion of interests, both between and below state actors. In terms of scholarship, the fourth wave is both especially dynamic, and slightly chaotic: everything and everyone under the sun is in focus. Included here is work on deterring rogue states -- traditionally weak states and militaries often in possession of limited nuclear or chemical and biological weapons, like Iraq, Iran,\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nSerbia, North Korea, Syria, and Libya. $^{19}$  Violent non-state actors have likewise been the focus of fourth wave scholarship, from pirates to ISIS and everyone in between, along with the processes of radicalisation, rebellion, insurgency, and political violence. $^{20}$  And while deterrence in space was a concern during the Cold War, it largely featured a limited number of actors, the US and USSR. But in the fourth wave, space deterrence features new entrants, like India, China, Israel, and private sector actors, including SpaceX and Blue Origin, and rapidly diffusing technology, including new forms of anti-satellite weaponry (ASAT), miniature satellites, and privately owned, reusable mega-rockets. As the scope of deterrence has broadened, so, too, has the practice of deterrence: the logic of denial has been expanded beyond its conventional limits, as has extended deterrence. $^{21}$  And altogether novel concepts, like cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace, have been proposed and tested. $^{22}$\n# Cyber deterrence in theory: Core research clusters\nResearch on cyber deterrence is largely rooted to the classical literature on deterrence stemming from IR.

The 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace defines it as a 'nervous system' or 'control system' for US critical infrastructure, comprised of 'hundreds of thousands of interconnected computers, servers, routers, switches, and fiber optic cables'. The 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations later defined cyberspace as a 'domain', characterized by 'the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures'. And in a 2008 memo, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England defined cyberspace as 'a global domain', consisting of 'the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'. While definitions of cyberspace continue to evolve, for the purposes of this paper, cyberspace is understood as a global, interconnected domain constituting hardware, digital data, and related infrastructrue in which electronic devices are used to create, save and disseminate information. The phrase 'cyber deterrence' also lacks a precise definition. At its broadest, cyber deterrence is a field of study - as deterring terrorism might be thought of - that involves applying and exploring the logic, theory, and practice of deterrence within cyberspace. More narrowly, cyber deterrence might be understood as the deterrence of attacks within or using cyberspace, or conversely, the use of cyberspace to accomplish deterrence in other domains. This paper relies on the broader definition but highlights the narrow use of the term where necessary.\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nThe largest cluster explores the manner in which the prerequisites of IR deterrence apply to cyberspace. By these standards some scholars conclude that the architecture of cyberspace – anonymity, complexity, interconnectivity, jurisdictional diffusion, open access – makes cyber deterrence inherently weak. The fundamental prerequisites are not easily met. Herein, the attribution dilemma receives greatest attention. The ease of digital obfuscation, complexity of 'multi-stage' cyberattacks, difficulty in signalling or communicating threats and deterrent capabilities, and challenge of uncovering the physical source of a cyberattack, can complicate how defenders construct and communicate credible coercive threats. If cyber adversaries believe that their identities are protected, retaliatory threats will fall short. A range of tentative solutions have been proposed. More sophisticated attribution capabilities, processes, and standards might be developed. Or, the Internet could be reengineered as an attributed network. Or, sources of a cyberattack might be better deduced weighing known capabilities, interests, and motivation of likely adversaries. Or, third party enablers of cyberattacks (i.e., owners of cyber infrastructure, and other private sector actors) might be held better accountable. Or, the threshold of 'certain identification' when contemplating retaliation can be lowered. Still other authors illustrate how cyber attribution is not, in fact, as potent a\n24The Economist (Benjamin Sutherland, ed.)

Weak states and non-state adversaries with fewer cyber platforms, conversely, have less to fear from cyberwar and much to gain by escalating a confrontation to digital space, where they may have advantages over traditionally stronger powers. That asymmetry may destabilise cyber deterrence.³⁷ Skirting this particular paradox may involve combining cyber threats with more traditional kinetic and non-kinetic threats, effectively adding military punishment, law enforcement, diplomatic and financial sanctions, and public shaming to the cyber mix. This cross-domain deterrent approach addresses cyber credibility by tackling on traditional forms of retaliation to the equation.³⁸ Robert Mandel suggests further that defenders use ‘unorthodox’ means to enhance the potency of their deterrence in cyberspace, including, for instance, ‘subtle political and diplomatic pressure on cyberattackers or their supporters, sponsor or patrons’, like public exposure, reputational embarrassment, shaming, condemnation, embassy closures, expulsion and other forms of humiliation.³⁹ Some authors caution, though, that skipping between the digital and physical (or kinetic) realms risks escalating a conflict in unanticipated ways.⁴⁰ Other experts counter that some cyberattacks, like those that disrupt financial or political systems by degrading software or targeting data rather than hardware, are unlikely to escalate to the kinetic domain at all.⁴¹ Still others argue that cyber and\n³⁵ Glaser, ‘Deterrence’; Will Goodman, ‘Cyber Deterrence’, Strategic Studies Quarterly, 2010; Lindsay, ‘Tipping’; Ben Buchanan, The Cybersecurity Dilemma (Oxford 2016), 145; Joseph Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, International Security 41/3 (2017), 51–52.\n³⁶ Richard Harknett, et. al. ‘Leaving Deterrence Behind’, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management 7/1 (2010); Adam Liff, ‘Cyberwar: A New “Absolute Weapon?”’ Journal of Strategic Studies 35/3 (2012).\n³⁷ Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Paul Rosenzweig, ‘The Organization of the United States Government and Private Sector for Achieving Cyber Deterrence’, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2010); Mike McConnell, ‘Cyberwar is the New Atomic Age’, New Perspectives Quarterly 26/3 (2009); James Adams, ‘Virtual Defense’, Foreign Affairs 80/3 (2001); Martin Libicki, Conquest in Cyberspace (Cambridge 2007), Chapter 11; Libicki, Cyberdeterrence (2009), Chapter Three; Libicki, ‘Cyberwar as a Confidence Game’, Strategic Studies Quarterly (Spring 2011); Martin Libicki, Cyberspace in Peace and War (Naval Institute Press 2016), Chapter 16 &amp; 17; Harknett, ‘Information Warfare’.\n³⁸ James Lewis, ‘Cross-Domain Deterrence and Credible Threats’, CSIS Working Paper (July 2010); Jon Lindsay and Erik Gartzke (eds.), Cross-Domain Deterrence (under review 2018); Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff, ‘Cyberwar’; Herbert Lin, ‘Laying an Intellectual Foundation for Cyberdeterrence’, in Kruger et al., (eds.), The Secure Information Society (Springer-Verlag 2013).\n³⁹ Mandel, Optimizing, 199–201.\n⁴⁰ Lewis ‘Cross-Domain’; Anthony Cordesman and Justin Cordesman, Cyberthreats, Information Warfare, and Critical Infrastructure Protection (Praeger 2002), Chapter One; Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff ‘Cyberwar’; Lin ‘Laying’.\n⁴¹ Harknett et al., ‘Leaving’; Rid ‘Cyber War’; Thomas Rid, ‘More Attacks, Less Violence’, Journal of Strategic Studies 36/1 (2013).\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nkinetic deterrence are not intrinsically separate: they intersect, compliment, and influence each other, such that retaliation in cyberspace may have unintended side-effects in non-cyber domains, like in international finance and diplomacy. Conversely, successful deterrence in one domain may trigger deterrence failure in another, as occurs when successful kinetic deterrence compels an adversary to shift to cyberattacks.\nA second research cluster centres on whether cyberspace favours offensive behaviour over defensive behaviour. For instance, while the number of cyber targets grows exponentially and the process of safeguarding them more complex, the ease of conducting cyberattacks remains relatively stable and inexpensive. Nor can defenders expect forewarning of an imminent cyberattack, eliminating their ability to mount an immediate deterrent response. On the contrary: cyberattacks often go unnoticed, for months, even years. Other forms of cyberattack that rely on the logic of strategic surprise, Jim Writz warns, may compel a weaker adversary to present a traditionally strong defender, like the United States, with a 'fait accompli', such that the defender then faces the prospects of a costly response in returning to the status quo. And traditional factors that mitigate offensive power in other domains of warfare – like the geographic distance between adversaries or resilient offensive weapons, including second strike capabilities – are much less evident in cyberwarfare, favouring intruders over defenders. Relatedly, the sheer number of potential cyber adversaries complicates coercive calculations, creating a potential asymmetry in intent, capability, and resolve that favors aggressors. Indeed, cyberspace augments the destructive power of weaker actors, including small, sub-state and non-sate networks. Some authors conclude that cyber deterrence is a 'mirage', and that a warfighting framework is the only way to address 'cyberaggression'. Still, other scholars caution against alarmism, noting that\n42Amir Lupovici, 'The \"Attribution Problem\" and the Social construction of \"Violence\"', International Studies Perspectives 17/3 (2016); Goodman, 'Cyber Deterrence'; Ronald Deibert and Rafal Rohozinkis, 'Risking Security', International Political Sociology 4 (2010); Joseph Nye, 'Cyber Power', Belfer Center, Harvard Kennedy School Working Paper, 2011.\n43Jon Lindsay, 'Stuxnet and the Limits of Cyber Wafare', Security Studies 22/3 (2013).\n44John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!'

Indeed cumulative, serial, or punctuated deterrence – which suggest that cyber deterrence move beyond Cold War notions of absolute deterrence success and populate the middle ground in which iterated cyber engagement overtime might shape the behaviour of defenders and challengers alike – may be effective in deterring certain attacks. Though the risk, of course, is that adversaries adapt in kind, improving their capabilities accordingly.\nA third subset of the literature explores cyber denial. Here, as noted, deterrence is achieved by convincing an adversary that their preferred actions are unlikely to succeed. Frustrating the preparation phase of a cyberattack may be especially valuable. Associated concepts like cyber resilience or resistance, in which compromised digital systems continue to function, or adapt and heal themselves, may further augment cyber denial. However, some scholars retort that adversaries incur very low costs when their cyberattacks fail, especially when attribution is uncertain, and are able to continue trying, even unsuccessfully, without incurring further costs, suggesting that denial, decoupled from attribution and punishment, may provide few coercive benefits. A fourth and final subset of the literature explores whether norms, regimes, and stigmatisation might delegitimise certain cyberattacks and shape individual and collective behaviour accordingly. For example, Joseph Nye, borrowing logic developed for intra-war deterrence during the Cold War that deterred the use of certain weapons,\n50 P.W.

Multiple poles within the research community exist. And much of the field is a conceptual extension of the literature on cyber warfare. Conflating warfare and deterrence makes a certain amount of sense given that deterrence is often a consequence of projecting military power. Yet this development has skewed the nascent literature on cyber deterrence in particular ways. First, IR deterrence is favoured, to the exclusion of the literature derived from criminology, psychology or other domains that have informed previous deterrence debates. Second, deterrence by punishment is overemphasised, such that denial, dissuasion, influence, delegitimisation and other concepts are often overlooked. Third, state actors figure prominently, to the near exclusion of the role non- and sub-state actors might have in deterring attacks in cyberspace. The coercive leverage of non-state cyber actors is rarely considered. Fourth, deterring high-end cyber threats dominates the research agenda. Deterring the far more common attributes of cyber insecurity, like cyber-crime, identity and property theft, data breaches and exfiltration, hacking (DDOS, malware, spear/phishing, whaling, ransomware), digital espionage, sabotage, bullying, and other concerns, goes largely unexplored. Fifth, policy prescription seems to dominate, while theoretical, methodological and empirical developments lag behind. Properly situating cyber deterrence within the larger IR literature, or within strategic studies, or political science, is wanting. Finally, few empirical evaluations of cyber deterrence have taken place, with the exceptions largely focusing on digital coercion among states actively involved in armed conflict.\nWhat follows is an exploration of how US cyber deterrence in practice has evolved over the past decades; lessons therein will help inform our theoretical understanding of how deterrence theory and cyberspace interact.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n257\n# US cyber deterrence strategy: Evolution in practice\nAmerican cybersecurity strategy dates back to 2003, with the publication under President George W. Bush of the first standalone strategic document on cybersecurity – The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.⁶⁰ [Figure 1 provides a timeline of relevant US cyber deterrence and cyber security doctrine.] At its core, the strategy is guided by three objectives: preventing cyberattacks against critical infrastructure; reducing vulnerability to cyberattacks; and mitigating damage from cyberattacks. The document further defines the distinct roles and responsibilities held by different cyber actors – from individual-level users of cyberspace, to institutions, businesses, and innovators, and the critical infrastructure sectors. ‘Protecting the widely distributed assets of cyberspace’, the strategy reads, ‘requires the efforts of many Americans. The federal government alone cannot sufficiently defend America’s cyberspace’.⁶¹ It also describes the national and international issues and concerns that require US Government leadership, including, for instance, building a national response system that identifies threats, promotes information exchange, advises on remediation, diminishes cyber vulnerabilities, and establishes international initiatives and multilateral endeavours with other states and non-state partners to collaboratively bolster cybersecurity at the global level.\nIn terms of deterrence specifically, the strategy weds various aspects of denial and punishment together, though the latter is mostly focused on domestic criminal prosecution. For illustration, at the local-level, touting roles for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the 2003 strategy lays bare the utility of using detection, apprehension, and prosecution of cyber-criminals (at home and, if possible, abroad) as a way to punish violations of domestic and international law. Here, some aspects of cyber aggression are treated to the logic of criminological deterrence (e.g., swift, certain and severe punishment). Bush’s 2003 National Strategy does not, however, overtly address cyber punishment or retaliation among states or at the international level. Only the oblique suggestion that the US response ‘need not be limited to criminal prosecution’, and that the US ‘reserves the right to respond in an appropriate manner’, hint at any larger retaliatory global strategy.⁶² While these pronouncements may have been obligatory, for the purposes of coercion they are also inherently weak. As the\n⁶⁰The 2003 document was, however, preceded by several antecedent publications that outlined how the US envisioned cybersecurity, including, a Clinton-era Presidential Commission report (1997) and a 2000 National Plan on information security.

S. WILNER\n# U.S. CYBER DETERRENCE STRATEGY TIMELINE (1997-PRESENT)\nFigure 1. US cyber deterrence strategy timeline.\nprerequisites of deterrence theory suggest, deterrence works best when threats are clearly communicated and credible.\nIn terms of deterrence by denial, the 2003 National Strategy links mitigating the effects of cyberattacks, building less-vulnerable cyber systems and fostering cybersecurity awareness among all Americans, as a way to limit the feasibility and utility of conducting cyberattacks, making them less attractive as a result. Herein, the Strategy builds off preliminary recommendations President Bush established previously in 2001 in EO 13231 that provided\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n259\nthe impetus for better coordinating public and private sector critical infrastructure protection 'in the information age'.63 President Bush subsequently further refined the 2003 Strategy with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (2003), which called upon DHS, which had only just been established following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, to develop the concepts, frameworks, and processes for protecting American critical infrastructure and key resources.64 DHS published the first National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) in 2006.65 [Subsequent NIPPs were published in 2009 and 2013, while related Quadrennial Homeland Security Reviews were published in 2010, 2014, and 2018.] The NIPP's core builds off the three-part approach outlined in the 2003 National Strategy – prevent attacks; reduce vulnerability; mitigate damage – but it also attempts to provide a much more robust definition of deterrence: 'Cause the potential attacker to perceive that the risk of failure is greater than that which they find acceptable'. Reducing a 'target's value', 'preventing and delaying' an attack, minimising and 'mitigating' an attack's effect, and recovering from attack, are added to this definition.66 Of importance, the logic baked into the NIPP's definition of deterrence is wholly based on deterrence by denial. This makes a certain amount of sense, given DHS's mandate, but it also reflects a larger trend in the way the United States approached cybersecurity in the early days: defence (and denial) trumped offense (and punishment). The balance between denial and punishment would start to shift only under President Barack Obama.\nIndeed, Obama's legacy is marked by the rise of cyber offensive measures in US cyber deterrence doctrine.67 Upon taking office in January 2009, Obama ordered a review of US cybersecurity efforts, which largely subsumed an earlier review launched by President Bush in 2008, during his last year of office – the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) as developed by National Security Presidential Directive 54.68 The CNCI, started by Bush and completed by Obama as part of his Cyber Space Policy Review, broadened the scope of cyber security beyond what had been defined in the 2003 Strategy. CNCI established a dozen tasks for the US\n63 The White House, Executive Order 13231, Critical Infrastructure Protection in the Information Age, October 2001.\n64 Homeland Security Presidential Directive No. 7, Directive on Critical Infrastructure, Prioritization, and Protection, 2003.\n65 Department of Homeland Security, National Infrastructure Protection Plan, 2006.

Though several sections of Presidential Directive 54 are redacted, what is left includes specific provisions relating to the roles the Department of Defence (DoD) and the US Intelligence Community have in securing, and deterring attacks within, cyberspace. For instance, the FBI was to establish the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, which would coordinate and integrate information from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), the US Secret Service, and other agencies, to augment criminal investigation and prosecution both in the US and overseas. DHS, with an assist from various other departments, was to establish the National Cybersecurity Center, to improve coordination in protecting and defending US Government communication, cyber, and information networks. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was instructed to develop a ‘cyber counterintelligence plan' to augment the 2007 National Counterintelligence Strategy (which mentioned ‘cyber' only a handful of times). The Secretaries of State, Defense, Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the DNI were to develop, jointly, a plan ‘for the coordination and application of offensive capabilities to defend U.S. information systems'. And, most importantly for our purposes, several agencies were called upon to ‘define and develop a comprehensive and coordinating strategy to deter interference and attacks in cyberspace'. Obama reiterated this latter goal in 2009 when he expanded the CNCI's objective. ‘Senior policymakers', the White House warned, ‘must think through the long-range strategic options available to the United States'. Cyber deterrence rested on improving ‘warning capabilities', articulating ‘roles for private sector and international partners', and developing ‘appropriate responses for both state and non-state actors'.\nObama moved quickly to implement and showcase the new US cyber deterrence posture. He began in 2009 by creating and filling a new position, the Executive Branch Cybersecurity Coordinator (aka, the White House cyber czar). Howard Schmidt, a former head of security at Microsoft, was tapped for the role, tasked with harmonising the various strategies and efforts that were being explored and enacted across the US government. Within the same year, the Department of Defense, in partnership with the NSA, established US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM, or Cybercom). Subordinate to US Strategic Command, housed at the NSA, and led by the director of the NSA, Cybercom was to use NSA networks to protect DoD computer and\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n261\ninformation infrastructure. Importantly, Cybercom was also eventually tasked with developing offensive cyber capabilities for deterrent purposes.\nDoD's cyber posture was initially defined in a relatively short 2011 document, DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, which built off the May 2010 National Security Strategy and February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The document provides five strategic initiatives relating to cyberspace, including that DoD will treat cyberspace as an 'operational domain' of warfare, and will 'organize, train, and equip' itself to 'take full advantage of cyberspace's potential'. The core of DoD's new cyber offensive posture is Cybercom's 133 Cyber Mission Force (CMF) teams. Each team is tasked with supporting a specific component of DoD's comprehensive cyber mission. For example, twenty-seven distinct 'Combat Mission' teams provide 'cyberspace effects' in support of military and operational plans. Other 'National Mission' and 'Protection Force' teams defend DoD and public networks and infrastructure by 'seeing adversary activity, blocking attacks, and maneuvering to defeat them'. A subsequent 2011 DoD report provided to Congress, DoD Cyberspace Policy Report, provides much greater detail as to how the Pentagon's evolving cyber posture provides a cyber deterrent effect. The report clearly relates offensive cyber capabilities with deterrence: 'should the \"deny objectives\" element of deterrence not prove adequate, DoD maintains ... the ability to respond militarily in cyberspace and in other domains ... using cyber and/or kinetic capabilities'. The report also highlights several other cyber deterrent issues and dilemmas the US will continue to face. They included: i) how to develop a US 'declaratory deterrence posture for cyberspace'; ii) the ways in which DoD will address the 'attribution' dilemma inherent to cyber deterrence by building 'cyber forensic capabilities' and 'behavior-based algorithms' for tracing the source of a cyberattack; iii) the dilemma DoD faces in demonstrating cyber capabilities and communicating plans for deterrent purposes without revealing sensitive tools, intelligence or techniques; and iv) how DoD will 'maintain control' of cyber escalation in times of crisis and war.\nThis last dilemma was subsequently tackled in a 2013 DoD Task Force Report, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, produced by the Defense Science Board. The report is perhaps most notable for openly suggesting that DoD cyber deterrence be anchored to offensive capabilities up to and including nuclear retaliation in the event of 'existential cyber attack'.

WILNER\nPosture Review (NPR) – which provided the President with guidance in nuclear policy – because it did ‘not explicitly mention’ and otherwise remained ‘essentially silent on [the] relationship between the U.S. nuclear deterrent … and the domain of cyber warfare’.77 Navy Admiral Michael Rogers, the chief of Cybercom and director of the NSA, later repurposed the nuclear analogy in his March 2015 testimony before the Senate Committee on Armed Services. ‘I liken our historical moment’, Rogers argued, ‘to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the [t]riad [sic] and underpinned by … policy structures including a declared deterrence posture’. On cyber offense, Rogers continues, the US must ‘commit time, effort, and resources to understanding our historical situation and building cyber military capabilities’.78 A month following Rogers’ testimony, DoD published The DoD Cyber Strategy (2015) its first such strategic document.\nThe 2015 Strategy enshrined Cybercom's expanding offensive purpose. The document, an expansive overview of cyberwarfare and cyber defence, helps guide the development and use of the CMF teams, going quite a distance in illustrating their ability, purpose, and potency. The document also defines deterrence by emphasising punishment, rather than denial, in cyberspace: 'The United States will continue to respond to cyberattacks against U.S. interests at a time, in a manner, and in a place of our choosing, using appropriate instruments of U.S. power'. By October 2016, all of Cybercom's CMF teams reached initial operating capability, translating into a force of roughly 6,000 cyber-warriors. A little over a year later, in January 2018, Cyber Command's headquarters - Joint Force Headquarters Department of Defense Information Network (JFHQ-DODIN) - itself became fully operational.\nSeparately, DoD again tasked the Defense Science Board to sharpen US cyber deterrence options, policy, and strategy, especially in the realm of deterrence by punishment. The DSB Task Force on Cyber Deterrence was established in October 2014; it published its final report in February 2017. Asked to explore the 'requirements for effective deterrence of cyber attacks' against the United States and its allies, and to identify digital and non-digital capabilities 'needed to support deterrence, war-fighting, and escalation control against a highly cyber-capable adversary', the Task Force focused\n77DoD Defense Science Board, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, 2013, 41. The 2010 NPR references 'cyber' exactly once; see DoD Nuclear Posture Review, 2010.\n78Admiral Michael Rogers, Statement before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, March 2015.\n79DoD Cyber Strategy, 2015, 10-11.\n80Navy Vice Adm. Nancy Norton took command of the Headquarters in February 2018. US Cyber Command News Release, 'DoD's Network Defense Headquarters Achieves Full Operational Capability', 31 January 2018; Defense Information Systems Agency News, 'Norton Assumes Command of JFHQ-DODIN and Directorship of DISA', 1 February 2018.\nprimarily on deterring high-end cyber threats emanating from major and ‘lesser' powers and sophisticated non-state actors. The DSB makes several important suggestions. First, it introduces the term ‘deterrence by cost imposition' to replace the more commonly used term deterrence by punishment. The rationale, it would seem, is to broaden punishment's scope in keeping with the emerging logic of cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace. ‘Cost imposition' better captures the kinetic, diplomatic, economic, law enforcement, and digital forms of punishment that the US might use in responding to cyberattacks and exploitations. Second, the DSB bridges the divide between denial and punishment in cyberspace. ‘DoD must create a second-strike cyber resilient “Thin Line”' of critical US offensive systems (cyber, nuclear and conventional) and related infrastructure in order to ensure that the US can credibly threaten retaliation in response to a potentially crippling cyber first strike. Good defence and resilience feeds into the potency and certainty of threats of punishment. Third, the DSB affirms, rather bluntly, the continued asymmetry between offense and defence in cyberspace. ‘The unfortunate reality', the 2017 DSB report reads, ‘is that, for at least the coming five to ten years, the offensive cyber capabilities of our most capable potential adversaries are likely to far exceed the United Sates' ability to defend and adequately strengthen the resilience of its critical infrastructures'. US cyber offense, then, is needed to correct the perceptions of asymmetry between defenders and challengers. Finally, the DSB links cyber deterrence to reputation, past and future. It warns that not responding to a cyberattack -- once, presumably, US cyber deterrence has failed -- is, with ‘near-certainty ... an invitation to follow-on cyber attacks'. In sum, the DSB Task Force solidifies the primary role offense will have in US cyber deterrence posture and strategy of the emerging decades.\nWith its offensive building blocks in place, the US, first under President Obama and later, under President Trump, began flexing its cyber muscle. It surreptitiously destroyed centrifuges in Iran, sabotaging and delaying the country's nuclear weapons program. It explored using cyberspace to dismantle Libya's air defences leading up to the March 2011 military intervention. The US likewise targeted and sabotaged North Korea's missile development program. Elsewhere, Cybercom was charged with attacking ISIS's online presence and capability in support of US and coalition plans to degrade and defeat the terrorist organisation, and to digitally augment related kinetic operations in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. The US is thought to have also used cyberspace to retaliate against North Korea following its 2014 hack on Sony Pictures. Other forms of punishment were meted out by\n#\nA. S. WILNER\nthe Justice Department. New cyber attribution capabilities allowed DOJ, in 2014, 2016, and 2018 to indict over a dozen Chinese military hackers, seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel, and another two private Iranian citizens for stealing US intellectual property, computer hacking, and launching ransomware attacks, and several Russian military intelligence officers for a string of hacks targeting the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and sporting and anti-doping agencies in the US, Canada and Europe. Via EO 13687, President Obama likewise imposed additional sanctions on North Korea in January 2015 in direct response to the Sony Hack. Finally, in his last days in office, President Obama sanctioned and expelled Russian nationals for their role in hacking the 2016 presidential election. Another 13 Russian nationals and three companies were subsequently charged by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of Special Council Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian's meddling in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Russia was again fingered by American and British officials in April 2018 for targeting and exploiting network infrastructure devices, like routers, for purposes of espionage. The coercive message, all told, is that the US has developed the capability to trace and attribute cyberattacks conducted against it and its allies, and to launch punitive measures in cyberspace and across domains in response.\nIn hand with this shift towards cyber punishment, Obama also developed US declaratory posture for cyberspace and helped establish international norms for cyber engagement. From a deterrence perspective, it is not enough to simply have the tools to harm an adversary: you also need to establish and communicate red lines against which acts of retaliation will be measured. Norms that help identify what is and is not acceptable behaviour in cyberspace further solidify retaliatory threats. Obama's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace is the backbone of this process. 'The digital world is no longer a lawless frontier', President Obama's opening statement to the document reads, 'it is a place where the norms of responsible, just, and peaceful conduct among states and people have begun to take hold'. The strategy outlines how the US would provide leadership in establishing global norms for cyber behaviour. The US State Department, for instance, went on to establish the world's first Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues (S/CCI) in February 2011, dedicated to coordinating the Department's diplomatic work on cyber and developing international cyber rules. Some 20\n84For an exploration of how and why North Korea's hack manipulated Sony's behaviour, which ultimately triggered the US response, see Travis Sharp, 'Theorizing Cyber Coercion: The 2014 North Korean Operation against Sony', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/7 (2017).\n85UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Joint US-UK Statement on Malicious Cyber Activity Carried out by Russian Government', 16 April 2018; UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Advisory: Russian Statesponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices', 16 April 2018.\n86The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace, 2011, 3.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n265\nother states later inaugurated their own, similar, offices. S/CCI’s greatest success was the 2015 US-China agreement on economic cyber espionage – a bilateral arrangement that China subsequently agreed to sign with the UK, Canada, Australia, the G-7, and G-20 – that codified that neither party would conduct ‘cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property’.87 The hope is that these bilateral and multilateral initiatives will curtail particular forms of behaviour in cyberspace that will eventually inform and help establish more comprehensive norms of engagement.\nThe Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues was also instrumental in assisting a UN Group of Government Experts (GGE) establish a rudimentary list of cyber norms in 2015 (though the GGE failed in 2017 to subsequently link those norms to recommendations embedded in international law).88 In terms of cyber deterrence, the 2011 Strategy illustrates that the US will continue to bolster denial – redubbed here as ‘dissuasion’ – to deter attacks, but also strongly signals its ‘right to self-defense’ in conducting cyber retaliation. The US, the document reads, ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any threat to our country … and we recognize that certain hostile acts … could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic’.89 In line with these strategic pronouncements, the Obama Administration tried to make a distinction between cyber espionage for the purposes of statecraft – which was deemed legitimate – and cyber espionage, theft, and attack for the purposes of economic or domestic disruption and infrastructure destruction – all deemed illegitimate. Thus, on the one hand, China’s 2015 exfiltration of over 20 million personnel records from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was deemed ‘not an attack’ by James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, but rather good espionage; ‘[we] would have done the same thing’.90 But on the other hand, Russia’s 2015/16 hack, manipulation, and leak of Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee data during the 2016 presidential election was deemed by CIA Director, John Brennan, as a ‘new level of malicious activity’ meant to undermine and influence the institution of US democracy.91 In January 2017,\n87 Adam Segal, ‘The Top Five Cyber Policy Developments of 2015’, Council on Foreign Relations blog, 4 January 2016.\n88 UN General Assembly, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, Seventieth Session, Item 93, 2015.\n89 The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World, May 2011, 13–14.\n90 The 2017 DSB report does however argue, rather cryptically, that ‘some would view’ the OPM heist as an example of ‘egregious behavior’ that crossed the ‘unwritten rules of traditional espionage’, DSB 2017, 7, 11–12. See also, David Sanger, ‘US Wrestles with how to fight back against Cyberattacks’, NY Times, 30 July 2016; Mike Levine, ‘China is “Leading Suspect” in Massive Hack of US Government Networks’, ABC News, 25 June 2016.\n91 Sanger, ‘Wrestles’.\n#\nA. S. WILNER\ntwo weeks before Trump's inauguration, DHS took the unprecedented step of classifying 'election infrastructure' as a critical infrastructure subsector, providing it with priority protection within the NIPP.\nWhile the Trump Administration's cyberspace and cyber deterrence strategies are still being patched together, given the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date, and given what we know about Trump's leanings in international affairs, three things are likely to occur under his watch.\nFirst, threats of cyber retaliation and the logic of deterrence by punishment will continue to grow in importance. Pentagon officials have long sought more leeway from congress to engage in cyber offense. In 2017, Admiral Rogers, Cybercom's chief, lamented that 'offensive cyber is almost treated like nuclear weapons, in the sense that their application ... is controlled at the chief executive level and not delegated down. What I would like to see, over the next five to 10 years', is that US cyber weapons are viewed 'as another tool for the commanders' at the tactical level. Signaling his acceptance of Rogers' position, President Trump, in August 2017, initiated the elevation of Cybercom to the status of a Unified Combatant Command (a step long-debated, but never taken, under Obama). The transition places Cybercom at par with other unified commands, like US Strategic Command or US European Command, establishing a direct line of communication between Cybercom's director and the Secretary of Defense. And a year later, in August 2018, President Trump rescinded a 2012 Obama-era directive - Presidential Policy Directive 20 - that governed the manner in which cyberattacks were approved. The reversal loosens the (somewhat onerous) restrictions that Obama had placed on conducting offensive cyber operations.\nFurthermore, Trump's February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (the first tabled since 2010), goes to some length in closing the cross-domain gap between nuclear weapons, nuclear retaliation, and cyber deterrence. Just as DoD's aforementioned Defense Science Board report recommended in 2013, the 2018 NPR expands the scope conditions that might lead to a US nuclear response as a result of a cyberattack. While US nuclear retaliation will continue to be reserved for 'extreme circumstances', the 2018 NPR significantly broadens these circumstances themselves to include 'significant non-nuclear strategic attacks', on 'civilian population or infrastructure'. Read:\n92Department of Homeland Security, 'Statement by Secretary Jeh Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector', 6 January 2017.\n93Cheryl Pellerin, 'Rogers Discusses near Future of U.S. Cyber Command', DoD News, 24 February 2017.\n94Separately, in February 2018, the White House signaled its intention to nominate Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone as Rogers' replacement at the helm of the NSA and Cybercom. The White House, Statement by President Donald J. Trump on the Elevation of Cyber Command, 18 August 2017; Chris Bing, 'White House Official: Paul Nakasone Nominated for NSA Director', CyberScoop, 13 February 2018.\n95Sean Lyngass, 'PPD-20 Elimination opens arguments over how US should Conduct Offensive Hacking Operations', CyberScoop, 16 August 2018.\ncrippling cyberattack. Additionally, perhaps cognizant that technology risks advancing more quickly than strategic policy, the NPR further warns that ‘the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of non-nuclear strategic attack technologies and U.S. capabilities to counter that threat'. Lest anyone misinterpret the document, DoD simultaneously published the NPR's Executive Summary in several languages, including Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Russian.\nThe logic of all of this was rolled into the State Department's ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats', a three-page brief published in May 2018 in direct response to EO 13800, and DoD's new Cyber Strategy, published in September 2018. The ‘Recommendations' report suggests that existing efforts at deterrence in cyberspace are ‘necessary but not sufficient': ‘network defense alone' is not enough. Calling for a ‘fundamental rethinking' of existing frameworks and a ‘new US vision' for cyber deterrence, the report recommends the development of a ‘broader menu of consequences' that the US can impose against state and non-state actors below ‘the threshold of the use of force'. With reference to the perennial issues of attribution and coercive credibility, the document calls for the US to openly demonstrate its ability to identify threats by imposing ‘swift, costly, and transparent consequences' on adversaries. Action will stand for credibility and might have ‘downstream deterrence effects'. Cyber offense is likewise paramount in DoD's 2018 Cyber Strategy. While the strategy itself is not publicity available, a 7-page summary is. And while this new strategy supersedes DoD's 2015 Strategy it compliments DoD's 2018 National Defense Strategy and the 2017 National Security Strategy. The document warns specific adversaries that the US will ‘build a more lethal force', conduct pre-emptive operations, ‘prepare for war', and collect cyber intelligence so as to field the ‘military cyber capabilities' the US needs to ‘defend forward'. A fuzzy term, defending forward implies terminating attacks at their (foreign) source, and ‘leveraging [US] focus outward to stop threats before they reach their targets'. By persistently engaging cyber competitors and aggressors on a daily basis, and by employing the Pentagon's full range of offensive capabilities, the US, the Strategy submits, will deter malicious cyber activities over time.\nSecond, and somewhat relatedly, under Trump, non-state actors may be encouraged to conduct cyber punishment and cyber offense themselves. The idea is to permit victims of cyber aggression and crime -- companies,\nA. S. WILNER\ninstitutions, NGOs, and individuals – to ‘hack back’ or counterattack via ‘active defense’ against their perpetrators. Under the current US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, it is illegal for individuals to gain entry into another’s computer system without permission. Though several US tech firms, including Google and Microsoft, have voiced concerns, Congress has nonetheless explored exceptions as part of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (first proposed in March 2017), and Georgia’s General Assembly passed a bill (later vetoed by the Governor) that would have made provisions for non-state active defence in cyberspace.⁹⁹ Despite the controversy, some companies, including major US banks, have been reported to have surveyed the utility of hack backs to protect their servers, data, and assets.¹⁰⁰ In a telling episode, Bossert, the former White House security advisor, and Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra, the chief cybersecurity official at DHS, heaped rare praise on Facebook and Microsoft during their lengthy December 2017 press-briefing in which the US officially blamed North Korea for conducting the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks. The attacks encrypted data on hundreds of thousands of public and private sector computers in over 150 countries. ‘We applaud our corporate partners’, Bossert asserted, ‘for acting on their own initiative … without any direction by the U.S. government … to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers. They shut down accounts … used to launch attacks and patched systems’.¹⁰¹ The destructive power and frequency of cyber hacking only grew under Obama. This trend will continue under Trump. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and wirelessly tethered Internet of Things (IoT) devices, along with new types of malicious activity like ransomware and sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, both of which can now be bought and sold on the Dark Web, will reshape the cyber threat landscape for individuals, communities, NGOs, and public and private-sector actors.¹⁰² Under the right conditions, non-state hack backs and other disruptive actions – the twenty-first century’s version of digital vigilantism – may prove useful for establishing a whole-of-society – rather than a whole-of-government – US cyber deterrence doctrine.\nFinally, in keeping with Trump’s general weariness of multilateralism and the United Nations in particular, the US is likely to downplay its role in establishing global cyber norms and focus instead on communicating its own red lines and bolstering the cyber deterrent posture of like-mined allied\n⁹⁹Zaid Shoorbajee, ‘Google and Microsoft ask Georgia Governor to Veto “Hack Back” Bill’, *CyberScoop*, 27 April 2018; Ryan Johnston, ‘After Widespread outcry, Georgia Governor Vetoes “Hack Back” Bill’, *State Scoop*, 8 May 2018.\n¹⁰⁰Dan Lohrmann, ‘Hack Back Law’, *Government Technology*, September 2017; Nicholas Schmidle, ‘The Digital Vigilantes who Hack Back’, *New Yorker*, 7 May 2018.\n¹⁰¹The White House, ‘Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea’, 19 December 2017.\n¹⁰²Bruce Schneier, ‘Botnets of Things’, *MIT Technology Review*, March/April 2017.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n#\nstates. The 2018 'Recommendations' report, for illustration, calls on the US to first establish criteria for US retaliation and to then communicate the policy both 'publicly and privately' so as to generate a deterrent effect. Separately, Trump shuttered the State Department's cyber coordinator's office, effectively degrading America's role in UN negotiations, though the Administration did test the waters for restarting the process of norm building in October 2018, following a ministerial meeting with US allies. What appears more certain, however, is that the US is likely to seek bilateral cyber relations with other states and groups of states. At the Cyber Week 2017 gathering in Israel in June, for instance, the ever-present Bossert announced the US-Israel bilateral cyber working group – which was to be led by White House cyber czar, Rob Joyce, before his departure and the elimination his position – signalling Washington's preference for establishing cyber coalitions of the willing. '[W]e must', Bossert warned, 'hold those who violate [cyber] norms accountable. This may not be achievable through a UN effort. Likeminded states should work to develop options for imposing consequences within a coalition structure'. In a similar vein, the US, in partnership with the UK, Germany and other NATO allies, aims to establish cyber warfare principles for 2019. And, as the White House articulates in its 2018 Cyber Strategy, the US has plans to build a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative' that will convene a coalition of 'like-minded states' that can collectively develop 'tailored strategies' and jointly impose 'consequences against malign actors'.\n# Conclusion: Evolution in theory\nUS cyber deterrence has come a long way since 2003. Definitions of deterrence – and core concepts linked to punishment and denial – have been revisited, reconceptualised, and broadened in scope. New government positions, institutions, agencies, and organisations have been created, staffed, trained, and tasked with operationalising core concepts. New technology, including software and hardware, has been developed and deployed. Partnerships across the US government, the private sector, and civil society have been established. And allies and international organisations have been leveraged. The footprints of all of these changes are evident in the record: US strategic doctrine allows us to trace the direction of this evolution. From a theoretical perspective, the way in which US cyber deterrence has been adapted since its inception provides\n103Sean Lyngaas, 'US Looks to Restart Talks on Global Cyber Norms', CyberScoop, October 2018.\n104The White House, 'Remarks by Homeland Security Advisor Thomas P. Bossert at Cyber Week 2017', 26 June 2017.\n105Robin Emmott, 'NATO mulls \"Offensive Defense\" with Cyber Warfare Rules', Reuters, 30 November 2017.\n106 National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America, September 2018, 21.\nscholars with insight as to how deterrence theory itself might respond to the promises and paradoxes of cyber deterrence. Several lessons stand out.\nFirst, US cyber deterrence has shifted from an almost exclusive focus on defence and deterrence by denial under President Bush to a punishment-based strategy under Presidents Obama and Trump. Part of the reason threats of retaliation and ‘deterrence by cost imposition' are currently emphasised is that recent technological advancements have allowed the US to improve its ability to monitor cyberattacks, identify perpetrators, and administer retaliatory actions, both within and outside cyberspace. Simply put, punishment strategies are increasingly feasible. Technological advancements have led to the adoption and use of new offensive coercive strategies. If so, theorists themselves should better situate technology into their own work of deterrence. How might the prerequisites of deterrence theory, and the concepts derived from them, adapt to novel, emerging, and disruptive technology within and beyond cyberspace?\nSecond, and relatedly, a separate reason US cyber punishment strategies have come to overshadow denial strategies has to do with the perception that deterrence by denial is not working, or rather, that the threat of denial used alone and separately from the threat of punishment, is not working. The number, severity and complexity of cyberattacks targeting US government and private sector facilities and assets has continued to rise over the past 15 years despite the US government's communicated threat of defence and denial. In response, US doctrine and strategy has evolved such that punishment is being used hand-in-glove with denial. For illustration, synchronising their efforts to defend the 2018 US midterm elections, DoD-DHS collaboration saw the former (via Cyber Command) target Russian operatives overseas to disrupt their actions all the while the latter worked with social media companies to counter disinformation. In practice, the two approaches reinforce each other. Recalibrating the effect punishment and denial have on each other in practice, suggests that theories of deterrence must better relate how the logic of punishment augments, or otherwise corresponds to, the logic of denial. Too often punishment and denial are considered poles apart, distinct levers applied separately to the cost-benefit calculus that underpins rational behaviour and coercion. In theory, how do punishment and denial relate and overlap; in cyberspace when does one stop and the other start?\nThird, the US has come to equate attribution as a distinct form of punishment that appears logically linked to denial. In fielding a question during the 2017 WannaCry press briefing, Bossert suggested, for instance, that ‘it's not about holding a country accountable; it's about simple culpability. We've determined who was behind the [WannaCry] attack, and we're saying it. ...\nWe're going to hold them accountable ... And we're going to shame them for it. ... And I think it's going to improve our security'. By identifying North Korea, the US denied it the benefit of anonymity in cyberspace; by publically outing North Korea, the US put the regime on notice for future punishment. From a theoretical perspective, however, attribution is largely understood as a mechanism, a crucial step that allows a defender to retaliate by identifying a challenger, rather than as a functional punishment in its own right. If so, and in light of perceptual changes in practice, deterrence theory must better explore whether, how, and under what conditions public attribution -- and the threat of shaming -- function as a source of cyber deterrence at the different levels of analysis. How might public and private attribution of an attack deter, coerce, or otherwise influence individual, non-state, and state cyber challengers?\nFourth, US cyber deterrence is not chiefly about military coercion. Notwithstanding Cybercom's emerging role in providing the US government with offensive and military options to punish cyber aggressors globally, US cyber deterrence strategy has emphasised the importance of several other departments and agencies, including DOJ, DHS, FBI, State Department and various others, for both denying and punishing cyberattacks. The goal is to equip the US government with as wide a set of coercive levers as possible, crossing domains as needed, to provide a truly whole of government approach to cybersecurity and cyber deterrence. The role of the DOJ (and the FBI by extension) is especially enlightening. By publicly indicting foreign nationals for cyberattacks conducted on American computer systems, the US government underscores the fact that contemporary cyber deterrence transcends traditional defence policy and military doctrine. By establishing the DOJ as a core pillar of its punishment strategy, the US signals its intention to use criminal justice tools to deter not just criminal attacks but attacks conducted by nation state adversaries. In doing so, the US further blurs the line between state institutions and individuals, by sanctioning the latter for actions they perpetrated while working for or on behalf of foreign governments, militaries, or intelligence agencies. For deterrence theory, the burgeoning role non-military and non-kinetic coercion have had in US cyber deterrence posture suggests that academics must redouble their efforts at multidisciplinarity. Academic silos still exist in the manner in which deterrence theory is developed and tested. To some degree, deterrence from within IR theory is privileged over that stemming from criminology, psychology, and terrorism and intelligence studies. This is especially the case when it comes to deterrence in national security and international affairs. Though the fourth wave of deterrence scholarship has gone to\nsome length to bridge the disciplinary divide, more cross-fertilisation is needed among disciplines to better reflect and speak to developments taking place in practice. What theoretical lessons do non-IR approaches to deterrence hold for how IR theories of cyber deterrence are developed and improved?\nFifth, US cyber deterrence is not solely about states, either. Rather, non-state actors figure prominently in American strategic doctrine as both potential perpetrators of cyberattacks targeting US infrastructure, and, more importantly for our purposes, as potential partners that amplify US cyber deterrence. For instance, private sector and individual victims of cyberattack share information, voluntarily, about attacks with law enforcement and intelligence. This provides governments with a better understanding of the nature, prevalence and evolution of certain types of attack, which can lead to improvements in defence and denial. In other cases, as highlighted by Facebook, Microsoft, and Marcus Hutchins -- a private British citizen who noticed a ‘kill switch' within WannaCry's code and took action to temporarily shut the attack down -- non-state actors can track and impede attacks without government oversight, further denying perpetrators the fruits of their labour. In still other cases, non-state actors, including companies, individuals, academics, NGOs, and other such groups, can augment US cyber security and deterrence by denial efforts by practicing better cyber hygiene -- i.e. updating passwords or patching software. This functions to further deny challengers easy opportunities to conduct successful attacks. On this front, Washington is exploring how it might compel (or, even, demand) private sector partners, contractors, and suppliers to do more to defend and secure their own networks, data and assets, as a precondition for working with and on behalf of the US government. In February 2018, for instance, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, in discussing the 2018 National Defense Strategy at a conference, warned that DoD wanted the cyber security ‘bar to be set so high, it will become the condition of doing business' with the Pentagon; for industry, cybersecurity will be ‘foundational to business with DoD'. The point, in this case, is to develop a whole of society deterrence posture, rather than simply a whole of government approach. The logic of all of this goes back to a statement made in President Bush's opening letter to the first 2003 cybersecurity strategy, oft repeated since: ‘Securing cyberspace is an extraordinarily difficult strategic challenge that requires a coordinated and focused effort from our entire society -- the federal government, state and local governments, the private sector, and the American people'. ‘Every American', the strategy continues ‘who can contribute to securing part of cyberspace is encouraged\nto do so. The federal government invites the creation of, and participation in, public-private partnerships to raise cybersecurity awareness, train personnel, stimulate market forces, improve technology, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, exchange information and plan recovery operations. Of the many ways in which the US government has previously approached deterrence in the other domains of warfare, this general call to arms is unique to cyberspace and cyber deterrence.\nIn response, scholars of deterrence need to explore the nature and feasibility of non-state cyber deterrence. Cyberspace is not a state-centric environment. On the contrary: states and militaries represent a tiny fraction of all the communities, individuals, and non-state actors that constitute cyberspace. Objects, too, have cyber presence. Projections suggest that 50 billion items -- from smart-homes to smart-cars, and from ‘intelligent' construction materials to wireless medical devices -- will be networked online as part of the IoT through an array of embedded electronics, software and sensors. All to say, the vast majority of interactions and the vast majority of the data created online is non-state in nature. Cyber deterrence theory must move beyond its narrow focus on states to account for the diversity of actors and objects that populate cyberspace. What is the equivalent in cyberspace of businesses, community groups, and homeowners employing storefront lighting, neighbourhood watch programs, and anti-burglary systems to deter physical attacks, theft and robbery? Can non-state actors be agents of their own deterrence in cyberspace?\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."

Wilner Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada # ABSTRACT When compared to advancements in conceptualising deterrence in other domains, cyber deterrence is still in it messy infancy. In some ways cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine, and policy are developed and put to use even before corresponding theories are properly understood. This article analyses how American cyber deterrence has been implemented over the past two decades in order to inform ongoing debates within the academic study of deterrence, and to provide insights from practice for how cyber deterrence theory can be better conceived and refined.\nWhile President Donald Trump upbraided the previous administration's apparent weakness in cyberspace – ‘We’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing’ – his administration has itself struggled to table a coherent cyber deterrence strategy, despite repeated promises to do so quickly.¹ As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to ‘develop the offensive cyber capabilities we need to deter attacks by both state and non-state actors’.² Two weeks following his November 2017 election, President-elect Trump went on to explain further – that he would build ‘a comprehensive plan to protect America’s vital infrastructure against cyberattacks’.³ And months later still, as President, he signed Executive Order (EO) 13800 in May 2017 – an updated draft of a January 2017 EO that had been scraped at the last minute – on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. The EO describes a plan to reassess all elements of US cybersecurity across and beyond the government. In terms of cyber deterrence specifically, EO 13800 calls on various agencies and departments – including the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security, along with the Director of CONTACT Alex S.

S. WILNER National Intelligence – to jointly submit a report ‘on the Nation’s strategic options for deterring adversaries’ in cyberspace. The report was to be submitted within 90 days. A public version of the report eventually appeared in May 2018. \nPresident Trump was also slow to appoint or approve several top-level federal cybersecurity and technology positions – including, notably, Federal Chief Information Security Officer, and the head of DHS's cybersecurity and infrastructure protection division. These positions are critical to guiding US cybersecurity policy and planning, including in the area of cyber deterrence. Despite all of this, (former) White House Homeland Security advisor, Thomas Bossert – who helped craft cybersecurity policy under US President George W. Bush – revealed in October 2017, that the Trump Administration was determined to eventually publish a new cybersecurity strategy based on EO 13800. And in his January 2017 Confirmation Hearing, General James Mattis, President Trump's (former) Secretary of Defense, suggested that a comprehensive 'cyber doctrine' might be ready by July 2018. The new National Cyber Strategy was eventually published in September 2018, after an earlier public summary was held back in May 2018. \nAlthough a US cyber deterrence strategy distinct from a broader cyber doctrine has yet to be established or fully leveraged, bits and pieces of the strategy exist, peppered about in different government departments and agencies. Indeed, US cyber deterrence has evolved a great deal since the mid-2000s. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, to better anticipate where US cyber deterrence is heading in practice by exploring the manner in which it has evolved through different presidential administrations. And second, to trace the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date to explore cyber deterrence in theory. When compared to theoretical advancements in conceptualising and implementing deterrence in other domains, including, The White House, Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical infrastructure, 11 May 2017.\nUS Department of State, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats’, 31 May 2018.\nJoseph Marks, ‘Many Top Cybersecurity Posts Remain Empty – and Not on Purpose’, DefenseOne, 10 November 2017; Mohana Ravindranath, ‘Many CFO Act federal Agencies are Still being Lead by Acting Chief Information Officers’, Nextgov, 17 November 2017.\nIn a moment of further intrigue, Bossert resigned his post in April 2018, on the request of John Bolton, Trump’s newly-appointed national security advisor. Bossert’s departure was followed a week later by Rob Joyce’s, the White House cybersecurity coordinator. President Trump later eliminated Joyce’s position altogether, in May 2018.

By the standards of deterrence theory, which has a robust and cumulative pedigree dating back over a century, cyber deterrence is an innovative but imperfectly understood idea. The bulk of the academic literature on cyber deterrence was produced only very recently, over the past fifteen years or so. Moreover, in some important ways, US cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine and policy have been developed, unveiled and put to use even before corresponding theories from academia are properly understood, tested and refined.\nIf practice precedes theory, then a reflection of how this practice progressed over time may help inform theory more broadly. Combined, these circumstances leave scholars with a unique opportunity to evaluate an example of cyber deterrence practice in order to explain and better describe cyber deterrence theory. In methodological terms, this article explores how American cyber deterrence has been implemented in order to better highlight theory more broadly. The United States, by dint of its size, pre-eminence in cyberspace and decades of experience operationalising deterrence theory in other domains, represents a crucial case. Moreover, in empirical terms, the US government openly discusses cybersecurity, and has made various iterations of its cyber deterrence strategy and doctrine publicly available. While a comprehensive US cyber deterrence strategy has yet to be tabled, fragments of the strategy can be patched together, piecemeal, from various US government bodies. A record of thought and practice exists; wading through it provides insights for theory.\nThe article begins with a summary of the academic literature on deterrence theory dating back to the beginning of the Cold War. The rationale here is to outline the nuts and bolts of deterrence theory, highlight conceptual prerequisites, illustrate the many ways deterrence has been operationalised, and briefly assess the ‘four waves' of deterrence scholarship. Next, the article takes a broad look at cyber deterrence theory in particular. The purpose is to discuss the core debates and research clusters embedded within this particular sub-field of the literature. Doing so will provide a theoretical foundation against which the empirical work can be paired against. An exploration of US cyber deterrence then follows. This section will provide a detailed and linear reflection of US cyber deterrence strategy, doctrine and policy stretching back to the early 2000s. The analysis will piece together how US strategy has unfolded and evolved over time, and help identify specific concepts, trends and assumptions baked into strategic # A. S. WILNER discourse. Highlights from the US example will then be analysed in the conclusion of the article. The way the United States has put cyber deterrence into practice over time provides lessons and insights for how cyber deterrence theory might be better conceived, approached and refined.\n# Deterrence in theory: Concepts and debates Deterrence is an enduring concept. It has repeatedly proven its flexibility in responding to, and evolving from, shifting international and interstate dynamics. Deterrence, at its theoretical core, entails using threats to manipulate an adversary's behaviour.[11] More concretely, it rests on convincing another actor to forgo an unwanted action. Compellence – a related concept – flips the process around, prompting an adversary to pursue an action it might otherwise have avoided. Compellence encourages behaviour, whereas deterrence restrains it. Both are subsumed within the logic of coercion. In all cases of deterrence and compellence, a minimum of two actors are involved. Defenders issue threats to alter an opponent's behaviour; challengers consider these threats, weigh their options, and decide whether or not to acquiesce. In some cases, a third actor is involved. With extended deterrence, for instance, a proxy, partner, or ally is also included in the process, either on the side of the defender or the challenger. Threats of punishment – usually in the form of retaliation – and promises of denial – usually in the form of depriving an adversary the expected benefits of a particular behaviour – form the basis for most deterrent and compellent engagements, though normative and ideological considerations that inform behaviour have also been recently developed within the context of delegitimisation. Each of these three coercive processes is linked to the logic of deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial, and deterrence by delegitimisation, respectively.[12] Deterrence works by informing a challenger's cost-benefit calculus. Importantly, it does so by weighing upon another's strategic choice.[13] Militarily crushing an adversary, as Thomas Schelling reminds us, such that it has no alternative but to accept demands made of it is not deterrence, but rather defeat.[14] The same can be said in the realm of denial. Developing a perfect, foolproof defence, while rare, does not deter by denial but rather deters by defeat; an adversary does not penetrate a target or conduct a certain attack because it is prevented from doing so, not because it decides [11] Moving beyond theory and strategy, Amir Lupovici contends that deterrence is also an idea, internalized within the identity of those who rely on it. Lupvici, *The Power of Deterrence*.\n[12] On the latter, see for instance, Jerry Mark Long and Alex Wilner, 'Delegitimizing al-Qaida: Defeating an\"Army Whose Men Love Death\"', *International Security* 39/1 (2014).\n[13] Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge: Polity Press 2004), 26.\n[14] Thomas Schelling, *Arms and Influence* (1966), 1–34.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES Put into practice, deterrence theory rests on a number of pre-requisites. First, actors must exhibit a degree of rationality, such that some combination of threats will suffice to alter behaviour. Second, overlapping preferences short of open conflict must be shared by all parties; deterrence requires that adversaries accept the feasibility of non-violence. Third, threats, expected changes in behaviour and a willingness to punish violations must be communicated. Defenders must likewise reassure challengers that threats will not be carried out in the event demands are met. Fourth, defenders must have the perceived capability, and the resolve to punish or deny as threatened. Finally, deterrence works best again a known or suspected adversary; anonymity robs deterrence of its potency.\nBuilding off these prerequisites and core conceptual tenets, deterrence theory has evolved in new and exciting ways over the past several decades. This process of theoretical rejuvenation and praxis has been the result of both changing geostrategic realities (from bipolarity to unipolarity and back, for instance), and because of the emergence of new technology (from nuclear weapons to artificial intelligence) and security domains (including air, space and cyberspace). For illustration of this evolution, consider these various concepts. Central deterrence – which functions to protect a defender's assets – stands against extended (or triadic) deterrence – which functions to protect a third party's assets. Broad deterrence – which deters aggression writ large – stands against narrow deterrence – which deters a specific, and often limited, behaviour. Similarly, general deterrence seeks to ¹⁵ Alex Wilner, ‘Contemporary Deterrence Theory Counterterrorism: A Bridge too Far?’ NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 47/2 (2015).\n¹⁶ The literature is expansive. For a reference point, consider these various meta-analyses of the empirical record: Anthony Braga and David Weisburd, ‘The Effects of Focused Deterrence Strategies on Crime’, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency 49 (2012); Rob Guerette and Kate Bowers, ‘Assessing the Extent of Crime Displacement and Diffusion of Benefits’, Criminology 47/4 (2009); Trevor Bennett, Katy Holloway, and David Farrington, ‘Does Neighborhood Watch Reduce Crime?’ Journal of Experimental Criminology 2/4 (2006); David Farrington, et al., ‘The Effects of Closed-Circuit Television on Crime’, Journal of Experimental Criminology 3 (2007).\n¹⁷ See, for illustration Kevin Woods and Mark Stout, ‘Saddam’s Perceptions and Misperceptions’, Journal of Strategic Studies 33/1 (2010); Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein, ‘Rational Deterrence Theory: I Think, Therefore I Deter’, World Politics 41/2 (1989); Robert Jervis, Richard Ned Lebow, and Janice Gross Stein, Psychology and Deterrence (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 1985); Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (Random House 2011).\nregulate and uphold accepted, status quo relations, whereas immediate deterrence functions within periods of crisis and against expected anti-status quo behaviour. Intra-war deterrence shapes certain behaviour within an ongoing hot war, after other forms of deterrence have already failed; the goal here is to influence an adversary's warfighting behaviour itself. Cumulative or serial deterrence is iterative; it functions by adding up the effects of repeated coercive interactions. Moving beyond threats, inducements, deflection, dissuasion, entanglement and influence have each been added to deterrence theory, too, broadening the manner in which defenders secure their interests and shape adversarial behaviour.\nWithin IR, deterrence scholarship has evolved within the context of ‘four waves', borrowing insights from other disciplines, namely criminology, terrorism studies, and psychology. The first wave emerged around the end of the Second World War, and corresponded to the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology within a US-dominated strategic backdrop. The second wave began in the early days of the Cold War. US-Soviet dynamics and alliance structures shaped the wave's research agenda, as did the limited proliferation of nuclear weapons to US allies, like France and the UK, and rivals, like China. The second wave used game theory and scientific modelling to explore how rivals could manage nuclear escalation and alliances. Focus was placed on strategic and conventional deterrence by punishment -- and to a much lesser degree on conventional deterrence by denial in Europe and Asia -- and on major power conflict pitting mutually rational and unitary state actors. The third wave began in the 1970s. Its focus was on empiricism, on qualitatively and quantitatively testing the concepts, frameworks and theories previously proposed. Findings suggested the importance of commitment, communication, and resolve in using both central and extended deterrence, and illustrated the variance embedded within the concept of expected utility. The psychology of coercion (e.g. human cognition and thought, bias, fatigue, decision-making, misperception, and error), along with notions of strategic culture, bureaucracy and leadership also emerged.\nThe fourth wave followed the end of the Cold War and continues today. A traditional focus on bipolarity, strategic weapons, and great power rivalries gave way to a diffusion of interests, both between and below state actors. In terms of scholarship, the fourth wave is both especially dynamic, and slightly chaotic: everything and everyone under the sun is in focus. Included here is work on deterring rogue states -- traditionally weak states and militaries often in possession of limited nuclear or chemical and biological weapons, like Iraq, Iran, THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # Serbia, North Korea, Syria, and Libya. Violent non-state actors have likewise been the focus of fourth wave scholarship, from pirates to ISIS and everyone in between, along with the processes of radicalisation, rebellion, insurgency, and political violence. And while deterrence in space was a concern during the Cold War, it largely featured a limited number of actors, the US and USSR. But in the fourth wave, space deterrence features new entrants, like India, China, Israel, and private sector actors, including SpaceX and Blue Origin, and rapidly diffusing technology, including new forms of anti-satellite weaponry (ASAT), miniature satellites, and privately owned, reusable mega-rockets. As the scope of deterrence has broadened, so, too, has the practice of deterrence: the logic of denial has been expanded beyond its conventional limits, as has extended deterrence. And altogether novel concepts, like cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace, have been proposed and tested. \n# Cyber deterrence in theory: Core research clusters Research on cyber deterrence is largely rooted to the classical literature on deterrence stemming from IR. Several thematic clusters populate the cyber deterrence literature.[23] T. V. Paul, Patrick M. Morgan, and James J. Wirtz (eds.), Complex Deterrence: Strategy in the Global Age (Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2009); James Lebovic, Deterring International Terrorism and Rogue States (London: Routledge 2007); Keith Payne, Deterrence in the Second Nuclear Age (Lexington: University of Kentucky 1996); Alex Wilner, 'Apocalypse Soon?

The 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace defines it as a 'nervous system' or 'control system' for US critical infrastructure, comprised of 'hundreds of thousands of interconnected computers, servers, routers, switches, and fiber optic cables'. The 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations later defined cyberspace as a 'domain', characterized by 'the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures'. And in a 2008 memo, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England defined cyberspace as 'a global domain', consisting of 'the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'. While definitions of cyberspace continue to evolve, for the purposes of this paper, cyberspace is understood as a global, interconnected domain constituting hardware, digital data, and related infrastructrue in which electronic devices are used to create, save and disseminate information. The phrase 'cyber deterrence' also lacks a precise definition. At its broadest, cyber deterrence is a field of study - as deterring terrorism might be thought of - that involves applying and exploring the logic, theory, and practice of deterrence within cyberspace. More narrowly, cyber deterrence might be understood as the deterrence of attacks within or using cyberspace, or conversely, the use of cyberspace to accomplish deterrence in other domains. This paper relies on the broader definition but highlights the narrow use of the term where necessary.\n# A. S. WILNER The largest cluster explores the manner in which the prerequisites of IR deterrence apply to cyberspace. By these standards some scholars conclude that the architecture of cyberspace – anonymity, complexity, interconnectivity, jurisdictional diffusion, open access – makes cyber deterrence inherently weak.[24] The fundamental prerequisites are not easily met. Herein, the attribution dilemma receives greatest attention.[25] The ease of digital obfuscation,[26] complexity of 'multi-stage' cyberattacks,[27] difficulty in signalling or communicating threats and deterrent capabilities,[28] and challenge of uncovering the physical source of a cyberattack,[29] can complicate how defenders construct and communicate credible coercive threats. If cyber adversaries believe that their identities are protected, retaliatory threats will fall short. A range of tentative solutions have been proposed. More sophisticated attribution capabilities, processes, and standards might be developed.[30] Or, the Internet could be reengineered as an attributed network.[31] Or, sources of a cyberattack might be better deduced weighing known capabilities, interests, and motivation of likely adversaries.[32] Or, third party enablers of cyberattacks (i.e., owners of cyber infrastructure, and other private sector actors) might be held better accountable.[33] Or, the threshold of 'certain identification' when contemplating retaliation can be lowered.[34] Still other authors illustrate how cyber attribution is not, in fact, as potent a 24The Economist (Benjamin Sutherland, ed.)

Weak states and non-state adversaries with fewer cyber platforms, conversely, have less to fear from cyberwar and much to gain by escalating a confrontation to digital space, where they may have advantages over traditionally stronger powers. That asymmetry may destabilise cyber deterrence.³⁷ Skirting this particular paradox may involve combining cyber threats with more traditional kinetic and non-kinetic threats, effectively adding military punishment, law enforcement, diplomatic and financial sanctions, and public shaming to the cyber mix. This cross-domain deterrent approach addresses cyber credibility by tackling on traditional forms of retaliation to the equation.³⁸ Robert Mandel suggests further that defenders use ‘unorthodox’ means to enhance the potency of their deterrence in cyberspace, including, for instance, ‘subtle political and diplomatic pressure on cyberattackers or their supporters, sponsor or patrons’, like public exposure, reputational embarrassment, shaming, condemnation, embassy closures, expulsion and other forms of humiliation.³⁹ Some authors caution, though, that skipping between the digital and physical (or kinetic) realms risks escalating a conflict in unanticipated ways.⁴⁰ Other experts counter that some cyberattacks, like those that disrupt financial or political systems by degrading software or targeting data rather than hardware, are unlikely to escalate to the kinetic domain at all.⁴¹ Still others argue that cyber and ³⁵ Glaser, ‘Deterrence’; Will Goodman, ‘Cyber Deterrence’, Strategic Studies Quarterly, 2010; Lindsay, ‘Tipping’; Ben Buchanan, The Cybersecurity Dilemma, 145; Joseph Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, International Security 41/3 (2017), 51–52.\n³⁶ Richard Harknett, et. al. ‘Leaving Deterrence Behind’, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management 7/1 (2010); Adam Liff, ‘Cyberwar: A New “Absolute Weapon?”’ Journal of Strategic Studies 35/3 (2012).\n³⁷ Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Paul Rosenzweig, ‘The Organization of the United States Government and Private Sector for Achieving Cyber Deterrence’, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2010); Mike McConnell, ‘Cyberwar is the New Atomic Age’, New Perspectives Quarterly 26/3 (2009); James Adams, ‘Virtual Defense’, Foreign Affairs 80/3 (2001); Martin Libicki, Conquest in Cyberspace, Chapter 11; Libicki, Cyberdeterrence (2009), Chapter Three; Libicki, ‘Cyberwar as a Confidence Game’, Strategic Studies Quarterly; Martin Libicki, Cyberspace in Peace and War (Naval Institute Press 2016), Chapter 16 &amp; 17; Harknett, ‘Information Warfare’.\n³⁸ James Lewis, ‘Cross-Domain Deterrence and Credible Threats’, CSIS Working Paper; Jon Lindsay and Erik Gartzke (eds.), Cross-Domain Deterrence (under review 2018); Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff, ‘Cyberwar’; Herbert Lin, ‘Laying an Intellectual Foundation for Cyberdeterrence’, in Kruger et al., (eds.), The Secure Information Society.\n³⁹ Mandel, Optimizing, 199–201.\n⁴⁰ Lewis ‘Cross-Domain’; Anthony Cordesman and Justin Cordesman, Cyberthreats, Information Warfare, and Critical Infrastructure Protection, Chapter One; Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff ‘Cyberwar’; Lin ‘Laying’.\n⁴¹ Harknett et al., ‘Leaving’; Rid ‘Cyber War’; Thomas Rid, ‘More Attacks, Less Violence’, Journal of Strategic Studies 36/1 (2013).\n# A. S. WILNER kinetic deterrence are not intrinsically separate: they intersect, compliment, and influence each other, such that retaliation in cyberspace may have unintended side-effects in non-cyber domains, like in international finance and diplomacy.[42] Conversely, successful deterrence in one domain may trigger deterrence failure in another, as occurs when successful kinetic deterrence compels an adversary to shift to cyberattacks.[43] A second research cluster centres on whether cyberspace favours offensive behaviour over defensive behaviour.[44] For instance, while the number of cyber targets grows exponentially and the process of safeguarding them more complex, the ease of conducting cyberattacks remains relatively stable and inexpensive. Nor can defenders expect forewarning of an imminent cyberattack, eliminating their ability to mount an immediate deterrent response. On the contrary: cyberattacks often go unnoticed, for months, even years. Other forms of cyberattack that rely on the logic of strategic surprise, Jim Writz warns, may compel a weaker adversary to present a traditionally strong defender, like the United States, with a 'fait accompli', such that the defender then faces the prospects of a costly response in returning to the status quo.[45] And traditional factors that mitigate offensive power in other domains of warfare – like the geographic distance between adversaries or resilient offensive weapons, including second strike capabilities – are much less evident in cyberwarfare, favouring intruders over defenders.[46] Relatedly, the sheer number of potential cyber adversaries complicates coercive calculations, creating a potential asymmetry in intent, capability, and resolve that favors aggressors.[47] Indeed, cyberspace augments the destructive power of weaker actors, including small, sub-state and non-sate networks.[48] Some authors conclude that cyber deterrence is a 'mirage', and that a warfighting framework is the only way to address 'cyberaggression'.[49] Still, other scholars caution against alarmism, noting that 42Amir Lupovici, 'The\"Attribution Problem\"and the Social construction of\"Violence\"', International Studies Perspectives 17/3 (2016); Goodman, 'Cyber Deterrence'; Ronald Deibert and Rafal Rohozinkis, 'Risking Security', International Political Sociology 4 (2010); Joseph Nye, 'Cyber Power', Belfer Center, Harvard Kennedy School Working Paper, 2011.\n43Jon Lindsay, 'Stuxnet and the Limits of Cyber Wafare', Security Studies 22/3 (2013).\n44John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!'

Frustrating the preparation phase of a cyberattack may be especially valuable.[53] Associated concepts like cyber resilience or resistance, in which compromised digital systems continue to function, or adapt and heal themselves, may further augment cyber denial.[54] However, some scholars retort that adversaries incur very low costs when their cyberattacks fail, especially when attribution is uncertain, and are able to continue trying, even unsuccessfully, without incurring further costs, suggesting that denial, decoupled from attribution and punishment, may provide few coercive benefits.[55] A fourth and final subset of the literature explores whether norms, regimes, and stigmatisation might delegitimise certain cyberattacks and shape individual and collective behaviour accordingly.[56] For example, Joseph Nye, borrowing logic developed for intra-war deterrence during the Cold War that deterred the use of certain weapons, like chemical and nuclear weapons, suggests that with cyberspace, a similar ‘taboo' might be constructed against certain types of cyberattack during peacetime, like those targeting civilian infrastructure and private sector facilities.\nIn sum, although a growing body of new literature explores the nuance and complexity of applying deterrence theory to cyber conflict, there is yet a great deal of division among scholars. Multiple poles within the research community exist. And much of the field is a conceptual extension of the literature on cyber warfare. Conflating warfare and deterrence makes a certain amount of sense given that deterrence is often a consequence of projecting military power. Yet this development has skewed the nascent literature on cyber deterrence in particular ways. First, IR deterrence is favoured, to the exclusion of the literature derived from criminology, psychology or other domains that have informed previous deterrence debates. Second, deterrence by punishment is overemphasised, such that denial, dissuasion, influence, delegitimisation and other concepts are often overlooked. Third, state actors figure prominently, to the near exclusion of the role non- and sub-state actors might have in deterring attacks in cyberspace. The coercive leverage of non-state cyber actors is rarely considered. Fourth, deterring high-end cyber threats dominates the research agenda. Deterring the far more common attributes of cyber insecurity, like cyber-crime, identity and property theft, data breaches and exfiltration, hacking (DDOS, malware, spear/phishing, whaling, ransomware), digital espionage, sabotage, bullying, and other concerns, goes largely unexplored. Fifth, policy prescription seems to dominate, while theoretical, methodological and empirical developments lag behind. Properly situating cyber deterrence within the larger IR literature, or within strategic studies, or political science, is wanting. Finally, few empirical evaluations of cyber deterrence have taken place, with the exceptions largely focusing on digital coercion among states actively involved in armed conflict.\nWhat follows is an exploration of how US cyber deterrence in practice has evolved over the past decades; lessons therein will help inform our theoretical understanding of how deterrence theory and cyberspace interact.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nAmerican cybersecurity strategy dates back to 2003, with the publication under President George W. Bush of the first standalone strategic document on cybersecurity – The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.⁶⁰ [Figure 1 provides a timeline of relevant US cyber deterrence and cyber security doctrine.] At its core, the strategy is guided by three objectives: preventing cyberattacks against critical infrastructure; reducing vulnerability to cyberattacks; and mitigating damage from cyberattacks. The document further defines the distinct roles and responsibilities held by different cyber actors – from individual-level users of cyberspace, to institutions, businesses, and innovators, and the critical infrastructure sectors. ‘Protecting the widely distributed assets of cyberspace’, the strategy reads, ‘requires the efforts of many Americans. The federal government alone cannot sufficiently defend America’s cyberspace’.⁶¹ It also describes the national and international issues and concerns that require US Government leadership, including, for instance, building a national response system that identifies threats, promotes information exchange, advises on remediation, diminishes cyber vulnerabilities, and establishes international initiatives and multilateral endeavours with other states and non-state partners to collaboratively bolster cybersecurity at the global level.\nIn terms of deterrence specifically, the strategy weds various aspects of denial and punishment together, though the latter is mostly focused on domestic criminal prosecution. For illustration, at the local-level, touting roles for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the 2003 strategy lays bare the utility of using detection, apprehension, and prosecution of cyber-criminals (at home and, if possible, abroad) as a way to punish violations of domestic and international law. Here, some aspects of cyber aggression are treated to the logic of criminological deterrence (e.g., swift, certain and severe punishment). Bush’s 2003 National Strategy does not, however, overtly address cyber punishment or retaliation among states or at the international level. Only the oblique suggestion that the US response ‘need not be limited to criminal prosecution’, and that the US ‘reserves the right to respond in an appropriate manner’, hint at any larger retaliatory global strategy.⁶² While these pronouncements may have been obligatory, for the purposes of coercion they are also inherently weak. As the\n⁶⁰The 2003 document was, however, preceded by several antecedent publications that outlined how the US envisioned cybersecurity, including, a Clinton-era Presidential Commission report (1997) and a 2000 National Plan on information security.

US cyber deterrence strategy timeline.\nprerequisites of deterrence theory suggest, deterrence works best when threats are clearly communicated and credible.\nIn terms of deterrence by denial, the 2003 National Strategy links mitigating the effects of cyberattacks, building less-vulnerable cyber systems and fostering cybersecurity awareness among all Americans, as a way to limit the feasibility and utility of conducting cyberattacks, making them less attractive as a result. Herein, the Strategy builds off preliminary recommendations President Bush established previously in 2001 in EO 13231 that provided\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nIndeed, Obama's legacy is marked by the rise of cyber offensive measures in US cyber deterrence doctrine.67 Upon taking office in January 2009, Obama ordered a review of US cybersecurity efforts, which largely subsumed an earlier review launched by President Bush in 2008, during his last year of office – the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) as developed by National Security Presidential Directive 54.68 The CNCI, started by Bush and completed by Obama as part of his Cyber Space Policy Review, broadened the scope of cyber security beyond what had been defined in the 2003 Strategy. CNCI established a dozen tasks for the US to accomplish over the coming years, including, at number 10: ‘define and develop enduring deterrence strategies and programs'. Though several sections of Presidential Directive 54 are redacted, what is left includes specific provisions relating to the roles the Department of Defence (DoD) and the US Intelligence Community have in securing, and deterring attacks within, cyberspace. For instance, the FBI was to establish the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, which would coordinate and integrate information from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), the US Secret Service, and other agencies, to augment criminal investigation and prosecution both in the US and overseas. DHS, with an assist from various other departments, was to establish the National Cybersecurity Center, to improve coordination in protecting and defending US Government communication, cyber, and information networks. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was instructed to develop a ‘cyber counterintelligence plan' to augment the 2007 National Counterintelligence Strategy (which mentioned ‘cyber' only a handful of times). The Secretaries of State, Defense, Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the DNI were to develop, jointly, a plan ‘for the coordination and application of offensive capabilities to defend U.S. information systems'. And, most importantly for our purposes, several agencies were called upon to ‘define and develop a comprehensive and coordinating strategy to deter interference and attacks in cyberspace'. Obama reiterated this latter goal in 2009 when he expanded the CNCI's objective. ‘Senior policymakers', the White House warned, ‘must think through the long-range strategic options available to the United States'. Cyber deterrence rested on improving ‘warning capabilities', articulating ‘roles for private sector and international partners', and developing ‘appropriate responses for both state and non-state actors'.\nObama moved quickly to implement and showcase the new US cyber deterrence posture. He began in 2009 by creating and filling a new position, the Executive Branch Cybersecurity Coordinator (aka, the White House cyber czar). Howard Schmidt, a former head of security at Microsoft, was tapped for the role, tasked with harmonising the various strategies and efforts that were being explored and enacted across the US government. Within the same year, the Department of Defense, in partnership with the NSA, established US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM, or Cybercom). Subordinate to US Strategic Command, housed at the NSA, and led by the director of the NSA, Cybercom was to use NSA networks to protect DoD computer and THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES DoD's cyber posture was initially defined in a relatively short 2011 document, DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, which built off the May 2010 National Security Strategy and February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The document provides five strategic initiatives relating to cyberspace, including that DoD will treat cyberspace as an 'operational domain' of warfare, and will 'organize, train, and equip' itself to 'take full advantage of cyberspace's potential'.[73] The core of DoD's new cyber offensive posture is Cybercom's 133 Cyber Mission Force (CMF) teams. Each team is tasked with supporting a specific component of DoD's comprehensive cyber mission. For example, twenty-seven distinct 'Combat Mission' teams provide 'cyberspace effects' in support of military and operational plans.[74] Other 'National Mission' and 'Protection Force' teams defend DoD and public networks and infrastructure by 'seeing adversary activity, blocking attacks, and maneuvering to defeat them'.[75] A subsequent 2011 DoD report provided to Congress, DoD Cyberspace Policy Report, provides much greater detail as to how the Pentagon's evolving cyber posture provides a cyber deterrent effect. The report clearly relates offensive cyber capabilities with deterrence: 'should the\"deny objectives\"element of deterrence not prove adequate, DoD maintains... the ability to respond militarily in cyberspace and in other domains... using cyber and/or kinetic capabilities'.[76] The report also highlights several other cyber deterrent issues and dilemmas the US will continue to face. They included: i) how to develop a US 'declaratory deterrence posture for cyberspace'; ii) the ways in which DoD will address the 'attribution' dilemma inherent to cyber deterrence by building 'cyber forensic capabilities' and 'behavior-based algorithms' for tracing the source of a cyberattack; iii) the dilemma DoD faces in demonstrating cyber capabilities and communicating plans for deterrent purposes without revealing sensitive tools, intelligence or techniques; and iv) how DoD will 'maintain control' of cyber escalation in times of crisis and war.\nThis last dilemma was subsequently tackled in a 2013 DoD Task Force Report, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, produced by the Defense Science Board. The report is perhaps most notable for openly suggesting that DoD cyber deterrence be anchored to offensive capabilities up to and including nuclear retaliation in the event of 'existential cyber attack'. The 2013 report goes on to chastise Obama's 2010 National\n\n# A. S. WILNER Posture Review (NPR) – which provided the President with guidance in nuclear policy – because it did ‘not explicitly mention’ and otherwise remained ‘essentially silent on [the] relationship between the U.S. nuclear deterrent … and the domain of cyber warfare’.77 Navy Admiral Michael Rogers, the chief of Cybercom and director of the NSA, later repurposed the nuclear analogy in his March 2015 testimony before the Senate Committee on Armed Services. ‘I liken our historical moment’, Rogers argued, ‘to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the [t]riad [sic] and underpinned by … policy structures including a declared deterrence posture’. On cyber offense, Rogers continues, the US must ‘commit time, effort, and resources to understanding our historical situation and building cyber military capabilities’.78 A month following Rogers’ testimony, DoD published The DoD Cyber Strategy (2015) its first such strategic document.\nThe 2015 Strategy enshrined Cybercom's expanding offensive purpose. The document, an expansive overview of cyberwarfare and cyber defence, helps guide the development and use of the CMF teams, going quite a distance in illustrating their ability, purpose, and potency. The document also defines deterrence by emphasising punishment, rather than denial, in cyberspace: 'The United States will continue to respond to cyberattacks against U.S. interests at a time, in a manner, and in a place of our choosing, using appropriate instruments of U.S. power'. By October 2016, all of Cybercom's CMF teams reached initial operating capability, translating into a force of roughly 6,000 cyber-warriors. A little over a year later, in January 2018, Cyber Command's headquarters - Joint Force Headquarters Department of Defense Information Network (JFHQ-DODIN) - itself became fully operational.\nSeparately, DoD again tasked the Defense Science Board to sharpen US cyber deterrence options, policy, and strategy, especially in the realm of deterrence by punishment. The DSB Task Force on Cyber Deterrence was established in October 2014; it published its final report in February 2017. Asked to explore the 'requirements for effective deterrence of cyber attacks' against the United States and its allies, and to identify digital and non-digital capabilities 'needed to support deterrence, war-fighting, and escalation control against a highly cyber-capable adversary', the Task Force focused 77DoD Defense Science Board, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, 2013, 41. The 2010 NPR references 'cyber' exactly once; see DoD Nuclear Posture Review, 2010.\n78Admiral Michael Rogers, Statement before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, March 2015.\n79DoD Cyber Strategy, 2015, 10-11.\n80Navy Vice Adm. Nancy Norton took command of the Headquarters in February 2018. US Cyber Command News Release, 'DoD's Network Defense Headquarters Achieves Full Operational Capability', 31 January 2018; Defense Information Systems Agency News, 'Norton Assumes Command of JFHQ-DODIN and Directorship of DISA', 1 February 2018.\nprimarily on deterring high-end cyber threats emanating from major and ‘lesser' powers and sophisticated non-state actors. The DSB makes several important suggestions. First, it introduces the term ‘deterrence by cost imposition' to replace the more commonly used term deterrence by punishment. The rationale, it would seem, is to broaden punishment's scope in keeping with the emerging logic of cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace. ‘Cost imposition' better captures the kinetic, diplomatic, economic, law enforcement, and digital forms of punishment that the US might use in responding to cyberattacks and exploitations. Second, the DSB bridges the divide between denial and punishment in cyberspace. ‘DoD must create a second-strike cyber resilient “Thin Line”' of critical US offensive systems (cyber, nuclear and conventional) and related infrastructure in order to ensure that the US can credibly threaten retaliation in response to a potentially crippling cyber first strike. Good defence and resilience feeds into the potency and certainty of threats of punishment. Third, the DSB affirms, rather bluntly, the continued asymmetry between offense and defence in cyberspace. ‘The unfortunate reality', the 2017 DSB report reads, ‘is that, for at least the coming five to ten years, the offensive cyber capabilities of our most capable potential adversaries are likely to far exceed the United Sates' ability to defend and adequately strengthen the resilience of its critical infrastructures'. US cyber offense, then, is needed to correct the perceptions of asymmetry between defenders and challengers. Finally, the DSB links cyber deterrence to reputation, past and future. It warns that not responding to a cyberattack -- once, presumably, US cyber deterrence has failed -- is, with ‘near-certainty... an invitation to follow-on cyber attacks'. In sum, the DSB Task Force solidifies the primary role offense will have in US cyber deterrence posture and strategy of the emerging decades.\nWith its offensive building blocks in place, the US, first under President Obama and later, under President Trump, began flexing its cyber muscle. It surreptitiously destroyed centrifuges in Iran, sabotaging and delaying the country's nuclear weapons program. It explored using cyberspace to dismantle Libya's air defences leading up to the March 2011 military intervention. The US likewise targeted and sabotaged North Korea's missile development program. Elsewhere, Cybercom was charged with attacking ISIS's online presence and capability in support of US and coalition plans to degrade and defeat the terrorist organisation, and to digitally augment related kinetic operations in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. The US is thought to have also used cyberspace to retaliate against North Korea following its 2014 hack on Sony Pictures. Other forms of punishment were meted out by # A. S. WILNER the Justice Department. New cyber attribution capabilities allowed DOJ, in 2014, 2016, and 2018 to indict over a dozen Chinese military hackers, seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel, and another two private Iranian citizens for stealing US intellectual property, computer hacking, and launching ransomware attacks, and several Russian military intelligence officers for a string of hacks targeting the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and sporting and anti-doping agencies in the US, Canada and Europe. Via EO 13687, President Obama likewise imposed additional sanctions on North Korea in January 2015 in direct response to the Sony Hack.[84] Finally, in his last days in office, President Obama sanctioned and expelled Russian nationals for their role in hacking the 2016 presidential election. Another 13 Russian nationals and three companies were subsequently charged by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of Special Council Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian's meddling in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Russia was again fingered by American and British officials in April 2018 for targeting and exploiting network infrastructure devices, like routers, for purposes of espionage.[85] The coercive message, all told, is that the US has developed the capability to trace and attribute cyberattacks conducted against it and its allies, and to launch punitive measures in cyberspace and across domains in response.\nIn hand with this shift towards cyber punishment, Obama also developed US declaratory posture for cyberspace and helped establish international norms for cyber engagement. From a deterrence perspective, it is not enough to simply have the tools to harm an adversary: you also need to establish and communicate red lines against which acts of retaliation will be measured. Norms that help identify what is and is not acceptable behaviour in cyberspace further solidify retaliatory threats. Obama's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace is the backbone of this process. 'The digital world is no longer a lawless frontier', President Obama's opening statement to the document reads, 'it is a place where the norms of responsible, just, and peaceful conduct among states and people have begun to take hold'.[86] The strategy outlines how the US would provide leadership in establishing global norms for cyber behaviour. The US State Department, for instance, went on to establish the world's first Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues (S/CCI) in February 2011, dedicated to coordinating the Department's diplomatic work on cyber and developing international cyber rules. Some 20 84For an exploration of how and why North Korea's hack manipulated Sony's behaviour, which ultimately triggered the US response, see Travis Sharp, 'Theorizing Cyber Coercion: The 2014 North Korean Operation against Sony', Journal of Strategic Studies 40/7 (2017).\n85UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Joint US-UK Statement on Malicious Cyber Activity Carried out by Russian Government', 16 April 2018; UK National Cyber Security Centre, 'Advisory: Russian Statesponsored Cyber Actors Targeting Network Infrastructure Devices', 16 April 2018.\n86The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace, 2011, 3.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n\nThe Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues was also instrumental in assisting a UN Group of Government Experts (GGE) establish a rudimentary list of cyber norms in 2015 (though the GGE failed in 2017 to subsequently link those norms to recommendations embedded in international law).88 In terms of cyber deterrence, the 2011 Strategy illustrates that the US will continue to bolster denial – redubbed here as ‘dissuasion’ – to deter attacks, but also strongly signals its ‘right to self-defense’ in conducting cyber retaliation. The US, the document reads, ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any threat to our country … and we recognize that certain hostile acts … could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic’.89 In line with these strategic pronouncements, the Obama Administration tried to make a distinction between cyber espionage for the purposes of statecraft – which was deemed legitimate – and cyber espionage, theft, and attack for the purposes of economic or domestic disruption and infrastructure destruction – all deemed illegitimate. Thus, on the one hand, China’s 2015 exfiltration of over 20 million personnel records from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was deemed ‘not an attack’ by James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, but rather good espionage; ‘[we] would have done the same thing’.90 But on the other hand, Russia’s 2015/16 hack, manipulation, and leak of Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee data during the 2016 presidential election was deemed by CIA Director, John Brennan, as a ‘new level of malicious activity’ meant to undermine and influence the institution of US democracy.91 In January 2017,\n\n# A. S. WILNER two weeks before Trump's inauguration, DHS took the unprecedented step of classifying 'election infrastructure' as a critical infrastructure subsector, providing it with priority protection within the NIPP.[92] While the Trump Administration's cyberspace and cyber deterrence strategies are still being patched together, given the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date, and given what we know about Trump's leanings in international affairs, three things are likely to occur under his watch.\nFirst, threats of cyber retaliation and the logic of deterrence by punishment will continue to grow in importance. Pentagon officials have long sought more leeway from congress to engage in cyber offense. In 2017, Admiral Rogers, Cybercom's chief, lamented that 'offensive cyber is almost treated like nuclear weapons, in the sense that their application... is controlled at the chief executive level and not delegated down. What I would like to see, over the next five to 10 years', is that US cyber weapons are viewed 'as another tool for the commanders' at the tactical level.[93] Signaling his acceptance of Rogers' position, President Trump, in August 2017, initiated the elevation of Cybercom to the status of a Unified Combatant Command (a step long-debated, but never taken, under Obama).[94] The transition places Cybercom at par with other unified commands, like US Strategic Command or US European Command, establishing a direct line of communication between Cybercom's director and the Secretary of Defense. And a year later, in August 2018, President Trump rescinded a 2012 Obama-era directive - Presidential Policy Directive 20 - that governed the manner in which cyberattacks were approved.[95] The reversal loosens the (somewhat onerous) restrictions that Obama had placed on conducting offensive cyber operations.\nFurthermore, Trump's February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (the first tabled since 2010), goes to some length in closing the cross-domain gap between nuclear weapons, nuclear retaliation, and cyber deterrence. Just as DoD's aforementioned Defense Science Board report recommended in 2013, the 2018 NPR expands the scope conditions that might lead to a US nuclear response as a result of a cyberattack. While US nuclear retaliation will continue to be reserved for 'extreme circumstances', the 2018 NPR significantly broadens these circumstances themselves to include 'significant non-nuclear strategic attacks', on 'civilian population or infrastructure'.

Gen. Paul Nakasone as Rogers' replacement at the helm of the NSA and Cybercom. The White House, Statement by President Donald J. Trump on the Elevation of Cyber Command, 18 August 2017; Chris Bing, 'White House Official: Paul Nakasone Nominated for NSA Director', CyberScoop, 13 February 2018.\n95Sean Lyngass, 'PPD-20 Elimination opens arguments over how US should Conduct Offensive Hacking Operations', CyberScoop, 16 August 2018.\ncrippling cyberattack. Additionally, perhaps cognizant that technology risks advancing more quickly than strategic policy, the NPR further warns that ‘the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of non-nuclear strategic attack technologies and U.S. capabilities to counter that threat'. Lest anyone misinterpret the document, DoD simultaneously published the NPR's Executive Summary in several languages, including Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Russian.\nThe logic of all of this was rolled into the State Department's ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats', a three-page brief published in May 2018 in direct response to EO 13800, and DoD's new Cyber Strategy, published in September 2018. The ‘Recommendations' report suggests that existing efforts at deterrence in cyberspace are ‘necessary but not sufficient': ‘network defense alone' is not enough. Calling for a ‘fundamental rethinking' of existing frameworks and a ‘new US vision' for cyber deterrence, the report recommends the development of a ‘broader menu of consequences' that the US can impose against state and non-state actors below ‘the threshold of the use of force'. With reference to the perennial issues of attribution and coercive credibility, the document calls for the US to openly demonstrate its ability to identify threats by imposing ‘swift, costly, and transparent consequences' on adversaries. Action will stand for credibility and might have ‘downstream deterrence effects'. Cyber offense is likewise paramount in DoD's 2018 Cyber Strategy. While the strategy itself is not publicity available, a 7-page summary is. And while this new strategy supersedes DoD's 2015 Strategy it compliments DoD's 2018 National Defense Strategy and the 2017 National Security Strategy. The document warns specific adversaries that the US will ‘build a more lethal force', conduct pre-emptive operations, ‘prepare for war', and collect cyber intelligence so as to field the ‘military cyber capabilities' the US needs to ‘defend forward'. A fuzzy term, defending forward implies terminating attacks at their (foreign) source, and ‘leveraging [US] focus outward to stop threats before they reach their targets'. By persistently engaging cyber competitors and aggressors on a daily basis, and by employing the Pentagon's full range of offensive capabilities, the US, the Strategy submits, will deter malicious cyber activities over time.\nSecond, and somewhat relatedly, under Trump, non-state actors may be encouraged to conduct cyber punishment and cyber offense themselves. The idea is to permit victims of cyber aggression and crime -- companies, A. S. WILNER institutions, NGOs, and individuals – to ‘hack back’ or counterattack via ‘active defense’ against their perpetrators. Under the current US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, it is illegal for individuals to gain entry into another’s computer system without permission. Though several US tech firms, including Google and Microsoft, have voiced concerns, Congress has nonetheless explored exceptions as part of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (first proposed in March 2017), and Georgia’s General Assembly passed a bill (later vetoed by the Governor) that would have made provisions for non-state active defence in cyberspace.⁹⁹ Despite the controversy, some companies, including major US banks, have been reported to have surveyed the utility of hack backs to protect their servers, data, and assets.¹⁰⁰ In a telling episode, Bossert, the former White House security advisor, and Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra, the chief cybersecurity official at DHS, heaped rare praise on Facebook and Microsoft during their lengthy December 2017 press-briefing in which the US officially blamed North Korea for conducting the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks. The attacks encrypted data on hundreds of thousands of public and private sector computers in over 150 countries. ‘We applaud our corporate partners’, Bossert asserted, ‘for acting on their own initiative … without any direction by the U.S. government … to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers. They shut down accounts … used to launch attacks and patched systems’.¹⁰¹ The destructive power and frequency of cyber hacking only grew under Obama. This trend will continue under Trump. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and wirelessly tethered Internet of Things (IoT) devices, along with new types of malicious activity like ransomware and sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, both of which can now be bought and sold on the Dark Web, will reshape the cyber threat landscape for individuals, communities, NGOs, and public and private-sector actors.¹⁰² Under the right conditions, non-state hack backs and other disruptive actions – the twenty-first century’s version of digital vigilantism – may prove useful for establishing a whole-of-society – rather than a whole-of-government – US cyber deterrence doctrine.\nFinally, in keeping with Trump’s general weariness of multilateralism and the United Nations in particular, the US is likely to downplay its role in establishing global cyber norms and focus instead on communicating its own red lines and bolstering the cyber deterrent posture of like-mined allied ⁹⁹Zaid Shoorbajee, ‘Google and Microsoft ask Georgia Governor to Veto “Hack Back” Bill’, *CyberScoop*, 27 April 2018; Ryan Johnston, ‘After Widespread outcry, Georgia Governor Vetoes “Hack Back” Bill’, *State Scoop*, 8 May 2018.\n¹⁰⁰Dan Lohrmann, ‘Hack Back Law’, *Government Technology*, September 2017; Nicholas Schmidle, ‘The Digital Vigilantes who Hack Back’, *New Yorker*, 7 May 2018.\n¹⁰¹The White House, ‘Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea’, 19 December 2017.\n¹⁰²Bruce Schneier, ‘Botnets of Things’, *MIT Technology Review*, March/April 2017.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # states. The 2018 'Recommendations' report, for illustration, calls on the US to first establish criteria for US retaliation and to then communicate the policy both 'publicly and privately' so as to generate a deterrent effect. Separately, Trump shuttered the State Department's cyber coordinator's office, effectively degrading America's role in UN negotiations, though the Administration did test the waters for restarting the process of norm building in October 2018, following a ministerial meeting with US allies.[103] What appears more certain, however, is that the US is likely to seek bilateral cyber relations with other states and groups of states. At the Cyber Week 2017 gathering in Israel in June, for instance, the ever-present Bossert announced the US-Israel bilateral cyber working group – which was to be led by White House cyber czar, Rob Joyce, before his departure and the elimination his position – signalling Washington's preference for establishing cyber coalitions of the willing. '[W]e must', Bossert warned, 'hold those who violate [cyber] norms accountable. This may not be achievable through a UN effort. Likeminded states should work to develop options for imposing consequences within a coalition structure'.[104] In a similar vein, the US, in partnership with the UK, Germany and other NATO allies, aims to establish cyber warfare principles for 2019.[105] And, as the White House articulates in its 2018 Cyber Strategy, the US has plans to build a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative' that will convene a coalition of 'like-minded states' that can collectively develop 'tailored strategies' and jointly impose 'consequences against malign actors'.[106] # Conclusion: Evolution in theory US cyber deterrence has come a long way since 2003. Definitions of deterrence – and core concepts linked to punishment and denial – have been revisited, reconceptualised, and broadened in scope. New government positions, institutions, agencies, and organisations have been created, staffed, trained, and tasked with operationalising core concepts. New technology, including software and hardware, has been developed and deployed. Partnerships across the US government, the private sector, and civil society have been established. And allies and international organisations have been leveraged. The footprints of all of these changes are evident in the record: US strategic doctrine allows us to trace the direction of this evolution. From a theoretical perspective, the way in which US cyber deterrence has been adapted since its inception provides 103Sean Lyngaas, 'US Looks to Restart Talks on Global Cyber Norms', CyberScoop, October 2018.\n104The White House, 'Remarks by Homeland Security Advisor Thomas P. Bossert at Cyber Week 2017', 26 June 2017.\n105Robin Emmott, 'NATO mulls\"Offensive Defense\"with Cyber Warfare Rules', Reuters, 30 November 2017.\n\nscholars with insight as to how deterrence theory itself might respond to the promises and paradoxes of cyber deterrence. Several lessons stand out.\nFirst, US cyber deterrence has shifted from an almost exclusive focus on defence and deterrence by denial under President Bush to a punishment-based strategy under Presidents Obama and Trump. Part of the reason threats of retaliation and ‘deterrence by cost imposition' are currently emphasised is that recent technological advancements have allowed the US to improve its ability to monitor cyberattacks, identify perpetrators, and administer retaliatory actions, both within and outside cyberspace. Simply put, punishment strategies are increasingly feasible. Technological advancements have led to the adoption and use of new offensive coercive strategies. If so, theorists themselves should better situate technology into their own work of deterrence. How might the prerequisites of deterrence theory, and the concepts derived from them, adapt to novel, emerging, and disruptive technology within and beyond cyberspace?\nSecond, and relatedly, a separate reason US cyber punishment strategies have come to overshadow denial strategies has to do with the perception that deterrence by denial is not working, or rather, that the threat of denial used alone and separately from the threat of punishment, is not working. The number, severity and complexity of cyberattacks targeting US government and private sector facilities and assets has continued to rise over the past 15 years despite the US government's communicated threat of defence and denial. In response, US doctrine and strategy has evolved such that punishment is being used hand-in-glove with denial. For illustration, synchronising their efforts to defend the 2018 US midterm elections, DoD-DHS collaboration saw the former (via Cyber Command) target Russian operatives overseas to disrupt their actions all the while the latter worked with social media companies to counter disinformation. In practice, the two approaches reinforce each other. Recalibrating the effect punishment and denial have on each other in practice, suggests that theories of deterrence must better relate how the logic of punishment augments, or otherwise corresponds to, the logic of denial. Too often punishment and denial are considered poles apart, distinct levers applied separately to the cost-benefit calculus that underpins rational behaviour and coercion. In theory, how do punishment and denial relate and overlap; in cyberspace when does one stop and the other start?\nThird, the US has come to equate attribution as a distinct form of punishment that appears logically linked to denial. In fielding a question during the 2017 WannaCry press briefing, Bossert suggested, for instance, that ‘it's not about holding a country accountable; it's about simple culpability. We've determined who was behind the [WannaCry] attack, and we're saying it....\nWe're going to hold them accountable... And we're going to shame them for it.... And I think it's going to improve our security'. By identifying North Korea, the US denied it the benefit of anonymity in cyberspace; by publically outing North Korea, the US put the regime on notice for future punishment. From a theoretical perspective, however, attribution is largely understood as a mechanism, a crucial step that allows a defender to retaliate by identifying a challenger, rather than as a functional punishment in its own right. If so, and in light of perceptual changes in practice, deterrence theory must better explore whether, how, and under what conditions public attribution -- and the threat of shaming -- function as a source of cyber deterrence at the different levels of analysis. How might public and private attribution of an attack deter, coerce, or otherwise influence individual, non-state, and state cyber challengers?\nFourth, US cyber deterrence is not chiefly about military coercion. Notwithstanding Cybercom's emerging role in providing the US government with offensive and military options to punish cyber aggressors globally, US cyber deterrence strategy has emphasised the importance of several other departments and agencies, including DOJ, DHS, FBI, State Department and various others, for both denying and punishing cyberattacks. The goal is to equip the US government with as wide a set of coercive levers as possible, crossing domains as needed, to provide a truly whole of government approach to cybersecurity and cyber deterrence. The role of the DOJ (and the FBI by extension) is especially enlightening. By publicly indicting foreign nationals for cyberattacks conducted on American computer systems, the US government underscores the fact that contemporary cyber deterrence transcends traditional defence policy and military doctrine. By establishing the DOJ as a core pillar of its punishment strategy, the US signals its intention to use criminal justice tools to deter not just criminal attacks but attacks conducted by nation state adversaries. In doing so, the US further blurs the line between state institutions and individuals, by sanctioning the latter for actions they perpetrated while working for or on behalf of foreign governments, militaries, or intelligence agencies. For deterrence theory, the burgeoning role non-military and non-kinetic coercion have had in US cyber deterrence posture suggests that academics must redouble their efforts at multidisciplinarity. Academic silos still exist in the manner in which deterrence theory is developed and tested. To some degree, deterrence from within IR theory is privileged over that stemming from criminology, psychology, and terrorism and intelligence studies. This is especially the case when it comes to deterrence in national security and international affairs. Though the fourth wave of deterrence scholarship has gone to some length to bridge the disciplinary divide, more cross-fertilisation is needed among disciplines to better reflect and speak to developments taking place in practice. What theoretical lessons do non-IR approaches to deterrence hold for how IR theories of cyber deterrence are developed and improved?\nFifth, US cyber deterrence is not solely about states, either. Rather, non-state actors figure prominently in American strategic doctrine as both potential perpetrators of cyberattacks targeting US infrastructure, and, more importantly for our purposes, as potential partners that amplify US cyber deterrence. For instance, private sector and individual victims of cyberattack share information, voluntarily, about attacks with law enforcement and intelligence. This provides governments with a better understanding of the nature, prevalence and evolution of certain types of attack, which can lead to improvements in defence and denial. In other cases, as highlighted by Facebook, Microsoft, and Marcus Hutchins -- a private British citizen who noticed a ‘kill switch' within WannaCry's code and took action to temporarily shut the attack down -- non-state actors can track and impede attacks without government oversight, further denying perpetrators the fruits of their labour. In still other cases, non-state actors, including companies, individuals, academics, NGOs, and other such groups, can augment US cyber security and deterrence by denial efforts by practicing better cyber hygiene -- i.e. updating passwords or patching software. This functions to further deny challengers easy opportunities to conduct successful attacks. On this front, Washington is exploring how it might compel (or, even, demand) private sector partners, contractors, and suppliers to do more to defend and secure their own networks, data and assets, as a precondition for working with and on behalf of the US government. In February 2018, for instance, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, in discussing the 2018 National Defense Strategy at a conference, warned that DoD wanted the cyber security ‘bar to be set so high, it will become the condition of doing business' with the Pentagon; for industry, cybersecurity will be ‘foundational to business with DoD'. The point, in this case, is to develop a whole of society deterrence posture, rather than simply a whole of government approach. The logic of all of this goes back to a statement made in President Bush's opening letter to the first 2003 cybersecurity strategy, oft repeated since: ‘Securing cyberspace is an extraordinarily difficult strategic challenge that requires a coordinated and focused effort from our entire society -- the federal government, state and local governments, the private sector, and the American people'. ‘Every American', the strategy continues ‘who can contribute to securing part of cyberspace is encouraged to do so. The federal government invites the creation of, and participation in, public-private partnerships to raise cybersecurity awareness, train personnel, stimulate market forces, improve technology, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, exchange information and plan recovery operations. Of the many ways in which the US government has previously approached deterrence in the other domains of warfare, this general call to arms is unique to cyberspace and cyber deterrence.\nIn response, scholars of deterrence need to explore the nature and feasibility of non-state cyber deterrence. Cyberspace is not a state-centric environment. On the contrary: states and militaries represent a tiny fraction of all the communities, individuals, and non-state actors that constitute cyberspace. Objects, too, have cyber presence. Projections suggest that 50 billion items -- from smart-homes to smart-cars, and from ‘intelligent' construction materials to wireless medical devices -- will be networked online as part of the IoT through an array of embedded electronics, software and sensors. All to say, the vast majority of interactions and the vast majority of the data created online is non-state in nature. Cyber deterrence theory must move beyond its narrow focus on states to account for the diversity of actors and objects that populate cyberspace. What is the equivalent in cyberspace of businesses, community groups, and homeowners employing storefront lighting, neighbourhood watch programs, and anti-burglary systems to deter physical attacks, theft and robbery? Can non-state actors be agents of their own deterrence in cyberspace?\n## Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author."

Wilner Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada # ABSTRACT When compared to advancements in conceptualising deterrence in other domains, cyber deterrence is still in it messy infancy. In some ways cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine, and policy are developed and put to use even before corresponding theories are properly understood. This article analyses how American cyber deterrence has been implemented over the past two decades in order to inform ongoing debates within the academic study of deterrence, and to provide insights from practice for how cyber deterrence theory can be better conceived and refined.\nWhile President Donald Trump upbraided the previous administration's apparent weakness in cyberspace – ‘We’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing’ – his administration has itself struggled to table a coherent cyber deterrence strategy, despite repeated promises to do so quickly.¹ As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to ‘develop the offensive cyber capabilities we need to deter attacks by both state and non-state actors’.² Two weeks following his November 2017 election, President-elect Trump went on to explain further – that he would build ‘a comprehensive plan to protect America’s vital infrastructure against cyberattacks’.³ And months later still, as President, he signed Executive Order (EO) 13800 in May 2017 – an updated draft of a January 2017 EO that had been scraped at the last minute – on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. The EO describes a plan to reassess all elements of US cybersecurity across and beyond the government. In terms of cyber deterrence specifically, EO 13800 calls on various agencies and departments – including the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security, along with the Director of CONTACT Alex S.

S. WILNER National Intelligence – to jointly submit a report ‘on the Nation’s strategic options for deterring adversaries’ in cyberspace. The report was to be submitted within 90 days (August 2017). A public version of the report eventually appeared in May 2018. \nPresident Trump was also slow to appoint or approve several top-level federal cybersecurity and technology positions – including, notably, Federal Chief Information Security Officer, and the head of DHS's cybersecurity and infrastructure protection division. These positions are critical to guiding US cybersecurity policy and planning, including in the area of cyber deterrence. Despite all of this, (former) White House Homeland Security advisor, Thomas Bossert – who helped craft cybersecurity policy under US President George W. Bush – revealed in October 2017, that the Trump Administration was determined to eventually publish a new cybersecurity strategy based on EO 13800. And in his January 2017 Confirmation Hearing, General James Mattis, President Trump's (former) Secretary of Defense, suggested that a comprehensive 'cyber doctrine' might be ready by July 2018. The new National Cyber Strategy was eventually published in September 2018, after an earlier public summary was held back in May 2018. \nAlthough a US cyber deterrence strategy distinct from a broader cyber doctrine has yet to be established or fully leveraged, bits and pieces of the strategy exist, peppered about in different government departments and agencies. Indeed, US cyber deterrence has evolved a great deal since the mid-2000s. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, to better anticipate where US cyber deterrence is heading in practice by exploring the manner in which it has evolved through different presidential administrations. And second, to trace the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date to explore cyber deterrence in theory. When compared to theoretical advancements in conceptualising and implementing deterrence in other domains, including, The White House, Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical infrastructure, 11 May 2017.\nUS Department of State, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats’, 31 May 2018.\nJoseph Marks, ‘Many Top Cybersecurity Posts Remain Empty – and Not on Purpose’, DefenseOne, 10 November 2017; Mohana Ravindranath, ‘Many CFO Act federal Agencies are Still being Lead by Acting Chief Information Officers’, Nextgov, 17 November 2017.\nIn a moment of further intrigue, Bossert resigned his post in April 2018, on the request of John Bolton, Trump’s newly-appointed national security advisor. Bossert’s departure was followed a week later by Rob Joyce’s, the White House cybersecurity coordinator. President Trump later eliminated Joyce’s position altogether, in May 2018.

By the standards of deterrence theory, which has a robust and cumulative pedigree dating back over a century, cyber deterrence is an innovative but imperfectly understood idea. The bulk of the academic literature on cyber deterrence was produced only very recently, over the past fifteen years or so. Moreover, in some important ways, US cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine and policy have been developed, unveiled and put to use even before corresponding theories from academia are properly understood, tested and refined.\nIf practice precedes theory, then a reflection of how this practice progressed over time may help inform theory more broadly. Combined, these circumstances leave scholars with a unique opportunity to evaluate an example of cyber deterrence practice in order to explain and better describe cyber deterrence theory. In methodological terms, this article explores how American cyber deterrence has been implemented in order to better highlight theory more broadly. The United States, by dint of its size, pre-eminence in cyberspace and decades of experience operationalising deterrence theory in other domains, represents a crucial case. Moreover, in empirical terms, the US government openly discusses cybersecurity, and has made various iterations of its cyber deterrence strategy and doctrine publicly available. While a comprehensive US cyber deterrence strategy has yet to be tabled, fragments of the strategy can be patched together, piecemeal, from various US government bodies. A record of thought and practice exists; wading through it provides insights for theory.\nThe article begins with a summary of the academic literature on deterrence theory dating back to the beginning of the Cold War. The rationale here is to outline the nuts and bolts of deterrence theory, highlight conceptual prerequisites, illustrate the many ways deterrence has been operationalised, and briefly assess the ‘four waves' of deterrence scholarship. Next, the article takes a broad look at cyber deterrence theory in particular. The purpose is to discuss the core debates and research clusters embedded within this particular sub-field of the literature. Doing so will provide a theoretical foundation against which the empirical work can be paired against. An exploration of US cyber deterrence then follows. This section will provide a detailed and linear reflection of US cyber deterrence strategy, doctrine and policy stretching back to the early 2000s. The analysis will piece together how US strategy has unfolded and evolved over time, and help identify specific concepts, trends and assumptions baked into strategic # A. S. WILNER discourse. Highlights from the US example will then be analysed in the conclusion of the article. The way the United States has put cyber deterrence into practice over time provides lessons and insights for how cyber deterrence theory might be better conceived, approached and refined.\n\n---\n\n## # A. S. WILNER two weeks before Trump's inauguration, DHS took the unprecedented step of classifying 'election infrastructure' as a critical infrastructure subsector, providing it with priority protection within the NIPP.[92] While the Trump Administration's cyberspace and cyber deterrence strategies are still being patched together, given the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date, and given what we know about Trump's leanings in international affairs, three things are likely to occur under his watch.\n\nFirst, threats of cyber retaliation and the logic of deterrence by punishment will continue to grow in importance. Pentagon officials have long sought more leeway from congress to engage in cyber offense. In 2017, Admiral Rogers, Cybercom's chief, lamented that 'offensive cyber is almost treated like nuclear weapons, in the sense that their application... is controlled at the chief executive level and not delegated down. What I would like to see, over the next five to 10 years', is that US cyber weapons are viewed 'as another tool for the commanders' at the tactical level.[93] Signaling his acceptance of Rogers' position, President Trump, in August 2017, initiated the elevation of Cybercom to the status of a Unified Combatant Command (a step long-debated, but never taken, under Obama).[94] The transition places Cybercom at par with other unified commands, like US Strategic Command or US European Command, establishing a direct line of communication between Cybercom's director and the Secretary of Defense. And a year later, in August 2018, President Trump rescinded a 2012 Obama-era directive - Presidential Policy Directive 20 - that governed the manner in which cyberattacks were approved.[95] The reversal loosens the (somewhat onerous) restrictions that Obama had placed on conducting offensive cyber operations.\nFurthermore, Trump's February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (the first tabled since 2010), goes to some length in closing the cross-domain gap between nuclear weapons, nuclear retaliation, and cyber deterrence. Just as DoD's aforementioned Defense Science Board report recommended in 2013, the 2018 NPR expands the scope conditions that might lead to a US nuclear response as a result of a cyberattack. While US nuclear retaliation will continue to be reserved for 'extreme circumstances', the 2018 NPR significantly broadens these circumstances themselves to include 'significant non-nuclear strategic attacks', on 'civilian population or infrastructure'. Read: 92Department of Homeland Security, 'Statement by Secretary Jeh Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector', 6 January 2017.\n93Cheryl Pellerin, 'Rogers Discusses near Future of U.S. Cyber Command', DoD News, 24 February 2017.\n94Separately, in February 2018, the White House signaled its intention to nominate Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone as Rogers' replacement at the helm of the NSA and Cybercom. The White House, Statement by President Donald J. Trump on the Elevation of Cyber Command, 18 August 2017; Chris Bing, 'White House Official: Paul Nakasone Nominated for NSA Director', CyberScoop, 13 February 2018.\n95Sean Lyngass, 'PPD-20 Elimination opens arguments over how US should Conduct Offensive Hacking Operations', CyberScoop, 16 August 2018.\ncrippling cyberattack. Additionally, perhaps cognizant that technology risks advancing more quickly than strategic policy, the NPR further warns that ‘the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of non-nuclear strategic attack technologies and U.S. capabilities to counter that threat'. Lest anyone misinterpret the document, DoD simultaneously published the NPR's Executive Summary in several languages, including Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Russian.\nThe logic of all of this was rolled into the State Department's ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats', a three-page brief published in May 2018 in direct response to EO 13800, and DoD's new Cyber Strategy, published in September 2018. The ‘Recommendations' report suggests that existing efforts at deterrence in cyberspace are ‘necessary but not sufficient': ‘network defense alone' is not enough. Calling for a ‘fundamental rethinking' of existing frameworks and a ‘new US vision' for cyber deterrence, the report recommends the development of a ‘broader menu of consequences' that the US can impose against state and non-state actors below ‘the threshold of the use of force'. With reference to the perennial issues of attribution and coercive credibility, the document calls for the US to openly demonstrate its ability to identify threats by imposing ‘swift, costly, and transparent consequences' on adversaries. Action will stand for credibility and might have ‘downstream deterrence effects'. Cyber offense is likewise paramount in DoD's 2018 Cyber Strategy. While the strategy itself is not publicity available, a 7-page summary is. And while this new strategy supersedes DoD's 2015 Strategy it compliments DoD's 2018 National Defense Strategy and the 2017 National Security Strategy. The document warns specific adversaries that the US will ‘build a more lethal force', conduct pre-emptive operations, ‘prepare for war', and collect cyber intelligence so as to field the ‘military cyber capabilities' the US needs to ‘defend forward'. A fuzzy term, defending forward implies terminating attacks at their (foreign) source, and ‘leveraging [US] focus outward to stop threats before they reach their targets'. By persistently engaging cyber competitors and aggressors on a daily basis, and by employing the Pentagon's full range of offensive capabilities, the US, the Strategy submits, will deter malicious cyber activities over time.\nSecond, and somewhat relatedly, under Trump, non-state actors may be encouraged to conduct cyber punishment and cyber offense themselves. The idea is to permit victims of cyber aggression and crime -- companies, A. S. WILNER institutions, NGOs, and individuals – to ‘hack back’ or counterattack via ‘active defense’ against their perpetrators. Under the current US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, it is illegal for individuals to gain entry into another’s computer system without permission. Though several US tech firms, including Google and Microsoft, have voiced concerns, Congress has nonetheless explored exceptions as part of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (first proposed in March 2017), and Georgia’s General Assembly passed a bill (later vetoed by the Governor) that would have made provisions for non-state active defence in cyberspace.⁹⁹ Despite the controversy, some companies, including major US banks, have been reported to have surveyed the utility of hack backs to protect their servers, data, and assets.¹⁰⁰ In a telling episode, Bossert, the former White House security advisor, and Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra, the chief cybersecurity official at DHS, heaped rare praise on Facebook and Microsoft during their lengthy December 2017 press-briefing in which the US officially blamed North Korea for conducting the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks. The attacks encrypted data on hundreds of thousands of public and private sector computers in over 150 countries. ‘We applaud our corporate partners’, Bossert asserted, ‘for acting on their own initiative … without any direction by the U.S. government … to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers. They shut down accounts … used to launch attacks and patched systems’.¹⁰¹ The destructive power and frequency of cyber hacking only grew under Obama. This trend will continue under Trump. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and wirelessly tethered Internet of Things (IoT) devices, along with new types of malicious activity like ransomware and sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, both of which can now be bought and sold on the Dark Web, will reshape the cyber threat landscape for individuals, communities, NGOs, and public and private-sector actors.¹⁰² Under the right conditions, non-state hack backs and other disruptive actions – the twenty-first century’s version of digital vigilantism – may prove useful for establishing a whole-of-society – rather than a whole-of-government – US cyber deterrence doctrine.\nFinally, in keeping with Trump’s general weariness of multilateralism and the United Nations in particular, the US is likely to downplay its role in establishing global cyber norms and focus instead on communicating its own red lines and bolstering the cyber deterrent posture of like-mined allied ⁹⁹Zaid Shoorbajee, ‘Google and Microsoft ask Georgia Governor to Veto “Hack Back” Bill’, *CyberScoop*, 27 April 2018; Ryan Johnston, ‘After Widespread outcry, Georgia Governor Vetoes “Hack Back” Bill’, *State Scoop*, 8 May 2018.\n¹⁰⁰Dan Lohrmann, ‘Hack Back Law’, *Government Technology*, September 2017; Nicholas Schmidle, ‘The Digital Vigilantes who Hack Back’, *New Yorker*, 7 May 2018.\n¹⁰¹The White House, ‘Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea’, 19 December 2017.\n¹⁰²Bruce Schneier, ‘Botnets of Things’, *MIT Technology Review*, March/April 2017.\nTHE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES # states. The 2018 'Recommendations' report, for illustration, calls on the US to first establish criteria for US retaliation and to then communicate the policy both 'publicly and privately' so as to generate a deterrent effect. Separately, Trump shuttered the State Department's cyber coordinator's office, effectively degrading America's role in UN negotiations, though the Administration did test the waters for restarting the process of norm building in October 2018, following a ministerial meeting with US allies.[103] What appears more certain, however, is that the US is likely to seek bilateral cyber relations with other states and groups of states. At the Cyber Week 2017 gathering in Israel in June, for instance, the ever-present Bossert announced the US-Israel bilateral cyber working group – which was to be led by White House cyber czar, Rob Joyce, before his departure and the elimination his position – signalling Washington's preference for establishing cyber coalitions of the willing. '[W]e must', Bossert warned, 'hold those who violate [cyber] norms accountable. This may not be achievable through a UN effort. Likeminded states should work to develop options for imposing consequences within a coalition structure'.[104] In a similar vein, the US, in partnership with the UK, Germany and other NATO allies, aims to establish cyber warfare principles for 2019.[105] And, as the White House articulates in its 2018 Cyber Strategy, the US has plans to build a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative' that will convene a coalition of 'like-minded states' that can collectively develop 'tailored strategies' and jointly impose 'consequences against malign actors'.[106] # Conclusion: Evolution in theory US cyber deterrence has come a long way since 2003. Definitions of deterrence – and core concepts linked to punishment and denial – have been revisited, reconceptualised, and broadened in scope. New government positions, institutions, agencies, and organisations have been created, staffed, trained, and tasked with operationalising core concepts. New technology, including software and hardware, has been developed and deployed. Partnerships across the US government, the private sector, and civil society have been established. And allies and international organisations have been leveraged. The footprints of all of these changes are evident in the record: US strategic doctrine allows us to trace the direction of this evolution. From a theoretical perspective, the way in which US cyber deterrence has been adapted since its inception provides 103Sean Lyngaas, 'US Looks to Restart Talks on Global Cyber Norms', CyberScoop, October 2018.\n104The White House, 'Remarks by Homeland Security Advisor Thomas P. Bossert at Cyber Week 2017', 26 June 2017.\n105Robin Emmott, 'NATO mulls\"Offensive Defense\"with Cyber Warfare Rules', Reuters, 30 November 2017.\nscholars with insight as to how deterrence theory itself might respond to the promises and paradoxes of cyber deterrence. Several lessons stand out.\nFirst, US cyber deterrence has shifted from an almost exclusive focus on defence and deterrence by denial under President Bush to a punishment-based strategy under Presidents Obama and Trump. Part of the reason threats of retaliation and ‘deterrence by cost imposition' are currently emphasised is that recent technological advancements have allowed the US to improve its ability to monitor cyberattacks, identify perpetrators, and administer retaliatory actions, both within and outside cyberspace. Simply put, punishment strategies are increasingly feasible. Technological advancements have led to the adoption and use of new offensive coercive strategies. If so, theorists themselves should better situate technology into their own work of deterrence. How might the prerequisites of deterrence theory, and the concepts derived from them, adapt to novel, emerging, and disruptive technology within and beyond cyberspace?\nSecond, and relatedly, a separate reason US cyber punishment strategies have come to overshadow denial strategies has to do with the perception that deterrence by denial is not working, or rather, that the threat of denial used alone and separately from the threat of punishment, is not working. The number, severity and complexity of cyberattacks targeting US government and private sector facilities and assets has continued to rise over the past 15 years despite the US government's communicated threat of defence and denial. In response, US doctrine and strategy has evolved such that punishment is being used hand-in-glove with denial. For illustration, synchronising their efforts to defend the 2018 US midterm elections, DoD-DHS collaboration saw the former (via Cyber Command) target Russian operatives overseas to disrupt their actions all the while the latter worked with social media companies to counter disinformation. In practice, the two approaches reinforce each other. Recalibrating the effect punishment and denial have on each other in practice, suggests that theories of deterrence must better relate how the logic of punishment augments, or otherwise corresponds to, the logic of denial. Too often punishment and denial are considered poles apart, distinct levers applied separately to the cost-benefit calculus that underpins rational behaviour and coercion. In theory, how do punishment and denial relate and overlap; in cyberspace when does one stop and the other start?\nThird, the US has come to equate attribution as a distinct form of punishment that appears logically linked to denial. In fielding a question during the 2017 WannaCry press briefing, Bossert suggested, for instance, that ‘it's not about holding a country accountable; it's about simple culpability. We've determined who was behind the [WannaCry] attack, and we're saying it....\nWe're going to hold them accountable... And we're going to shame them for it.... And I think it's going to improve our security'. By identifying North Korea, the US denied it the benefit of anonymity in cyberspace; by publically outing North Korea, the US put the regime on notice for future punishment. From a theoretical perspective, however, attribution is largely understood as a mechanism, a crucial step that allows a defender to retaliate by identifying a challenger, rather than as a functional punishment in its own right. If so, and in light of perceptual changes in practice, deterrence theory must better explore whether, how, and under what conditions public attribution -- and the threat of shaming -- function as a source of cyber deterrence at the different levels of analysis. How might public and private attribution of an attack deter, coerce, or otherwise influence individual, non-state, and state cyber challengers?\nFourth, US cyber deterrence is not chiefly about military coercion. Notwithstanding Cybercom's emerging role in providing the US government with offensive and military options to punish cyber aggressors globally, US cyber deterrence strategy has emphasised the importance of several other departments and agencies, including DOJ, DHS, FBI, State Department and various others, for both denying and punishing cyberattacks. The goal is to equip the US government with as wide a set of coercive levers as possible, crossing domains as needed, to provide a truly whole of government approach to cybersecurity and cyber deterrence. The role of the DOJ (and the FBI by extension) is especially enlightening. By publicly indicting foreign nationals for cyberattacks conducted on American computer systems, the US government underscores the fact that contemporary cyber deterrence transcends traditional defence policy and military doctrine. By establishing the DOJ as a core pillar of its punishment strategy, the US signals its intention to use criminal justice tools to deter not just criminal attacks but attacks conducted by nation state adversaries. In doing so, the US further blurs the line between state institutions and individuals, by sanctioning the latter for actions they perpetrated while working for or on behalf of foreign governments, militaries, or intelligence agencies. For deterrence theory, the burgeoning role non-military and non-kinetic coercion have had in US cyber deterrence posture suggests that academics must redouble their efforts at multidisciplinarity. Academic silos still exist in the manner in which deterrence theory is developed and tested. To some degree, deterrence from within IR theory is privileged over that stemming from criminology, psychology, and terrorism and intelligence studies. This is especially the case when it comes to deterrence in national security and international affairs. Though the fourth wave of deterrence scholarship has gone to some length to bridge the disciplinary divide, more cross-fertilisation is needed among disciplines to better reflect and speak to developments taking place in practice. What theoretical lessons do non-IR approaches to deterrence hold for how IR theories of cyber deterrence are developed and improved?\nFifth, US cyber deterrence is not solely about states, either. Rather, non-state actors figure prominently in American strategic doctrine as both potential perpetrators of cyberattacks targeting US infrastructure, and, more importantly for our purposes, as potential partners that amplify US cyber deterrence. For instance, private sector and individual victims of cyberattack share information, voluntarily, about attacks with law enforcement and intelligence. This provides governments with a better understanding of the nature, prevalence and evolution of certain types of attack, which can lead to improvements in defence and denial. In other cases, as highlighted by Facebook, Microsoft, and Marcus Hutchins -- a private British citizen who noticed a ‘kill switch' within WannaCry's code and took action to temporarily shut the attack down -- non-state actors can track and impede attacks without government oversight, further denying perpetrators the fruits of their labour. In still other cases, non-state actors, including companies, individuals, academics, NGOs, and other such groups, can augment US cyber security and deterrence by denial efforts by practicing better cyber hygiene -- i.e. updating passwords or patching software. This functions to further deny challengers easy opportunities to conduct successful attacks. On this front, Washington is exploring how it might compel (or, even, demand) private sector partners, contractors, and suppliers to do more to defend and secure their own networks, data and assets, as a precondition for working with and on behalf of the US government. In February 2018, for instance, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, in discussing the 2018 National Defense Strategy at a conference, warned that DoD wanted the cyber security ‘bar to be set so high, it will become the condition of doing business' with the Pentagon; for industry, cybersecurity will be ‘foundational to business with DoD'. The point, in this case, is to develop a whole of society deterrence posture, rather than simply a whole of government approach. The logic of all of this goes back to a statement made in President Bush's opening letter to the first 2003 cybersecurity strategy, oft repeated since: ‘Securing cyberspace is an extraordinarily difficult strategic challenge that requires a coordinated and focused effort from our entire society -- the federal government, state and local governments, the private sector, and the American people'. ‘Every American', the strategy continues ‘who can contribute to securing part of cyberspace is encouraged to do so. The federal government invites the creation of, and participation in, public-private partnerships to raise cybersecurity awareness, train personnel, stimulate market forces, improve technology, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, exchange information and plan recovery operations. Of the many ways in which the US government has previously approached deterrence in the other domains of warfare, this general call to arms is unique to cyberspace and cyber deterrence.\nIn response, scholars of deterrence need to explore the nature and feasibility of non-state cyber deterrence. Cyberspace is not a state-centric environment. On the contrary: states and militaries represent a tiny fraction of all the communities, individuals, and non-state actors that constitute cyberspace. Objects, too, have cyber presence. Projections suggest that 50 billion items -- from smart-homes to smart-cars, and from ‘intelligent' construction materials to wireless medical devices -- will be networked online as part of the IoT through an array of embedded electronics, software and sensors. All to say, the vast majority of interactions and the vast majority of the data created online is non-state in nature. Cyber deterrence theory must move beyond its narrow focus on states to account for the diversity of actors and objects that populate cyberspace. What is the equivalent in cyberspace of businesses, community groups, and homeowners employing storefront lighting, neighbourhood watch programs, and anti-burglary systems to deter physical attacks, theft and robbery? Can non-state actors be agents of their own deterrence in cyberspace?\n## Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.",

It has repeatedly proven its flexibility in responding to, and evolving from, shifting international and interstate dynamics. Deterrence, at its theoretical core, entails using threats to manipulate an adversary's behaviour.[11] More concretely, it rests on convincing another actor to forgo an unwanted action. Compellence – a related concept – flips the process around, prompting an adversary to pursue an action it might otherwise have avoided. Compellence encourages behaviour, whereas deterrence restrains it. Both are subsumed within the logic of coercion. In all cases of deterrence and compellence, a minimum of two actors are involved. Defenders issue threats to alter an opponent's behaviour; challengers consider these threats, weigh their options, and decide whether or not to acquiesce. In some cases, a third actor is involved. With extended deterrence, for instance, a proxy, partner, or ally is also included in the process, either on the side of the defender or the challenger. Threats of punishment – usually in the form of retaliation – and promises of denial – usually in the form of depriving an adversary the expected benefits of a particular behaviour – form the basis for most deterrent and compellent engagements, though normative and ideological considerations that inform behaviour have also been recently developed within the context of delegitimisation. Each of these three coercive processes is linked to the logic of deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial, and deterrence by delegitimisation, respectively.[12] Deterrence works by informing a challenger's cost-benefit calculus. Importantly, it does so by weighing upon another's strategic choice.[13] Militarily crushing an adversary, as Thomas Schelling reminds us, such that it has no alternative but to accept demands made of it is not deterrence, but rather defeat.[14] The same can be said in the realm of denial. Developing a perfect, foolproof defence, while rare, does not deter by denial but rather deters by defeat; an adversary does not penetrate a target or conduct a certain attack because it is prevented from doing so, not because it decides [11] Moving beyond theory and strategy, Amir Lupovici contends that deterrence is also an idea, internalized within the identity of those who rely on it.

    "for instance, in conventional and nuclear warfare, in space, and in counterterrorism, cyber deterrence theory is still in its messy infancy. By the standards of deterrence theory, which has a robust and cumulative pedigree dating back over a century, cyber deterrence is an innovative but imperfectly understood idea. The bulk of the academic literature on cyber deterrence was produced only very recently, over the past fifteen years or so. Moreover, in some important ways, US cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine and policy have been developed, unveiled and put to use even before corresponding theories from academia are properly understood, tested and refined.\n\nIf practice precedes theory, then a reflection of how this practice progressed over time may help inform theory more broadly. Combined, these circumstances leave scholars with a unique opportunity to evaluate an example of cyber deterrence practice in order to explain and better describe cyber deterrence theory. In methodological terms, this article explores how American cyber deterrence has been implemented in order to better highlight theory more broadly. The United States, by dint of its size, pre-eminence in cyberspace and decades of experience operationalising deterrence theory in other domains, represents a crucial case. Moreover, in empirical terms, the US government openly discusses cybersecurity, and has made various iterations of its cyber deterrence strategy and doctrine publicly available. While a comprehensive US cyber deterrence strategy has yet to be tabled, fragments of the strategy can be patched together, piecemeal, from various US government bodies. A record of thought and practice exists; wading through it provides insights for theory.\n\nThe article begins with a summary of the academic literature on deterrence theory dating back to the beginning of the Cold War. The rationale here is to outline the nuts and bolts of deterrence theory, highlight conceptual prerequisites, illustrate the many ways deterrence has been operationalised, and briefly assess the ‘four waves' of deterrence scholarship. Next, the article takes a broad look at cyber deterrence theory in particular. The purpose is to discuss the core debates and research clusters embedded within this particular sub-field of the literature. Doing so will provide a theoretical foundation against which the empirical work can be paired against. An exploration of US cyber deterrence then follows. This section will provide a detailed and linear reflection of US cyber deterrence strategy, doctrine and policy stretching back to the early 2000s. The analysis will piece together how US strategy has unfolded and evolved over time, and help identify specific concepts, trends and assumptions baked into strategic",

The way the United States has put cyber deterrence into practice over time provides lessons and insights for how cyber deterrence theory might be better conceived, approached and refined.\n\n# Deterrence in theory: Concepts and debates\n\nDeterrence is an enduring concept. It has repeatedly proven its flexibility in responding to, and evolving from, shifting international and interstate dynamics. Deterrence, at its theoretical core, entails using threats to manipulate an adversary's behaviour.[11] More concretely, it rests on convincing another actor to forgo an unwanted action. Compellence – a related concept – flips the process around, prompting an adversary to pursue an action it might otherwise have avoided. Compellence encourages behaviour, whereas deterrence restrains it. Both are subsumed within the logic of coercion. In all cases of deterrence and compellence, a minimum of two actors are involved. Defenders issue threats to alter an opponent's behaviour; challengers consider these threats, weigh their options, and decide whether or not to acquiesce. In some cases, a third actor is involved. With extended deterrence, for instance, a proxy, partner, or ally is also included in the process, either on the side of the defender or the challenger. Threats of punishment – usually in the form of retaliation – and promises of denial – usually in the form of depriving an adversary the expected benefits of a particular behaviour – form the basis for most deterrent and compellent engagements, though normative and ideological considerations that inform behaviour have also been recently developed within the context of delegitimisation. Each of these three coercive processes is linked to the logic of deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial, and deterrence by delegitimisation, respectively.[12]\n\nDeterrence works by informing a challenger's cost-benefit calculus. Importantly, it does so by weighing upon another's strategic choice.[13] Militarily crushing an adversary, as Thomas Schelling reminds us, such that it has no alternative but to accept demands made of it is not deterrence, but rather defeat.[14] The same can be said in the realm of denial.

Lupvici, *The Power of Deterrence* (Cambridge 2016).\n[12] On the latter, see for instance, Jerry Mark Long and Alex Wilner, 'Delegitimizing al-Qaida: Defeating an \"Army Whose Men Love Death\"', *International Security* 39/1 (2014).\n[13] Lawrence Freedman, *Deterrence* (Cambridge: Polity Press 2004), 26.\n[14] Thomas Schelling, *Arms and Influence* (1966), 1–34.",
    "THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n249\n\nagainst doing so.¹⁵ In deterrence, changes in behaviour are an option, not a necessity. Finally, though studies of deterrence in international affairs are naturally anchored to International Relations theory, deterrence is not reserved for states alone. It functions just as well among non-state actors, including between individuals, groups, and other organisations. Indeed, criminological deterrence has an especially rich literature on deterring violence and crime within communities, well below the level of the state.¹⁶ And the field of psychology, too, has provided deterrence scholars with avenues for exploring the cognitive side of deterrence across disciplines.¹⁷\n\nPut into practice, deterrence theory rests on a number of pre-requisites. First, actors must exhibit a degree of rationality, such that some combination of threats will suffice to alter behaviour. Second, overlapping preferences short of open conflict must be shared by all parties; deterrence requires that adversaries accept the feasibility of non-violence. Third, threats, expected changes in behaviour and a willingness to punish violations must be communicated. Defenders must likewise reassure challengers that threats will not be carried out in the event demands are met. Fourth, defenders must have the perceived capability, and the resolve to punish or deny as threatened. Finally, deterrence works best again a known or suspected adversary; anonymity robs deterrence of its potency.\n\nBuilding off these prerequisites and core conceptual tenets, deterrence theory has evolved in new and exciting ways over the past several decades. This process of theoretical rejuvenation and praxis has been the result of both changing geostrategic realities (from bipolarity to unipolarity and back, for instance), and because of the emergence of new technology (from nuclear weapons to artificial intelligence) and security domains (including air, space and cyberspace). For illustration of this evolution, consider these various concepts. Central deterrence – which functions to protect a defender's assets – stands against extended (or triadic) deterrence – which functions to protect a third party's assets. Broad deterrence – which deters aggression writ large – stands against narrow deterrence – which deters a specific, and often limited, behaviour. Similarly, general deterrence seeks to\n\n¹⁵ Alex Wilner, ‘Contemporary Deterrence Theory Counterterrorism: A Bridge too Far?’ NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 47/2 (2015).\n\n¹⁶ The literature is expansive.

    "regulate and uphold accepted, status quo relations, whereas immediate deterrence functions within periods of crisis and against expected anti-status quo behaviour. Intra-war deterrence shapes certain behaviour within an ongoing hot war, after other forms of deterrence have already failed; the goal here is to influence an adversary's warfighting behaviour itself. Cumulative or serial deterrence is iterative; it functions by adding up the effects of repeated coercive interactions. Moving beyond threats, inducements, deflection, dissuasion, entanglement and influence have each been added to deterrence theory, too, broadening the manner in which defenders secure their interests and shape adversarial behaviour.\n\nWithin IR, deterrence scholarship has evolved within the context of ‘four waves', borrowing insights from other disciplines, namely criminology, terrorism studies, and psychology. The first wave emerged around the end of the Second World War, and corresponded to the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology within a US-dominated strategic backdrop. The second wave began in the early days of the Cold War. US-Soviet dynamics and alliance structures shaped the wave's research agenda, as did the limited proliferation of nuclear weapons to US allies, like France and the UK, and rivals, like China. The second wave used game theory and scientific modelling to explore how rivals could manage nuclear escalation and alliances. Focus was placed on strategic and conventional deterrence by punishment -- and to a much lesser degree on conventional deterrence by denial in Europe and Asia -- and on major power conflict pitting mutually rational and unitary state actors. The third wave began in the 1970s. Its focus was on empiricism, on qualitatively and quantitatively testing the concepts, frameworks and theories previously proposed. Findings suggested the importance of commitment, communication, and resolve in using both central and extended deterrence, and illustrated the variance embedded within the concept of expected utility. The psychology of coercion (e.g. human cognition and thought, bias, fatigue, decision-making, misperception, and error), along with notions of strategic culture, bureaucracy and leadership also emerged.\n\nThe fourth wave followed the end of the Cold War and continues today. A traditional focus on bipolarity, strategic weapons, and great power rivalries gave way to a diffusion of interests, both between and below state actors. In terms of scholarship, the fourth wave is both especially dynamic, and slightly chaotic: everything and everyone under the sun is in focus. Included here is work on deterring rogue states -- traditionally weak states and militaries often in possession of limited nuclear or chemical and biological weapons, like Iraq, Iran,",

The 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace defines it as a 'nervous system' or 'control system' for US critical infrastructure, comprised of 'hundreds of thousands of interconnected computers, servers, routers, switches, and fiber optic cables'. The 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations later defined cyberspace as a 'domain', characterized by 'the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures'. And in a 2008 memo, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England defined cyberspace as 'a global domain', consisting of 'the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers'. While definitions of cyberspace continue to evolve, for the purposes of this paper, cyberspace is understood as a global, interconnected domain constituting hardware, digital data, and related infrastructrue in which electronic devices are used to create, save and disseminate information. The phrase 'cyber deterrence' also lacks a precise definition. At its broadest, cyber deterrence is a field of study - as deterring terrorism might be thought of - that involves applying and exploring the logic, theory, and practice of deterrence within cyberspace. More narrowly, cyber deterrence might be understood as the deterrence of attacks within or using cyberspace, or conversely, the use of cyberspace to accomplish deterrence in other domains. This paper relies on the broader definition but highlights the narrow use of the term where necessary.",

By these standards some scholars conclude that the architecture of cyberspace – anonymity, complexity, interconnectivity, jurisdictional diffusion, open access – makes cyber deterrence inherently weak.[24] The fundamental prerequisites are not easily met. Herein, the attribution dilemma receives greatest attention.[25] The ease of digital obfuscation,[26] complexity of 'multi-stage' cyberattacks,[27] difficulty in signalling or communicating threats and deterrent capabilities,[28] and challenge of uncovering the physical source of a cyberattack,[29] can complicate how defenders construct and communicate credible coercive threats. If cyber adversaries believe that their identities are protected, retaliatory threats will fall short. A range of tentative solutions have been proposed. More sophisticated attribution capabilities, processes, and standards might be developed.[30] Or, the Internet could be reengineered as an attributed network.[31] Or, sources of a cyberattack might be better deduced weighing known capabilities, interests, and motivation of likely adversaries.[32] Or, third party enablers of cyberattacks (i.e., owners of cyber infrastructure, and other private sector actors) might be held better accountable.[33] Or, the threshold of 'certain identification' when contemplating retaliation can be lowered.[34] Still other authors illustrate how cyber attribution is not, in fact, as potent a\n\n24The Economist (Benjamin Sutherland, ed.)

Weak states and non-state adversaries with fewer cyber platforms, conversely, have less to fear from cyberwar and much to gain by escalating a confrontation to digital space, where they may have advantages over traditionally stronger powers. That asymmetry may destabilise cyber deterrence.³⁷ Skirting this particular paradox may involve combining cyber threats with more traditional kinetic and non-kinetic threats, effectively adding military punishment, law enforcement, diplomatic and financial sanctions, and public shaming to the cyber mix. This cross-domain deterrent approach addresses cyber credibility by tackling on traditional forms of retaliation to the equation.³⁸ Robert Mandel suggests further that defenders use ‘unorthodox’ means to enhance the potency of their deterrence in cyberspace, including, for instance, ‘subtle political and diplomatic pressure on cyberattackers or their supporters, sponsor or patrons’, like public exposure, reputational embarrassment, shaming, condemnation, embassy closures, expulsion and other forms of humiliation.³⁹ Some authors caution, though, that skipping between the digital and physical (or kinetic) realms risks escalating a conflict in unanticipated ways.⁴⁰ Other experts counter that some cyberattacks, like those that disrupt financial or political systems by degrading software or targeting data rather than hardware, are unlikely to escalate to the kinetic domain at all.⁴¹ Still others argue that cyber and\n\n³⁵ Glaser, ‘Deterrence’; Will Goodman, ‘Cyber Deterrence’, Strategic Studies Quarterly, 2010; Lindsay, ‘Tipping’; Ben Buchanan, The Cybersecurity Dilemma (Oxford 2016), 145; Joseph Nye, ‘Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace’, International Security 41/3 (2017), 51–52.\n³⁶ Richard Harknett, et. al. ‘Leaving Deterrence Behind’, Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management 7/1 (2010); Adam Liff, ‘Cyberwar: A New “Absolute Weapon?”’ Journal of Strategic Studies 35/3 (2012).\n³⁷ Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Paul Rosenzweig, ‘The Organization of the United States Government and Private Sector for Achieving Cyber Deterrence’, Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks (Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2010); Mike McConnell, ‘Cyberwar is the New Atomic Age’, New Perspectives Quarterly 26/3 (2009); James Adams, ‘Virtual Defense’, Foreign Affairs 80/3 (2001); Martin Libicki, Conquest in Cyberspace (Cambridge 2007), Chapter 11; Libicki, Cyberdeterrence (2009), Chapter Three; Libicki, ‘Cyberwar as a Confidence Game’, Strategic Studies Quarterly (Spring 2011); Martin Libicki, Cyberspace in Peace and War (Naval Institute Press 2016), Chapter 16 &amp; 17; Harknett, ‘Information Warfare’.\n³⁸ James Lewis, ‘Cross-Domain Deterrence and Credible Threats’, CSIS Working Paper (July 2010); Jon Lindsay and Erik Gartzke (eds.), Cross-Domain Deterrence (under review 2018); Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff, ‘Cyberwar’; Herbert Lin, ‘Laying an Intellectual Foundation for Cyberdeterrence’, in Kruger et al., (eds.), The Secure Information Society (Springer-Verlag 2013).\n³⁹ Mandel, Optimizing, 199–201.\n⁴⁰ Lewis ‘Cross-Domain’; Anthony Cordesman and Justin Cordesman, Cyberthreats, Information Warfare, and Critical Infrastructure Protection (Praeger 2002), Chapter One; Kugler, ‘Deterrence’; Lupovici, ‘Cyber Warfare’; Sterner ‘Retaliatory’; Liff ‘Cyberwar’; Lin ‘Laying’.\n⁴¹ Harknett et al., ‘Leaving’; Rid ‘Cyber War’; Thomas Rid, ‘More Attacks, Less Violence’, Journal of Strategic Studies 36/1 (2013).",

Nor can defenders expect forewarning of an imminent cyberattack, eliminating their ability to mount an immediate deterrent response. On the contrary: cyberattacks often go unnoticed, for months, even years. Other forms of cyberattack that rely on the logic of strategic surprise, Jim Writz warns, may compel a weaker adversary to present a traditionally strong defender, like the United States, with a 'fait accompli', such that the defender then faces the prospects of a costly response in returning to the status quo.[45] And traditional factors that mitigate offensive power in other domains of warfare – like the geographic distance between adversaries or resilient offensive weapons, including second strike capabilities – are much less evident in cyberwarfare, favouring intruders over defenders.[46] Relatedly, the sheer number of potential cyber adversaries complicates coercive calculations, creating a potential asymmetry in intent, capability, and resolve that favors aggressors.[47] Indeed, cyberspace augments the destructive power of weaker actors, including small, sub-state and non-sate networks.[48] Some authors conclude that cyber deterrence is a 'mirage', and that a warfighting framework is the only way to address 'cyberaggression'.[49] Still, other scholars caution against alarmism, noting that\n\n42Amir Lupovici, 'The \"Attribution Problem\" and the Social construction of \"Violence\"', International Studies Perspectives 17/3 (2016); Goodman, 'Cyber Deterrence'; Ronald Deibert and Rafal Rohozinkis, 'Risking Security', International Political Sociology 4 (2010); Joseph Nye, 'Cyber Power', Belfer Center, Harvard Kennedy School Working Paper, 2011.\n43Jon Lindsay, 'Stuxnet and the Limits of Cyber Wafare', Security Studies 22/3 (2013).\n44John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, 'Cyberwar is Coming!'

Frustrating the preparation phase of a cyberattack may be especially valuable.[53] Associated concepts like cyber resilience or resistance, in which compromised digital systems continue to function, or adapt and heal themselves, may further augment cyber denial.[54] However, some scholars retort that adversaries incur very low costs when their cyberattacks fail, especially when attribution is uncertain, and are able to continue trying, even unsuccessfully, without incurring further costs, suggesting that denial, decoupled from attribution and punishment, may provide few coercive benefits.[55] A fourth and final subset of the literature explores whether norms, regimes, and stigmatisation might delegitimise certain cyberattacks and shape individual and collective behaviour accordingly.[56] For example, Joseph Nye, borrowing logic developed for intra-war deterrence during the Cold War that deterred the use of certain weapons,\n\n50 P.W.

    "like chemical and nuclear weapons, suggests that with cyberspace, a similar ‘taboo' might be constructed against certain types of cyberattack during peacetime, like those targeting civilian infrastructure and private sector facilities.\n\nIn sum, although a growing body of new literature explores the nuance and complexity of applying deterrence theory to cyber conflict, there is yet a great deal of division among scholars. Multiple poles within the research community exist. And much of the field is a conceptual extension of the literature on cyber warfare. Conflating warfare and deterrence makes a certain amount of sense given that deterrence is often a consequence of projecting military power. Yet this development has skewed the nascent literature on cyber deterrence in particular ways. First, IR deterrence is favoured, to the exclusion of the literature derived from criminology, psychology or other domains that have informed previous deterrence debates. Second, deterrence by punishment is overemphasised, such that denial, dissuasion, influence, delegitimisation and other concepts are often overlooked. Third, state actors figure prominently, to the near exclusion of the role non- and sub-state actors might have in deterring attacks in cyberspace. The coercive leverage of non-state cyber actors is rarely considered. Fourth, deterring high-end cyber threats dominates the research agenda. Deterring the far more common attributes of cyber insecurity, like cyber-crime, identity and property theft, data breaches and exfiltration, hacking (DDOS, malware, spear/phishing, whaling, ransomware), digital espionage, sabotage, bullying, and other concerns, goes largely unexplored. Fifth, policy prescription seems to dominate, while theoretical, methodological and empirical developments lag behind. Properly situating cyber deterrence within the larger IR literature, or within strategic studies, or political science, is wanting. Finally, few empirical evaluations of cyber deterrence have taken place, with the exceptions largely focusing on digital coercion among states actively involved in armed conflict.\n\nWhat follows is an exploration of how US cyber deterrence in practice has evolved over the past decades; lessons therein will help inform our theoretical understanding of how deterrence theory and cyberspace interact.",
    "THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n257\n\n# US cyber deterrence strategy: Evolution in practice\n\nAmerican cybersecurity strategy dates back to 2003, with the publication under President George W. Bush of the first standalone strategic document on cybersecurity – The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.⁶⁰ [Figure 1 provides a timeline of relevant US cyber deterrence and cyber security doctrine.] At its core, the strategy is guided by three objectives: preventing cyberattacks against critical infrastructure; reducing vulnerability to cyberattacks; and mitigating damage from cyberattacks. The document further defines the distinct roles and responsibilities held by different cyber actors – from individual-level users of cyberspace, to institutions, businesses, and innovators, and the critical infrastructure sectors. ‘Protecting the widely distributed assets of cyberspace’, the strategy reads, ‘requires the efforts of many Americans. The federal government alone cannot sufficiently defend America’s cyberspace’.⁶¹ It also describes the national and international issues and concerns that require US Government leadership, including, for instance, building a national response system that identifies threats, promotes information exchange, advises on remediation, diminishes cyber vulnerabilities, and establishes international initiatives and multilateral endeavours with other states and non-state partners to collaboratively bolster cybersecurity at the global level.\n\nIn terms of deterrence specifically, the strategy weds various aspects of denial and punishment together, though the latter is mostly focused on domestic criminal prosecution. For illustration, at the local-level, touting roles for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the 2003 strategy lays bare the utility of using detection, apprehension, and prosecution of cyber-criminals (at home and, if possible, abroad) as a way to punish violations of domestic and international law. Here, some aspects of cyber aggression are treated to the logic of criminological deterrence (e.g., swift, certain and severe punishment). Bush’s 2003 National Strategy does not, however, overtly address cyber punishment or retaliation among states or at the international level. Only the oblique suggestion that the US response ‘need not be limited to criminal prosecution’, and that the US ‘reserves the right to respond in an appropriate manner’, hint at any larger retaliatory global strategy.⁶² While these pronouncements may have been obligatory, for the purposes of coercion they are also inherently weak. As the\n\n⁶⁰The 2003 document was, however, preceded by several antecedent publications that outlined how the US envisioned cybersecurity, including, a Clinton-era Presidential Commission report (1997) and a 2000 National Plan on information security.

Herein, the Strategy builds off preliminary recommendations President Bush established previously in 2001 in EO 13231 that provided",
    "THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n259\n\nthe impetus for better coordinating public and private sector critical infrastructure protection 'in the information age'.63 President Bush subsequently further refined the 2003 Strategy with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (2003), which called upon DHS, which had only just been established following the terrorist attacks of September 2001, to develop the concepts, frameworks, and processes for protecting American critical infrastructure and key resources.64 DHS published the first National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) in 2006.65 [Subsequent NIPPs were published in 2009 and 2013, while related Quadrennial Homeland Security Reviews were published in 2010, 2014, and 2018.] The NIPP's core builds off the three-part approach outlined in the 2003 National Strategy – prevent attacks; reduce vulnerability; mitigate damage – but it also attempts to provide a much more robust definition of deterrence: 'Cause the potential attacker to perceive that the risk of failure is greater than that which they find acceptable'. Reducing a 'target's value', 'preventing and delaying' an attack, minimising and 'mitigating' an attack's effect, and recovering from attack, are added to this definition.66 Of importance, the logic baked into the NIPP's definition of deterrence is wholly based on deterrence by denial. This makes a certain amount of sense, given DHS's mandate, but it also reflects a larger trend in the way the United States approached cybersecurity in the early days: defence (and denial) trumped offense (and punishment). The balance between denial and punishment would start to shift only under President Barack Obama.\n\nIndeed, Obama's legacy is marked by the rise of cyber offensive measures in US cyber deterrence doctrine.67 Upon taking office in January 2009, Obama ordered a review of US cybersecurity efforts, which largely subsumed an earlier review launched by President Bush in 2008, during his last year of office – the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) as developed by National Security Presidential Directive 54.68 The CNCI, started by Bush and completed by Obama as part of his Cyber Space Policy Review, broadened the scope of cyber security beyond what had been defined in the 2003 Strategy.

Though several sections of Presidential Directive 54 are redacted, what is left includes specific provisions relating to the roles the Department of Defence (DoD) and the US Intelligence Community have in securing, and deterring attacks within, cyberspace. For instance, the FBI was to establish the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, which would coordinate and integrate information from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), the US Secret Service, and other agencies, to augment criminal investigation and prosecution both in the US and overseas. DHS, with an assist from various other departments, was to establish the National Cybersecurity Center, to improve coordination in protecting and defending US Government communication, cyber, and information networks. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was instructed to develop a ‘cyber counterintelligence plan' to augment the 2007 National Counterintelligence Strategy (which mentioned ‘cyber' only a handful of times). The Secretaries of State, Defense, Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the DNI were to develop, jointly, a plan ‘for the coordination and application of offensive capabilities to defend U.S. information systems'. And, most importantly for our purposes, several agencies were called upon to ‘define and develop a comprehensive and coordinating strategy to deter interference and attacks in cyberspace'. Obama reiterated this latter goal in 2009 when he expanded the CNCI's objective. ‘Senior policymakers', the White House warned, ‘must think through the long-range strategic options available to the United States'. Cyber deterrence rested on improving ‘warning capabilities', articulating ‘roles for private sector and international partners', and developing ‘appropriate responses for both state and non-state actors'.\n\nObama moved quickly to implement and showcase the new US cyber deterrence posture. He began in 2009 by creating and filling a new position, the Executive Branch Cybersecurity Coordinator (aka, the White House cyber czar). Howard Schmidt, a former head of security at Microsoft, was tapped for the role, tasked with harmonising the various strategies and efforts that were being explored and enacted across the US government. Within the same year, the Department of Defense, in partnership with the NSA, established US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM, or Cybercom). Subordinate to US Strategic Command, housed at the NSA, and led by the director of the NSA, Cybercom was to use NSA networks to protect DoD computer and",

Importantly, Cybercom was also eventually tasked with developing offensive cyber capabilities for deterrent purposes.\n\nDoD's cyber posture was initially defined in a relatively short 2011 document, DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, which built off the May 2010 National Security Strategy and February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The document provides five strategic initiatives relating to cyberspace, including that DoD will treat cyberspace as an 'operational domain' of warfare, and will 'organize, train, and equip' itself to 'take full advantage of cyberspace's potential'.[73] The core of DoD's new cyber offensive posture is Cybercom's 133 Cyber Mission Force (CMF) teams. Each team is tasked with supporting a specific component of DoD's comprehensive cyber mission. For example, twenty-seven distinct 'Combat Mission' teams provide 'cyberspace effects' in support of military and operational plans.[74] Other 'National Mission' and 'Protection Force' teams defend DoD and public networks and infrastructure by 'seeing adversary activity, blocking attacks, and maneuvering to defeat them'.[75] A subsequent 2011 DoD report provided to Congress, DoD Cyberspace Policy Report, provides much greater detail as to how the Pentagon's evolving cyber posture provides a cyber deterrent effect. The report clearly relates offensive cyber capabilities with deterrence: 'should the \"deny objectives\" element of deterrence not prove adequate, DoD maintains ... the ability to respond militarily in cyberspace and in other domains ... using cyber and/or kinetic capabilities'.[76] The report also highlights several other cyber deterrent issues and dilemmas the US will continue to face. They included: i) how to develop a US 'declaratory deterrence posture for cyberspace'; ii) the ways in which DoD will address the 'attribution' dilemma inherent to cyber deterrence by building 'cyber forensic capabilities' and 'behavior-based algorithms' for tracing the source of a cyberattack; iii) the dilemma DoD faces in demonstrating cyber capabilities and communicating plans for deterrent purposes without revealing sensitive tools, intelligence or techniques; and iv) how DoD will 'maintain control' of cyber escalation in times of crisis and war.\n\nThis last dilemma was subsequently tackled in a 2013 DoD Task Force Report, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, produced by the Defense Science Board. The report is perhaps most notable for openly suggesting that DoD cyber deterrence be anchored to offensive capabilities up to and including nuclear retaliation in the event of 'existential cyber attack'. The 2013 report goes on to chastise Obama's 2010 National\n\n73 US Department of Defense, Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace, 2011, 5–6.\n74 In October 2016, in Obama’s last months in office, Cybercom finally reached its full operating capability, translating into a force of roughly 6,000 cyber-warriors.

We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the [t]riad [sic] and underpinned by … policy structures including a declared deterrence posture’. On cyber offense, Rogers continues, the US must ‘commit time, effort, and resources to understanding our historical situation and building cyber military capabilities’.78 A month following Rogers’ testimony, DoD published The DoD Cyber Strategy (2015) its first such strategic document.\n\nThe 2015 Strategy enshrined Cybercom's expanding offensive purpose. The document, an expansive overview of cyberwarfare and cyber defence, helps guide the development and use of the CMF teams, going quite a distance in illustrating their ability, purpose, and potency. The document also defines deterrence by emphasising punishment, rather than denial, in cyberspace: 'The United States will continue to respond to cyberattacks against U.S. interests at a time, in a manner, and in a place of our choosing, using appropriate instruments of U.S. power'. By October 2016, all of Cybercom's CMF teams reached initial operating capability, translating into a force of roughly 6,000 cyber-warriors. A little over a year later, in January 2018, Cyber Command's headquarters - Joint Force Headquarters Department of Defense Information Network (JFHQ-DODIN) - itself became fully operational.\n\nSeparately, DoD again tasked the Defense Science Board to sharpen US cyber deterrence options, policy, and strategy, especially in the realm of deterrence by punishment. The DSB Task Force on Cyber Deterrence was established in October 2014; it published its final report in February 2017. Asked to explore the 'requirements for effective deterrence of cyber attacks' against the United States and its allies, and to identify digital and non-digital capabilities 'needed to support deterrence, war-fighting, and escalation control against a highly cyber-capable adversary', the Task Force focused\n\n77DoD Defense Science Board, Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, 2013, 41.

    "primarily on deterring high-end cyber threats emanating from major and ‘lesser' powers and sophisticated non-state actors. The DSB makes several important suggestions. First, it introduces the term ‘deterrence by cost imposition' to replace the more commonly used term deterrence by punishment. The rationale, it would seem, is to broaden punishment's scope in keeping with the emerging logic of cross-domain deterrence for cyberspace. ‘Cost imposition' better captures the kinetic, diplomatic, economic, law enforcement, and digital forms of punishment that the US might use in responding to cyberattacks and exploitations. Second, the DSB bridges the divide between denial and punishment in cyberspace. ‘DoD must create a second-strike cyber resilient “Thin Line”' of critical US offensive systems (cyber, nuclear and conventional) and related infrastructure in order to ensure that the US can credibly threaten retaliation in response to a potentially crippling cyber first strike. Good defence and resilience feeds into the potency and certainty of threats of punishment. Third, the DSB affirms, rather bluntly, the continued asymmetry between offense and defence in cyberspace. ‘The unfortunate reality', the 2017 DSB report reads, ‘is that, for at least the coming five to ten years, the offensive cyber capabilities of our most capable potential adversaries are likely to far exceed the United Sates' ability to defend and adequately strengthen the resilience of its critical infrastructures'. US cyber offense, then, is needed to correct the perceptions of asymmetry between defenders and challengers. Finally, the DSB links cyber deterrence to reputation, past and future. It warns that not responding to a cyberattack -- once, presumably, US cyber deterrence has failed -- is, with ‘near-certainty ... an invitation to follow-on cyber attacks'. In sum, the DSB Task Force solidifies the primary role offense will have in US cyber deterrence posture and strategy of the emerging decades.\n\nWith its offensive building blocks in place, the US, first under President Obama and later, under President Trump, began flexing its cyber muscle. It surreptitiously destroyed centrifuges in Iran, sabotaging and delaying the country's nuclear weapons program. It explored using cyberspace to dismantle Libya's air defences leading up to the March 2011 military intervention. The US likewise targeted and sabotaged North Korea's missile development program. Elsewhere, Cybercom was charged with attacking ISIS's online presence and capability in support of US and coalition plans to degrade and defeat the terrorist organisation, and to digitally augment related kinetic operations in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. The US is thought to have also used cyberspace to retaliate against North Korea following its 2014 hack on Sony Pictures. Other forms of punishment were meted out by",

New cyber attribution capabilities allowed DOJ, in 2014, 2016, and 2018 to indict over a dozen Chinese military hackers, seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel, and another two private Iranian citizens for stealing US intellectual property, computer hacking, and launching ransomware attacks, and several Russian military intelligence officers for a string of hacks targeting the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and sporting and anti-doping agencies in the US, Canada and Europe. Via EO 13687, President Obama likewise imposed additional sanctions on North Korea in January 2015 in direct response to the Sony Hack.[84] Finally, in his last days in office, President Obama sanctioned and expelled Russian nationals for their role in hacking the 2016 presidential election. Another 13 Russian nationals and three companies were subsequently charged by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of Special Council Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian's meddling in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Russia was again fingered by American and British officials in April 2018 for targeting and exploiting network infrastructure devices, like routers, for purposes of espionage.[85] The coercive message, all told, is that the US has developed the capability to trace and attribute cyberattacks conducted against it and its allies, and to launch punitive measures in cyberspace and across domains in response.\n\nIn hand with this shift towards cyber punishment, Obama also developed US declaratory posture for cyberspace and helped establish international norms for cyber engagement. From a deterrence perspective, it is not enough to simply have the tools to harm an adversary: you also need to establish and communicate red lines against which acts of retaliation will be measured. Norms that help identify what is and is not acceptable behaviour in cyberspace further solidify retaliatory threats. Obama's 2011 International Strategy for Cyberspace is the backbone of this process. 'The digital world is no longer a lawless frontier', President Obama's opening statement to the document reads, 'it is a place where the norms of responsible, just, and peaceful conduct among states and people have begun to take hold'.[86] The strategy outlines how the US would provide leadership in establishing global norms for cyber behaviour. The US State Department, for instance, went on to establish the world's first Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues (S/CCI) in February 2011, dedicated to coordinating the Department's diplomatic work on cyber and developing international cyber rules.

    "THE JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES\n265\n\nother states later inaugurated their own, similar, offices. S/CCI’s greatest success was the 2015 US-China agreement on economic cyber espionage – a bilateral arrangement that China subsequently agreed to sign with the UK, Canada, Australia, the G-7, and G-20 – that codified that neither party would conduct ‘cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property’.87 The hope is that these bilateral and multilateral initiatives will curtail particular forms of behaviour in cyberspace that will eventually inform and help establish more comprehensive norms of engagement.\n\nThe Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues was also instrumental in assisting a UN Group of Government Experts (GGE) establish a rudimentary list of cyber norms in 2015 (though the GGE failed in 2017 to subsequently link those norms to recommendations embedded in international law).88 In terms of cyber deterrence, the 2011 Strategy illustrates that the US will continue to bolster denial – redubbed here as ‘dissuasion’ – to deter attacks, but also strongly signals its ‘right to self-defense’ in conducting cyber retaliation. The US, the document reads, ‘will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any threat to our country … and we recognize that certain hostile acts … could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the right to use all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic’.89 In line with these strategic pronouncements, the Obama Administration tried to make a distinction between cyber espionage for the purposes of statecraft – which was deemed legitimate – and cyber espionage, theft, and attack for the purposes of economic or domestic disruption and infrastructure destruction – all deemed illegitimate. Thus, on the one hand, China’s 2015 exfiltration of over 20 million personnel records from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was deemed ‘not an attack’ by James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, but rather good espionage; ‘[we] would have done the same thing’.90 But on the other hand, Russia’s 2015/16 hack, manipulation, and leak of Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee data during the 2016 presidential election was deemed by CIA Director, John Brennan, as a ‘new level of malicious activity’ meant to undermine and influence the institution of US democracy.91 In January 2017,\n\n87 Adam Segal, ‘The Top Five Cyber Policy Developments of 2015’, Council on Foreign Relations blog, 4 January 2016.\n\n88 UN General Assembly, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, Seventieth Session, Item 93, 2015.\n\n89 The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World, May 2011, 13–14.\n\n90 The 2017 DSB report does however argue, rather cryptically, that ‘some would view’ the OPM heist as an example of ‘egregious behavior’ that crossed the ‘unwritten rules of traditional espionage’, DSB 2017, 7, 11–12.

    "#\n\nA. S. WILNER\n\ntwo weeks before Trump's inauguration, DHS took the unprecedented step of classifying 'election infrastructure' as a critical infrastructure subsector, providing it with priority protection within the NIPP.[92]\n\nWhile the Trump Administration's cyberspace and cyber deterrence strategies are still being patched together, given the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date, and given what we know about Trump's leanings in international affairs, three things are likely to occur under his watch.\n\nFirst, threats of cyber retaliation and the logic of deterrence by punishment will continue to grow in importance. Pentagon officials have long sought more leeway from congress to engage in cyber offense. In 2017, Admiral Rogers, Cybercom's chief, lamented that 'offensive cyber is almost treated like nuclear weapons, in the sense that their application ... is controlled at the chief executive level and not delegated down. What I would like to see, over the next five to 10 years', is that US cyber weapons are viewed 'as another tool for the commanders' at the tactical level.[93] Signaling his acceptance of Rogers' position, President Trump, in August 2017, initiated the elevation of Cybercom to the status of a Unified Combatant Command (a step long-debated, but never taken, under Obama).[94] The transition places Cybercom at par with other unified commands, like US Strategic Command or US European Command, establishing a direct line of communication between Cybercom's director and the Secretary of Defense. And a year later, in August 2018, President Trump rescinded a 2012 Obama-era directive - Presidential Policy Directive 20 - that governed the manner in which cyberattacks were approved.[95] The reversal loosens the (somewhat onerous) restrictions that Obama had placed on conducting offensive cyber operations.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's February 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (the first tabled since 2010), goes to some length in closing the cross-domain gap between nuclear weapons, nuclear retaliation, and cyber deterrence. Just as DoD's aforementioned Defense Science Board report recommended in 2013, the 2018 NPR expands the scope conditions that might lead to a US nuclear response as a result of a cyberattack. While US nuclear retaliation will continue to be reserved for 'extreme circumstances', the 2018 NPR significantly broadens these circumstances themselves to include 'significant non-nuclear strategic attacks', on 'civilian population or infrastructure'.

    "crippling cyberattack. Additionally, perhaps cognizant that technology risks advancing more quickly than strategic policy, the NPR further warns that ‘the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of non-nuclear strategic attack technologies and U.S. capabilities to counter that threat'. Lest anyone misinterpret the document, DoD simultaneously published the NPR's Executive Summary in several languages, including Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Russian.\n\nThe logic of all of this was rolled into the State Department's ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats', a three-page brief published in May 2018 in direct response to EO 13800, and DoD's new Cyber Strategy, published in September 2018. The ‘Recommendations' report suggests that existing efforts at deterrence in cyberspace are ‘necessary but not sufficient': ‘network defense alone' is not enough. Calling for a ‘fundamental rethinking' of existing frameworks and a ‘new US vision' for cyber deterrence, the report recommends the development of a ‘broader menu of consequences' that the US can impose against state and non-state actors below ‘the threshold of the use of force'. With reference to the perennial issues of attribution and coercive credibility, the document calls for the US to openly demonstrate its ability to identify threats by imposing ‘swift, costly, and transparent consequences' on adversaries. Action will stand for credibility and might have ‘downstream deterrence effects'. Cyber offense is likewise paramount in DoD's 2018 Cyber Strategy. While the strategy itself is not publicity available, a 7-page summary is. And while this new strategy supersedes DoD's 2015 Strategy it compliments DoD's 2018 National Defense Strategy and the 2017 National Security Strategy. The document warns specific adversaries that the US will ‘build a more lethal force', conduct pre-emptive operations, ‘prepare for war', and collect cyber intelligence so as to field the ‘military cyber capabilities' the US needs to ‘defend forward'. A fuzzy term, defending forward implies terminating attacks at their (foreign) source, and ‘leveraging [US] focus outward to stop threats before they reach their targets'. By persistently engaging cyber competitors and aggressors on a daily basis, and by employing the Pentagon's full range of offensive capabilities, the US, the Strategy submits, will deter malicious cyber activities over time.\n\nSecond, and somewhat relatedly, under Trump, non-state actors may be encouraged to conduct cyber punishment and cyber offense themselves.

Under the current US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, it is illegal for individuals to gain entry into another’s computer system without permission. Though several US tech firms, including Google and Microsoft, have voiced concerns, Congress has nonetheless explored exceptions as part of the Active Cyber Defense Certainty Act (first proposed in March 2017), and Georgia’s General Assembly passed a bill (later vetoed by the Governor) that would have made provisions for non-state active defence in cyberspace.⁹⁹ Despite the controversy, some companies, including major US banks, have been reported to have surveyed the utility of hack backs to protect their servers, data, and assets.¹⁰⁰ In a telling episode, Bossert, the former White House security advisor, and Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra, the chief cybersecurity official at DHS, heaped rare praise on Facebook and Microsoft during their lengthy December 2017 press-briefing in which the US officially blamed North Korea for conducting the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks. The attacks encrypted data on hundreds of thousands of public and private sector computers in over 150 countries. ‘We applaud our corporate partners’, Bossert asserted, ‘for acting on their own initiative … without any direction by the U.S. government … to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers. They shut down accounts … used to launch attacks and patched systems’.¹⁰¹ The destructive power and frequency of cyber hacking only grew under Obama. This trend will continue under Trump. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and wirelessly tethered Internet of Things (IoT) devices, along with new types of malicious activity like ransomware and sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, both of which can now be bought and sold on the Dark Web, will reshape the cyber threat landscape for individuals, communities, NGOs, and public and private-sector actors.¹⁰² Under the right conditions, non-state hack backs and other disruptive actions – the twenty-first century’s version of digital vigilantism – may prove useful for establishing a whole-of-society – rather than a whole-of-government – US cyber deterrence doctrine.\n\nFinally, in keeping with Trump’s general weariness of multilateralism and the United Nations in particular, the US is likely to downplay its role in establishing global cyber norms and focus instead on communicating its own red lines and bolstering the cyber deterrent posture of like-mined allied\n\n⁹⁹Zaid Shoorbajee, ‘Google and Microsoft ask Georgia Governor to Veto “Hack Back” Bill’, *CyberScoop*, 27 April 2018; Ryan Johnston, ‘After Widespread outcry, Georgia Governor Vetoes “Hack Back” Bill’, *State Scoop*, 8 May 2018.\n¹⁰⁰Dan Lohrmann, ‘Hack Back Law’, *Government Technology*, September 2017; Nicholas Schmidle, ‘The Digital Vigilantes who Hack Back’, *New Yorker*, 7 May 2018.\n¹⁰¹The White House, ‘Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea’, 19 December 2017.\n¹⁰²Bruce Schneier, ‘Botnets of Things’, *MIT Technology Review*, March/April 2017.",

The 2018 'Recommendations' report, for illustration, calls on the US to first establish criteria for US retaliation and to then communicate the policy both 'publicly and privately' so as to generate a deterrent effect. Separately, Trump shuttered the State Department's cyber coordinator's office, effectively degrading America's role in UN negotiations, though the Administration did test the waters for restarting the process of norm building in October 2018, following a ministerial meeting with US allies.[103] What appears more certain, however, is that the US is likely to seek bilateral cyber relations with other states and groups of states. At the Cyber Week 2017 gathering in Israel in June, for instance, the ever-present Bossert announced the US-Israel bilateral cyber working group – which was to be led by White House cyber czar, Rob Joyce, before his departure and the elimination his position – signalling Washington's preference for establishing cyber coalitions of the willing. '[W]e must', Bossert warned, 'hold those who violate [cyber] norms accountable. This may not be achievable through a UN effort. Likeminded states should work to develop options for imposing consequences within a coalition structure'.[104] In a similar vein, the US, in partnership with the UK, Germany and other NATO allies, aims to establish cyber warfare principles for 2019.[105] And, as the White House articulates in its 2018 Cyber Strategy, the US has plans to build a 'Cyber Deterrence Initiative' that will convene a coalition of 'like-minded states' that can collectively develop 'tailored strategies' and jointly impose 'consequences against malign actors'.[106]\n\n# Conclusion: Evolution in theory\n\nUS cyber deterrence has come a long way since 2003. Definitions of deterrence – and core concepts linked to punishment and denial – have been revisited, reconceptualised, and broadened in scope. New government positions, institutions, agencies, and organisations have been created, staffed, trained, and tasked with operationalising core concepts. New technology, including software and hardware, has been developed and deployed. Partnerships across the US government, the private sector, and civil society have been established. And allies and international organisations have been leveraged. The footprints of all of these changes are evident in the record: US strategic doctrine allows us to trace the direction of this evolution. From a theoretical perspective, the way in which US cyber deterrence has been adapted since its inception provides\n\n103Sean Lyngaas, 'US Looks to Restart Talks on Global Cyber Norms', CyberScoop, October 2018.\n\n104The White House, 'Remarks by Homeland Security Advisor Thomas P.

    "scholars with insight as to how deterrence theory itself might respond to the promises and paradoxes of cyber deterrence. Several lessons stand out.\n\nFirst, US cyber deterrence has shifted from an almost exclusive focus on defence and deterrence by denial under President Bush to a punishment-based strategy under Presidents Obama and Trump. Part of the reason threats of retaliation and ‘deterrence by cost imposition' are currently emphasised is that recent technological advancements have allowed the US to improve its ability to monitor cyberattacks, identify perpetrators, and administer retaliatory actions, both within and outside cyberspace. Simply put, punishment strategies are increasingly feasible. Technological advancements have led to the adoption and use of new offensive coercive strategies. If so, theorists themselves should better situate technology into their own work of deterrence. How might the prerequisites of deterrence theory, and the concepts derived from them, adapt to novel, emerging, and disruptive technology within and beyond cyberspace?\n\nSecond, and relatedly, a separate reason US cyber punishment strategies have come to overshadow denial strategies has to do with the perception that deterrence by denial is not working, or rather, that the threat of denial used alone and separately from the threat of punishment, is not working. The number, severity and complexity of cyberattacks targeting US government and private sector facilities and assets has continued to rise over the past 15 years despite the US government's communicated threat of defence and denial. In response, US doctrine and strategy has evolved such that punishment is being used hand-in-glove with denial. For illustration, synchronising their efforts to defend the 2018 US midterm elections, DoD-DHS collaboration saw the former (via Cyber Command) target Russian operatives overseas to disrupt their actions all the while the latter worked with social media companies to counter disinformation. In practice, the two approaches reinforce each other. Recalibrating the effect punishment and denial have on each other in practice, suggests that theories of deterrence must better relate how the logic of punishment augments, or otherwise corresponds to, the logic of denial. Too often punishment and denial are considered poles apart, distinct levers applied separately to the cost-benefit calculus that underpins rational behaviour and coercion. In theory, how do punishment and denial relate and overlap; in cyberspace when does one stop and the other start?\n\nThird, the US has come to equate attribution as a distinct form of punishment that appears logically linked to denial. In fielding a question during the 2017 WannaCry press briefing, Bossert suggested, for instance, that ‘it's not about holding a country accountable; it's about simple culpability. We've determined who was behind the [WannaCry] attack, and we're saying it. ...",
    "We're going to hold them accountable ... And we're going to shame them for it. ... And I think it's going to improve our security'. By identifying North Korea, the US denied it the benefit of anonymity in cyberspace; by publically outing North Korea, the US put the regime on notice for future punishment. From a theoretical perspective, however, attribution is largely understood as a mechanism, a crucial step that allows a defender to retaliate by identifying a challenger, rather than as a functional punishment in its own right. If so, and in light of perceptual changes in practice, deterrence theory must better explore whether, how, and under what conditions public attribution -- and the threat of shaming -- function as a source of cyber deterrence at the different levels of analysis. How might public and private attribution of an attack deter, coerce, or otherwise influence individual, non-state, and state cyber challengers?\n\nFourth, US cyber deterrence is not chiefly about military coercion. Notwithstanding Cybercom's emerging role in providing the US government with offensive and military options to punish cyber aggressors globally, US cyber deterrence strategy has emphasised the importance of several other departments and agencies, including DOJ, DHS, FBI, State Department and various others, for both denying and punishing cyberattacks. The goal is to equip the US government with as wide a set of coercive levers as possible, crossing domains as needed, to provide a truly whole of government approach to cybersecurity and cyber deterrence. The role of the DOJ (and the FBI by extension) is especially enlightening. By publicly indicting foreign nationals for cyberattacks conducted on American computer systems, the US government underscores the fact that contemporary cyber deterrence transcends traditional defence policy and military doctrine. By establishing the DOJ as a core pillar of its punishment strategy, the US signals its intention to use criminal justice tools to deter not just criminal attacks but attacks conducted by nation state adversaries. In doing so, the US further blurs the line between state institutions and individuals, by sanctioning the latter for actions they perpetrated while working for or on behalf of foreign governments, militaries, or intelligence agencies. For deterrence theory, the burgeoning role non-military and non-kinetic coercion have had in US cyber deterrence posture suggests that academics must redouble their efforts at multidisciplinarity. Academic silos still exist in the manner in which deterrence theory is developed and tested. To some degree, deterrence from within IR theory is privileged over that stemming from criminology, psychology, and terrorism and intelligence studies. This is especially the case when it comes to deterrence in national security and international affairs. Though the fourth wave of deterrence scholarship has gone to",
    "some length to bridge the disciplinary divide, more cross-fertilisation is needed among disciplines to better reflect and speak to developments taking place in practice. What theoretical lessons do non-IR approaches to deterrence hold for how IR theories of cyber deterrence are developed and improved?\n\nFifth, US cyber deterrence is not solely about states, either. Rather, non-state actors figure prominently in American strategic doctrine as both potential perpetrators of cyberattacks targeting US infrastructure, and, more importantly for our purposes, as potential partners that amplify US cyber deterrence. For instance, private sector and individual victims of cyberattack share information, voluntarily, about attacks with law enforcement and intelligence. This provides governments with a better understanding of the nature, prevalence and evolution of certain types of attack, which can lead to improvements in defence and denial. In other cases, as highlighted by Facebook, Microsoft, and Marcus Hutchins -- a private British citizen who noticed a ‘kill switch' within WannaCry's code and took action to temporarily shut the attack down -- non-state actors can track and impede attacks without government oversight, further denying perpetrators the fruits of their labour. In still other cases, non-state actors, including companies, individuals, academics, NGOs, and other such groups, can augment US cyber security and deterrence by denial efforts by practicing better cyber hygiene -- i.e. updating passwords or patching software. This functions to further deny challengers easy opportunities to conduct successful attacks. On this front, Washington is exploring how it might compel (or, even, demand) private sector partners, contractors, and suppliers to do more to defend and secure their own networks, data and assets, as a precondition for working with and on behalf of the US government. In February 2018, for instance, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, in discussing the 2018 National Defense Strategy at a conference, warned that DoD wanted the cyber security ‘bar to be set so high, it will become the condition of doing business' with the Pentagon; for industry, cybersecurity will be ‘foundational to business with DoD'. The point, in this case, is to develop a whole of society deterrence posture, rather than simply a whole of government approach. The logic of all of this goes back to a statement made in President Bush's opening letter to the first 2003 cybersecurity strategy, oft repeated since: ‘Securing cyberspace is an extraordinarily difficult strategic challenge that requires a coordinated and focused effort from our entire society -- the federal government, state and local governments, the private sector, and the American people'. ‘Every American', the strategy continues ‘who can contribute to securing part of cyberspace is encouraged",
    "to do so. The federal government invites the creation of, and participation in, public-private partnerships to raise cybersecurity awareness, train personnel, stimulate market forces, improve technology, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, exchange information and plan recovery operations. Of the many ways in which the US government has previously approached deterrence in the other domains of warfare, this general call to arms is unique to cyberspace and cyber deterrence.\n\nIn response, scholars of deterrence need to explore the nature and feasibility of non-state cyber deterrence. Cyberspace is not a state-centric environment. On the contrary: states and militaries represent a tiny fraction of all the communities, individuals, and non-state actors that constitute cyberspace. Objects, too, have cyber presence. Projections suggest that 50 billion items -- from smart-homes to smart-cars, and from ‘intelligent' construction materials to wireless medical devices -- will be networked online as part of the IoT through an array of embedded electronics, software and sensors. All to say, the vast majority of interactions and the vast majority of the data created online is non-state in nature. Cyber deterrence theory must move beyond its narrow focus on states to account for the diversity of actors and objects that populate cyberspace. What is the equivalent in cyberspace of businesses, community groups, and homeowners employing storefront lighting, neighbourhood watch programs, and anti-burglary systems to deter physical attacks, theft and robbery? Can non-state actors be agents of their own deterrence in cyberspace?\n\n## Disclosure statement\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.\n\n## Notes on contributor\n\nAlex S.

This article analyses how American cyber deterrence has been implemented over the past two decades in order to inform ongoing debates within the academic study of deterrence, and to provide insights from practice for how cyber deterrence theory can be better conceived and refined. While President Donald Trump upbraided the previous administration's apparent weakness in cyberspace – ‘We’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing’ – his administration has itself struggled to table a coherent cyber deterrence strategy, despite repeated promises to do so quickly.¹ As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to ‘develop the offensive cyber capabilities we need to deter attacks by both state and non-state actors’.² Two weeks following his November 2017 election, President-elect Trump went on to explain further – that he would build ‘a comprehensive plan to protect America’s vital infrastructure against cyberattacks’.³ And months later still, as President, he signed Executive Order (EO) 13800 in May 2017 – an updated draft of a January 2017 EO that had been scraped at the last minute – on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. The EO describes a plan to reassess all elements of US cybersecurity across and beyond the government. In terms of cyber deterrence specifically, EO 13800 calls on various agencies and departments – including the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security, along with the Director of CONTACT Alex S.

S. WILNER National Intelligence – to jointly submit a report ‘on the Nation’s strategic options for deterring adversaries’ in cyberspace. $^{4}$ The report was to be submitted within 90 days (August 2017). A public version of the report eventually appeared in May 2018. $^{5}$ President Trump was also slow to appoint or approve several top-level federal cybersecurity and technology positions – including, notably, Federal Chief Information Security Officer, and the head of DHS's cybersecurity and infrastructure protection division. $^{6}$ These positions are critical to guiding US cybersecurity policy and planning, including in the area of cyber deterrence. Despite all of this, (former) White House Homeland Security advisor, Thomas Bossert – who helped craft cybersecurity policy under US President George W. Bush – revealed in October 2017, that the Trump Administration was determined to eventually publish a new cybersecurity strategy based on EO 13800. $^{7}$ And in his January 2017 Confirmation Hearing, General James Mattis, President Trump's (former) Secretary of Defense, suggested that a comprehensive 'cyber doctrine' might be ready by July 2018. $^{8}$ The new National Cyber Strategy was eventually published in September 2018, after an earlier public summary was held back in May 2018. $^{9}$ Although a US cyber deterrence strategy distinct from a broader cyber doctrine has yet to be established or fully leveraged, bits and pieces of the strategy exist, peppered about in different government departments and agencies. Indeed, US cyber deterrence has evolved a great deal since the mid-2000s. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, to better anticipate where US cyber deterrence is heading in practice by exploring the manner in which it has evolved through different presidential administrations. And second, to trace the evolution of US cyber deterrence to date to explore cyber deterrence in theory. When compared to theoretical advancements in conceptualising and implementing deterrence in other domains, including, $^{4}$The White House, Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical infrastructure, 11 May 2017. $^{5}$US Department of State, Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, ‘Recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the American People from Cyber Threats’, 31 May 2018. $^{6}$Joseph Marks, ‘Many Top Cybersecurity Posts Remain Empty – and Not on Purpose’, DefenseOne, 10 November 2017; Mohana Ravindranath, ‘Many CFO Act federal Agencies are Still being Lead by Acting Chief Information Officers’, Nextgov, 17 November 2017. $^{7}$In a moment of further intrigue, Bossert resigned his post in April 2018, on the request of John Bolton, Trump’s newly-appointed national security advisor. Bossert’s departure was followed a week later by Rob Joyce’s, the White House cybersecurity coordinator. President Trump later eliminated Joyce’s position altogether, in May 2018.

By the standards of deterrence theory, which has a robust and cumulative pedigree dating back over a century, cyber deterrence is an innovative but imperfectly understood idea. The bulk of the academic literature on cyber deterrence was produced only very recently, over the past fifteen years or so. Moreover, in some important ways, US cyber deterrence practice outpaces cyber deterrence theory. Tactics, strategy, doctrine and policy have been developed, unveiled and put to use even before corresponding theories from academia are properly understood, tested and refined. If practice precedes theory, then a reflection of how this practice progressed over time may help inform theory more broadly. Combined, these circumstances leave scholars with a unique opportunity to evaluate an example of cyber deterrence practice in order to explain and better describe cyber deterrence theory. In methodological terms, this article explores how American cyber deterrence has been implemented in order to better highlight theory more broadly. The United States, by dint of its size, pre-eminence in cyberspace and decades of experience operationalising deterrence theory in other domains, represents a crucial case. Moreover, in empirical terms, the US government openly discusses cybersecurity, and has made various iterations of its cyber deterrence strategy and doctrine publicly available. While a comprehensive US cyber deterrence strategy has yet to be tabled, fragments of the strategy can be patched together, piecemeal, from various US government bodies. A record of thought and practice exists; wading through it provides insights for theory. The article begins with a summary of the academic literature on deterrence theory dating back to the beginning of the Cold War. The rationale here is to outline the nuts and bolts of deterrence theory, highlight conceptual prerequisites, illustrate the many ways deterrence has been operationalised, and briefly assess the ‘four waves' of deterrence scholarship. Next, the article takes a broad look at cyber deterrence theory in particular. The purpose is to discuss the core debates and research clusters embedded within this particular sub-field of the literature. Doing so will provide a theoretical foundation against which the empirical work can be paired against. An exploration of US cyber deterrence then follows. This section will provide a detailed and linear reflection of US cyber deterrence strategy, doctrine and policy stretching back to the early 2000s. The analysis will piece together how US strategy has unfolded and evolved over time, and help identify specific concepts, trends and assumptions baked into strategic # A. S. WILNER discourse. Highlights from the US example will then be analysed in the conclusion of the article. The way the United States has put cyber deterrence into practice over time provides lessons and insights for how cyber deterrence theory might be better conceived, approached and refined.",
