Based on the protection of integrity and sovereignty of States, they comprise obligations to refrain, to prevent, and to co-operate, in order to avoid transboundary harm to other States. The obligation to prevent such harm is a general obligation of due diligence and, as such, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\nKEYWORDS: Budapest Convention, State Sovereignty, Corfu Channel Principle, Obligation to Prevent Harm, Due Diligence Standard, Duty to Co-Operate\n## I. Introduction\nUnder general international law three kinds of behaviour can be required from a State on whose territory incidents occur which may have a damaging effect on other States: to refrain from the incident, to prevent the incident, and to co-operate with other States in order to control the effects of the incident. If it fails to fulfil any of these obligations, the State of origin may on a secondary level be liable to make reparation for any damage sustained. But before we can try to develop those obligations any further, we need to take a look at the object which they are supposed to have in our context, i.e. at the kind of incidents we are talking about here.\n* Professor for Public Law, International, European, and Comparative Law, European Legal Studies Institute, University of Osnabrück.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## II. The Indicatory Function of the Budapest Convention\nWe all seem to agree that, as international law stands today, there are no binding instruments which deal specifically with cyber security incidents and which would entail inter-State obligations on prevention, information, and co-operation. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention)¹ seeks to harmonise national criminal laws, thus refers to the situation after the fact and not, at least not directly, on ‘mitigating the risks’ of cyber incidents. Still, the Convention does have some impact on our subject: It is so far binding upon 47 States (as of 1 October 2015), among them important States, such as the United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Those States express through the Convention that combating cybercrime and the interference with computer systems is an issue for co-operation between States, and thus something the international community should be concerned about. And recent State practice seems to confirm that since States are regularly complaining about their computer systems being hacked or damaged from another State’s territory, and at least some of those statements refer in this respect to an illegal act, thus implying that international law has, or at least should have, something to say on incidents of that kind.\nFurthermore, the Budapest Convention defines in its Articles 2 to 6 certain forms of interference with computer systems which the States parties are supposed to make criminal offences under their national law. By doing so, the Convention implies that those incidents are considered unacceptable for the international community and should, therefore, be prohibited by law. Since this agreement is contained in an international treaty, we might take it as the seed of an opinio iuris to the effect that the interferences concerned, if caught by a norm of international law, are examples of internationally illegal behaviour. In other words, the categories outlined in the Convention may help to define the scope of international duties of behaviour with regard to computer systems in other States, even if the Convention does not itself contain such duties. Thus, if a rule of international law could be identified to require such behaviour by States, we may safely assume that it encompassed acts like the illegal access to computer systems, the technical interception of non-public transmission of computer data, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration, or suppression of\n¹ Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ncomputer data, and the serious hindering of the functioning of a computer system. These are grosso modo the kinds of acts that our topic summarises as 'cyber security incidents'.\nMoreover, the common understandings agreed by the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), set up under Article 46 Budapest Convention, although they necessarily reflect the provisions of the Convention, may with all due care serve as indications on how specific terms and concepts could be understood under general international law. This is also due to the fact that, apart from delegations of the contracting parties, the Committee includes representatives from other States and international organisations.² The guiding function of the Committee's work could, for instance, apply to the notion of 'computer system', defined in Article 1 (a) Budapest Convention, which the T-CY Guidance Note #1 (2012) clarified by discussing some examples of covered devices, or to the forms of malware which the Committee specified in its Guidance Note #7 (2013).³\nHowever, the above categorisation can only become effective under general international law if the latter does indeed contain 'carrier obligations' for States with regard to foreign computer systems. Since State practice so far has not produced specific instruments or obligations with regard to cyber security incidents, we need to refer to general obligations of States under international law and try to apply them to those incidents. Three points can be made in this respect.\n## III. Obligation to Refrain from Computer Attacks\nThe fundamental obligation for States is, of course, to refrain themselves from interfering with computer systems of another State or situated in another State's territory. Some authors refer to the well-known principle of non-intervention in\n² Cf. Art. 3.3 T-CY Rules of Procedure, 3 December 2013, T-CY (2013)25 rev, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016802e7278 (accessed on 6 October, 2014).\n³ All T-CY Guidance Notes are available via: http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/guidance-notes (accessed on 6 October 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\norder to specify this obligation.⁴ Based on the terminology used by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case,⁵ I would in this respect prefer to simply apply the principle of State sovereignty, which is involved whenever a State willingly produces adverse effects of a certain gravity in another State’s territory. Just as this principle was violated by the laying of mines in the Nicaragua case, it is by manipulating computer devices in another State’s sovereign realm. As opposed to that, the principle of non-intervention applies in the Court’s view only when a State uses methods of coercion against another with respect to matters which are in the domaine réservé of that other State.⁶ Thus, it seems that interferences which simply, by *vis absoluta*, produce certain effects in another State’s territory would not easily fit under this concept of intervention. They constitute a different form of violation of State sovereignty.\nThe gravest forms of such violation, if attributable to a State and if resulting in physical harm of a certain scale and effects in another State’s territory, may be considered acts of force, or even armed attacks giving rise to the right of self-defence.⁷ But, as the focus of this conference is on incidents below that threshold, the various problems raised by the concepts of the use of force and self-defence in this respect are left aside here.\n⁴ Cf. e.g. Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, German Yearbook of International Law 58 (2015), 67; id., Cyber Security als Herausforderung für das Völkerrecht, Juristenzeitung 70 (2015), 685, 687.\n⁵ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Obligation to Prevent Computer Attacks\nThe main obligation of the State from whose territory cyber attacks originate, is, of course, the preventive obligation stipulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case.⁸ With that the Court identified a primary obligation under customary international law which entails a comprehensive responsibility of States for activities on their territory and which does not, therefore, raise the need to attribute those actions to the State in order to hold the State responsible under international law.\n## A. Duties to Prevent in International Law\nIt is often pointed out that in *Corfu Channel* the Court upheld the requirement of positive knowledge of the territorial State for the rule to apply, while assuming such knowledge in cases of an overall control.⁹ However, it seems to me that the ICJ has abandoned that requirement with respect to environmental damage and, thus, broadened the preventive obligation in its *Nuclear Weapons* advisory opinion in 1996: Here the preventive obligation of States under customary international law is designated as a “general obligation to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States”.¹⁰ This extensive approach has been confirmed in subsequent ICJ decisions, such as the *Gabčikovo-Nagymaros* and the *Pulp Mills* cases.¹¹ The international responsibility of a State is not dependent any more on its positive knowledge of private activities, its responsibility towards other States is now being viewed as ‘a responsibility to ensure’, which entails the obligation to make sure that it knows what is going on in its territory and, at least in principle, the\n⁸ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n⁹ Cf. e.g. *Walter* (note 4), *Obligations of States*; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688.\n¹⁰ ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, 226, para. 29.\n¹¹ Id., *Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary *v.* Slovakia), Merits, Judgment of 25 September 1997, ICJ Reports 1997, 7, para. 53; id., *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina *v.* Uruguay), Merits, Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 101.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nobligation to control private activities that carry in them the risk of causing serious damage in another State.\nIt is in this broad design that the preventive obligation had been put forward in the Stockholm (1972)¹² and Rio Declarations (1992),¹³ and through affirmative State practice became part of customary environmental law. In 2001 the International Law Commission (ILC) formulated the principle as follows: “The State of origin shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.”¹⁴ A recent offspring of this broad preventive obligation is the obligation to undertake an environmental impact assessment, stipulated by the ICJ in the Pulp Mills case for industrial activities which may have an adverse transboundary impact,¹⁵ and also adopted by various arbitral tribunals.\nIt is submitted that the duty to prevent harm arising from activities in a State’s territory to another State’s environment constitutes a specific expression of the general principles of State sovereignty and integrity. States must not allow private persons to use their territory for causing severe damage in another State’s territory. States are thus not only under an obligation to refrain from acts having a negative impact on another State’s territory, but additionally under a positive obligation to prevent private activities to that effect. Another specific expression of that obligation may be seen in the law on the use of force, where it is recognised that when a State allows its territory to be used for private attacks against another State, this can constitute an illegal act of force by the territorial State or under certain circumstances even amount to an armed attack.¹⁶ Other examples of the same principle can be found in Article 194 (2) United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea, according to which “States shall\n¹² Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

The 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration of the UN General Assembly stipulated to that effect that “every State has the duty to refrain from [...] acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of [acts of force]”, GA Res. 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ntake all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment”,¹⁷ or in Article 7 (1) Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Use of International Watercourses.¹⁸\nThus, the preventive obligation of States in respect of harmful private activities in its territory is firmly rooted in general international law and not only a rule of environmental law. It is therefore submitted that the obligation can, as a rule of customary international law, in principle also be applied to transboundary cyber incidents which have their origin in private computers or private activities. This extensive duty of prevention and its application to acts in cyberspace is not only advocated in legal writings,¹⁹ but there are also first indications to this effect in the *opinio iuris* of States: For example, the German Federal Minister of the Interior and the State Secretary in the German Ministry of the Interior have expressed views to that effect,²⁰ and the UN\n¹⁷ United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3.\n¹⁸ “Watercourse States shall, in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States”, GA Res. 51/229 of 21 May 1997.\n¹⁹ Cf. e.g. Matthew J.

Contrary to that, the International Group of Experts who was responsible for drawing up the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (ed. by Michael N. Schmitt, 2013) could not agree on whether a duty of prevention exists under international law, cf. ibid., Rule 5, para. 7.\n²⁰ Hans-Peter Friedrich, International Co-operation in Developing Codes of Conduct for Cyberspace, Speech by the German Federal Minister of the Interior, 2 May 2012, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2012/05/bm_usa.html (accessed on 18 October 2015); Cornelia Rogall-Grothe, International Co-operation in Developing Norms of State Behaviour for Cyberspace, Speech by the State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, 13 December 2011, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2011/12/strg_cyber_engl.html (accessed on 18 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nGeneral Assembly has underlined the responsibility of States for the use of information technologies in their territory.²¹\n## B. The Standard of Due Diligence\nHowever, and this is a big ‘however’, any preventive obligation of the State of origin, be it in respect of the environment or of cyber security, can under current international law only be a due diligence obligation, that is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Due diligence describes an international minimum standard providing a test whereby a State’s conduct is compared to what a reasonable or ‘good government’ would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.²² It is a flexible and evolving standard which the ILC described as “what is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”.²³ Or, as the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea put it, “it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost” to obtain the required result.²⁴\nThe required degree of care is to be determined in every given case and dependent on the degree of hazard involved, but also the degree of control exercised by the State with regard to the activities in question is important.²⁵ And here things are getting difficult in respect of harmful cyber activities: How would a State, at least one bound by the rule of law, be in a position to control every private access to the internet? Private computers having a wireless access device are different in this respect from large construction projects or industrial plants which may produce hazardous effects to neighbouring countries, but which can alone for physical reasons be detected,\n²¹ “States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies”, GA Res. 55/63 of 22 January 2001, para. 1 (a).\n²² Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. III (2012), 236, para. 16; see also ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 17.\n²³ ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11.\n²⁴ International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Seabed Disputes Chamber, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 110, available at: http://www.itlos.org/index.php?id=109 (accessed on 8 July 2015).\n²⁵ Koivurova (note 22), para. 19.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ncontrolled, and regulated by State authorities. It would seem that an autonomous standard of control must be developed for IT activities which is bound to also take into account the specific technical capacities of the State concerned. As the ICJ has ruled in the Armed Activities case, the limited capacities of a State of effectively controlling parts of its territory may, under certain circumstances, limit the attribution of private acts committed on that territory to it.²⁶ Thus, the due diligence standard required by international law with regard to the control of local cyber activities is in all probability different for the United States, as it is, for example, for Liberia.\nFurthermore, if due diligence is what a ‘good government’ is supposed to do, it must also include reference to the basic human rights obligations to which the State in question is legally bound. Although you might in principle say that the due diligence obligation entails a duty to control and regulate private activities in its territory,²⁷ this duty must find its limits where the private activities concerned are protected by human rights guarantees: To solve the collision, the preventive obligation of the State and its human rights obligation must in every individual case be weighed and balanced against each other.²⁸ Applied to cyber activities, this involves, above all, the right to freedom of information and expression, as it is laid down in Article 19 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.²⁹ On account of this human right, the due diligence obligation of the State of origin cannot entail a complete preventive surveillance of private cyber activities in its territory. This is why an obligation of States “to prevent any destructive information originating from their territory”, as proposed by Russia in October 2011,³⁰ would be unacceptable under international law.\nNevertheless, what we certainly can say is that the due diligence obligation to prevent transboundary harm requires every State of origin to keep abreast of technological\n²⁶ Cf. ICJ, Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (DR Congo v. Uganda), Merits, Judgment of 19 December 2005, ICJ Reports 2005, 168, paras. 300–303.\n²⁷ Koivurova (note 22), para. 19 at the end.\n²⁸ Thus, the protection of human rights does not constitute a valid argument to simply deny the existence of preventive obligations of States; against Walter (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688–689.\n²⁹ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 16 December 1966, UNTS 999, 171.\n³⁰ Art. 6 (2) Concept of a Convention on International Information Security, proposed by the Russian Federation on 28 October 2011, available at: http://www.rusemb.org.uk/policycontact/52 (accessed on 8 July 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nand scientific developments,³¹ so that it be prepared to act in case of harmful cyber security incidents originating from its territory. Moreover, the obligation implies that States establish the institutional capacities and the appropriate procedures (e.g. monitoring mechanisms) to be able to fulfil the requirements of due diligence.\n## C. Consequences of a Breach of Due Diligence\nA State that violates the customary due diligence standard of prevention has to make appropriate reparation to injured States in accordance with general rules of State responsibility, and the States concerned may adopt countermeasures according to the same rules. Many new questions arise in this respect which cannot be dealt with here: Which States are legally injured (and thus entitled to countermeasures) by the non- or under-performance of due diligence obligations? Is it only the State on whose territory the incident has resulted in physical damage or also States whose technical facilities or infrastructure are indirectly affected? What could be appropriate and, above all, proportionate measures in response to the failure of prevention?\n## V. Obligation to Co-Operate with Other States\nThis brings me to my third and final point. It is a general feature of many areas of law that, where the substantive legal standards for regulated behaviour are deficient (or non-existing), that deficit is, at least partially, compensated for by procedural obligations. This compensatory function could in our case be fulfilled, as just mentioned, by procedural obligations of due diligence, but also by autonomous obligations established by treaty or customary law.\nAs for the source of such obligations, many turn to the established principle of 'good neighbourliness' and considering the characteristics of the cyberspace expand it to a 'universal neighbourliness' applicable to the relation between all States.³² I very much like the idea of a 'universal neighbourhood' as a fitting description of fact of\n³¹ Cf. ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11 at the end.\n³² Cf. e.g. Walter (note 4), Obligations of States; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 689.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\nhow the world wide web transformed international relations. But does this ‘universal neighbourhood’ really give rise to legal obligations? Even if the UN General Assembly purports to apply the concept of good neighbours to States that are not contiguous,³³ this appears to be much more of a political idea (‘States should act as good neighbours’) than a legal duty: International law does *de lege lata* not contain an obligation of States to be nice, friendly, and considerate toward each other. It does know, however, of specific procedural obligations of States that arise from a certain context of geographic proximity: Thus, the concept of good-neighbourliness is essentially of a territorial nature,³⁴ and it is *this* factor which makes it the source of legal obligations. I find it therefore very difficult to simply apply those obligations to activities in cyberspace only because the latter has made the world a smaller place.\nInstead, I suggest to use the concept of due diligence described above as a source for procedural obligations, since, as the ILC put it, “the duty of prevention based on the concept of due diligence is not a one-time effort but requires *continuous* effort”,³⁵ and it requires States not only to set up appropriate control mechanisms in their territory, but also to communicate with other States in case of severe incidents. I think we should think of this obligation as a kind of ‘procedural prolongation’ of the duty to prevent which we have described earlier.\nWhat this means in procedural terms, must be established according to the circumstances of every given case. Under customary law, a good case can be made for the duty to inform the States concerned in cases of emergency. Here, the *Corfu Channel* precedent has been taken up by several treaty clauses in environmental law, but also in Articles 6 and 7 International Health Regulations³⁶ which oblige the States parties to notify the World Health Organization within 24 hours “of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory”. I would submit that this rule, albeit contained in a specific treaty regime, might be\n³³ GA Res. 46/62 of 9 December 1991, para. 2.\n³⁴ *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 24, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 6 October 2015).\n³⁵ ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 12, para. 2.\n³⁶ World Health Organization, International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 6 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nconsidered to come close to what the customary rule of due diligence requires all States of origin to do.\nMoreover, it seems that the same applies in principle outside emergency situations, i.e. during regular public or private cyber activities. As soon as the State of origin discovers that such an activity within its territory proves to be harmful or potentially hazardous for the computer systems in other States, it is under a due diligence obligation to inform those States and consult with them on appropriate measures to contain the damage. This is not so much an analogy to Article 12 ILC Draft Articles on Hazardous Activities,³⁷ since that rule concerns an exchange of information ex ante, before an incident occurs. Instead, the duty to inform in case of a severe security incident strikes me as being simply the procedural element of the general preventive obligation of the State under customary law. As the ICJ held in the Pulp Mills case, co-operation between States is a necessary requirement in order to fulfil the general obligation of prevention,³⁸ and the first step of co-operation is to share any information available with regard to potentially harmful security incidents. Being based on the due diligence obligation, performance of this duty would, however, have to take into account individual rights with regard to the freedom of information and, when it comes to sharing information with other States, with regard to the protection of intellectual property.\nObligations of co-operation and mutual assistance for the purpose of criminal proceedings can arise for the State of origin, as for others, only under specific international instruments. An extensive catalogue of such obligations is contained in Chapter III of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. Apart from those, I do not see any indication of customary obligations of States to prosecute or to extradite in cases of cyber security incidents, even when those occurred in their own territory.\n## VI. Summary\nCyber security incidents do not as such produce any specific new obligations for the State of origin under international law, but for the most part simply activate\n³⁷ Supra, note 14.\n³⁸ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 11), para. 102.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\nexisting general obligations under customary law which can also be applied to those incidents.

The Indicatory Function of the Budapest Convention\nWe all seem to agree that, as international law stands today, there are no binding instruments which deal specifically with cyber security incidents and which would entail inter-State obligations on prevention, information, and co-operation. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention) seeks to harmonise national criminal laws, thus refers to the situation after the fact and not, at least not directly, on ‘mitigating the risks’ of cyber incidents. Still, the Convention does have some impact on our subject: It is so far binding upon 47 States (as of 1 October 2015), among them important States, such as the United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Those States express through the Convention that combating cybercrime and the interference with computer systems is an issue for co-operation between States, and thus something the international community should be concerned about. And recent State practice seems to confirm that since States are regularly complaining about their computer systems being hacked or damaged from another State’s territory, and at least some of those statements refer in this respect to an illegal act, thus implying that international law has, or at least should have, something to say on incidents of that kind.\nFurthermore, the Budapest Convention defines in its Articles 2 to 6 certain forms of interference with computer systems which the States parties are supposed to make criminal offences under their national law. By doing so, the Convention implies that those incidents are considered unacceptable for the international community and should, therefore, be prohibited by law. Since this agreement is contained in an international treaty, we might take it as the seed of an opinio iuris to the effect that the interferences concerned, if caught by a norm of international law, are examples of internationally illegal behaviour. In other words, the categories outlined in the Convention may help to define the scope of international duties of behaviour with regard to computer systems in other States, even if the Convention does not itself contain such duties. Thus, if a rule of international law could be identified to require such behaviour by States, we may safely assume that it encompassed acts like the illegal access to computer systems, the technical interception of non-public transmission of computer data, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration, or suppression of\n Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ncomputer data, and the serious hindering of the functioning of a computer system. These are grosso modo the kinds of acts that our topic summarises as 'cyber security incidents'.\nMoreover, the common understandings agreed by the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), set up under Article 46 Budapest Convention, although they necessarily reflect the provisions of the Convention, may with all due care serve as indications on how specific terms and concepts could be understood under general international law. This is also due to the fact that, apart from delegations of the contracting parties, the Committee includes representatives from other States and international organisations. The guiding function of the Committee's work could, for instance, apply to the notion of 'computer system', defined in Article 1 (a) Budapest Convention, which the T-CY Guidance Note #1 (2012) clarified by discussing some examples of covered devices, or to the forms of malware which the Committee specified in its Guidance Note #7 (2013).\nHowever, the above categorisation can only become effective under general international law if the latter does indeed contain 'carrier obligations' for States with regard to foreign computer systems. Since State practice so far has not produced specific instruments or obligations with regard to cyber security incidents, we need to refer to general obligations of States under international law and try to apply them to those incidents. Three points can be made in this respect.\n## III. Obligation to Refrain from Computer Attacks\nThe fundamental obligation for States is, of course, to refrain themselves from interfering with computer systems of another State or situated in another State's territory.

Based on the terminology used by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case, I would in this respect prefer to simply apply the principle of State sovereignty, which is involved whenever a State willingly produces adverse effects of a certain gravity in another State’s territory. Just as this principle was violated by the laying of mines in the Nicaragua case, it is by manipulating computer devices in another State’s sovereign realm. As opposed to that, the principle of non-intervention applies in the Court’s view only when a State uses methods of coercion against another with respect to matters which are in the domaine réservé of that other State. Thus, it seems that interferences which simply, by *vis absoluta*, produce certain effects in another State’s territory would not easily fit under this concept of intervention. They constitute a different form of violation of State sovereignty.\nThe gravest forms of such violation, if attributable to a State and if resulting in physical harm of a certain scale and effects in another State’s territory, may be considered acts of force, or even armed attacks giving rise to the right of self-defence. But, as the focus of this conference is on incidents below that threshold, the various problems raised by the concepts of the use of force and self-defence in this respect are left aside here.\n Cf. e.g. Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, German Yearbook of International Law 58 (2015), 67; id., Cyber Security als Herausforderung für das Völkerrecht, Juristenzeitung 70 (2015), 685, 687.\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Obligation to Prevent Computer Attacks\nThe main obligation of the State from whose territory cyber attacks originate, is, of course, the preventive obligation stipulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case. With that the Court identified a primary obligation under customary international law which entails a comprehensive responsibility of States for activities on their territory and which does not, therefore, raise the need to attribute those actions to the State in order to hold the State responsible under international law.\n## A. Duties to Prevent in International Law\nIt is often pointed out that in *Corfu Channel* the Court upheld the requirement of positive knowledge of the territorial State for the rule to apply, while assuming such knowledge in cases of an overall control. However, it seems to me that the ICJ has abandoned that requirement with respect to environmental damage and, thus, broadened the preventive obligation in its *Nuclear Weapons* advisory opinion in 1996: Here the preventive obligation of States under customary international law is designated as a “general obligation to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States”. This extensive approach has been confirmed in subsequent ICJ decisions, such as the *Gabčikovo-Nagymaros* and the *Pulp Mills* cases. The international responsibility of a State is not dependent any more on its positive knowledge of private activities, its responsibility towards other States is now being viewed as ‘a responsibility to ensure’, which entails the obligation to make sure that it knows what is going on in its territory and, at least in principle, the\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n Cf. e.g. *Walter* (note 4), *Obligations of States*; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688.\n ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, 226, para. 29.\n Id., *Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary *v.* Slovakia), Merits, Judgment of 25 September 1997, ICJ Reports 1997, 7, para. 53; id., *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina *v.* Uruguay), Merits, Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 101.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nobligation to control private activities that carry in them the risk of causing serious damage in another State.\nIt is in this broad design that the preventive obligation had been put forward in the Stockholm (1972) and Rio Declarations (1992), and through affirmative State practice became part of customary environmental law. In 2001 the International Law Commission (ILC) formulated the principle as follows: “The State of origin shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.” A recent offspring of this broad preventive obligation is the obligation to undertake an environmental impact assessment, stipulated by the ICJ in the Pulp Mills case for industrial activities which may have an adverse transboundary impact, and also adopted by various arbitral tribunals.\nIt is submitted that the duty to prevent harm arising from activities in a State’s territory to another State’s environment constitutes a specific expression of the general principles of State sovereignty and integrity. States must not allow private persons to use their territory for causing severe damage in another State’s territory. States are thus not only under an obligation to refrain from acts having a negative impact on another State’s territory, but additionally under a positive obligation to prevent private activities to that effect. Another specific expression of that obligation may be seen in the law on the use of force, where it is recognised that when a State allows its territory to be used for private attacks against another State, this can constitute an illegal act of force by the territorial State or under certain circumstances even amount to an armed attack. Other examples of the same principle can be found in Article 194 (2) United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea, according to which “States shall\n Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

The 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration of the UN General Assembly stipulated to that effect that “every State has the duty to refrain from [...] acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of [acts of force]”, GA Res. 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ntake all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment”, or in Article 7 (1) Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Use of International Watercourses.\nThus, the preventive obligation of States in respect of harmful private activities in its territory is firmly rooted in general international law and not only a rule of environmental law. It is therefore submitted that the obligation can, as a rule of customary international law, in principle also be applied to transboundary cyber incidents which have their origin in private computers or private activities. This extensive duty of prevention and its application to acts in cyberspace is not only advocated in legal writings, but there are also first indications to this effect in the *opinio iuris* of States: For example, the German Federal Minister of the Interior and the State Secretary in the German Ministry of the Interior have expressed views to that effect, and the UN\n United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3.\n “Watercourse States shall, in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States”, GA Res. 51/229 of 21 May 1997.\n Cf. e.g. Matthew J.

Contrary to that, the International Group of Experts who was responsible for drawing up the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (ed. by Michael N. Schmitt, 2013) could not agree on whether a duty of prevention exists under international law, cf. ibid., Rule 5, para. 7.\n Hans-Peter Friedrich, International Co-operation in Developing Codes of Conduct for Cyberspace, Speech by the German Federal Minister of the Interior, 2 May 2012, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2012/05/bm_usa.html (accessed on 18 October 2015); Cornelia Rogall-Grothe, International Co-operation in Developing Norms of State Behaviour for Cyberspace, Speech by the State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, 13 December 2011, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2011/12/strg_cyber_engl.html (accessed on 18 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nGeneral Assembly has underlined the responsibility of States for the use of information technologies in their territory.\n## B. The Standard of Due Diligence\nHowever, and this is a big ‘however’, any preventive obligation of the State of origin, be it in respect of the environment or of cyber security, can under current international law only be a due diligence obligation, that is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Due diligence describes an international minimum standard providing a test whereby a State’s conduct is compared to what a reasonable or ‘good government’ would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm. It is a flexible and evolving standard which the ILC described as “what is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”. Or, as the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea put it, “it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost” to obtain the required result.\nThe required degree of care is to be determined in every given case and dependent on the degree of hazard involved, but also the degree of control exercised by the State with regard to the activities in question is important. And here things are getting difficult in respect of harmful cyber activities: How would a State, at least one bound by the rule of law, be in a position to control every private access to the internet? Private computers having a wireless access device are different in this respect from large construction projects or industrial plants which may produce hazardous effects to neighbouring countries, but which can alone for physical reasons be detected,\n “States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies”, GA Res. 55/63 of 22 January 2001, para. 1 (a).\n Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. III (2012), 236, para. 16; see also ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 17.\n ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11.\n International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Seabed Disputes Chamber, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 110, available at: http://www.itlos.org/index.php?id=109 (accessed on 8 July 2015).\n Koivurova (note 22), para. 19.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ncontrolled, and regulated by State authorities. It would seem that an autonomous standard of control must be developed for IT activities which is bound to also take into account the specific technical capacities of the State concerned. As the ICJ has ruled in the Armed Activities case, the limited capacities of a State of effectively controlling parts of its territory may, under certain circumstances, limit the attribution of private acts committed on that territory to it. Thus, the due diligence standard required by international law with regard to the control of local cyber activities is in all probability different for the United States, as it is, for example, for Liberia.\nFurthermore, if due diligence is what a ‘good government’ is supposed to do, it must also include reference to the basic human rights obligations to which the State in question is legally bound. Although you might in principle say that the due diligence obligation entails a duty to control and regulate private activities in its territory, this duty must find its limits where the private activities concerned are protected by human rights guarantees: To solve the collision, the preventive obligation of the State and its human rights obligation must in every individual case be weighed and balanced against each other. Applied to cyber activities, this involves, above all, the right to freedom of information and expression, as it is laid down in Article 19 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On account of this human right, the due diligence obligation of the State of origin cannot entail a complete preventive surveillance of private cyber activities in its territory. This is why an obligation of States “to prevent any destructive information originating from their territory”, as proposed by Russia in October 2011, would be unacceptable under international law.\nNevertheless, what we certainly can say is that the due diligence obligation to prevent transboundary harm requires every State of origin to keep abreast of technological\n Cf. ICJ, Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (DR Congo v. Uganda), Merits, Judgment of 19 December 2005, ICJ Reports 2005, 168, paras. 300–303.\n Koivurova (note 22), para. 19 at the end.\n Thus, the protection of human rights does not constitute a valid argument to simply deny the existence of preventive obligations of States; against Walter (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688–689.\n International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 16 December 1966, UNTS 999, 171.\n Art. 6 (2) Concept of a Convention on International Information Security, proposed by the Russian Federation on 28 October 2011, available at: http://www.rusemb.org.uk/policycontact/52 (accessed on 8 July 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nand scientific developments, so that it be prepared to act in case of harmful cyber security incidents originating from its territory. Moreover, the obligation implies that States establish the institutional capacities and the appropriate procedures (e.g. monitoring mechanisms) to be able to fulfil the requirements of due diligence.\n## C. Consequences of a Breach of Due Diligence\nA State that violates the customary due diligence standard of prevention has to make appropriate reparation to injured States in accordance with general rules of State responsibility, and the States concerned may adopt countermeasures according to the same rules. Many new questions arise in this respect which cannot be dealt with here: Which States are legally injured (and thus entitled to countermeasures) by the non- or under-performance of due diligence obligations? Is it only the State on whose territory the incident has resulted in physical damage or also States whose technical facilities or infrastructure are indirectly affected? What could be appropriate and, above all, proportionate measures in response to the failure of prevention?\n## V. Obligation to Co-Operate with Other States\nThis brings me to my third and final point. It is a general feature of many areas of law that, where the substantive legal standards for regulated behaviour are deficient (or non-existing), that deficit is, at least partially, compensated for by procedural obligations. This compensatory function could in our case be fulfilled, as just mentioned, by procedural obligations of due diligence, but also by autonomous obligations established by treaty or customary law.\nAs for the source of such obligations, many turn to the established principle of 'good neighbourliness' and considering the characteristics of the cyberspace expand it to a 'universal neighbourliness' applicable to the relation between all States. I very much like the idea of a 'universal neighbourhood' as a fitting description of fact of\n Cf. ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11 at the end.\n Cf. e.g. Walter (note 4), Obligations of States; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 689.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\nhow the world wide web transformed international relations. But does this ‘universal neighbourhood’ really give rise to legal obligations? Even if the UN General Assembly purports to apply the concept of good neighbours to States that are not contiguous, this appears to be much more of a political idea (‘States should act as good neighbours’) than a legal duty: International law does *de lege lata* not contain an obligation of States to be nice, friendly, and considerate toward each other. It does know, however, of specific procedural obligations of States that arise from a certain context of geographic proximity: Thus, the concept of good-neighbourliness is essentially of a territorial nature, and it is *this* factor which makes it the source of legal obligations. I find it therefore very difficult to simply apply those obligations to activities in cyberspace only because the latter has made the world a smaller place.\nInstead, I suggest to use the concept of due diligence described above as a source for procedural obligations, since, as the ILC put it, “the duty of prevention based on the concept of due diligence is not a one-time effort but requires *continuous* effort”, and it requires States not only to set up appropriate control mechanisms in their territory, but also to communicate with other States in case of severe incidents. I think we should think of this obligation as a kind of ‘procedural prolongation’ of the duty to prevent which we have described earlier.\nWhat this means in procedural terms, must be established according to the circumstances of every given case. Under customary law, a good case can be made for the duty to inform the States concerned in cases of emergency. Here, the *Corfu Channel* precedent has been taken up by several treaty clauses in environmental law, but also in Articles 6 and 7 International Health Regulations which oblige the States parties to notify the World Health Organization within 24 hours “of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory”. I would submit that this rule, albeit contained in a specific treaty regime, might be\n GA Res. 46/62 of 9 December 1991, para. 2.\n *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 24, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 6 October 2015).\n ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 12, para. 2.\n World Health Organization, International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 6 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nconsidered to come close to what the customary rule of due diligence requires all States of origin to do.\nMoreover, it seems that the same applies in principle outside emergency situations, i.e. during regular public or private cyber activities. As soon as the State of origin discovers that such an activity within its territory proves to be harmful or potentially hazardous for the computer systems in other States, it is under a due diligence obligation to inform those States and consult with them on appropriate measures to contain the damage. This is not so much an analogy to Article 12 ILC Draft Articles on Hazardous Activities, since that rule concerns an exchange of information ex ante, before an incident occurs. Instead, the duty to inform in case of a severe security incident strikes me as being simply the procedural element of the general preventive obligation of the State under customary law. As the ICJ held in the Pulp Mills case, co-operation between States is a necessary requirement in order to fulfil the general obligation of prevention, and the first step of co-operation is to share any information available with regard to potentially harmful security incidents. Being based on the due diligence obligation, performance of this duty would, however, have to take into account individual rights with regard to the freedom of information and, when it comes to sharing information with other States, with regard to the protection of intellectual property.\nObligations of co-operation and mutual assistance for the purpose of criminal proceedings can arise for the State of origin, as for others, only under specific international instruments. An extensive catalogue of such obligations is contained in Chapter III of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. Apart from those, I do not see any indication of customary obligations of States to prosecute or to extradite in cases of cyber security incidents, even when those occurred in their own territory.\n## VI. Summary\nCyber security incidents do not as such produce any specific new obligations for the State of origin under international law, but for the most part simply activate\n Supra, note 14.\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 11), para. 102.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\nexisting general obligations under customary law which can also be applied to those incidents. The main obligation, based on the protection of the integrity and sovereignty of States, is the obligation to prevent transboundary harm to other States, which, as an obligation of due diligence, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\n.",

Just as this principle was violated by the laying of mines in the Nicaragua case, it is by manipulating computer devices in another State’s sovereign realm. As opposed to that, the principle of non-intervention applies in the Court’s view only when a State uses methods of coercion against another with respect to matters which are in the domaine réservé of that other State.⁶ Thus, it seems that interferences which simply, by *vis absoluta*, produce certain effects in another State’s territory would not easily fit under this concept of intervention. They constitute a different form of violation of State sovereignty.\nThe gravest forms of such violation, if attributable to a State and if resulting in physical harm of a certain scale and effects in another State’s territory, may be considered acts of force, or even armed attacks giving rise to the right of self-defence.⁷ But, as the focus of this conference is on incidents below that threshold, the various problems raised by the concepts of the use of force and self-defence in this respect are left aside here.\n⁴ Cf. e.g. Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, German Yearbook of International Law 58 (2015), 67; id., Cyber Security als Herausforderung für das Völkerrecht, Juristenzeitung 70 (2015), 685, 687.\n⁵ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Obligation to Prevent Computer Attacks The main obligation of the State from whose territory cyber attacks originate, is, of course, the preventive obligation stipulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case.⁸ With that the Court identified a primary obligation under customary international law which entails a comprehensive responsibility of States for activities on their territory and which does not, therefore, raise the need to attribute those actions to the State in order to hold the State responsible under international law.",
    "## A. Duties to Prevent in International Law It is often pointed out that in *Corfu Channel* the Court upheld the requirement of positive knowledge of the territorial State for the rule to apply, while assuming such knowledge in cases of an overall control.⁹ However, it seems to me that the ICJ has abandoned that requirement with respect to environmental damage and, thus, broadened the preventive obligation in its *Nuclear Weapons* advisory opinion in 1996: Here the preventive obligation of States under customary international law is designated as a “general obligation to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States”.¹⁰ This extensive approach has been confirmed in subsequent ICJ decisions, such as the *Gabčikovo-Nagymaros* and the *Pulp Mills* cases.¹¹ The international responsibility of a State is not dependent any more on its positive knowledge of private activities, its responsibility towards other States is now being viewed as ‘a responsibility to ensure’, which entails the obligation to make sure that it knows what is going on in its territory and, at least in principle, the ⁸ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.": "⁹ Cf. e.g. *Walter* (note 4), *Obligations of States*; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688.\n¹⁰ ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, 226, para. 29.\n¹¹ Id., *Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary *v.* Slovakia), Merits, Judgment of 25 September 1997, ICJ Reports 1997, 7, para. 53; id., *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina *v.* Uruguay), Merits, Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 101.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 obligation to control private activities that carry in them the risk of causing serious damage in another State.\nIt is in this broad design that the preventive obligation had been put forward in the Stockholm (1972)¹² and Rio Declarations (1992),¹³ and through affirmative State practice became part of customary environmental law. In 2001 the International Law Commission (ILC) formulated the principle as follows: “The State of origin shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.”¹⁴ A recent offspring of this broad preventive obligation is the obligation to undertake an environmental impact assessment, stipulated by the ICJ in the Pulp Mills case for industrial activities which may have an adverse transboundary impact,¹⁵ and also adopted by various arbitral tribunals.\nIt is submitted that the duty to prevent harm arising from activities in a State’s territory to another State’s environment constitutes a specific expression of the general principles of State sovereignty and integrity. States must not allow private persons to use their territory for causing severe damage in another State’s territory. States are thus not only under an obligation to refrain from acts having a negative impact on another State’s territory, but additionally under a positive obligation to prevent private activities to that effect. Another specific expression of that obligation may be seen in the law on the use of force, where it is recognised that when a State allows its territory to be used for private attacks against another State, this can constitute an illegal act of force by the territorial State or under certain circumstances even amount to an armed attack.¹⁶ Other examples of the same principle can be found in Article 194 (2) United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea, according to which “States shall ¹² Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

The 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration of the UN General Assembly stipulated to that effect that “every State has the duty to refrain from [...] acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of [acts of force]”, GA Res. 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN take all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment”,¹⁷ or in Article 7 (1) Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Use of International Watercourses.¹⁸ Thus, the preventive obligation of States in respect of harmful private activities in its territory is firmly rooted in general international law and not only a rule of environmental law. It is therefore submitted that the obligation can, as a rule of customary international law, in principle also be applied to transboundary cyber incidents which have their origin in private computers or private activities. This extensive duty of prevention and its application to acts in cyberspace is not only advocated in legal writings,¹⁹ but there are also first indications to this effect in the *opinio iuris* of States: For example, the German Federal Minister of the Interior and the State Secretary in the German Ministry of the Interior have expressed views to that effect,²⁰ and the UN ¹⁷ United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3.\n¹⁸ “Watercourse States shall, in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States”, GA Res. 51/229 of 21 May 1997.\n¹⁹ Cf. e.g. Matthew J.

Schmitt, 2013) could not agree on whether a duty of prevention exists under international law, cf. ibid., Rule 5, para. 7.\n²⁰ Hans-Peter Friedrich, International Co-operation in Developing Codes of Conduct for Cyberspace, Speech by the German Federal Minister of the Interior, 2 May 2012, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2012/05/bm_usa.html (accessed on 18 October 2015); Cornelia Rogall-Grothe, International Co-operation in Developing Norms of State Behaviour for Cyberspace, Speech by the State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, 13 December 2011, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2011/12/strg_cyber_engl.html (accessed on 18 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 General Assembly has underlined the responsibility of States for the use of information technologies in their territory.²¹ ## B. The Standard of Due Diligence However, and this is a big ‘however’, any preventive obligation of the State of origin, be it in respect of the environment or of cyber security, can under current international law only be a due diligence obligation, that is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Due diligence describes an international minimum standard providing a test whereby a State’s conduct is compared to what a reasonable or ‘good government’ would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.²² It is a flexible and evolving standard which the ILC described as “what is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”.²³ Or, as the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea put it, “it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost” to obtain the required result.²⁴ The required degree of care is to be determined in every given case and dependent on the degree of hazard involved, but also the degree of control exercised by the State with regard to the activities in question is important.²⁵ And here things are getting difficult in respect of harmful cyber activities: How would a State, at least one bound by the rule of law, be in a position to control every private access to the internet? Private computers having a wireless access device are different in this respect from large construction projects or industrial plants which may produce hazardous effects to neighbouring countries, but which can alone for physical reasons be detected, ²¹ “States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies”, GA Res. 55/63 of 22 January 2001, para. 1 (a).\n²² Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. III (2012), 236, para. 16; see also ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 17.\n²³ ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11.\n²⁴ International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Seabed Disputes Chamber, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 110, available at: http://www.itlos.org/index.php?id=109 (accessed on 8 July 2015).\n²⁵ Koivurova (note 22), para. 19.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN controlled, and regulated by State authorities. It would seem that an autonomous standard of control must be developed for IT activities which is bound to also take into account the specific technical capacities of the State concerned. As the ICJ has ruled in the Armed Activities case, the limited capacities of a State of effectively controlling parts of its territory may, under certain circumstances, limit the attribution of private acts committed on that territory to it.²⁶ Thus, the due diligence standard required by international law with regard to the control of local cyber activities is in all probability different for the United States, as it is, for example, for Liberia.\nFurthermore, if due diligence is what a ‘good government’ is supposed to do, it must also include reference to the basic human rights obligations to which the State in question is legally bound. Although you might in principle say that the due diligence obligation entails a duty to control and regulate private activities in its territory,²⁷ this duty must find its limits where the private activities concerned are protected by human rights guarantees: To solve the collision, the preventive obligation of the State and its human rights obligation must in every individual case be weighed and balanced against each other.²⁸ Applied to cyber activities, this involves, above all, the right to freedom of information and expression, as it is laid down in Article 19 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.²⁹ On account of this human right, the due diligence obligation of the State of origin cannot entail a complete preventive surveillance of private cyber activities in its territory. This is why an obligation of States “to prevent any destructive information originating from their territory”, as proposed by Russia in October 2011,³⁰ would be unacceptable under international law.\nNevertheless, what we certainly can say is that the due diligence obligation to prevent transboundary harm requires every State of origin to keep abreast of technological ²⁶ Cf. ICJ, Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (DR Congo v. Uganda), Merits, Judgment of 19 December 2005, ICJ Reports 2005, 168, paras. 300–303.\n²⁷ Koivurova (note 22), para. 19 at the end.\n²⁸ Thus, the protection of human rights does not constitute a valid argument to simply deny the existence of preventive obligations of States; against Walter (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688–689.\n²⁹ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 16 December 1966, UNTS 999, 171.\n³⁰ Art. 6 (2) Concept of a Convention on International Information Security, proposed by the Russian Federation on 28 October 2011, available at: http://www.rusemb.org.uk/policycontact/52 (accessed on 8 July 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 and scientific developments,³¹ so that it be prepared to act in case of harmful cyber security incidents originating from its territory. Moreover, the obligation implies that States establish the institutional capacities and the appropriate procedures (e.g. monitoring mechanisms) to be able to fulfil the requirements of due diligence.",
    "## C. Consequences of a Breach of Due Diligence A State that violates the customary due diligence standard of prevention has to make appropriate reparation to injured States in accordance with general rules of State responsibility, and the States concerned may adopt countermeasures according to the same rules. Many new questions arise in this respect which cannot be dealt with here: Which States are legally injured (and thus entitled to countermeasures) by the non- or under-performance of due diligence obligations? Is it only the State on whose territory the incident has resulted in physical damage or also States whose technical facilities or infrastructure are indirectly affected? What could be appropriate and, above all, proportionate measures in response to the failure of prevention?": "",
    "## V. Obligation to Co-Operate with Other States This brings me to my third and final point. It is a general feature of many areas of law that, where the substantive legal standards for regulated behaviour are deficient (or non-existing), that deficit is, at least partially, compensated for by procedural obligations. This compensatory function could in our case be fulfilled, as just mentioned, by procedural obligations of due diligence, but also by autonomous obligations established by treaty or customary law.": "As for the source of such obligations, many turn to the established principle of 'good neighbourliness' and considering the characteristics of the cyberspace expand it to a 'universal neighbourliness' applicable to the relation between all States.³² I very much like the idea of a 'universal neighbourhood' as a fitting description of fact of ³¹ Cf. ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11 at the end.\n³² Cf. e.g. Walter (note 4), Obligations of States; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 689.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN how the world wide web transformed international relations. But does this ‘universal neighbourhood’ really give rise to legal obligations? Even if the UN General Assembly purports to apply the concept of good neighbours to States that are not contiguous,³³ this appears to be much more of a political idea (‘States should act as good neighbours’) than a legal duty: International law does *de lege lata* not contain an obligation of States to be nice, friendly, and considerate toward each other. It does know, however, of specific procedural obligations of States that arise from a certain context of geographic proximity: Thus, the concept of good-neighbourliness is essentially of a territorial nature,³⁴ and it is *this* factor which makes it the source of legal obligations. I find it therefore very difficult to simply apply those obligations to activities in cyberspace only because the latter has made the world a smaller place.\nInstead, I suggest to use the concept of due diligence described above as a source for procedural obligations, since, as the ILC put it, “the duty of prevention based on the concept of due diligence is not a one-time effort but requires *continuous* effort”,³⁵ and it requires States not only to set up appropriate control mechanisms in their territory, but also to communicate with other States in case of severe incidents. I think we should think of this obligation as a kind of ‘procedural prolongation’ of the duty to prevent which we have described earlier.\nWhat this means in procedural terms, must be established according to the circumstances of every given case. Under customary law, a good case can be made for the duty to inform the States concerned in cases of emergency. Here, the *Corfu Channel* precedent has been taken up by several treaty clauses in environmental law, but also in Articles 6 and 7 International Health Regulations³⁶ which oblige the States parties to notify the World Health Organization within 24 hours “of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory”. I would submit that this rule, albeit contained in a specific treaty regime, might be ³³ GA Res. 46/62 of 9 December 1991, para. 2.\n³⁴ *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 24, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 6 October 2015).\n³⁵ ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 12, para. 2.\n³⁶ World Health Organization, International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 6 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 considered to come close to what the customary rule of due diligence requires all States of origin to do.\nMoreover, it seems that the same applies in principle outside emergency situations, i.e. during regular public or private cyber activities. As soon as the State of origin discovers that such an activity within its territory proves to be harmful or potentially hazardous for the computer systems in other States, it is under a due diligence obligation to inform those States and consult with them on appropriate measures to contain the damage. This is not so much an analogy to Article 12 ILC Draft Articles on Hazardous Activities,³⁷ since that rule concerns an exchange of information ex ante, before an incident occurs. Instead, the duty to inform in case of a severe security incident strikes me as being simply the procedural element of the general preventive obligation of the State under customary law. As the ICJ held in the Pulp Mills case, co-operation between States is a necessary requirement in order to fulfil the general obligation of prevention,³⁸ and the first step of co-operation is to share any information available with regard to potentially harmful security incidents. Being based on the due diligence obligation, performance of this duty would, however, have to take into account individual rights with regard to the freedom of information and, when it comes to sharing information with other States, with regard to the protection of intellectual property.\nObligations of co-operation and mutual assistance for the purpose of criminal proceedings can arise for the State of origin, as for others, only under specific international instruments. An extensive catalogue of such obligations is contained in Chapter III of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. Apart from those, I do not see any indication of customary obligations of States to prosecute or to extradite in cases of cyber security incidents, even when those occurred in their own territory.",
    "## VI. Summary Cyber security incidents do not as such produce any specific new obligations for the State of origin under international law, but for the most part simply activate ³⁷ Supra, note 14.": "³⁸ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 11), para. 102.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN existing general obligations under customary law which can also be applied to those incidents. The main obligation, based on the protection of the integrity and sovereignty of States, is the obligation to prevent transboundary harm to other States, which, as an obligation of due diligence, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\n."

Based on the protection of integrity and sovereignty of States, they comprise obligations to refrain, to prevent, and to co-operate, in order to avoid transboundary harm to other States. The obligation to prevent such harm is a general obligation of due diligence and, as such, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\nKEYWORDS: Budapest Convention, State Sovereignty, Corfu Channel Principle, Obligation to Prevent Harm, Due Diligence Standard, Duty to Co-Operate\n## I. Introduction\nUnder general international law three kinds of behaviour can be required from a State on whose territory incidents occur which may have a damaging effect on other States: to refrain from the incident, to prevent the incident, and to co-operate with other States in order to control the effects of the incident. If it fails to fulfil any of these obligations, the State of origin may on a secondary level be liable to make reparation for any damage sustained. But before we can try to develop those obligations any further, we need to take a look at the object which they are supposed to have in our context, i.e. at the kind of incidents we are talking about here.\n* Professor for Public Law, International, European, and Comparative Law, European Legal Studies Institute, University of Osnabrück.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## II. The Indicatory Function of the Budapest Convention\nWe all seem to agree that, as international law stands today, there are no binding instruments which deal specifically with cyber security incidents and which would entail inter-State obligations on prevention, information, and co-operation. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention) seeks to harmonise national criminal laws, thus refers to the situation after the fact and not, at least not directly, on ‘mitigating the risks’ of cyber incidents. Still, the Convention does have some impact on our subject: It is so far binding upon 47 States (as of 1 October 2015), among them important States, such as the United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Those States express through the Convention that combating cybercrime and the interference with computer systems is an issue for co-operation between States, and thus something the international community should be concerned about. And recent State practice seems to confirm that since States are regularly complaining about their computer systems being hacked or damaged from another State’s territory, and at least some of those statements refer in this respect to an illegal act, thus implying that international law has, or at least should have, something to say on incidents of that kind.\nFurthermore, the Budapest Convention defines in its Articles 2 to 6 certain forms of interference with computer systems which the States parties are supposed to make criminal offences under their national law. By doing so, the Convention implies that those incidents are considered unacceptable for the international community and should, therefore, be prohibited by law. Since this agreement is contained in an international treaty, we might take it as the seed of an opinio iuris to the effect that the interferences concerned, if caught by a norm of international law, are examples of internationally illegal behaviour. In other words, the categories outlined in the Convention may help to define the scope of international duties of behaviour with regard to computer systems in other States, even if the Convention does not itself contain such duties. Thus, if a rule of international law could be identified to require such behaviour by States, we may safely assume that it encompassed acts like the illegal access to computer systems, the technical interception of non-public transmission of computer data, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration, or suppression of\n Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ncomputer data, and the serious hindering of the functioning of a computer system. These are grosso modo the kinds of acts that our topic summarises as 'cyber security incidents'.\nMoreover, the common understandings agreed by the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), set up under Article 46 Budapest Convention, although they necessarily reflect the provisions of the Convention, may with all due care serve as indications on how specific terms and concepts could be understood under general international law. This is also due to the fact that, apart from delegations of the contracting parties, the Committee includes representatives from other States and international organisations. The guiding function of the Committee's work could, for instance, apply to the notion of 'computer system', defined in Article 1 (a) Budapest Convention, which the T-CY Guidance Note #1 (2012) clarified by discussing some examples of covered devices, or to the forms of malware which the Committee specified in its Guidance Note #7 (2013).\nHowever, the above categorisation can only become effective under general international law if the latter does indeed contain 'carrier obligations' for States with regard to foreign computer systems. Since State practice so far has not produced specific instruments or obligations with regard to cyber security incidents, we need to refer to general obligations of States under international law and try to apply them to those incidents. Three points can be made in this respect.\n## III. Obligation to Refrain from Computer Attacks\nThe fundamental obligation for States is, of course, to refrain themselves from interfering with computer systems of another State or situated in another State's territory. Some authors refer to the well-known principle of non-intervention in\n Cf. Art. 3.3 T-CY Rules of Procedure, 3 December 2013, T-CY (2013)25 rev, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016802e7278 (accessed on 6 October, 2014).\n All T-CY Guidance Notes are available via: http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/guidance-notes (accessed on 6 October 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\norder to specify this obligation. Based on the terminology used by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case, I would in this respect prefer to simply apply the principle of State sovereignty, which is involved whenever a State willingly produces adverse effects of a certain gravity in another State’s territory. Just as this principle was violated by the laying of mines in the Nicaragua case, it is by manipulating computer devices in another State’s sovereign realm. As opposed to that, the principle of non-intervention applies in the Court’s view only when a State uses methods of coercion against another with respect to matters which are in the domaine réservé of that other State. Thus, it seems that interferences which simply, by *vis absoluta*, produce certain effects in another State’s territory would not easily fit under this concept of intervention. They constitute a different form of violation of State sovereignty.\nThe gravest forms of such violation, if attributable to a State and if resulting in physical harm of a certain scale and effects in another State’s territory, may be considered acts of force, or even armed attacks giving rise to the right of self-defence. But, as the focus of this conference is on incidents below that threshold, the various problems raised by the concepts of the use of force and self-defence in this respect are left aside here.\n Cf. e.g. Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, German Yearbook of International Law 58 (2015), 67; id., Cyber Security als Herausforderung für das Völkerrecht, Juristenzeitung 70 (2015), 685, 687.\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Obligation to Prevent Computer Attacks\nThe main obligation of the State from whose territory cyber attacks originate, is, of course, the preventive obligation stipulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case. With that the Court identified a primary obligation under customary international law which entails a comprehensive responsibility of States for activities on their territory and which does not, therefore, raise the need to attribute those actions to the State in order to hold the State responsible under international law.\n## A. Duties to Prevent in International Law\nIt is often pointed out that in *Corfu Channel* the Court upheld the requirement of positive knowledge of the territorial State for the rule to apply, while assuming such knowledge in cases of an overall control. However, it seems to me that the ICJ has abandoned that requirement with respect to environmental damage and, thus, broadened the preventive obligation in its *Nuclear Weapons* advisory opinion in 1996: Here the preventive obligation of States under customary international law is designated as a “general obligation to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States”. This extensive approach has been confirmed in subsequent ICJ decisions, such as the *Gabčikovo-Nagymaros* and the *Pulp Mills* cases. The international responsibility of a State is not dependent any more on its positive knowledge of private activities, its responsibility towards other States is now being viewed as ‘a responsibility to ensure’, which entails the obligation to make sure that it knows what is going on in its territory and, at least in principle, the\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n Cf. e.g. *Walter* (note 4), *Obligations of States*; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688.\n ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, 226, para. 29.\n Id., *Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary *v.* Slovakia), Merits, Judgment of 25 September 1997, ICJ Reports 1997, 7, para. 53; id., *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina *v.* Uruguay), Merits, Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 101.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nobligation to control private activities that carry in them the risk of causing serious damage in another State.\nIt is in this broad design that the preventive obligation had been put forward in the Stockholm (1972) and Rio Declarations (1992), and through affirmative State practice became part of customary environmental law. In 2001 the International Law Commission (ILC) formulated the principle as follows: “The State of origin shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.” A recent offspring of this broad preventive obligation is the obligation to undertake an environmental impact assessment, stipulated by the ICJ in the Pulp Mills case for industrial activities which may have an adverse transboundary impact, and also adopted by various arbitral tribunals.\nIt is submitted that the duty to prevent harm arising from activities in a State’s territory to another State’s environment constitutes a specific expression of the general principles of State sovereignty and integrity. States must not allow private persons to use their territory for causing severe damage in another State’s territory. States are thus not only under an obligation to refrain from acts having a negative impact on another State’s territory, but additionally under a positive obligation to prevent private activities to that effect. Another specific expression of that obligation may be seen in the law on the use of force, where it is recognised that when a State allows its territory to be used for private attacks against another State, this can constitute an illegal act of force by the territorial State or under certain circumstances even amount to an armed attack. Other examples of the same principle can be found in Article 194 (2) United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea, according to which “States shall\n Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

The 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration of the UN General Assembly stipulated to that effect that “every State has the duty to refrain from [...] acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of [acts of force]”, GA Res. 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ntake all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment”, or in Article 7 (1) Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Use of International Watercourses.\nThus, the preventive obligation of States in respect of harmful private activities in its territory is firmly rooted in general international law and not only a rule of environmental law. It is therefore submitted that the obligation can, as a rule of customary international law, in principle also be applied to transboundary cyber incidents which have their origin in private computers or private activities. This extensive duty of prevention and its application to acts in cyberspace is not only advocated in legal writings, but there are also first indications to this effect in the *opinio iuris* of States: For example, the German Federal Minister of the Interior and the State Secretary in the German Ministry of the Interior have expressed views to that effect, and the UN\n United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3.\n “Watercourse States shall, in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States”, GA Res. 51/229 of 21 May 1997.\n Cf. e.g. Matthew J.

Contrary to that, the International Group of Experts who was responsible for drawing up the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (ed. by Michael N. Schmitt, 2013) could not agree on whether a duty of prevention exists under international law, cf. ibid., Rule 5, para. 7.\n Hans-Peter Friedrich, International Co-operation in Developing Codes of Conduct for Cyberspace, Speech by the German Federal Minister of the Interior, 2 May 2012, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2012/05/bm_usa.html (accessed on 18 October 2015); Cornelia Rogall-Grothe, International Co-operation in Developing Norms of State Behaviour for Cyberspace, Speech by the State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, 13 December 2011, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2011/12/strg_cyber_engl.html (accessed on 18 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nGeneral Assembly has underlined the responsibility of States for the use of information technologies in their territory.\n## B. The Standard of Due Diligence\nHowever, and this is a big ‘however’, any preventive obligation of the State of origin, be it in respect of the environment or of cyber security, can under current international law only be a due diligence obligation, that is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Due diligence describes an international minimum standard providing a test whereby a State’s conduct is compared to what a reasonable or ‘good government’ would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm. It is a flexible and evolving standard which the ILC described as “what is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”. Or, as the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea put it, “it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost” to obtain the required result.\nThe required degree of care is to be determined in every given case and dependent on the degree of hazard involved, but also the degree of control exercised by the State with regard to the activities in question is important. And here things are getting difficult in respect of harmful cyber activities: How would a State, at least one bound by the rule of law, be in a position to control every private access to the internet? Private computers having a wireless access device are different in this respect from large construction projects or industrial plants which may produce hazardous effects to neighbouring countries, but which can alone for physical reasons be detected,\n “States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies”, GA Res. 55/63 of 22 January 2001, para. 1 (a).\n Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. III (2012), 236, para. 16; see also ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 17.\n ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11.\n International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Seabed Disputes Chamber, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 110, available at: http://www.itlos.org/index.php?id=109 (accessed on 8 July 2015).\n Koivurova (note 22), para. 19.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ncontrolled, and regulated by State authorities. It would seem that an autonomous standard of control must be developed for IT activities which is bound to also take into account the specific technical capacities of the State concerned. As the ICJ has ruled in the Armed Activities case, the limited capacities of a State of effectively controlling parts of its territory may, under certain circumstances, limit the attribution of private acts committed on that territory to it. Thus, the due diligence standard required by international law with regard to the control of local cyber activities is in all probability different for the United States, as it is, for example, for Liberia.\nFurthermore, if due diligence is what a ‘good government’ is supposed to do, it must also include reference to the basic human rights obligations to which the State in question is legally bound. Although you might in principle say that the due diligence obligation entails a duty to control and regulate private activities in its territory, this duty must find its limits where the private activities concerned are protected by human rights guarantees: To solve the collision, the preventive obligation of the State and its human rights obligation must in every individual case be weighed and balanced against each other. Applied to cyber activities, this involves, above all, the right to freedom of information and expression, as it is laid down in Article 19 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On account of this human right, the due diligence obligation of the State of origin cannot entail a complete preventive surveillance of private cyber activities in its territory. This is why an obligation of States “to prevent any destructive information originating from their territory”, as proposed by Russia in October 2011, would be unacceptable under international law.\nNevertheless, what we certainly can say is that the due diligence obligation to prevent transboundary harm requires every State of origin to keep abreast of technological\n Cf. ICJ, Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (DR Congo v. Uganda), Merits, Judgment of 19 December 2005, ICJ Reports 2005, 168, paras. 300–303.\n Koivurova (note 22), para. 19 at the end.\n Thus, the protection of human rights does not constitute a valid argument to simply deny the existence of preventive obligations of States; against Walter (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688–689.\n International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 16 December 1966, UNTS 999, 171.\n Art. 6 (2) Concept of a Convention on International Information Security, proposed by the Russian Federation on 28 October 2011, available at: http://www.rusemb.org.uk/policycontact/52 (accessed on 8 July 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nand scientific developments, so that it be prepared to act in case of harmful cyber security incidents originating from its territory. Moreover, the obligation implies that States establish the institutional capacities and the appropriate procedures (e.g. monitoring mechanisms) to be able to fulfil the requirements of due diligence.\n## C. Consequences of a Breach of Due Diligence\nA State that violates the customary due diligence standard of prevention has to make appropriate reparation to injured States in accordance with general rules of State responsibility, and the States concerned may adopt countermeasures according to the same rules. Many new questions arise in this respect which cannot be dealt with here: Which States are legally injured (and thus entitled to countermeasures) by the non- or under-performance of due diligence obligations? Is it only the State on whose territory the incident has resulted in physical damage or also States whose technical facilities or infrastructure are indirectly affected? What could be appropriate and, above all, proportionate measures in response to the failure of prevention?\n## V. Obligation to Co-Operate with Other States\nThis brings me to my third and final point. It is a general feature of many areas of law that, where the substantive legal standards for regulated behaviour are deficient (or non-existing), that deficit is, at least partially, compensated for by procedural obligations. This compensatory function could in our case be fulfilled, as just mentioned, by procedural obligations of due diligence, but also by autonomous obligations established by treaty or customary law.\nAs for the source of such obligations, many turn to the established principle of 'good neighbourliness' and considering the characteristics of the cyberspace expand it to a 'universal neighbourliness' applicable to the relation between all States. I very much like the idea of a 'universal neighbourhood' as a fitting description of fact of\n Cf. ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11 at the end.\n Cf. e.g. Walter (note 4), Obligations of States; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 689.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\nhow the world wide web transformed international relations. But does this ‘universal neighbourhood’ really give rise to legal obligations? Even if the UN General Assembly purports to apply the concept of good neighbours to States that are not contiguous, this appears to be much more of a political idea (‘States should act as good neighbours’) than a legal duty: International law does *de lege lata* not contain an obligation of States to be nice, friendly, and considerate toward each other. It does know, however, of specific procedural obligations of States that arise from a certain context of geographic proximity: Thus, the concept of good-neighbourliness is essentially of a territorial nature, and it is *this* factor which makes it the source of legal obligations. I find it therefore very difficult to simply apply those obligations to activities in cyberspace only because the latter has made the world a smaller place.\nInstead, I suggest to use the concept of due diligence described above as a source for procedural obligations, since, as the ILC put it, “the duty of prevention based on the concept of due diligence is not a one-time effort but requires *continuous* effort”, and it requires States not only to set up appropriate control mechanisms in their territory, but also to communicate with other States in case of severe incidents. I think we should think of this obligation as a kind of ‘procedural prolongation’ of the duty to prevent which we have described earlier.\nWhat this means in procedural terms, must be established according to the circumstances of every given case. Under customary law, a good case can be made for the duty to inform the States concerned in cases of emergency. Here, the *Corfu Channel* precedent has been taken up by several treaty clauses in environmental law, but also in Articles 6 and 7 International Health Regulations which oblige the States parties to notify the World Health Organization within 24 hours “of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory”. I would submit that this rule, albeit contained in a specific treaty regime, might be\n GA Res. 46/62 of 9 December 1991, para. 2.\n *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 24, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 6 October 2015).\n ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 12, para. 2.\n World Health Organization, International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 6 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nconsidered to come close to what the customary rule of due diligence requires all States of origin to do.\nMoreover, it seems that the same applies in principle outside emergency situations, i.e. during regular public or private cyber activities. As soon as the State of origin discovers that such an activity within its territory proves to be harmful or potentially hazardous for the computer systems in other States, it is under a due diligence obligation to inform those States and consult with them on appropriate measures to contain the damage. This is not so much an analogy to Article 12 ILC Draft Articles on Hazardous Activities, since that rule concerns an exchange of information ex ante, before an incident occurs. Instead, the duty to inform in case of a severe security incident strikes me as being simply the procedural element of the general preventive obligation of the State under customary law. As the ICJ held in the Pulp Mills case, co-operation between States is a necessary requirement in order to fulfil the general obligation of prevention, and the first step of co-operation is to share any information available with regard to potentially harmful security incidents. Being based on the due diligence obligation, performance of this duty would, however, have to take into account individual rights with regard to the freedom of information and, when it comes to sharing information with other States, with regard to the protection of intellectual property.\nObligations of co-operation and mutual assistance for the purpose of criminal proceedings can arise for the State of origin, as for others, only under specific international instruments. An extensive catalogue of such obligations is contained in Chapter III of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. Apart from those, I do not see any indication of customary obligations of States to prosecute or to extradite in cases of cyber security incidents, even when those occurred in their own territory.\n## VI. Summary\nCyber security incidents do not as such produce any specific new obligations for the State of origin under international law, but for the most part simply activate\n Supra, note 14.\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 11), para. 102.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\nexisting general obligations under customary law which can also be applied to those incidents. The main obligation, based on the protection of the integrity and sovereignty of States, is the obligation to prevent transboundary harm to other States, which, as an obligation of due diligence, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\n.",

Based on the protection of integrity and sovereignty of States, they comprise obligations to refrain, to prevent, and to co-operate, in order to avoid transboundary harm to other States. The obligation to prevent such harm is a general obligation of due diligence and, as such, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\nKEYWORDS: Budapest Convention, State Sovereignty, Corfu Channel Principle, Obligation to Prevent Harm, Due Diligence Standard, Duty to Co-Operate\n## I. Introduction\nUnder general international law three kinds of behaviour can be required from a State on whose territory incidents occur which may have a damaging effect on other States: to refrain from the incident, to prevent the incident, and to co-operate with other States in order to control the effects of the incident. If it fails to fulfil any of these obligations, the State of origin may on a secondary level be liable to make reparation for any damage sustained. But before we can try to develop those obligations any further, we need to take a look at the object which they are supposed to have in our context, i.e. at the kind of incidents we are talking about here.\n* Professor for Public Law, International, European, and Comparative Law, European Legal Studies Institute, University of Osnabrück.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## II. The Indicatory Function of the Budapest Convention\nWe all seem to agree that, as international law stands today, there are no binding instruments which deal specifically with cyber security incidents and which would entail inter-State obligations on prevention, information, and co-operation. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention) seeks to harmonise national criminal laws, thus refers to the situation after the fact and not, at least not directly, on ‘mitigating the risks’ of cyber incidents. Still, the Convention does have some impact on our subject: It is so far binding upon 47 States (as of 1 October 2015), among them important States, such as the United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Those States express through the Convention that combating cybercrime and the interference with computer systems is an issue for co-operation between States, and thus something the international community should be concerned about. And recent State practice seems to confirm that since States are regularly complaining about their computer systems being hacked or damaged from another State’s territory, and at least some of those statements refer in this respect to an illegal act, thus implying that international law has, or at least should have, something to say on incidents of that kind.\nFurthermore, the Budapest Convention defines in its Articles 2 to 6 certain forms of interference with computer systems which the States parties are supposed to make criminal offences under their national law. By doing so, the Convention implies that those incidents are considered unacceptable for the international community and should, therefore, be prohibited by law. Since this agreement is contained in an international treaty, we might take it as the seed of an opinio iuris to the effect that the interferences concerned, if caught by a norm of international law, are examples of internationally illegal behaviour. In other words, the categories outlined in the Convention may help to define the scope of international duties of behaviour with regard to computer systems in other States, even if the Convention does not itself contain such duties. Thus, if a rule of international law could be identified to require such behaviour by States, we may safely assume that it encompassed acts like the illegal access to computer systems, the technical interception of non-public transmission of computer data, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration, or suppression of\n Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ncomputer data, and the serious hindering of the functioning of a computer system. These are grosso modo the kinds of acts that our topic summarises as 'cyber security incidents'.\nMoreover, the common understandings agreed by the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), set up under Article 46 Budapest Convention, although they necessarily reflect the provisions of the Convention, may with all due care serve as indications on how specific terms and concepts could be understood under general international law. This is also due to the fact that, apart from delegations of the contracting parties, the Committee includes representatives from other States and international organisations. The guiding function of the Committee's work could, for instance, apply to the notion of 'computer system', defined in Article 1 (a) Budapest Convention, which the T-CY Guidance Note #1 (2012) clarified by discussing some examples of covered devices, or to the forms of malware which the Committee specified in its Guidance Note #7 (2013).\nHowever, the above categorisation can only become effective under general international law if the latter does indeed contain 'carrier obligations' for States with regard to foreign computer systems. Since State practice so far has not produced specific instruments or obligations with regard to cyber security incidents, we need to refer to general obligations of States under international law and try to apply them to those incidents. Three points can be made in this respect.\n## III. Obligation to Refrain from Computer Attacks\nThe fundamental obligation for States is, of course, to refrain themselves from interfering with computer systems of another State or situated in another State's territory. Some authors refer to the well-known principle of non-intervention in\n Cf. Art. 3.3 T-CY Rules of Procedure, 3 December 2013, T-CY (2013)25 rev, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016802e7278 (accessed on 6 October, 2014).\n All T-CY Guidance Notes are available via: http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/guidance-notes (accessed on 6 October 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\norder to specify this obligation. Based on the terminology used by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case, I would in this respect prefer to simply apply the principle of State sovereignty, which is involved whenever a State willingly produces adverse effects of a certain gravity in another State’s territory. Just as this principle was violated by the laying of mines in the Nicaragua case, it is by manipulating computer devices in another State’s sovereign realm. As opposed to that, the principle of non-intervention applies in the Court’s view only when a State uses methods of coercion against another with respect to matters which are in the domaine réservé of that other State. Thus, it seems that interferences which simply, by *vis absoluta*, produce certain effects in another State’s territory would not easily fit under this concept of intervention. They constitute a different form of violation of State sovereignty.\nThe gravest forms of such violation, if attributable to a State and if resulting in physical harm of a certain scale and effects in another State’s territory, may be considered acts of force, or even armed attacks giving rise to the right of self-defence. But, as the focus of this conference is on incidents below that threshold, the various problems raised by the concepts of the use of force and self-defence in this respect are left aside here.\n Cf. e.g. Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, German Yearbook of International Law 58 (2015), 67; id., Cyber Security als Herausforderung für das Völkerrecht, Juristenzeitung 70 (2015), 685, 687.\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Obligation to Prevent Computer Attacks\nThe main obligation of the State from whose territory cyber attacks originate, is, of course, the preventive obligation stipulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case. With that the Court identified a primary obligation under customary international law which entails a comprehensive responsibility of States for activities on their territory and which does not, therefore, raise the need to attribute those actions to the State in order to hold the State responsible under international law.\n## A. Duties to Prevent in International Law\nIt is often pointed out that in *Corfu Channel* the Court upheld the requirement of positive knowledge of the territorial State for the rule to apply, while assuming such knowledge in cases of an overall control. However, it seems to me that the ICJ has abandoned that requirement with respect to environmental damage and, thus, broadened the preventive obligation in its *Nuclear Weapons* advisory opinion in 1996: Here the preventive obligation of States under customary international law is designated as a “general obligation to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States”. This extensive approach has been confirmed in subsequent ICJ decisions, such as the *Gabčikovo-Nagymaros* and the *Pulp Mills* cases. The international responsibility of a State is not dependent any more on its positive knowledge of private activities, its responsibility towards other States is now being viewed as ‘a responsibility to ensure’, which entails the obligation to make sure that it knows what is going on in its territory and, at least in principle, the\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n Cf. e.g. *Walter* (note 4), *Obligations of States*; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688.\n ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, 226, para. 29.\n Id., *Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary *v.* Slovakia), Merits, Judgment of 25 September 1997, ICJ Reports 1997, 7, para. 53; id., *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina *v.* Uruguay), Merits, Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 101.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nobligation to control private activities that carry in them the risk of causing serious damage in another State.\nIt is in this broad design that the preventive obligation had been put forward in the Stockholm (1972) and Rio Declarations (1992), and through affirmative State practice became part of customary environmental law. In 2001 the International Law Commission (ILC) formulated the principle as follows: “The State of origin shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.” A recent offspring of this broad preventive obligation is the obligation to undertake an environmental impact assessment, stipulated by the ICJ in the Pulp Mills case for industrial activities which may have an adverse transboundary impact, and also adopted by various arbitral tribunals.\nIt is submitted that the duty to prevent harm arising from activities in a State’s territory to another State’s environment constitutes a specific expression of the general principles of State sovereignty and integrity. States must not allow private persons to use their territory for causing severe damage in another State’s territory. States are thus not only under an obligation to refrain from acts having a negative impact on another State’s territory, but additionally under a positive obligation to prevent private activities to that effect. Another specific expression of that obligation may be seen in the law on the use of force, where it is recognised that when a State allows its territory to be used for private attacks against another State, this can constitute an illegal act of force by the territorial State or under certain circumstances even amount to an armed attack. Other examples of the same principle can be found in Article 194 (2) United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea, according to which “States shall\n Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

The 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration of the UN General Assembly stipulated to that effect that “every State has the duty to refrain from [...] acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of [acts of force]”, GA Res. 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ntake all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment”, or in Article 7 (1) Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Use of International Watercourses.\nThus, the preventive obligation of States in respect of harmful private activities in its territory is firmly rooted in general international law and not only a rule of environmental law. It is therefore submitted that the obligation can, as a rule of customary international law, in principle also be applied to transboundary cyber incidents which have their origin in private computers or private activities. This extensive duty of prevention and its application to acts in cyberspace is not only advocated in legal writings, but there are also first indications to this effect in the *opinio iuris* of States: For example, the German Federal Minister of the Interior and the State Secretary in the German Ministry of the Interior have expressed views to that effect, and the UN\n United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3.\n “Watercourse States shall, in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States”, GA Res. 51/229 of 21 May 1997.\n Cf. e.g. Matthew J.

Contrary to that, the International Group of Experts who was responsible for drawing up the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (ed. by Michael N. Schmitt, 2013) could not agree on whether a duty of prevention exists under international law, cf. ibid., Rule 5, para. 7.\n Hans-Peter Friedrich, International Co-operation in Developing Codes of Conduct for Cyberspace, Speech by the German Federal Minister of the Interior, 2 May 2012, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2012/05/bm_usa.html (accessed on 18 October 2015); Cornelia Rogall-Grothe, International Co-operation in Developing Norms of State Behaviour for Cyberspace, Speech by the State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, 13 December 2011, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2011/12/strg_cyber_engl.html (accessed on 18 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nGeneral Assembly has underlined the responsibility of States for the use of information technologies in their territory.\n## B. The Standard of Due Diligence\nHowever, and this is a big ‘however’, any preventive obligation of the State of origin, be it in respect of the environment or of cyber security, can under current international law only be a due diligence obligation, that is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Due diligence describes an international minimum standard providing a test whereby a State’s conduct is compared to what a reasonable or ‘good government’ would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm. It is a flexible and evolving standard which the ILC described as “what is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”. Or, as the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea put it, “it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost” to obtain the required result.\nThe required degree of care is to be determined in every given case and dependent on the degree of hazard involved, but also the degree of control exercised by the State with regard to the activities in question is important. And here things are getting difficult in respect of harmful cyber activities: How would a State, at least one bound by the rule of law, be in a position to control every private access to the internet? Private computers having a wireless access device are different in this respect from large construction projects or industrial plants which may produce hazardous effects to neighbouring countries, but which can alone for physical reasons be detected,\n “States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies”, GA Res. 55/63 of 22 January 2001, para. 1 (a).\n Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. III (2012), 236, para. 16; see also ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 17.\n ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11.\n International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Seabed Disputes Chamber, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 110, available at: http://www.itlos.org/index.php?id=109 (accessed on 8 July 2015).\n Koivurova (note 22), para. 19.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ncontrolled, and regulated by State authorities. It would seem that an autonomous standard of control must be developed for IT activities which is bound to also take into account the specific technical capacities of the State concerned. As the ICJ has ruled in the Armed Activities case, the limited capacities of a State of effectively controlling parts of its territory may, under certain circumstances, limit the attribution of private acts committed on that territory to it. Thus, the due diligence standard required by international law with regard to the control of local cyber activities is in all probability different for the United States, as it is, for example, for Liberia.\nFurthermore, if due diligence is what a ‘good government’ is supposed to do, it must also include reference to the basic human rights obligations to which the State in question is legally bound. Although you might in principle say that the due diligence obligation entails a duty to control and regulate private activities in its territory, this duty must find its limits where the private activities concerned are protected by human rights guarantees: To solve the collision, the preventive obligation of the State and its human rights obligation must in every individual case be weighed and balanced against each other. Applied to cyber activities, this involves, above all, the right to freedom of information and expression, as it is laid down in Article 19 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On account of this human right, the due diligence obligation of the State of origin cannot entail a complete preventive surveillance of private cyber activities in its territory. This is why an obligation of States “to prevent any destructive information originating from their territory”, as proposed by Russia in October 2011, would be unacceptable under international law.\nNevertheless, what we certainly can say is that the due diligence obligation to prevent transboundary harm requires every State of origin to keep abreast of technological\n Cf. ICJ, Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (DR Congo v. Uganda), Merits, Judgment of 19 December 2005, ICJ Reports 2005, 168, paras. 300–303.\n Koivurova (note 22), para. 19 at the end.\n Thus, the protection of human rights does not constitute a valid argument to simply deny the existence of preventive obligations of States; against Walter (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688–689.\n International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 16 December 1966, UNTS 999, 171.\n Art. 6 (2) Concept of a Convention on International Information Security, proposed by the Russian Federation on 28 October 2011, available at: http://www.rusemb.org.uk/policycontact/52 (accessed on 8 July 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nand scientific developments, so that it be prepared to act in case of harmful cyber security incidents originating from its territory. Moreover, the obligation implies that States establish the institutional capacities and the appropriate procedures (e.g. monitoring mechanisms) to be able to fulfil the requirements of due diligence.\n## C. Consequences of a Breach of Due Diligence\nA State that violates the customary due diligence standard of prevention has to make appropriate reparation to injured States in accordance with general rules of State responsibility, and the States concerned may adopt countermeasures according to the same rules. Many new questions arise in this respect which cannot be dealt with here: Which States are legally injured (and thus entitled to countermeasures) by the non- or under-performance of due diligence obligations? Is it only the State on whose territory the incident has resulted in physical damage or also States whose technical facilities or infrastructure are indirectly affected? What could be appropriate and, above all, proportionate measures in response to the failure of prevention?\n## V. Obligation to Co-Operate with Other States\nThis brings me to my third and final point. It is a general feature of many areas of law that, where the substantive legal standards for regulated behaviour are deficient (or non-existing), that deficit is, at least partially, compensated for by procedural obligations. This compensatory function could in our case be fulfilled, as just mentioned, by procedural obligations of due diligence, but also by autonomous obligations established by treaty or customary law.\nAs for the source of such obligations, many turn to the established principle of 'good neighbourliness' and considering the characteristics of the cyberspace expand it to a 'universal neighbourliness' applicable to the relation between all States. I very much like the idea of a 'universal neighbourhood' as a fitting description of fact of\n Cf. ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11 at the end.\n Cf. e.g. Walter (note 4), Obligations of States; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 689.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\nhow the world wide web transformed international relations. But does this ‘universal neighbourhood’ really give rise to legal obligations? Even if the UN General Assembly purports to apply the concept of good neighbours to States that are not contiguous, this appears to be much more of a political idea (‘States should act as good neighbours’) than a legal duty: International law does *de lege lata* not contain an obligation of States to be nice, friendly, and considerate toward each other. It does know, however, of specific procedural obligations of States that arise from a certain context of geographic proximity: Thus, the concept of good-neighbourliness is essentially of a territorial nature, and it is *this* factor which makes it the source of legal obligations. I find it therefore very difficult to simply apply those obligations to activities in cyberspace only because the latter has made the world a smaller place.\nInstead, I suggest to use the concept of due diligence described above as a source for procedural obligations, since, as the ILC put it, “the duty of prevention based on the concept of due diligence is not a one-time effort but requires *continuous* effort”, and it requires States not only to set up appropriate control mechanisms in their territory, but also to communicate with other States in case of severe incidents. I think we should think of this obligation as a kind of ‘procedural prolongation’ of the duty to prevent which we have described earlier.\nWhat this means in procedural terms, must be established according to the circumstances of every given case. Under customary law, a good case can be made for the duty to inform the States concerned in cases of emergency. Here, the *Corfu Channel* precedent has been taken up by several treaty clauses in environmental law, but also in Articles 6 and 7 International Health Regulations which oblige the States parties to notify the World Health Organization within 24 hours “of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory”. I would submit that this rule, albeit contained in a specific treaty regime, might be\n GA Res. 46/62 of 9 December 1991, para. 2.\n *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 24, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 6 October 2015).\n ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 12, para. 2.\n World Health Organization, International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 6 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nconsidered to come close to what the customary rule of due diligence requires all States of origin to do.\nMoreover, it seems that the same applies in principle outside emergency situations, i.e. during regular public or private cyber activities. As soon as the State of origin discovers that such an activity within its territory proves to be harmful or potentially hazardous for the computer systems in other States, it is under a due diligence obligation to inform those States and consult with them on appropriate measures to contain the damage. This is not so much an analogy to Article 12 ILC Draft Articles on Hazardous Activities, since that rule concerns an exchange of information ex ante, before an incident occurs. Instead, the duty to inform in case of a severe security incident strikes me as being simply the procedural element of the general preventive obligation of the State under customary law. As the ICJ held in the Pulp Mills case, co-operation between States is a necessary requirement in order to fulfil the general obligation of prevention, and the first step of co-operation is to share any information available with regard to potentially harmful security incidents. Being based on the due diligence obligation, performance of this duty would, however, have to take into account individual rights with regard to the freedom of information and, when it comes to sharing information with other States, with regard to the protection of intellectual property.\nObligations of co-operation and mutual assistance for the purpose of criminal proceedings can arise for the State of origin, as for others, only under specific international instruments. An extensive catalogue of such obligations is contained in Chapter III of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. Apart from those, I do not see any indication of customary obligations of States to prosecute or to extradite in cases of cyber security incidents, even when those occurred in their own territory.\n## VI. Summary\nCyber security incidents do not as such produce any specific new obligations for the State of origin under international law, but for the most part simply activate\n Supra, note 14.\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 11), para. 102.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\nexisting general obligations under customary law which can also be applied to those incidents. The main obligation, based on the protection of the integrity and sovereignty of States, is the obligation to prevent transboundary harm to other States, which, as an obligation of due diligence, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\n."

Based on the protection of integrity and sovereignty of States, they comprise obligations to refrain, to prevent, and to co-operate, in order to avoid transboundary harm to other States. The obligation to prevent such harm is a general obligation of due diligence and, as such, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\nKEYWORDS: Budapest Convention, State Sovereignty, Corfu Channel Principle, Obligation to Prevent Harm, Due Diligence Standard, Duty to Co-Operate\n## I. Introduction\nUnder general international law three kinds of behaviour can be required from a State on whose territory incidents occur which may have a damaging effect on other States: to refrain from the incident, to prevent the incident, and to co-operate with other States in order to control the effects of the incident. If it fails to fulfil any of these obligations, the State of origin may on a secondary level be liable to make reparation for any damage sustained. But before we can try to develop those obligations any further, we need to take a look at the object which they are supposed to have in our context, i.e. at the kind of incidents we are talking about here.\n* Professor for Public Law, International, European, and Comparative Law, European Legal Studies Institute, University of Osnabrück.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## II. The Indicatory Function of the Budapest Convention\nWe all seem to agree that, as international law stands today, there are no binding instruments which deal specifically with cyber security incidents and which would entail inter-State obligations on prevention, information, and co-operation. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention)¹ seeks to harmonise national criminal laws, thus refers to the situation after the fact and not, at least not directly, on ‘mitigating the risks’ of cyber incidents. Still, the Convention does have some impact on our subject: It is so far binding upon 47 States (as of 1 October 2015), among them important States, such as the United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Those States express through the Convention that combating cybercrime and the interference with computer systems is an issue for co-operation between States, and thus something the international community should be concerned about. And recent State practice seems to confirm that since States are regularly complaining about their computer systems being hacked or damaged from another State’s territory, and at least some of those statements refer in this respect to an illegal act, thus implying that international law has, or at least should have, something to say on incidents of that kind.\nFurthermore, the Budapest Convention defines in its Articles 2 to 6 certain forms of interference with computer systems which the States parties are supposed to make criminal offences under their national law. By doing so, the Convention implies that those incidents are considered unacceptable for the international community and should, therefore, be prohibited by law. Since this agreement is contained in an international treaty, we might take it as the seed of an opinio iuris to the effect that the interferences concerned, if caught by a norm of international law, are examples of internationally illegal behaviour. In other words, the categories outlined in the Convention may help to define the scope of international duties of behaviour with regard to computer systems in other States, even if the Convention does not itself contain such duties. Thus, if a rule of international law could be identified to require such behaviour by States, we may safely assume that it encompassed acts like the illegal access to computer systems, the technical interception of non-public transmission of computer data, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration, or suppression of\n¹ Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ncomputer data, and the serious hindering of the functioning of a computer system. These are grosso modo the kinds of acts that our topic summarises as 'cyber security incidents'.\nMoreover, the common understandings agreed by the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), set up under Article 46 Budapest Convention, although they necessarily reflect the provisions of the Convention, may with all due care serve as indications on how specific terms and concepts could be understood under general international law. This is also due to the fact that, apart from delegations of the contracting parties, the Committee includes representatives from other States and international organisations.² The guiding function of the Committee's work could, for instance, apply to the notion of 'computer system', defined in Article 1 (a) Budapest Convention, which the T-CY Guidance Note #1 (2012) clarified by discussing some examples of covered devices, or to the forms of malware which the Committee specified in its Guidance Note #7 (2013).³\nHowever, the above categorisation can only become effective under general international law if the latter does indeed contain 'carrier obligations' for States with regard to foreign computer systems. Since State practice so far has not produced specific instruments or obligations with regard to cyber security incidents, we need to refer to general obligations of States under international law and try to apply them to those incidents. Three points can be made in this respect.\n## III. Obligation to Refrain from Computer Attacks\nThe fundamental obligation for States is, of course, to refrain themselves from interfering with computer systems of another State or situated in another State's territory. Some authors refer to the well-known principle of non-intervention in\n² Cf. Art. 3.3 T-CY Rules of Procedure, 3 December 2013, T-CY (2013)25 rev, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016802e7278 (accessed on 6 October, 2014).\n³ All T-CY Guidance Notes are available via: http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/guidance-notes (accessed on 6 October 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\norder to specify this obligation.⁴ Based on the terminology used by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case,⁵ I would in this respect prefer to simply apply the principle of State sovereignty, which is involved whenever a State willingly produces adverse effects of a certain gravity in another State’s territory. Just as this principle was violated by the laying of mines in the Nicaragua case, it is by manipulating computer devices in another State’s sovereign realm. As opposed to that, the principle of non-intervention applies in the Court’s view only when a State uses methods of coercion against another with respect to matters which are in the domaine réservé of that other State.⁶ Thus, it seems that interferences which simply, by *vis absoluta*, produce certain effects in another State’s territory would not easily fit under this concept of intervention. They constitute a different form of violation of State sovereignty.\nThe gravest forms of such violation, if attributable to a State and if resulting in physical harm of a certain scale and effects in another State’s territory, may be considered acts of force, or even armed attacks giving rise to the right of self-defence.⁷ But, as the focus of this conference is on incidents below that threshold, the various problems raised by the concepts of the use of force and self-defence in this respect are left aside here.\n⁴ Cf. e.g. Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, German Yearbook of International Law 58 (2015), 67; id., Cyber Security als Herausforderung für das Völkerrecht, Juristenzeitung 70 (2015), 685, 687.\n⁵ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Obligation to Prevent Computer Attacks\nThe main obligation of the State from whose territory cyber attacks originate, is, of course, the preventive obligation stipulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case.⁸ With that the Court identified a primary obligation under customary international law which entails a comprehensive responsibility of States for activities on their territory and which does not, therefore, raise the need to attribute those actions to the State in order to hold the State responsible under international law.\n## A. Duties to Prevent in International Law\nIt is often pointed out that in *Corfu Channel* the Court upheld the requirement of positive knowledge of the territorial State for the rule to apply, while assuming such knowledge in cases of an overall control.⁹ However, it seems to me that the ICJ has abandoned that requirement with respect to environmental damage and, thus, broadened the preventive obligation in its *Nuclear Weapons* advisory opinion in 1996: Here the preventive obligation of States under customary international law is designated as a “general obligation to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States”.¹⁰ This extensive approach has been confirmed in subsequent ICJ decisions, such as the *Gabčikovo-Nagymaros* and the *Pulp Mills* cases.¹¹ The international responsibility of a State is not dependent any more on its positive knowledge of private activities, its responsibility towards other States is now being viewed as ‘a responsibility to ensure’, which entails the obligation to make sure that it knows what is going on in its territory and, at least in principle, the\n⁸ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n⁹ Cf. e.g. *Walter* (note 4), *Obligations of States*; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688.\n¹⁰ ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, 226, para. 29.\n¹¹ Id., *Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary *v.* Slovakia), Merits, Judgment of 25 September 1997, ICJ Reports 1997, 7, para. 53; id., *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina *v.* Uruguay), Merits, Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 101.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nobligation to control private activities that carry in them the risk of causing serious damage in another State.\nIt is in this broad design that the preventive obligation had been put forward in the Stockholm (1972)¹² and Rio Declarations (1992),¹³ and through affirmative State practice became part of customary environmental law. In 2001 the International Law Commission (ILC) formulated the principle as follows: “The State of origin shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.”¹⁴ A recent offspring of this broad preventive obligation is the obligation to undertake an environmental impact assessment, stipulated by the ICJ in the Pulp Mills case for industrial activities which may have an adverse transboundary impact,¹⁵ and also adopted by various arbitral tribunals.\nIt is submitted that the duty to prevent harm arising from activities in a State’s territory to another State’s environment constitutes a specific expression of the general principles of State sovereignty and integrity. States must not allow private persons to use their territory for causing severe damage in another State’s territory. States are thus not only under an obligation to refrain from acts having a negative impact on another State’s territory, but additionally under a positive obligation to prevent private activities to that effect. Another specific expression of that obligation may be seen in the law on the use of force, where it is recognised that when a State allows its territory to be used for private attacks against another State, this can constitute an illegal act of force by the territorial State or under certain circumstances even amount to an armed attack.¹⁶ Other examples of the same principle can be found in Article 194 (2) United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea, according to which “States shall\n¹² Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

The 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration of the UN General Assembly stipulated to that effect that “every State has the duty to refrain from [...] acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of [acts of force]”, GA Res. 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ntake all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment”,¹⁷ or in Article 7 (1) Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Use of International Watercourses.¹⁸\nThus, the preventive obligation of States in respect of harmful private activities in its territory is firmly rooted in general international law and not only a rule of environmental law. It is therefore submitted that the obligation can, as a rule of customary international law, in principle also be applied to transboundary cyber incidents which have their origin in private computers or private activities. This extensive duty of prevention and its application to acts in cyberspace is not only advocated in legal writings,¹⁹ but there are also first indications to this effect in the *opinio iuris* of States: For example, the German Federal Minister of the Interior and the State Secretary in the German Ministry of the Interior have expressed views to that effect,²⁰ and the UN\n¹⁷ United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3.\n¹⁸ “Watercourse States shall, in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States”, GA Res. 51/229 of 21 May 1997.\n¹⁹ Cf. e.g. Matthew J.

Contrary to that, the International Group of Experts who was responsible for drawing up the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (ed. by Michael N. Schmitt, 2013) could not agree on whether a duty of prevention exists under international law, cf. ibid., Rule 5, para. 7.\n²⁰ Hans-Peter Friedrich, International Co-operation in Developing Codes of Conduct for Cyberspace, Speech by the German Federal Minister of the Interior, 2 May 2012, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2012/05/bm_usa.html (accessed on 18 October 2015); Cornelia Rogall-Grothe, International Co-operation in Developing Norms of State Behaviour for Cyberspace, Speech by the State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, 13 December 2011, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2011/12/strg_cyber_engl.html (accessed on 18 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nGeneral Assembly has underlined the responsibility of States for the use of information technologies in their territory.²¹\n## B. The Standard of Due Diligence\nHowever, and this is a big ‘however’, any preventive obligation of the State of origin, be it in respect of the environment or of cyber security, can under current international law only be a due diligence obligation, that is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Due diligence describes an international minimum standard providing a test whereby a State’s conduct is compared to what a reasonable or ‘good government’ would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.²² It is a flexible and evolving standard which the ILC described as “what is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”.²³ Or, as the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea put it, “it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost” to obtain the required result.²⁴\nThe required degree of care is to be determined in every given case and dependent on the degree of hazard involved, but also the degree of control exercised by the State with regard to the activities in question is important.²⁵ And here things are getting difficult in respect of harmful cyber activities: How would a State, at least one bound by the rule of law, be in a position to control every private access to the internet? Private computers having a wireless access device are different in this respect from large construction projects or industrial plants which may produce hazardous effects to neighbouring countries, but which can alone for physical reasons be detected,\n²¹ “States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies”, GA Res. 55/63 of 22 January 2001, para. 1 (a).\n²² Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. III (2012), 236, para. 16; see also ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 17.\n²³ ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11.\n²⁴ International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Seabed Disputes Chamber, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 110, available at: http://www.itlos.org/index.php?id=109 (accessed on 8 July 2015).\n²⁵ Koivurova (note 22), para. 19.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\ncontrolled, and regulated by State authorities. It would seem that an autonomous standard of control must be developed for IT activities which is bound to also take into account the specific technical capacities of the State concerned. As the ICJ has ruled in the Armed Activities case, the limited capacities of a State of effectively controlling parts of its territory may, under certain circumstances, limit the attribution of private acts committed on that territory to it.²⁶ Thus, the due diligence standard required by international law with regard to the control of local cyber activities is in all probability different for the United States, as it is, for example, for Liberia.\nFurthermore, if due diligence is what a ‘good government’ is supposed to do, it must also include reference to the basic human rights obligations to which the State in question is legally bound. Although you might in principle say that the due diligence obligation entails a duty to control and regulate private activities in its territory,²⁷ this duty must find its limits where the private activities concerned are protected by human rights guarantees: To solve the collision, the preventive obligation of the State and its human rights obligation must in every individual case be weighed and balanced against each other.²⁸ Applied to cyber activities, this involves, above all, the right to freedom of information and expression, as it is laid down in Article 19 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.²⁹ On account of this human right, the due diligence obligation of the State of origin cannot entail a complete preventive surveillance of private cyber activities in its territory. This is why an obligation of States “to prevent any destructive information originating from their territory”, as proposed by Russia in October 2011,³⁰ would be unacceptable under international law.\nNevertheless, what we certainly can say is that the due diligence obligation to prevent transboundary harm requires every State of origin to keep abreast of technological\n²⁶ Cf. ICJ, Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (DR Congo v. Uganda), Merits, Judgment of 19 December 2005, ICJ Reports 2005, 168, paras. 300–303.\n²⁷ Koivurova (note 22), para. 19 at the end.\n²⁸ Thus, the protection of human rights does not constitute a valid argument to simply deny the existence of preventive obligations of States; against Walter (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688–689.\n²⁹ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 16 December 1966, UNTS 999, 171.\n³⁰ Art. 6 (2) Concept of a Convention on International Information Security, proposed by the Russian Federation on 28 October 2011, available at: http://www.rusemb.org.uk/policycontact/52 (accessed on 8 July 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nand scientific developments,³¹ so that it be prepared to act in case of harmful cyber security incidents originating from its territory. Moreover, the obligation implies that States establish the institutional capacities and the appropriate procedures (e.g. monitoring mechanisms) to be able to fulfil the requirements of due diligence.\n## C. Consequences of a Breach of Due Diligence\nA State that violates the customary due diligence standard of prevention has to make appropriate reparation to injured States in accordance with general rules of State responsibility, and the States concerned may adopt countermeasures according to the same rules. Many new questions arise in this respect which cannot be dealt with here: Which States are legally injured (and thus entitled to countermeasures) by the non- or under-performance of due diligence obligations? Is it only the State on whose territory the incident has resulted in physical damage or also States whose technical facilities or infrastructure are indirectly affected? What could be appropriate and, above all, proportionate measures in response to the failure of prevention?\n## V. Obligation to Co-Operate with Other States\nThis brings me to my third and final point. It is a general feature of many areas of law that, where the substantive legal standards for regulated behaviour are deficient (or non-existing), that deficit is, at least partially, compensated for by procedural obligations. This compensatory function could in our case be fulfilled, as just mentioned, by procedural obligations of due diligence, but also by autonomous obligations established by treaty or customary law.\nAs for the source of such obligations, many turn to the established principle of 'good neighbourliness' and considering the characteristics of the cyberspace expand it to a 'universal neighbourliness' applicable to the relation between all States.³² I very much like the idea of a 'universal neighbourhood' as a fitting description of fact of\n³¹ Cf. ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11 at the end.\n³² Cf. e.g. Walter (note 4), Obligations of States; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 689.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\nhow the world wide web transformed international relations. But does this ‘universal neighbourhood’ really give rise to legal obligations? Even if the UN General Assembly purports to apply the concept of good neighbours to States that are not contiguous,³³ this appears to be much more of a political idea (‘States should act as good neighbours’) than a legal duty: International law does *de lege lata* not contain an obligation of States to be nice, friendly, and considerate toward each other. It does know, however, of specific procedural obligations of States that arise from a certain context of geographic proximity: Thus, the concept of good-neighbourliness is essentially of a territorial nature,³⁴ and it is *this* factor which makes it the source of legal obligations. I find it therefore very difficult to simply apply those obligations to activities in cyberspace only because the latter has made the world a smaller place.\nInstead, I suggest to use the concept of due diligence described above as a source for procedural obligations, since, as the ILC put it, “the duty of prevention based on the concept of due diligence is not a one-time effort but requires *continuous* effort”,³⁵ and it requires States not only to set up appropriate control mechanisms in their territory, but also to communicate with other States in case of severe incidents. I think we should think of this obligation as a kind of ‘procedural prolongation’ of the duty to prevent which we have described earlier.\nWhat this means in procedural terms, must be established according to the circumstances of every given case. Under customary law, a good case can be made for the duty to inform the States concerned in cases of emergency. Here, the *Corfu Channel* precedent has been taken up by several treaty clauses in environmental law, but also in Articles 6 and 7 International Health Regulations³⁶ which oblige the States parties to notify the World Health Organization within 24 hours “of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory”. I would submit that this rule, albeit contained in a specific treaty regime, might be\n³³ GA Res. 46/62 of 9 December 1991, para. 2.\n³⁴ *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 24, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 6 October 2015).\n³⁵ ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 12, para. 2.\n³⁶ World Health Organization, International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 6 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nconsidered to come close to what the customary rule of due diligence requires all States of origin to do.\nMoreover, it seems that the same applies in principle outside emergency situations, i.e. during regular public or private cyber activities. As soon as the State of origin discovers that such an activity within its territory proves to be harmful or potentially hazardous for the computer systems in other States, it is under a due diligence obligation to inform those States and consult with them on appropriate measures to contain the damage. This is not so much an analogy to Article 12 ILC Draft Articles on Hazardous Activities,³⁷ since that rule concerns an exchange of information ex ante, before an incident occurs. Instead, the duty to inform in case of a severe security incident strikes me as being simply the procedural element of the general preventive obligation of the State under customary law. As the ICJ held in the Pulp Mills case, co-operation between States is a necessary requirement in order to fulfil the general obligation of prevention,³⁸ and the first step of co-operation is to share any information available with regard to potentially harmful security incidents. Being based on the due diligence obligation, performance of this duty would, however, have to take into account individual rights with regard to the freedom of information and, when it comes to sharing information with other States, with regard to the protection of intellectual property.\nObligations of co-operation and mutual assistance for the purpose of criminal proceedings can arise for the State of origin, as for others, only under specific international instruments. An extensive catalogue of such obligations is contained in Chapter III of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. Apart from those, I do not see any indication of customary obligations of States to prosecute or to extradite in cases of cyber security incidents, even when those occurred in their own territory.\n## VI. Summary\nCyber security incidents do not as such produce any specific new obligations for the State of origin under international law, but for the most part simply activate\n³⁷ Supra, note 14.\n³⁸ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 11), para. 102.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\nexisting general obligations under customary law which can also be applied to those incidents. The main obligation, based on the protection of the integrity and sovereignty of States, is the obligation to prevent transboundary harm to other States, which, as an obligation of due diligence, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\n."

Based on the protection of integrity and sovereignty of States, they comprise obligations to refrain, to prevent, and to co-operate, in order to avoid transboundary harm to other States. The obligation to prevent such harm is a general obligation of due diligence and, as such, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\nKEYWORDS: Budapest Convention, State Sovereignty, Corfu Channel Principle, Obligation to Prevent Harm, Due Diligence Standard, Duty to Co-Operate ## I. Introduction Under general international law three kinds of behaviour can be required from a State on whose territory incidents occur which may have a damaging effect on other States: to refrain from the incident, to prevent the incident, and to co-operate with other States in order to control the effects of the incident. If it fails to fulfil any of these obligations, the State of origin may on a secondary level be liable to make reparation for any damage sustained. But before we can try to develop those obligations any further, we need to take a look at the object which they are supposed to have in our context, i.e. at the kind of incidents we are talking about here.\n* Professor for Public Law, International, European, and Comparative Law, European Legal Studies Institute, University of Osnabrück.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 ## II. The Indicatory Function of the Budapest Convention We all seem to agree that, as international law stands today, there are no binding instruments which deal specifically with cyber security incidents and which would entail inter-State obligations on prevention, information, and co-operation. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention)¹ seeks to harmonise national criminal laws, thus refers to the situation after the fact and not, at least not directly, on ‘mitigating the risks’ of cyber incidents. Still, the Convention does have some impact on our subject: It is so far binding upon 47 States (as of 1 October 2015), among them important States, such as the United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Those States express through the Convention that combating cybercrime and the interference with computer systems is an issue for co-operation between States, and thus something the international community should be concerned about. And recent State practice seems to confirm that since States are regularly complaining about their computer systems being hacked or damaged from another State’s territory, and at least some of those statements refer in this respect to an illegal act, thus implying that international law has, or at least should have, something to say on incidents of that kind.\nFurthermore, the Budapest Convention defines in its Articles 2 to 6 certain forms of interference with computer systems which the States parties are supposed to make criminal offences under their national law. By doing so, the Convention implies that those incidents are considered unacceptable for the international community and should, therefore, be prohibited by law. Since this agreement is contained in an international treaty, we might take it as the seed of an opinio iuris to the effect that the interferences concerned, if caught by a norm of international law, are examples of internationally illegal behaviour. In other words, the categories outlined in the Convention may help to define the scope of international duties of behaviour with regard to computer systems in other States, even if the Convention does not itself contain such duties. Thus, if a rule of international law could be identified to require such behaviour by States, we may safely assume that it encompassed acts like the illegal access to computer systems, the technical interception of non-public transmission of computer data, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration, or suppression of ¹ Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN computer data, and the serious hindering of the functioning of a computer system. These are grosso modo the kinds of acts that our topic summarises as 'cyber security incidents'.\nMoreover, the common understandings agreed by the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), set up under Article 46 Budapest Convention, although they necessarily reflect the provisions of the Convention, may with all due care serve as indications on how specific terms and concepts could be understood under general international law. This is also due to the fact that, apart from delegations of the contracting parties, the Committee includes representatives from other States and international organisations.² The guiding function of the Committee's work could, for instance, apply to the notion of 'computer system', defined in Article 1 (a) Budapest Convention, which the T-CY Guidance Note #1 (2012) clarified by discussing some examples of covered devices, or to the forms of malware which the Committee specified in its Guidance Note #7 (2013).³ However, the above categorisation can only become effective under general international law if the latter does indeed contain 'carrier obligations' for States with regard to foreign computer systems. Since State practice so far has not produced specific instruments or obligations with regard to cyber security incidents, we need to refer to general obligations of States under international law and try to apply them to those incidents. Three points can be made in this respect.\n## III. Obligation to Refrain from Computer Attacks The fundamental obligation for States is, of course, to refrain themselves from interfering with computer systems of another State or situated in another State's territory. Some authors refer to the well-known principle of non-intervention in ² Cf. Art. 3.3 T-CY Rules of Procedure, 3 December 2013, T-CY (2013)25 rev, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016802e7278 (accessed on 6 October, 2014).\n³ All T-CY Guidance Notes are available via: http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/guidance-notes (accessed on 6 October 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015 order to specify this obligation.⁴ Based on the terminology used by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case,⁵ I would in this respect prefer to simply apply the principle of State sovereignty, which is involved whenever a State willingly produces adverse effects of a certain gravity in another State’s territory. Just as this principle was violated by the laying of mines in the Nicaragua case, it is by manipulating computer devices in another State’s sovereign realm. As opposed to that, the principle of non-intervention applies in the Court’s view only when a State uses methods of coercion against another with respect to matters which are in the domaine réservé of that other State.⁶ Thus, it seems that interferences which simply, by *vis absoluta*, produce certain effects in another State’s territory would not easily fit under this concept of intervention. They constitute a different form of violation of State sovereignty.\nThe gravest forms of such violation, if attributable to a State and if resulting in physical harm of a certain scale and effects in another State’s territory, may be considered acts of force, or even armed attacks giving rise to the right of self-defence.⁷ But, as the focus of this conference is on incidents below that threshold, the various problems raised by the concepts of the use of force and self-defence in this respect are left aside here.\n⁴ Cf. e.g. Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, German Yearbook of International Law 58 (2015), 67; id., Cyber Security als Herausforderung für das Völkerrecht, Juristenzeitung 70 (2015), 685, 687.\n⁵ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Obligation to Prevent Computer Attacks The main obligation of the State from whose territory cyber attacks originate, is, of course, the preventive obligation stipulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case.⁸ With that the Court identified a primary obligation under customary international law which entails a comprehensive responsibility of States for activities on their territory and which does not, therefore, raise the need to attribute those actions to the State in order to hold the State responsible under international law.\n## A. Duties to Prevent in International Law It is often pointed out that in *Corfu Channel* the Court upheld the requirement of positive knowledge of the territorial State for the rule to apply, while assuming such knowledge in cases of an overall control.⁹ However, it seems to me that the ICJ has abandoned that requirement with respect to environmental damage and, thus, broadened the preventive obligation in its *Nuclear Weapons* advisory opinion in 1996: Here the preventive obligation of States under customary international law is designated as a “general obligation to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States”.¹⁰ This extensive approach has been confirmed in subsequent ICJ decisions, such as the *Gabčikovo-Nagymaros* and the *Pulp Mills* cases.¹¹ The international responsibility of a State is not dependent any more on its positive knowledge of private activities, its responsibility towards other States is now being viewed as ‘a responsibility to ensure’, which entails the obligation to make sure that it knows what is going on in its territory and, at least in principle, the ⁸ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n⁹ Cf. e.g. *Walter* (note 4), *Obligations of States*; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688.\n¹⁰ ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, 226, para. 29.\n¹¹ Id., *Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary *v.* Slovakia), Merits, Judgment of 25 September 1997, ICJ Reports 1997, 7, para. 53; id., *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina *v.* Uruguay), Merits, Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 101.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 obligation to control private activities that carry in them the risk of causing serious damage in another State.\nIt is in this broad design that the preventive obligation had been put forward in the Stockholm (1972)¹² and Rio Declarations (1992),¹³ and through affirmative State practice became part of customary environmental law. In 2001 the International Law Commission (ILC) formulated the principle as follows: “The State of origin shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.”¹⁴ A recent offspring of this broad preventive obligation is the obligation to undertake an environmental impact assessment, stipulated by the ICJ in the Pulp Mills case for industrial activities which may have an adverse transboundary impact,¹⁵ and also adopted by various arbitral tribunals.\nIt is submitted that the duty to prevent harm arising from activities in a State’s territory to another State’s environment constitutes a specific expression of the general principles of State sovereignty and integrity. States must not allow private persons to use their territory for causing severe damage in another State’s territory. States are thus not only under an obligation to refrain from acts having a negative impact on another State’s territory, but additionally under a positive obligation to prevent private activities to that effect. Another specific expression of that obligation may be seen in the law on the use of force, where it is recognised that when a State allows its territory to be used for private attacks against another State, this can constitute an illegal act of force by the territorial State or under certain circumstances even amount to an armed attack.¹⁶ Other examples of the same principle can be found in Article 194 (2) United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea, according to which “States shall ¹² Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

The 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration of the UN General Assembly stipulated to that effect that “every State has the duty to refrain from [...] acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of [acts of force]”, GA Res. 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN take all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment”,¹⁷ or in Article 7 (1) Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Use of International Watercourses.¹⁸ Thus, the preventive obligation of States in respect of harmful private activities in its territory is firmly rooted in general international law and not only a rule of environmental law. It is therefore submitted that the obligation can, as a rule of customary international law, in principle also be applied to transboundary cyber incidents which have their origin in private computers or private activities. This extensive duty of prevention and its application to acts in cyberspace is not only advocated in legal writings,¹⁹ but there are also first indications to this effect in the *opinio iuris* of States: For example, the German Federal Minister of the Interior and the State Secretary in the German Ministry of the Interior have expressed views to that effect,²⁰ and the UN ¹⁷ United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3.\n¹⁸ “Watercourse States shall, in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States”, GA Res. 51/229 of 21 May 1997.\n¹⁹ Cf. e.g. Matthew J.

Contrary to that, the International Group of Experts who was responsible for drawing up the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (ed. by Michael N. Schmitt, 2013) could not agree on whether a duty of prevention exists under international law, cf. ibid., Rule 5, para. 7.\n²⁰ Hans-Peter Friedrich, International Co-operation in Developing Codes of Conduct for Cyberspace, Speech by the German Federal Minister of the Interior, 2 May 2012, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2012/05/bm_usa.html (accessed on 18 October 2015); Cornelia Rogall-Grothe, International Co-operation in Developing Norms of State Behaviour for Cyberspace, Speech by the State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, 13 December 2011, available at: http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/2011/12/strg_cyber_engl.html (accessed on 18 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 General Assembly has underlined the responsibility of States for the use of information technologies in their territory.²¹ ## B. The Standard of Due Diligence However, and this is a big ‘however’, any preventive obligation of the State of origin, be it in respect of the environment or of cyber security, can under current international law only be a due diligence obligation, that is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Due diligence describes an international minimum standard providing a test whereby a State’s conduct is compared to what a reasonable or ‘good government’ would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.²² It is a flexible and evolving standard which the ILC described as “what is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”.²³ Or, as the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea put it, “it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost” to obtain the required result.²⁴ The required degree of care is to be determined in every given case and dependent on the degree of hazard involved, but also the degree of control exercised by the State with regard to the activities in question is important.²⁵ And here things are getting difficult in respect of harmful cyber activities: How would a State, at least one bound by the rule of law, be in a position to control every private access to the internet?

As the ICJ has ruled in the Armed Activities case, the limited capacities of a State of effectively controlling parts of its territory may, under certain circumstances, limit the attribution of private acts committed on that territory to it.²⁶ Thus, the due diligence standard required by international law with regard to the control of local cyber activities is in all probability different for the United States, as it is, for example, for Liberia.\nFurthermore, if due diligence is what a ‘good government’ is supposed to do, it must also include reference to the basic human rights obligations to which the State in question is legally bound. Although you might in principle say that the due diligence obligation entails a duty to control and regulate private activities in its territory,²⁷ this duty must find its limits where the private activities concerned are protected by human rights guarantees: To solve the collision, the preventive obligation of the State and its human rights obligation must in every individual case be weighed and balanced against each other.²⁸ Applied to cyber activities, this involves, above all, the right to freedom of information and expression, as it is laid down in Article 19 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.²⁹ On account of this human right, the due diligence obligation of the State of origin cannot entail a complete preventive surveillance of private cyber activities in its territory. This is why an obligation of States “to prevent any destructive information originating from their territory”, as proposed by Russia in October 2011,³⁰ would be unacceptable under international law.\nNevertheless, what we certainly can say is that the due diligence obligation to prevent transboundary harm requires every State of origin to keep abreast of technological ²⁶ Cf. ICJ, Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (DR Congo v. Uganda), Merits, Judgment of 19 December 2005, ICJ Reports 2005, 168, paras. 300–303.\n²⁷ Koivurova (note 22), para. 19 at the end.\n²⁸ Thus, the protection of human rights does not constitute a valid argument to simply deny the existence of preventive obligations of States; against Walter (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688–689.\n²⁹ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 16 December 1966, UNTS 999, 171.\n³⁰ Art. 6 (2) Concept of a Convention on International Information Security, proposed by the Russian Federation on 28 October 2011, available at: http://www.rusemb.org.uk/policycontact/52 (accessed on 8 July 2014).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 and scientific developments,³¹ so that it be prepared to act in case of harmful cyber security incidents originating from its territory. Moreover, the obligation implies that States establish the institutional capacities and the appropriate procedures (e.g. monitoring mechanisms) to be able to fulfil the requirements of due diligence.\n## C. Consequences of a Breach of Due Diligence A State that violates the customary due diligence standard of prevention has to make appropriate reparation to injured States in accordance with general rules of State responsibility, and the States concerned may adopt countermeasures according to the same rules. Many new questions arise in this respect which cannot be dealt with here: Which States are legally injured (and thus entitled to countermeasures) by the non- or under-performance of due diligence obligations? Is it only the State on whose territory the incident has resulted in physical damage or also States whose technical facilities or infrastructure are indirectly affected? What could be appropriate and, above all, proportionate measures in response to the failure of prevention?\n## V. Obligation to Co-Operate with Other States This brings me to my third and final point. It is a general feature of many areas of law that, where the substantive legal standards for regulated behaviour are deficient (or non-existing), that deficit is, at least partially, compensated for by procedural obligations. This compensatory function could in our case be fulfilled, as just mentioned, by procedural obligations of due diligence, but also by autonomous obligations established by treaty or customary law.\nAs for the source of such obligations, many turn to the established principle of 'good neighbourliness' and considering the characteristics of the cyberspace expand it to a 'universal neighbourliness' applicable to the relation between all States.³² I very much like the idea of a 'universal neighbourhood' as a fitting description of fact of ³¹ Cf. ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11 at the end.\n³² Cf. e.g. Walter (note 4), Obligations of States; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 689.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN how the world wide web transformed international relations. But does this ‘universal neighbourhood’ really give rise to legal obligations? Even if the UN General Assembly purports to apply the concept of good neighbours to States that are not contiguous,³³ this appears to be much more of a political idea (‘States should act as good neighbours’) than a legal duty: International law does *de lege lata* not contain an obligation of States to be nice, friendly, and considerate toward each other. It does know, however, of specific procedural obligations of States that arise from a certain context of geographic proximity: Thus, the concept of good-neighbourliness is essentially of a territorial nature,³⁴ and it is *this* factor which makes it the source of legal obligations. I find it therefore very difficult to simply apply those obligations to activities in cyberspace only because the latter has made the world a smaller place.\nInstead, I suggest to use the concept of due diligence described above as a source for procedural obligations, since, as the ILC put it, “the duty of prevention based on the concept of due diligence is not a one-time effort but requires *continuous* effort”,³⁵ and it requires States not only to set up appropriate control mechanisms in their territory, but also to communicate with other States in case of severe incidents. I think we should think of this obligation as a kind of ‘procedural prolongation’ of the duty to prevent which we have described earlier.\nWhat this means in procedural terms, must be established according to the circumstances of every given case. Under customary law, a good case can be made for the duty to inform the States concerned in cases of emergency. Here, the *Corfu Channel* precedent has been taken up by several treaty clauses in environmental law, but also in Articles 6 and 7 International Health Regulations³⁶ which oblige the States parties to notify the World Health Organization within 24 hours “of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory”. I would submit that this rule, albeit contained in a specific treaty regime, might be ³³ GA Res. 46/62 of 9 December 1991, para. 2.\n³⁴ *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 24, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 6 October 2015).\n³⁵ ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 12, para. 2.\n³⁶ World Health Organization, International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 6 October 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 considered to come close to what the customary rule of due diligence requires all States of origin to do.\nMoreover, it seems that the same applies in principle outside emergency situations, i.e. during regular public or private cyber activities. As soon as the State of origin discovers that such an activity within its territory proves to be harmful or potentially hazardous for the computer systems in other States, it is under a due diligence obligation to inform those States and consult with them on appropriate measures to contain the damage. This is not so much an analogy to Article 12 ILC Draft Articles on Hazardous Activities,³⁷ since that rule concerns an exchange of information ex ante, before an incident occurs. Instead, the duty to inform in case of a severe security incident strikes me as being simply the procedural element of the general preventive obligation of the State under customary law. As the ICJ held in the Pulp Mills case, co-operation between States is a necessary requirement in order to fulfil the general obligation of prevention,³⁸ and the first step of co-operation is to share any information available with regard to potentially harmful security incidents. Being based on the due diligence obligation, performance of this duty would, however, have to take into account individual rights with regard to the freedom of information and, when it comes to sharing information with other States, with regard to the protection of intellectual property.\nObligations of co-operation and mutual assistance for the purpose of criminal proceedings can arise for the State of origin, as for others, only under specific international instruments. An extensive catalogue of such obligations is contained in Chapter III of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. Apart from those, I do not see any indication of customary obligations of States to prosecute or to extradite in cases of cyber security incidents, even when those occurred in their own territory.\n## VI. Summary Cyber security incidents do not as such produce any specific new obligations for the State of origin under international law, but for the most part simply activate ³⁷ Supra, note 14.\n³⁸ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 11), para. 102.\nOBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN existing general obligations under customary law which can also be applied to those incidents. The main obligation, based on the protection of the integrity and sovereignty of States, is the obligation to prevent transboundary harm to other States, which, as an obligation of due diligence, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\n."

Just as this principle was violated by the laying of mines in the Nicaragua case, it is by manipulating computer devices in another State’s sovereign realm. As opposed to that, the principle of non-intervention applies in the Court’s view only when a State uses methods of coercion against another with respect to matters which are in the domaine réservé of that other State.⁶ Thus, it seems that interferences which simply, by *vis absoluta*, produce certain effects in another State’s territory would not easily fit under this concept of intervention. They constitute a different form of violation of State sovereignty.\nThe gravest forms of such violation, if attributable to a State and if resulting in physical harm of a certain scale and effects in another State’s territory, may be considered acts of force, or even armed attacks giving rise to the right of self-defence.⁷ But, as the focus of this conference is on incidents below that threshold, the various problems raised by the concepts of the use of force and self-defence in this respect are left aside here.\n⁴ Cf. e.g. Christian Walter, Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident, German Yearbook of International Law 58 (2015), 67; id., Cyber Security als Herausforderung für das Völkerrecht, Juristenzeitung 70 (2015), 685, 687.\n⁵ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

    "# Obligations of the State of Origin of a Cyber Security Incident\n\nOLIVER DÖRR*\n\nABSTRACT: Cyber-security incidents do not as such produce any new obligations for the State of origin under international law, its obligations rather result from rules of general international law. Based on the protection of integrity and sovereignty of States, they comprise obligations to refrain, to prevent, and to co-operate, in order to avoid transboundary harm to other States. The obligation to prevent such harm is a general obligation of due diligence and, as such, provides a flexible regulatory framework to define substantive and procedural duties of conduct and to accommodate the public and private interests involved.\n\nKEYWORDS: Budapest Convention, State Sovereignty, Corfu Channel Principle, Obligation to Prevent Harm, Due Diligence Standard, Duty to Co-Operate\n\n## I. Introduction\n\nUnder general international law three kinds of behaviour can be required from a State on whose territory incidents occur which may have a damaging effect on other States: to refrain from the incident, to prevent the incident, and to co-operate with other States in order to control the effects of the incident. If it fails to fulfil any of these obligations, the State of origin may on a secondary level be liable to make reparation for any damage sustained. But before we can try to develop those obligations any further, we need to take a look at the object which they are supposed to have in our context, i.e. at the kind of incidents we are talking about here.\n\n* Professor for Public Law, International, European, and Comparative Law, European Legal Studies Institute, University of Osnabrück.",
    "GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n\n## II. The Indicatory Function of the Budapest Convention\n\nWe all seem to agree that, as international law stands today, there are no binding instruments which deal specifically with cyber security incidents and which would entail inter-State obligations on prevention, information, and co-operation. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention)¹ seeks to harmonise national criminal laws, thus refers to the situation after the fact and not, at least not directly, on ‘mitigating the risks’ of cyber incidents. Still, the Convention does have some impact on our subject: It is so far binding upon 47 States (as of 1 October 2015), among them important States, such as the United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Those States express through the Convention that combating cybercrime and the interference with computer systems is an issue for co-operation between States, and thus something the international community should be concerned about. And recent State practice seems to confirm that since States are regularly complaining about their computer systems being hacked or damaged from another State’s territory, and at least some of those statements refer in this respect to an illegal act, thus implying that international law has, or at least should have, something to say on incidents of that kind.\n\nFurthermore, the Budapest Convention defines in its Articles 2 to 6 certain forms of interference with computer systems which the States parties are supposed to make criminal offences under their national law. By doing so, the Convention implies that those incidents are considered unacceptable for the international community and should, therefore, be prohibited by law. Since this agreement is contained in an international treaty, we might take it as the seed of an opinio iuris to the effect that the interferences concerned, if caught by a norm of international law, are examples of internationally illegal behaviour. In other words, the categories outlined in the Convention may help to define the scope of international duties of behaviour with regard to computer systems in other States, even if the Convention does not itself contain such duties. Thus, if a rule of international law could be identified to require such behaviour by States, we may safely assume that it encompassed acts like the illegal access to computer systems, the technical interception of non-public transmission of computer data, the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration, or suppression of\n\n¹ Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention).",
    "OBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\n\ncomputer data, and the serious hindering of the functioning of a computer system. These are grosso modo the kinds of acts that our topic summarises as 'cyber security incidents'.\n\nMoreover, the common understandings agreed by the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), set up under Article 46 Budapest Convention, although they necessarily reflect the provisions of the Convention, may with all due care serve as indications on how specific terms and concepts could be understood under general international law. This is also due to the fact that, apart from delegations of the contracting parties, the Committee includes representatives from other States and international organisations.² The guiding function of the Committee's work could, for instance, apply to the notion of 'computer system', defined in Article 1 (a) Budapest Convention, which the T-CY Guidance Note #1 (2012) clarified by discussing some examples of covered devices, or to the forms of malware which the Committee specified in its Guidance Note #7 (2013).³\n\nHowever, the above categorisation can only become effective under general international law if the latter does indeed contain 'carrier obligations' for States with regard to foreign computer systems. Since State practice so far has not produced specific instruments or obligations with regard to cyber security incidents, we need to refer to general obligations of States under international law and try to apply them to those incidents. Three points can be made in this respect.\n\n## III.

    "OBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\n\n## IV. Obligation to Prevent Computer Attacks\n\nThe main obligation of the State from whose territory cyber attacks originate, is, of course, the preventive obligation stipulated by the ICJ in the *Corfu Channel* case.⁸ With that the Court identified a primary obligation under customary international law which entails a comprehensive responsibility of States for activities on their territory and which does not, therefore, raise the need to attribute those actions to the State in order to hold the State responsible under international law.\n\n## A. Duties to Prevent in International Law\n\nIt is often pointed out that in *Corfu Channel* the Court upheld the requirement of positive knowledge of the territorial State for the rule to apply, while assuming such knowledge in cases of an overall control.⁹ However, it seems to me that the ICJ has abandoned that requirement with respect to environmental damage and, thus, broadened the preventive obligation in its *Nuclear Weapons* advisory opinion in 1996: Here the preventive obligation of States under customary international law is designated as a “general obligation to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States”.¹⁰ This extensive approach has been confirmed in subsequent ICJ decisions, such as the *Gabčikovo-Nagymaros* and the *Pulp Mills* cases.¹¹ The international responsibility of a State is not dependent any more on its positive knowledge of private activities, its responsibility towards other States is now being viewed as ‘a responsibility to ensure’, which entails the obligation to make sure that it knows what is going on in its territory and, at least in principle, the\n\n⁸ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland *v.* Albania), Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, 4.\n\n⁹ Cf. e.g. *Walter* (note 4), *Obligations of States*; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 688.\n\n¹⁰ ICJ, *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, 226, para. 29.\n\n¹¹ Id., *Case Concerning the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary *v.* Slovakia), Merits, Judgment of 25 September 1997, ICJ Reports 1997, 7, para. 53; id., *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina *v.* Uruguay), Merits, Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 101.",
    "GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n\nobligation to control private activities that carry in them the risk of causing serious damage in another State.\n\nIt is in this broad design that the preventive obligation had been put forward in the Stockholm (1972)¹² and Rio Declarations (1992),¹³ and through affirmative State practice became part of customary environmental law. In 2001 the International Law Commission (ILC) formulated the principle as follows: “The State of origin shall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.”¹⁴ A recent offspring of this broad preventive obligation is the obligation to undertake an environmental impact assessment, stipulated by the ICJ in the Pulp Mills case for industrial activities which may have an adverse transboundary impact,¹⁵ and also adopted by various arbitral tribunals.\n\nIt is submitted that the duty to prevent harm arising from activities in a State’s territory to another State’s environment constitutes a specific expression of the general principles of State sovereignty and integrity. States must not allow private persons to use their territory for causing severe damage in another State’s territory. States are thus not only under an obligation to refrain from acts having a negative impact on another State’s territory, but additionally under a positive obligation to prevent private activities to that effect. Another specific expression of that obligation may be seen in the law on the use of force, where it is recognised that when a State allows its territory to be used for private attacks against another State, this can constitute an illegal act of force by the territorial State or under certain circumstances even amount to an armed attack.¹⁶ Other examples of the same principle can be found in Article 194 (2) United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea, according to which “States shall\n\n¹² Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

The 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration of the UN General Assembly stipulated to that effect that “every State has the duty to refrain from [...] acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of [acts of force]”, GA Res. 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970.",

It is therefore submitted that the obligation can, as a rule of customary international law, in principle also be applied to transboundary cyber incidents which have their origin in private computers or private activities. This extensive duty of prevention and its application to acts in cyberspace is not only advocated in legal writings,¹⁹ but there are also first indications to this effect in the *opinio iuris* of States: For example, the German Federal Minister of the Interior and the State Secretary in the German Ministry of the Interior have expressed views to that effect,²⁰ and the UN\n\n¹⁷ United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, UNTS 1833, 3.\n\n¹⁸ “Watercourse States shall, in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States”, GA Res. 51/229 of 21 May 1997.\n\n¹⁹ Cf. e.g. Matthew J.

The Standard of Due Diligence\n\nHowever, and this is a big ‘however’, any preventive obligation of the State of origin, be it in respect of the environment or of cyber security, can under current international law only be a due diligence obligation, that is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Due diligence describes an international minimum standard providing a test whereby a State’s conduct is compared to what a reasonable or ‘good government’ would do in a specific situation of transboundary harm.²² It is a flexible and evolving standard which the ILC described as “what is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance”.²³ Or, as the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea put it, “it is an obligation to deploy adequate means, to exercise best possible efforts, to do the utmost” to obtain the required result.²⁴\n\nThe required degree of care is to be determined in every given case and dependent on the degree of hazard involved, but also the degree of control exercised by the State with regard to the activities in question is important.²⁵ And here things are getting difficult in respect of harmful cyber activities: How would a State, at least one bound by the rule of law, be in a position to control every private access to the internet? Private computers having a wireless access device are different in this respect from large construction projects or industrial plants which may produce hazardous effects to neighbouring countries, but which can alone for physical reasons be detected,\n\n²¹ “States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies”, GA Res. 55/63 of 22 January 2001, para. 1 (a).\n\n²² Timo Koivurova, Due Diligence, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. III (2012), 236, para. 16; see also ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 17.\n\n²³ ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11.\n\n²⁴ International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, Seabed Disputes Chamber, Advisory Opinion of 1 February 2011, para. 110, available at: http://www.itlos.org/index.php?id=109 (accessed on 8 July 2015).\n\n²⁵ Koivurova (note 22), para. 19.",

It would seem that an autonomous standard of control must be developed for IT activities which is bound to also take into account the specific technical capacities of the State concerned. As the ICJ has ruled in the Armed Activities case, the limited capacities of a State of effectively controlling parts of its territory may, under certain circumstances, limit the attribution of private acts committed on that territory to it.²⁶ Thus, the due diligence standard required by international law with regard to the control of local cyber activities is in all probability different for the United States, as it is, for example, for Liberia.\n\nFurthermore, if due diligence is what a ‘good government’ is supposed to do, it must also include reference to the basic human rights obligations to which the State in question is legally bound. Although you might in principle say that the due diligence obligation entails a duty to control and regulate private activities in its territory,²⁷ this duty must find its limits where the private activities concerned are protected by human rights guarantees: To solve the collision, the preventive obligation of the State and its human rights obligation must in every individual case be weighed and balanced against each other.²⁸ Applied to cyber activities, this involves, above all, the right to freedom of information and expression, as it is laid down in Article 19 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.²⁹ On account of this human right, the due diligence obligation of the State of origin cannot entail a complete preventive surveillance of private cyber activities in its territory. This is why an obligation of States “to prevent any destructive information originating from their territory”, as proposed by Russia in October 2011,³⁰ would be unacceptable under international law.\n\nNevertheless, what we certainly can say is that the due diligence obligation to prevent transboundary harm requires every State of origin to keep abreast of technological\n\n²⁶ Cf.

Moreover, the obligation implies that States establish the institutional capacities and the appropriate procedures (e.g. monitoring mechanisms) to be able to fulfil the requirements of due diligence.\n\n## C. Consequences of a Breach of Due Diligence\n\nA State that violates the customary due diligence standard of prevention has to make appropriate reparation to injured States in accordance with general rules of State responsibility, and the States concerned may adopt countermeasures according to the same rules. Many new questions arise in this respect which cannot be dealt with here: Which States are legally injured (and thus entitled to countermeasures) by the non- or under-performance of due diligence obligations? Is it only the State on whose territory the incident has resulted in physical damage or also States whose technical facilities or infrastructure are indirectly affected? What could be appropriate and, above all, proportionate measures in response to the failure of prevention?\n\n## V. Obligation to Co-Operate with Other States\n\nThis brings me to my third and final point. It is a general feature of many areas of law that, where the substantive legal standards for regulated behaviour are deficient (or non-existing), that deficit is, at least partially, compensated for by procedural obligations. This compensatory function could in our case be fulfilled, as just mentioned, by procedural obligations of due diligence, but also by autonomous obligations established by treaty or customary law.\n\nAs for the source of such obligations, many turn to the established principle of 'good neighbourliness' and considering the characteristics of the cyberspace expand it to a 'universal neighbourliness' applicable to the relation between all States.³² I very much like the idea of a 'universal neighbourhood' as a fitting description of fact of\n\n³¹ Cf. ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 3, para. 11 at the end.\n\n³² Cf. e.g. Walter (note 4), Obligations of States; id., (note 4), Cyber Security als Herausforderung, 689.",
    "OBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ORIGIN\n\nhow the world wide web transformed international relations. But does this ‘universal neighbourhood’ really give rise to legal obligations? Even if the UN General Assembly purports to apply the concept of good neighbours to States that are not contiguous,³³ this appears to be much more of a political idea (‘States should act as good neighbours’) than a legal duty: International law does *de lege lata* not contain an obligation of States to be nice, friendly, and considerate toward each other. It does know, however, of specific procedural obligations of States that arise from a certain context of geographic proximity: Thus, the concept of good-neighbourliness is essentially of a territorial nature,³⁴ and it is *this* factor which makes it the source of legal obligations. I find it therefore very difficult to simply apply those obligations to activities in cyberspace only because the latter has made the world a smaller place.\n\nInstead, I suggest to use the concept of due diligence described above as a source for procedural obligations, since, as the ILC put it, “the duty of prevention based on the concept of due diligence is not a one-time effort but requires *continuous* effort”,³⁵ and it requires States not only to set up appropriate control mechanisms in their territory, but also to communicate with other States in case of severe incidents. I think we should think of this obligation as a kind of ‘procedural prolongation’ of the duty to prevent which we have described earlier.\n\nWhat this means in procedural terms, must be established according to the circumstances of every given case. Under customary law, a good case can be made for the duty to inform the States concerned in cases of emergency. Here, the *Corfu Channel* precedent has been taken up by several treaty clauses in environmental law, but also in Articles 6 and 7 International Health Regulations³⁶ which oblige the States parties to notify the World Health Organization within 24 hours “of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory”. I would submit that this rule, albeit contained in a specific treaty regime, might be\n\n³³ GA Res. 46/62 of 9 December 1991, para. 2.\n³⁴ *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 24, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 6 October 2015).\n³⁵ ILC (note 14), Commentary on Art. 12, para. 2.\n³⁶ World Health Organization, International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43883/1/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 6 October 2015).",

As soon as the State of origin discovers that such an activity within its territory proves to be harmful or potentially hazardous for the computer systems in other States, it is under a due diligence obligation to inform those States and consult with them on appropriate measures to contain the damage. This is not so much an analogy to Article 12 ILC Draft Articles on Hazardous Activities,³⁷ since that rule concerns an exchange of information ex ante, before an incident occurs. Instead, the duty to inform in case of a severe security incident strikes me as being simply the procedural element of the general preventive obligation of the State under customary law. As the ICJ held in the Pulp Mills case, co-operation between States is a necessary requirement in order to fulfil the general obligation of prevention,³⁸ and the first step of co-operation is to share any information available with regard to potentially harmful security incidents. Being based on the due diligence obligation, performance of this duty would, however, have to take into account individual rights with regard to the freedom of information and, when it comes to sharing information with other States, with regard to the protection of intellectual property.\n\nObligations of co-operation and mutual assistance for the purpose of criminal proceedings can arise for the State of origin, as for others, only under specific international instruments. An extensive catalogue of such obligations is contained in Chapter III of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. Apart from those, I do not see any indication of customary obligations of States to prosecute or to extradite in cases of cyber security incidents, even when those occurred in their own territory.\n\n## VI.

Still, the Convention does have some impact on our subject: It is so far binding upon 47 States (as of 1 October 2015), among them important States, such as the United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Those States express through the Convention that combating cybercrime and the interference with computer systems is an issue for co-operation between States, and thus something the international community should be concerned about.
