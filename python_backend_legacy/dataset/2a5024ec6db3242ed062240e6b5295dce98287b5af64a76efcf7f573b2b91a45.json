Introduction\n\nWhile there is an increasing consensus that attribution in the cyber context is not entirely impossible,¹ the actual act of attributing cyber operations to a state has remained difficult. Reasons include a lack of sufficient technical capacities within the victim states to attribute the attack, national security interests barring the states from disclosing intelligence on which a potential public attribution would be based, or the reluctance of states to undermine their good relations with alleged wrongful states. To overcome these political challenges, there has recently been an increased interest within academia, civil societies and private companies in the establishment of an independent body supervising the attribution of cyber operations to states.² But also on an inter-state level, states have relatively recently undergone efforts of collective attribution, such as in the case of the NotPetya and WannaCry cyber incidents, and, most recently, the cyber operations against Georgia.³ Collective efforts have the advantage of increasing the credibility of attribution findings, and the attribution claim gains more political weight the more states join in, which in turn might have a beneficial deterrent effect on the\n\n¹ See, *ia* Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (14 September 2018) 2, <www.dni.gov 00ni_a_guide_to_cyber_attribution.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" documents=\"\" cjb:ctiic=\"\" other=\"\" references=\"\" to=\"\" online=\"\" sources=\"\" the=\"\" to=\"\" where:=\"\">; references to online sources are accurate as of 3 July 2020.\n\n² See *ia* Microsoft, ‘An Attribution Organization to Strengthen Trust Online’ (Microsoft Policy Papers, 2017) <www.microsoft.com an-attribution-organization-to-strengthen-trust-online=\"\" en-us=\"\" cybersecurity=\"\" content-hub=\"\">; J S Davis and others, ‘Stateless Attribution: Toward International Accountability in Cyberspace’ (Rand Corporation, 2017) <www.rand.org 2017=\"\" 12=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2018=\"\" j=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" nelson-states=\"\" press=\"\" pubs=\"\" research_reports=\"\" rn2081.html=\"\" www.rand.org=\"\">; S Charncy, ‘Cybersecurity Norms for Nation-States and the Global ICT Industry’ (Microsoft Blog, 23 June 2016) <blogs.microsoft.com 2016=\"\" 06=\"\" 06=\"\" 2018=\"\" cjb:=\"\" cjb:cti-industry=\"\" on-the-issues=\"\" online=\"\" research=\"\" www.artlantic.org=\"\" www.ratlantic.org=\"\"></blogs.microsoft.com></www.rand.org></www.racn-cry></www.racn-cry></www.dni.gov>",

This is perhaps also the reason why organisations such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have lately been working on strengthening their collective capabilities within the cyber realm. But also the United States, with its recently launched ‘Cyber Deterrence Initiative’, is focusing more on mobilising allied states to undertake collective attributions. This paper will thus provide an overview on these already existing developments of a potential international attribution mechanism for cyber operations at the EU and NATO level, as well as touch briefly on measures taken by the US in this context.\n\n## 2. The European Union⁴\n\nThe EU has relatively recently taken up the challenge of building a collective cyber security mechanism across the EU.⁵ It has also realised that it needs to step up its game regarding its attribution capabilities.⁶ A significant milestone was finding consensus on creating a set of measures which the EU and its member states can resort to in the case of a cyber incident threatening the security of the Union. This set of measures was named the ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ (for further details see below) and also addresses the question how the EU attempts to deal with the issue of attributing these cyber incidents to state or non-state actors.⁷ Before addressing these measures, however, it is important to note how the EU defines ‘attribution’.\n\nAccording to an early draft version of the European External Action Service, attribution is defined as ‘the practice of assigning responsibility for malicious cyber activity to a specific actor or sponsor’.⁸ Regarding the fact that no specific reference is made to a state actor, this definition seems to imply that the EU regards ‘attribution’ in a broader sense than it is understood under the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles).⁹ Moreover, the EU is keen to note that attribution is a ‘sovereign political\n\n⁴ When referring to the European Union, reference is made to all main institutions – the European Commission, the Council, the European Council and the European Parliament, either collectively or in their singular capacity, as representing the EU as a whole, unless otherwise stated.\n\n⁵ For example, the EU adopted its first Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013, see European Commission Press Release, ‘EU Cybersecurity Plan to Protect Open Internet and Online Freedom and Opportunity’ (Digital Single Market News, 7 February 2013) <ec.europa.eu en=\"\" digital-single-market=\"\" eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity=\"\" news=\"\">.\n\n⁶ See eg European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, ‘Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council: Increasing Resilience and Bolstering Capabilities to Address Hybrid Threats’ (13 June 2018) JOIN (2018) 16 final, 8.\n\n⁷ See General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Council Conclusions on a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (“Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox”)’ (19 June 2017) Doc 10474/17, <data.consilium.europa.eu dec=\"\" document=\"\" en=\"\" pt=\"\" st-10474-2017-init=\"\">.\n\n⁸ European External Action Service, ‘Implementation of the Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities – Attribution of Malicious Cyber Activities – Discussion of a Revised Text’ (18 March 2019) Doc 6852/1/19 REV 1, 3, <www.statewatch.org 2019=\"\" eu-council-cyber-6852-rev-1-19.pdf=\"\" news=\"\" www.2019=\"\">; note, however, that this draft version is the only available version online.\n\n⁹ UN ILC, ‘Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (2001) GAOR, 53rd Session, Supp No 10; the ILC Articles are widely held to reflect customary international law; note that the EU heavily emphasises, in most of its documents regarding cyber security, that ‘existing international law is applicable to cyberspace’ (see for example Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler!

This is reflected in the recent establishment of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and the EU cyber sanctions regime. Both will be discussed in the following sub-chapters.\n\n## 2.1. The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\n\nThe EU has adopted the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox in June 2017.¹¹ The Toolbox describes a set of measures with which the EU can respond to so-called ‘malicious’ cyber activities¹² under its Common Foreign and Security Policy. To be specific, the Council of the European Union¹³ decides which measures to take, based on a proposal by a Member State or the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Measures that can be taken include démarches (i.e. diplomatic visits, usually to a state representative in charge of the dossier), public statements condemning the cyber activity, confidence-building measures, political dialogues or even restrictive measures (these will be addressed in a separate point below).¹⁴\n\nThe Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (hereinafter: Draft Implementing Guidelines) note that in order to resort to some, but not all, measures, prior attribution of a cyber activity is required.¹⁵ They also seem to distinguish between measures that require firm attribution and those that do not (eg when contacting states whose territory may have been used to conduct a ‘malicious cyber activity’).¹⁶ What level of proof is required for a firm attribution and for any other attribution is not specified in the available documents. An earlier draft version of an EU paper on attribution contained a so-called ‘uncertainty yardstick’, developed by the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN), the intelligence body of the European External Action Service (EEAS)¹⁷,\n\n¹⁰ General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities’ (9 October 2017) Doc 13007/17, 13, <https: en=\"\" document=\"\" document?st-13007-2017-init=\"\" data.consilium.europa.eu=\"\" en=\"\" pdf=\"\">; the draft version is the only version available online; cf also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler!

[...] The benefit of such signalling is that it can generally be done without requiring firm attribution’ [emphasis added].\n\n¹⁷ The EEAS serves as a diplomatic body of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and exercises foreign ministry and defense ministry functions for the EU; the EU INTCEN is tasked with providing intelligence analyses to EU decision-making bodies, which are based on information voluntarily provided by the EU member states.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</https:>",

This yardstick, however, was removed in a later draft version.¹⁸\n\nIt is important to note that, despite the involvement of European cyber institutions to help in the process of attribution, the power to decide to attribute remains within the hands of the member states: The Council notes that the EU INTCEN, along with other competent European ‘cyber institutions’ (such as the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) network established under Article 12 of the EU Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)¹⁹, the European Cybercrime Centre, European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) or the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions (CERT-EU)), ‘plays a valuable role [...] by sharing its analyses and information related to the origin of the malicious cyber activity’.²⁰ Thus, institutions such as INTCEN are there to facilitate rather than make the decision to attribute a certain activity to a specific actor. This may entail collecting and assessing information received by member states, third states or collected on its own, followed by an analysis of the received and/or collected information. This analysis may, for example, contain a conclusion that the cyber activity, based on the available information, is with a high likelihood attributable to state X or Y. Member states may then assess this information based on their ‘sovereign prerogative’ of attribution and decide whether they agree with the analysis or not.\n\nWhether member states will have access to the information upon which INTCEN and others created their conclusions is not clear. Especially when it comes to classified information, it is highly unlikely that the information received by one member state or a third party can be shared with the rest of the member states. In this case, member states are supposed to decide whether they follow the conclusions made by these bodies without having access to the underlying information. This decision to attribute has to be taken unanimously by all member states, if taken by the EU as a whole.²¹\n\nAn additional issue is that, according to the Implementing Guidelines ‘Member States are not obliged to provide information or analysis when it [sic] considers this as contrary to the essential interests of its [sic] national security.’²² As the necessary information will usually be linked to essential interests of a state’s national security, it might be difficult to receive valuable information at all.\n\nIt is also not clear what level of proof the EU regards as having to be met in order to attribute successfully. As already mentioned above, there seems to have been a discussion about\n\n¹⁸ Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 10.\n¹⁹ Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 Concerning Measures for a High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Across the Union, OJ L194/1; the NIS Directive is the first EU legislation addressing cybersecurity, and seeks to improve and harmonise the level of cybersecurity within the EU.\n²⁰ Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 13.\n²¹ Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 2.\n²² Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 11.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297",

This proposal has, however, been dropped. There is no official statement so far by the EU on this matter.\n\nTo conclude, despite having INTCEN and others undertake an analysis on attribution, the responsibility to attribute remains with the member states. This means that building trust between member states is crucial. In this respect, at least having a framework to task impartial bodies with the analysis might facilitate building trust and eventually, better intelligence-sharing between member states. This impartial body, however, still relies on information provided by member states.\n\n## 2.2. Cyber Sanctions Regime:²³\n\nOn 17 May 2019, Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 and Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against ‘cyber attacks’ threatening the EU or its member states have entered into force.²⁴ The Decision, which initially applied until 18 May 2020,²⁵ was amended on 14 May 2020 to apply until 18 May 2021.²⁶ The Decision and the Regulation form the basis of the new ‘cyber sanctions regime’ adopted by the EU. They impose entry restrictions on, and the freezing of funds of, persons that are responsible for ‘cyber attacks’²⁷ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, persons who provide financial, technical or material support for or are otherwise involved in ‘cyber attacks’ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, or others associated with these persons.²⁸\n\nFor that purpose, and in line with the procedure in other sanctions regimes, an Annex to the Decision and Regulation shall contain a list of these ‘persons, entities and bodies’ whose funds shall be frozen and who shall be denied entry into the EU’s member states.²⁹ These may be added by the Council, acting in unanimity ‘upon a proposal from a member state or from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy’.³⁰ This means that all member states will have to agree on adding certain actors to this list, but can also veto any proposal made by a member state or the High Representative. Importantly, these listings can be challenged by the listed person or entity before the General Court of the European Union, in accordance with Articles 275(2) and 263(4) and (6) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the\n\n²³ The EU’s cyber sanctions regime will only be analysed with regard to its relationship with ‘attribution’.

Most recently, however, Germany has announced that it will propose listing certain Russian individuals involved in a large-scale hack against the German Bundestag in 2015.³³ Importantly, one of the individuals was most certainly working for the Russian GRU at the time of the event.³⁴ At the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether Germany will be successful with its proposal.\n\nRecital 9 of the Council Decision notes that ‘[t]argeted restrictive measures should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyber-attacks to a third State. The application of targeted restrictive measures does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken on a case-by-case basis. Every Member State is free to make its own determination with respect to the attribution of cyber-attacks to a third State.’\n\nIn this context, it may be noted that there is no reference in the EU legal texts that the cyber sanctions regime is only restricted to sanctioning non-state actors who have no affiliation to a state. To the contrary, it seems to have been in the EU’s interests to also be able to impose sanctions on state actors, as the Implementing Guidelines note that restrictive measures could also be used ‘[i]n the case where the malicious cyber activity is being carried out by a State, as well as in the case when a State is deemed responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that is acting under its direction or control, or if this State recognizes and adopts the behaviour of such a non-state actor as its own’.³⁵ Here, reference is clearly made to the rules of attribution enshrined in the ILC Articles and, to some extent, the language of Articles 8 and 11 ILC Articles is used.³⁶\n\nFor a state to be held responsible under international law, the act must be attributable to the state and constitute ‘a breach of an international obligation of the state.’³⁷ Thus, attribution of an act to a state alone does not lead to any consequences under the law of state responsibility. Politically, however, it is questionable how listing state-affiliated actors in the Annex – a decision taken by all EU member states in their sovereign capacity – can be done without undertaking a collective attribution through the EU.

One might assume that the EU is reluctant, from a foreign policy perspective, to condemn an entire state for committing a ‘malicious’ cyber activity. By listing only individuals and entities instead, attribution can be avoided and (hopefully) good relations with the affiliated state can be maintained. This cautious (and inconsistent) approach indicates the EU’s reluctance to undergo collective attribution efforts.\n\nRegarding evidentiary standards necessary for listing: According to the EU’s Sanctions Guidelines, listing proposals must contain ‘accurate, up-to-date and defendable statements of reasons’.³⁹ The reasons for listings should moreover be ‘capable of being made public’.⁴⁰ However, ‘[i]n exceptional cases, where it is considered that the reasons for the listing are not suitable for publication, because of considerations of privacy and security, the reasons will need to be addressed separately to the person, group or entity concerned.’⁴¹ In any case, the evidence must be sufficient to withstand examination by the European Court of Justice.⁴²\n\nWhether listing certain actors under the Annex is defined as attribution or not, the EU’s cyber sanctions regime may, on the one hand, facilitate cooperative efforts to avoid impunity for ‘malicious’ cyber acts and, on the other hand, provide helpful indications what evidence states may find sufficient enough in order to publicly condemn a ‘malicious’ behaviour in cyberspace. Of course, this will only become possible as soon as someone will actually be listed in the Annex. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether clear conclusions may be drawn therefrom. As listing actors in the Annex needs to follow a unanimous decision, it is highly likely that the EU will only enforce measures against actors whose listings are not too harmful for the EU member states’ political interests.\n\n# 3. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\nSimilar to the EU, NATO is a consensus-based alliance, which means that any decision taken by NATO is agreed unanimously by all its member states.⁴³ Within this mechanism, NATO agreed in 2016 that cyberspace is a ‘domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself\n\n³⁸ cf Article 4 ILC Articles (n 9).\n\n³⁹ Sanctions Guidelines – Update (n 31) para 17.\n\n⁴⁰ Ibid, Annex I, para 10.\n\n⁴¹ Ibid.\n\n⁴² cf European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Mellat v Council of the European Union (29 January 2013) Case T-496/10, para 77; European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Saderat Iran v Council of the European Union (5 February 2013) Case T-494/10, para 73.\n\n⁴³ NATO’s practice of consensus-based decision-making has been applied since its founding, despite a lack of any specific provision in the founding documents requiring NATO member states to do so; for further details see T Gill and others (eds), Leuven Manual on the International Law Applicable to Peace Operations (Cambridge University Press 2017) 68f.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297",

The process of consultation includes exchanging information and opinions,⁴⁸ and might also be used to discuss the attribution of the act to a state prior to launching a collaborative NATO operation. Article 4 thus likewise enables the sharing of intelligence especially in the context of cyber attribution.⁴⁹ At least once, NATO has arguably already joined a collective attribution initiated by the Dutch and British governments in the cyber context, condemning the Russian hacking activities against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018.⁵⁰ There is, however, no public information available whether NATO resorted to Article 4 in this context, nor whether it considered adhering to any evidentiary standards for attributing the act to Russia.\n\nThe consultation process can, in some circumstances, lead to a joint decision or action,⁵¹ which may include condemning acts of the wrongful state (after having attributed the activity successfully). It is clear, however, that this would have to happen in consensus with all NATO allies, which could require that – especially in the context of attribution – all NATO members are equally equipped with the necessary information and capacities to make a profound decision.

According to the NATO website, ‘almost all Allies have upgraded their cyber defences’ since adopting the Pledge.52 Measures such as these further facilitate intelligence-sharing between states, as states with a higher level of security will trust other ‘more cyber capable Allies’ more than those with less secure cyber defense mechanisms.53\n\nNATO is also cooperating with regional organisations, such as the EU, on questions regarding better intelligence-sharing to counter cyber threats. In a Joint Declaration in 2016, the EU and NATO noted the ‘urgent need to: Boost [the EU’s and NATO’s] ability to counter hybrid threats, including by bolstering resilience, working together on analysis, prevention, and early detection, through timely information sharing and, to the extent possible, intelligence sharing between staffs; and cooperating on strategic communication and response.’54 Also, amongst other initiatives, the EU Computer Emergency Response Team and the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability have concluded a ‘Technical Arrangement on Cyber Defence’ in 2016, providing a framework where both sides can better exchange information and share best practices on cyber defence.55\n\nIn sum, NATO has realised that there is a need to increase its capacities to become an effective platform of assistance and cooperation for its members to counter cyber threats (which also includes attribution). Measures such as the Cyber Defense Pledge or cooperation agreements with other organisations seem to help with capacity-building and better cooperation. However, it is evident that an institutionalised system comparable to the EU’s ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ does not exist.\n\n## 4.

The United States will work with like-minded states to coordinate and support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken, and joint imposition of consequences against malign actors’.⁵⁹\n\nConcerning evidentiary standards, the Cyber Strategy itself does not reveal much. However, in a paper titled ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence explains different levels of confidence (high, moderate and low) which analysts adhere to when assessing the available evidence.⁶⁰ High confidence exists when responsibility of a certain actor can be proven ‘beyond reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative’.⁶¹ Moderate confidence is given when the evidence is clear and convincing, and low confidence is given when ‘more than half of the body of evidence points to one thing, but there are significant information gaps’.⁶² Still, the paper does not explicitly elaborate upon which level of confidence suffices in order to conduct an attribution. In case of high confidence, it will, however, most certainly be possible to undertake an attribution.\n\nIn order to bring more states on board for a collective attribution, states will have to be on similar levels regarding their capacities to attribute. Hence, similar to NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Strategy aims at building ‘international cyber capacity’ that ‘will empower international partners to implement policies and practices which allow them to be effective partners in the United States-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative’.⁶³ Further details on how capacity-building will be achieved are also not publicly available.\n\nHowever, unlike mechanisms within NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative seems to allow more flexible alliances, which can differ depending on the activity to be attributed.

Regardless, there is no public information available whether this Initiative has ever been put to actual use.\n\n# 5. Conclusion\n\nTo summarise, there is potential within the EU's Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and its newly adopted sanctions regime, NATO's alliance and the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative, to tackle the 'attribution problem'. These collective mechanisms might help release the burden of attribution by one state and increase the political pressure on the alleged wrongful state, which might even perhaps deter future 'malicious' cyber incidents. However, the biggest issue for collective attribution seems to be a lack of trust between states, which, in turn, hinders them to take collective action. Without having the possibility to assess the evidence regarding attribution by other states themselves and the fact that states usually underline that there is no international obligation to share evidence,[65] states will most likely be reluctant to support attribution claims. Closely interlinked with this is the question whether common evidentiary standards might be helpful to solve this problem. In any event, states will tend to refuse to attribute if doing so could potentially harm their international relations with the alleged wrongful state. The lack of technical expertise and insecure cyber defence systems within some states compared to other technologically well-equipped states does not help with building trust either. Hence why capacity-building is crucial, also for a collective attribution effort. To conclude, although there seems to be potential within the above-mentioned mechanisms, it is questionable whether states will make use of them or remain fairly reluctant to attribute.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297",

Introduction\nWhile there is an increasing consensus that attribution in the cyber context is not entirely impossible,¹ the actual act of attributing cyber operations to a state has remained difficult. Reasons include a lack of sufficient technical capacities within the victim states to attribute the attack, national security interests barring the states from disclosing intelligence on which a potential public attribution would be based, or the reluctance of states to undermine their good relations with alleged wrongful states. To overcome these political challenges, there has recently been an increased interest within academia, civil societies and private companies in the establishment of an independent body supervising the attribution of cyber operations to states.² But also on an inter-state level, states have relatively recently undergone efforts of collective attribution, such as in the case of the NotPetya and WannaCry cyber incidents, and, most recently, the cyber operations against Georgia.³ Collective efforts have the advantage of increasing the credibility of attribution findings, and the attribution claim gains more political weight the more states join in, which in turn might have a beneficial deterrent effect on the\n¹ See, *ia* Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (14 September 2018) 2, <www.dni.gov 00ni_a_guide_to_cyber_attribution.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" documents=\"\" cjb:ctiic=\"\" other=\"\" references=\"\" to=\"\" online=\"\" sources=\"\" the=\"\" to=\"\" where:=\"\">; references to online sources are accurate as of 3 July 2020.\n² See *ia* Microsoft, ‘An Attribution Organization to Strengthen Trust Online’ (Microsoft Policy Papers, 2017) <www.microsoft.com an-attribution-organization-to-strengthen-trust-online=\"\" en-us=\"\" cybersecurity=\"\" content-hub=\"\">; J S Davis and others, ‘Stateless Attribution: Toward International Accountability in Cyberspace’ (Rand Corporation, 2017) <www.rand.org 2017=\"\" 12=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2018=\"\" j=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" nelson-states=\"\" press=\"\" pubs=\"\" research_reports=\"\" rn2081.html=\"\" www.rand.org=\"\">; S Charncy, ‘Cybersecurity Norms for Nation-States and the Global ICT Industry’ (Microsoft Blog, 23 June 2016) <blogs.microsoft.com 2016=\"\" 06=\"\" 06=\"\" 2018=\"\" cjb:=\"\" cjb:cti-industry=\"\" on-the-issues=\"\" online=\"\" research=\"\" www.artlantic.org=\"\" www.ratlantic.org=\"\"></blogs.microsoft.com></www.rand.org></www.racn-cry></www.racn-cry></www.dni.gov>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nwrongful state(s). This is perhaps also the reason why organisations such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have lately been working on strengthening their collective capabilities within the cyber realm. But also the United States, with its recently launched ‘Cyber Deterrence Initiative’, is focusing more on mobilising allied states to undertake collective attributions. This paper will thus provide an overview on these already existing developments of a potential international attribution mechanism for cyber operations at the EU and NATO level, as well as touch briefly on measures taken by the US in this context.\n## 2. The European Union⁴\nThe EU has relatively recently taken up the challenge of building a collective cyber security mechanism across the EU.⁵ It has also realised that it needs to step up its game regarding its attribution capabilities.⁶ A significant milestone was finding consensus on creating a set of measures which the EU and its member states can resort to in the case of a cyber incident threatening the security of the Union. This set of measures was named the ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ (for further details see below) and also addresses the question how the EU attempts to deal with the issue of attributing these cyber incidents to state or non-state actors.⁷ Before addressing these measures, however, it is important to note how the EU defines ‘attribution’.\nAccording to an early draft version of the European External Action Service, attribution is defined as ‘the practice of assigning responsibility for malicious cyber activity to a specific actor or sponsor’.⁸ Regarding the fact that no specific reference is made to a state actor, this definition seems to imply that the EU regards ‘attribution’ in a broader sense than it is understood under the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles).⁹ Moreover, the EU is keen to note that attribution is a ‘sovereign political\n⁴ When referring to the European Union, reference is made to all main institutions – the European Commission, the Council, the European Council and the European Parliament, either collectively or in their singular capacity, as representing the EU as a whole, unless otherwise stated.\n⁵ For example, the EU adopted its first Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013, see European Commission Press Release, ‘EU Cybersecurity Plan to Protect Open Internet and Online Freedom and Opportunity’ (Digital Single Market News, 7 February 2013) <ec.europa.eu en=\"\" digital-single-market=\"\" eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity=\"\" news=\"\">.\n⁶ See eg European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, ‘Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council: Increasing Resilience and Bolstering Capabilities to Address Hybrid Threats’ (13 June 2018) JOIN (2018) 16 final, 8.\n⁷ See General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Council Conclusions on a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (“Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox”)’ (19 June 2017) Doc 10474/17, <data.consilium.europa.eu dec=\"\" document=\"\" en=\"\" pt=\"\" st-10474-2017-init=\"\">.\n⁸ European External Action Service, ‘Implementation of the Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities – Attribution of Malicious Cyber Activities – Discussion of a Revised Text’ (18 March 2019) Doc 6852/1/19 REV 1, 3, <www.statewatch.org 2019=\"\" eu-council-cyber-6852-rev-1-19.pdf=\"\" news=\"\" www.2019=\"\">; note, however, that this draft version is the only available version online.\n⁹ UN ILC, ‘Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (2001) GAOR, 53rd Session, Supp No 10; the ILC Articles are widely held to reflect customary international law; note that the EU heavily emphasises, in most of its documents regarding cyber security, that ‘existing international law is applicable to cyberspace’ (see for example Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler!

This is reflected in the recent establishment of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and the EU cyber sanctions regime. Both will be discussed in the following sub-chapters.\n## 2.1. The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\nThe EU has adopted the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox in June 2017.¹¹ The Toolbox describes a set of measures with which the EU can respond to so-called ‘malicious’ cyber activities¹² under its Common Foreign and Security Policy. To be specific, the Council of the European Union¹³ decides which measures to take, based on a proposal by a Member State or the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Measures that can be taken include démarches (i.e. diplomatic visits, usually to a state representative in charge of the dossier), public statements condemning the cyber activity, confidence-building measures, political dialogues or even restrictive measures (these will be addressed in a separate point below).¹⁴\nThe Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (hereinafter: Draft Implementing Guidelines) note that in order to resort to some, but not all, measures, prior attribution of a cyber activity is required.¹⁵ They also seem to distinguish between measures that require firm attribution and those that do not (eg when contacting states whose territory may have been used to conduct a ‘malicious cyber activity’).¹⁶ What level of proof is required for a firm attribution and for any other attribution is not specified in the available documents. An earlier draft version of an EU paper on attribution contained a so-called ‘uncertainty yardstick’, developed by the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN), the intelligence body of the European External Action Service (EEAS)¹⁷,\n¹⁰ General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities’ (9 October 2017) Doc 13007/17, 13, <https: en=\"\" document=\"\" document?st-13007-2017-init=\"\" data.consilium.europa.eu=\"\" en=\"\" pdf=\"\">; the draft version is the only version available online; cf also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.) 4.\n¹¹ See Council of the EU Press Release, ‘Cyber Attacks: EU Ready to Respond with a Range of Measures, Including Sanctions’ (19 June 2017) <www.consilium.europa.eu en=\"\" press=\"\" press-releases=\"\" 06=\"\" 19=\"\" 2017=\"\" cyber-diplomacy-toolbox=\"\"></www.consilium.europa.eu>; see also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.).\n¹² The Council noted specifically that malicious cyber activities ‘may constitute wrongful acts under international law and could give rise to a joint EU response’, see EU Press Release (n 11).\n¹³ The Council consists of the respective ministers of each EU member state and is, next to the European Parliament and the European Commission, one of the three legislative bodies of the European Union.\n¹⁴ See Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 6ff.\n¹⁵ Ibid, 14; see also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.) 4.\n¹⁶ See Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 8: ‘When one or more Member States are impacted by a malicious cyber activity, it could be beneficial to jointly contact States exercising jurisdiction over these territories that have been used for conducting the malicious activity. [...] The benefit of such signalling is that it can generally be done without requiring firm attribution’ [emphasis added].\n¹⁷ The EEAS serves as a diplomatic body of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and exercises foreign ministry and defense ministry functions for the EU; the EU INTCEN is tasked with providing intelligence analyses to EU decision-making bodies, which are based on information voluntarily provided by the EU member states.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</https:>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nwhich divided the range of probabilities of an attribution into percentages from 0-5% (remote chance) to 95-100% (almost certain). This yardstick, however, was removed in a later draft version.¹⁸\nIt is important to note that, despite the involvement of European cyber institutions to help in the process of attribution, the power to decide to attribute remains within the hands of the member states: The Council notes that the EU INTCEN, along with other competent European ‘cyber institutions’ (such as the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) network established under Article 12 of the EU Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)¹⁹, the European Cybercrime Centre, European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) or the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions (CERT-EU)), ‘plays a valuable role [...] by sharing its analyses and information related to the origin of the malicious cyber activity’.²⁰ Thus, institutions such as INTCEN are there to facilitate rather than make the decision to attribute a certain activity to a specific actor. This may entail collecting and assessing information received by member states, third states or collected on its own, followed by an analysis of the received and/or collected information. This analysis may, for example, contain a conclusion that the cyber activity, based on the available information, is with a high likelihood attributable to state X or Y. Member states may then assess this information based on their ‘sovereign prerogative’ of attribution and decide whether they agree with the analysis or not.\nWhether member states will have access to the information upon which INTCEN and others created their conclusions is not clear. Especially when it comes to classified information, it is highly unlikely that the information received by one member state or a third party can be shared with the rest of the member states. In this case, member states are supposed to decide whether they follow the conclusions made by these bodies without having access to the underlying information. This decision to attribute has to be taken unanimously by all member states, if taken by the EU as a whole.²¹\nAn additional issue is that, according to the Implementing Guidelines ‘Member States are not obliged to provide information or analysis when it [sic] considers this as contrary to the essential interests of its [sic] national security.’²² As the necessary information will usually be linked to essential interests of a state’s national security, it might be difficult to receive valuable information at all.\nIt is also not clear what level of proof the EU regards as having to be met in order to attribute successfully. As already mentioned above, there seems to have been a discussion about\n¹⁸ Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 10.\n¹⁹ Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 Concerning Measures for a High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Across the Union, OJ L194/1; the NIS Directive is the first EU legislation addressing cybersecurity, and seeks to improve and harmonise the level of cybersecurity within the EU.\n²⁰ Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 13.\n²¹ Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 2.\n²² Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 11.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\ncategorising evidence into ranges of probability. This proposal has, however, been dropped. There is no official statement so far by the EU on this matter.\nTo conclude, despite having INTCEN and others undertake an analysis on attribution, the responsibility to attribute remains with the member states. This means that building trust between member states is crucial. In this respect, at least having a framework to task impartial bodies with the analysis might facilitate building trust and eventually, better intelligence-sharing between member states. This impartial body, however, still relies on information provided by member states.\n## 2.2. Cyber Sanctions Regime:²³\nOn 17 May 2019, Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 and Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against ‘cyber attacks’ threatening the EU or its member states have entered into force.²⁴ The Decision, which initially applied until 18 May 2020,²⁵ was amended on 14 May 2020 to apply until 18 May 2021.²⁶ The Decision and the Regulation form the basis of the new ‘cyber sanctions regime’ adopted by the EU. They impose entry restrictions on, and the freezing of funds of, persons that are responsible for ‘cyber attacks’²⁷ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, persons who provide financial, technical or material support for or are otherwise involved in ‘cyber attacks’ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, or others associated with these persons.²⁸\nFor that purpose, and in line with the procedure in other sanctions regimes, an Annex to the Decision and Regulation shall contain a list of these ‘persons, entities and bodies’ whose funds shall be frozen and who shall be denied entry into the EU’s member states.²⁹ These may be added by the Council, acting in unanimity ‘upon a proposal from a member state or from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy’.³⁰ This means that all member states will have to agree on adding certain actors to this list, but can also veto any proposal made by a member state or the High Representative. Importantly, these listings can be challenged by the listed person or entity before the General Court of the European Union, in accordance with Articles 275(2) and 263(4) and (6) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the\n²³ The EU’s cyber sanctions regime will only be analysed with regard to its relationship with ‘attribution’. Whether or not these sanctions are in conformity with international law will not be addressed in this paper.\n²⁴ Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 of 17 May 2019 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States [2019] OJ L 129I/13; Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 of 17 May 2019 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States [2019] OJ LI 129/1.\n²⁵ See Article 10 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n²⁶ Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/651 of 14 May 2020 Amending Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States; Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 (n 24) remains in force unamended.\n²⁷ ‘Cyber attacks’ are defined as ‘actions involving any of the following: (a) access to information systems; (b) information system interference; (c) data interference; or (d) data interception, where such actions are not duly authorised by the owner or by another right holder of the system or data or part of it, or are not permitted under the law of the Union or of the Member State concerned’; see Article 1 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n²⁸ See Articles 4 and 5 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n²⁹ See Article 4(1) CD 2019/797 (n 24), and Article 3 CR (n 24).\n³⁰ See Article 6 CD 2019/797 (n 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nEuropean Union.³¹ Also, the list in the Annex ‘shall be reviewed at regular intervals and at least every 12 months’.³² Currently, the Annex does not contain any persons, entities or bodies. Most recently, however, Germany has announced that it will propose listing certain Russian individuals involved in a large-scale hack against the German Bundestag in 2015.³³ Importantly, one of the individuals was most certainly working for the Russian GRU at the time of the event.³⁴ At the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether Germany will be successful with its proposal.\nRecital 9 of the Council Decision notes that ‘[t]argeted restrictive measures should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyber-attacks to a third State. The application of targeted restrictive measures does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken on a case-by-case basis. Every Member State is free to make its own determination with respect to the attribution of cyber-attacks to a third State.’\nIn this context, it may be noted that there is no reference in the EU legal texts that the cyber sanctions regime is only restricted to sanctioning non-state actors who have no affiliation to a state. To the contrary, it seems to have been in the EU’s interests to also be able to impose sanctions on state actors, as the Implementing Guidelines note that restrictive measures could also be used ‘[i]n the case where the malicious cyber activity is being carried out by a State, as well as in the case when a State is deemed responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that is acting under its direction or control, or if this State recognizes and adopts the behaviour of such a non-state actor as its own’.³⁵ Here, reference is clearly made to the rules of attribution enshrined in the ILC Articles and, to some extent, the language of Articles 8 and 11 ILC Articles is used.³⁶\nFor a state to be held responsible under international law, the act must be attributable to the state and constitute ‘a breach of an international obligation of the state.’³⁷ Thus, attribution of an act to a state alone does not lead to any consequences under the law of state responsibility. Politically, however, it is questionable how listing state-affiliated actors in the Annex – a decision taken by all EU member states in their sovereign capacity – can be done without undertaking a collective attribution through the EU. For example, if the EU decided to list the Russian individual allegedly working for the GRU and involved in the German Bundestag hack\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\n³¹ Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union [2012] OJ C326/47; cf General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Sanctions Guidelines – Update’ (4 May 2018) Doc 5664/18, 56.\n³² See Article 13(4) CR 2019/796 (n 24).\n³³ German Federal Foreign Office, ‘Federal Foreign Office on the Hacker Attack on the German Bundestag’ (Press Release, 28 May 2020) <www.auswaertiges-amt.de en=\"\" hacker-attack-bundestag=\"\" newsroom=\"\" newss=\"\" 2345580=\"\">.\n³⁴ Ibid.\n³⁵ Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 5.\n³⁶ Article 8 ILC Articles (n 9) stipulates that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.’; Article 11 stipulates that ‘[c]onduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.’\n³⁷ Article 2 ILC Articles (n 9).</www.auswaertiges-amt.de>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\n- something the EU cyber sanctions regime enables the member states to do – the EU would officially condemn the actions of a Russian state organ.³⁸\nSecond, if all EU member states have to unanimously decide who will be added to this list, this act of collective attribution remains in their responsibility. One might assume that the EU is reluctant, from a foreign policy perspective, to condemn an entire state for committing a ‘malicious’ cyber activity. By listing only individuals and entities instead, attribution can be avoided and (hopefully) good relations with the affiliated state can be maintained. This cautious (and inconsistent) approach indicates the EU’s reluctance to undergo collective attribution efforts.\nRegarding evidentiary standards necessary for listing: According to the EU’s Sanctions Guidelines, listing proposals must contain ‘accurate, up-to-date and defendable statements of reasons’.³⁹ The reasons for listings should moreover be ‘capable of being made public’.⁴⁰ However, ‘[i]n exceptional cases, where it is considered that the reasons for the listing are not suitable for publication, because of considerations of privacy and security, the reasons will need to be addressed separately to the person, group or entity concerned.’⁴¹ In any case, the evidence must be sufficient to withstand examination by the European Court of Justice.⁴²\nWhether listing certain actors under the Annex is defined as attribution or not, the EU’s cyber sanctions regime may, on the one hand, facilitate cooperative efforts to avoid impunity for ‘malicious’ cyber acts and, on the other hand, provide helpful indications what evidence states may find sufficient enough in order to publicly condemn a ‘malicious’ behaviour in cyberspace. Of course, this will only become possible as soon as someone will actually be listed in the Annex. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether clear conclusions may be drawn therefrom. As listing actors in the Annex needs to follow a unanimous decision, it is highly likely that the EU will only enforce measures against actors whose listings are not too harmful for the EU member states’ political interests.\n# 3. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nSimilar to the EU, NATO is a consensus-based alliance, which means that any decision taken by NATO is agreed unanimously by all its member states.⁴³ Within this mechanism, NATO agreed in 2016 that cyberspace is a ‘domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself\n³⁸ cf Article 4 ILC Articles (n 9).\n³⁹ Sanctions Guidelines – Update (n 31) para 17.\n⁴⁰ Ibid, Annex I, para 10.\n⁴¹ Ibid.\n⁴² cf European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Mellat v Council of the European Union (29 January 2013) Case T-496/10, para 77; European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Saderat Iran v Council of the European Union (5 February 2013) Case T-494/10, para 73.\n⁴³ NATO’s practice of consensus-based decision-making has been applied since its founding, despite a lack of any specific provision in the founding documents requiring NATO member states to do so; for further details see T Gill and others (eds), Leuven Manual on the International Law Applicable to Peace Operations (Cambridge University Press 2017) 68f.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nas effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea’.⁴⁴ Two years previously, NATO allies agreed that an ‘armed attack’ as referred to in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty may also be applicable to a cyber attack, as long as the cyber attack reaches the severity of an ‘armed attack’.⁴⁵ According to Article 5, this would mean that such a cyber attack against one NATO member constitutes an attack against all NATO members, triggering their obligation to assist the harmed state in taking defensive measures to ‘restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.’⁴⁶ In order to take action, however, knowing who to defend against is crucial.\nIn cases of cyber operations below the threshold of an armed attack, Article 4 of the Washington Treaty calls on the NATO members to ‘consult together’ if the ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’.⁴⁷ Here as well, attribution is important. The process of consultation includes exchanging information and opinions,⁴⁸ and might also be used to discuss the attribution of the act to a state prior to launching a collaborative NATO operation. Article 4 thus likewise enables the sharing of intelligence especially in the context of cyber attribution.⁴⁹ At least once, NATO has arguably already joined a collective attribution initiated by the Dutch and British governments in the cyber context, condemning the Russian hacking activities against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018.⁵⁰ There is, however, no public information available whether NATO resorted to Article 4 in this context, nor whether it considered adhering to any evidentiary standards for attributing the act to Russia.\nThe consultation process can, in some circumstances, lead to a joint decision or action,⁵¹ which may include condemning acts of the wrongful state (after having attributed the activity successfully). It is clear, however, that this would have to happen in consensus with all NATO allies, which could require that – especially in the context of attribution – all NATO members are equally equipped with the necessary information and capacities to make a profound decision. To build this community of trust where NATO members can share information\n⁴⁴ NATO Press Release, ‘Warsaw Summit Communiqué’ (9 July 2016) para 70, <www.nato.int cps=\"\" on=\"\" official_texts_133169.htm=\"\" natohq=\"\">.\n⁴⁵ See NATO Press Release, ‘Wales Summit Declaration’ (5 September 2014) para 72, <www.nato.int cps=\"\" on=\"\" official_texts_112964.htm=\"\" natohq=\"\">; see also NATO Review Magazine, ‘NATO’s Role in Cyberspace’ (February 2019) <www.nato.int 2019=\"\" also-in-2019=\"\" natos-role-in-cyberspace-alliance-defence=\"\" den=\"\" index.htm=\"\" docu=\"\" review=\"\">; C Porter and K Jordan, ‘Don’t Let Cyber Attribution Debates Tear Apart the NATO Alliance’ (Lawfare Blog, 14 February 2019) <www.lawfareblog.com dont-let-cyber-attribution-debates-tear-apart-nato-alliance=\"\">; NATO has so far not specified what level of severity would be needed for an armed attack in the cyber context.

According to the NATO website, ‘almost all Allies have upgraded their cyber defences’ since adopting the Pledge.52 Measures such as these further facilitate intelligence-sharing between states, as states with a higher level of security will trust other ‘more cyber capable Allies’ more than those with less secure cyber defense mechanisms.53\nNATO is also cooperating with regional organisations, such as the EU, on questions regarding better intelligence-sharing to counter cyber threats. In a Joint Declaration in 2016, the EU and NATO noted the ‘urgent need to: Boost [the EU’s and NATO’s] ability to counter hybrid threats, including by bolstering resilience, working together on analysis, prevention, and early detection, through timely information sharing and, to the extent possible, intelligence sharing between staffs; and cooperating on strategic communication and response.’54 Also, amongst other initiatives, the EU Computer Emergency Response Team and the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability have concluded a ‘Technical Arrangement on Cyber Defence’ in 2016, providing a framework where both sides can better exchange information and share best practices on cyber defence.55\nIn sum, NATO has realised that there is a need to increase its capacities to become an effective platform of assistance and cooperation for its members to counter cyber threats (which also includes attribution). Measures such as the Cyber Defense Pledge or cooperation agreements with other organisations seem to help with capacity-building and better cooperation. However, it is evident that an institutionalised system comparable to the EU’s ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ does not exist.\n## 4. The US Cyber Deterrence Initiative\nThe concept of the so-called US Cyber Deterrence Initiative first appeared in the US National Cyber Strategy of September 2018.56 It is part of the US National Cyber Strategy’s Third Pillar (‘Preserve Peace Through Strength’) and entails the coordination with and support of like-minded states in combatting ‘malicious cyber behaviour’.57 This also includes, amongst others, supporting each other’s attribution claims, which – according to Robert Strayer, Deputy\n52 NATO Website, ‘Cyber Defense’ (16 July 2018) <www.nato.int en=\"\" cps=\"\" natohq=\"\" topics_78170.htm=\"\">.\n53 cf J Shea ‘How is NATO Meeting the Challenge of Cyberspace?’, Prism 7, No 2 (21 December 2017) 22-23.\n54 NATO Press Release, ‘Joint Declaration by the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission, and the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’ (8 July 2016) <www.nato.int cps=\"\" en=\"\" natohq=\"\" official_texts_133163.htm=\"\">.\n55 NATO Website, ‘NATO and the European Union Enhance Cyber Defence Cooperation’ (10 February 2016) <www.nato.int en=\"\" cps=\"\" natohq=\"\" news_127836.htm=\"\">.\n56 See The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (September 2018) 21, <www.whitehouse.gov 2018=\"\" 09=\"\" national-cyber-strategy.pdf=\"\" wp-content=\"\" uploads=\"\">.\n57 Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.whitehouse.gov></www.nato.int></www.nato.int>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nAssistant Secretary of State for cyber and international communications and information policy – is the second of the Initiative’s four elements.⁵⁸\nThe US Cyber Strategy describes methods of collective attribution as follows:\n‘Objective and actionable intelligence will be shared across the United States Government and with key partners to identify hostile foreign nation states [...]. The United States will work with like-minded states to coordinate and support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken, and joint imposition of consequences against malign actors’.⁵⁹\nConcerning evidentiary standards, the Cyber Strategy itself does not reveal much. However, in a paper titled ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence explains different levels of confidence (high, moderate and low) which analysts adhere to when assessing the available evidence.⁶⁰ High confidence exists when responsibility of a certain actor can be proven ‘beyond reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative’.⁶¹ Moderate confidence is given when the evidence is clear and convincing, and low confidence is given when ‘more than half of the body of evidence points to one thing, but there are significant information gaps’.⁶² Still, the paper does not explicitly elaborate upon which level of confidence suffices in order to conduct an attribution. In case of high confidence, it will, however, most certainly be possible to undertake an attribution.\nIn order to bring more states on board for a collective attribution, states will have to be on similar levels regarding their capacities to attribute. Hence, similar to NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Strategy aims at building ‘international cyber capacity’ that ‘will empower international partners to implement policies and practices which allow them to be effective partners in the United States-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative’.⁶³ Further details on how capacity-building will be achieved are also not publicly available.\nHowever, unlike mechanisms within NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative seems to allow more flexible alliances, which can differ depending on the activity to be attributed. While NATO and EU decisions are consensus-based and thus require the backing of all its member states, the US Initiative may enable the creation of ad hoc alliances.⁶⁴ This may allow the Initiative to act more swiftly in critical situations. A potential downside of such an\n⁵⁸ Ibid; cf T Starks, ‘Top State Cyber Official Talks Huawei, Deterrence’ (Politico, 20 March 2019) <www.politico.com 03=\"\" 20=\"\" 2019=\"\" newsletters=\"\" morning-cybersecurity=\"\" top-state-cyber-official-talks-huawei-deterrence-552356=\"\">; the first element entails making a decision on the type of activity the US would like to deter. The second element focuses on the improvement of methods of collective attribution. The third element is about focusing on the measures of imposing consequences on malicious actors. The fourth and last element is about the actual deterrence – publicly warning malicious actors of the consequences.\n⁵⁹ See US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 21.\n⁶⁰ See ODNI, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (n 1) 4.\n⁶¹ Ibid.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 26; Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45).\n⁶⁴ cf Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45); on possible advantages of such ad-hoc collaboration see K E Eichensehr, ‘The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution’ (forthcoming 2020) 67 UCLA Law Review 61.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.politico.com>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\narrangement, however, would be a lack of institutional knowledge between states that continuously work together to achieve a collective attribution. Regardless, there is no public information available whether this Initiative has ever been put to actual use.\n# 5. Conclusion\nTo summarise, there is potential within the EU's Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and its newly adopted sanctions regime, NATO's alliance and the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative, to tackle the 'attribution problem'. These collective mechanisms might help release the burden of attribution by one state and increase the political pressure on the alleged wrongful state, which might even perhaps deter future 'malicious' cyber incidents. However, the biggest issue for collective attribution seems to be a lack of trust between states, which, in turn, hinders them to take collective action. Without having the possibility to assess the evidence regarding attribution by other states themselves and the fact that states usually underline that there is no international obligation to share evidence,[65] states will most likely be reluctant to support attribution claims. Closely interlinked with this is the question whether common evidentiary standards might be helpful to solve this problem. In any event, states will tend to refuse to attribute if doing so could potentially harm their international relations with the alleged wrongful state. The lack of technical expertise and insecure cyber defence systems within some states compared to other technologically well-equipped states does not help with building trust either. Hence why capacity-building is crucial, also for a collective attribution effort. To conclude, although there seems to be potential within the above-mentioned mechanisms, it is questionable whether states will make use of them or remain fairly reluctant to attribute.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297",

Introduction\nWhile there is an increasing consensus that attribution in the cyber context is not entirely impossible, the actual act of attributing cyber operations to a state has remained difficult. Reasons include a lack of sufficient technical capacities within the victim states to attribute the attack, national security interests barring the states from disclosing intelligence on which a potential public attribution would be based, or the reluctance of states to undermine their good relations with alleged wrongful states. To overcome these political challenges, there has recently been an increased interest within academia, civil societies and private companies in the establishment of an independent body supervising the attribution of cyber operations to states. But also on an inter-state level, states have relatively recently undergone efforts of collective attribution, such as in the case of the NotPetya and WannaCry cyber incidents, and, most recently, the cyber operations against Georgia. Collective efforts have the advantage of increasing the credibility of attribution findings, and the attribution claim gains more political weight the more states join in, which in turn might have a beneficial deterrent effect on the\n See, *ia* Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (14 September 2018) 2, <www.dni.gov 00ni_a_guide_to_cyber_attribution.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" documents=\"\" cjb:ctiic=\"\" other=\"\" references=\"\" to=\"\" online=\"\" sources=\"\" the=\"\" to=\"\" where:=\"\">; references to online sources are accurate as of 3 July 2020.\n See *ia* Microsoft, ‘An Attribution Organization to Strengthen Trust Online’ (Microsoft Policy Papers, 2017) <www.microsoft.com an-attribution-organization-to-strengthen-trust-online=\"\" en-us=\"\" cybersecurity=\"\" content-hub=\"\">; J S Davis and others, ‘Stateless Attribution: Toward International Accountability in Cyberspace’ (Rand Corporation, 2017) <www.rand.org 2017=\"\" 12=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2018=\"\" j=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" nelson-states=\"\" press=\"\" pubs=\"\" research_reports=\"\" rn2081.html=\"\" www.rand.org=\"\">; S Charncy, ‘Cybersecurity Norms for Nation-States and the Global ICT Industry’ (Microsoft Blog, 23 June 2016) <blogs.microsoft.com 2016=\"\" 06=\"\" 06=\"\" 2018=\"\" cjb:=\"\" cjb:cti-industry=\"\" on-the-issues=\"\" online=\"\" research=\"\" www.artlantic.org=\"\" www.ratlantic.org=\"\"></blogs.microsoft.com></www.rand.org></www.racn-cry></www.racn-cry></www.dni.gov>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nwrongful state(s). This is perhaps also the reason why organisations such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have lately been working on strengthening their collective capabilities within the cyber realm. But also the United States, with its recently launched ‘Cyber Deterrence Initiative’, is focusing more on mobilising allied states to undertake collective attributions. This paper will thus provide an overview on these already existing developments of a potential international attribution mechanism for cyber operations at the EU and NATO level, as well as touch briefly on measures taken by the US in this context.\n## 2. The European Union\nThe EU has relatively recently taken up the challenge of building a collective cyber security mechanism across the EU. It has also realised that it needs to step up its game regarding its attribution capabilities. A significant milestone was finding consensus on creating a set of measures which the EU and its member states can resort to in the case of a cyber incident threatening the security of the Union. This set of measures was named the ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ (for further details see below) and also addresses the question how the EU attempts to deal with the issue of attributing these cyber incidents to state or non-state actors. Before addressing these measures, however, it is important to note how the EU defines ‘attribution’.\nAccording to an early draft version of the European External Action Service, attribution is defined as ‘the practice of assigning responsibility for malicious cyber activity to a specific actor or sponsor’. Regarding the fact that no specific reference is made to a state actor, this definition seems to imply that the EU regards ‘attribution’ in a broader sense than it is understood under the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles). Moreover, the EU is keen to note that attribution is a ‘sovereign political\n When referring to the European Union, reference is made to all main institutions – the European Commission, the Council, the European Council and the European Parliament, either collectively or in their singular capacity, as representing the EU as a whole, unless otherwise stated.\n For example, the EU adopted its first Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013, see European Commission Press Release, ‘EU Cybersecurity Plan to Protect Open Internet and Online Freedom and Opportunity’ (Digital Single Market News, 7 February 2013) <ec.europa.eu en=\"\" digital-single-market=\"\" eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity=\"\" news=\"\">.\n See eg European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, ‘Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council: Increasing Resilience and Bolstering Capabilities to Address Hybrid Threats’ (13 June 2018) JOIN (2018) 16 final, 8.\n See General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Council Conclusions on a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (“Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox”)’ (19 June 2017) Doc 10474/17, <data.consilium.europa.eu dec=\"\" document=\"\" en=\"\" pt=\"\" st-10474-2017-init=\"\">.\n European External Action Service, ‘Implementation of the Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities – Attribution of Malicious Cyber Activities – Discussion of a Revised Text’ (18 March 2019) Doc 6852/1/19 REV 1, 3, <www.statewatch.org 2019=\"\" eu-council-cyber-6852-rev-1-19.pdf=\"\" news=\"\" www.2019=\"\">; note, however, that this draft version is the only available version online.\n UN ILC, ‘Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (2001) GAOR, 53rd Session, Supp No 10; the ILC Articles are widely held to reflect customary international law; note that the EU heavily emphasises, in most of its documents regarding cyber security, that ‘existing international law is applicable to cyberspace’ (see for example Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler!

This is reflected in the recent establishment of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and the EU cyber sanctions regime. Both will be discussed in the following sub-chapters.\n## 2.1. The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\nThe EU has adopted the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox in June 2017. The Toolbox describes a set of measures with which the EU can respond to so-called ‘malicious’ cyber activities under its Common Foreign and Security Policy. To be specific, the Council of the European Union decides which measures to take, based on a proposal by a Member State or the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Measures that can be taken include démarches (i.e. diplomatic visits, usually to a state representative in charge of the dossier), public statements condemning the cyber activity, confidence-building measures, political dialogues or even restrictive measures (these will be addressed in a separate point below).\nThe Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (hereinafter: Draft Implementing Guidelines) note that in order to resort to some, but not all, measures, prior attribution of a cyber activity is required. They also seem to distinguish between measures that require firm attribution and those that do not (eg when contacting states whose territory may have been used to conduct a ‘malicious cyber activity’). What level of proof is required for a firm attribution and for any other attribution is not specified in the available documents. An earlier draft version of an EU paper on attribution contained a so-called ‘uncertainty yardstick’, developed by the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN), the intelligence body of the European External Action Service (EEAS),\n General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities’ (9 October 2017) Doc 13007/17, 13, <https: en=\"\" document=\"\" document?st-13007-2017-init=\"\" data.consilium.europa.eu=\"\" en=\"\" pdf=\"\">; the draft version is the only version available online; cf also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler!

Textmarke nicht definiert.).\n The Council noted specifically that malicious cyber activities ‘may constitute wrongful acts under international law and could give rise to a joint EU response’, see EU Press Release (n 11).\n The Council consists of the respective ministers of each EU member state and is, next to the European Parliament and the European Commission, one of the three legislative bodies of the European Union.\n See Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 6ff.\n Ibid, 14; see also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.) 4.\n See Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 8: ‘When one or more Member States are impacted by a malicious cyber activity, it could be beneficial to jointly contact States exercising jurisdiction over these territories that have been used for conducting the malicious activity. [...] The benefit of such signalling is that it can generally be done without requiring firm attribution’ [emphasis added].\n The EEAS serves as a diplomatic body of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and exercises foreign ministry and defense ministry functions for the EU; the EU INTCEN is tasked with providing intelligence analyses to EU decision-making bodies, which are based on information voluntarily provided by the EU member states.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</https:>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nwhich divided the range of probabilities of an attribution into percentages from 0-5% (remote chance) to 95-100% (almost certain). This yardstick, however, was removed in a later draft version.\nIt is important to note that, despite the involvement of European cyber institutions to help in the process of attribution, the power to decide to attribute remains within the hands of the member states: The Council notes that the EU INTCEN, along with other competent European ‘cyber institutions’ (such as the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) network established under Article 12 of the EU Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive), the European Cybercrime Centre, European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) or the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions (CERT-EU)), ‘plays a valuable role [...] by sharing its analyses and information related to the origin of the malicious cyber activity’. Thus, institutions such as INTCEN are there to facilitate rather than make the decision to attribute a certain activity to a specific actor. This may entail collecting and assessing information received by member states, third states or collected on its own, followed by an analysis of the received and/or collected information. This analysis may, for example, contain a conclusion that the cyber activity, based on the available information, is with a high likelihood attributable to state X or Y. Member states may then assess this information based on their ‘sovereign prerogative’ of attribution and decide whether they agree with the analysis or not.\nWhether member states will have access to the information upon which INTCEN and others created their conclusions is not clear. Especially when it comes to classified information, it is highly unlikely that the information received by one member state or a third party can be shared with the rest of the member states. In this case, member states are supposed to decide whether they follow the conclusions made by these bodies without having access to the underlying information. This decision to attribute has to be taken unanimously by all member states, if taken by the EU as a whole.\nAn additional issue is that, according to the Implementing Guidelines ‘Member States are not obliged to provide information or analysis when it [sic] considers this as contrary to the essential interests of its [sic] national security.’ As the necessary information will usually be linked to essential interests of a state’s national security, it might be difficult to receive valuable information at all.\nIt is also not clear what level of proof the EU regards as having to be met in order to attribute successfully. As already mentioned above, there seems to have been a discussion about\n Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 10.\n Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 Concerning Measures for a High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Across the Union, OJ L194/1; the NIS Directive is the first EU legislation addressing cybersecurity, and seeks to improve and harmonise the level of cybersecurity within the EU.\n Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 13.\n Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 2.\n Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 11.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\ncategorising evidence into ranges of probability. This proposal has, however, been dropped. There is no official statement so far by the EU on this matter.\nTo conclude, despite having INTCEN and others undertake an analysis on attribution, the responsibility to attribute remains with the member states. This means that building trust between member states is crucial. In this respect, at least having a framework to task impartial bodies with the analysis might facilitate building trust and eventually, better intelligence-sharing between member states. This impartial body, however, still relies on information provided by member states.\n## 2.2. Cyber Sanctions Regime:\nOn 17 May 2019, Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 and Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against ‘cyber attacks’ threatening the EU or its member states have entered into force. The Decision, which initially applied until 18 May 2020, was amended on 14 May 2020 to apply until 18 May 2021. The Decision and the Regulation form the basis of the new ‘cyber sanctions regime’ adopted by the EU. They impose entry restrictions on, and the freezing of funds of, persons that are responsible for ‘cyber attacks’ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, persons who provide financial, technical or material support for or are otherwise involved in ‘cyber attacks’ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, or others associated with these persons.\nFor that purpose, and in line with the procedure in other sanctions regimes, an Annex to the Decision and Regulation shall contain a list of these ‘persons, entities and bodies’ whose funds shall be frozen and who shall be denied entry into the EU’s member states. These may be added by the Council, acting in unanimity ‘upon a proposal from a member state or from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy’. This means that all member states will have to agree on adding certain actors to this list, but can also veto any proposal made by a member state or the High Representative. Importantly, these listings can be challenged by the listed person or entity before the General Court of the European Union, in accordance with Articles 275(2) and 263(4) and (6) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the\n The EU’s cyber sanctions regime will only be analysed with regard to its relationship with ‘attribution’. Whether or not these sanctions are in conformity with international law will not be addressed in this paper.\n Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 of 17 May 2019 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States [2019] OJ L 129I/13; Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 of 17 May 2019 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States [2019] OJ LI 129/1.\n See Article 10 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/651 of 14 May 2020 Amending Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States; Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 (n 24) remains in force unamended.\n ‘Cyber attacks’ are defined as ‘actions involving any of the following: (a) access to information systems; (b) information system interference; (c) data interference; or (d) data interception, where such actions are not duly authorised by the owner or by another right holder of the system or data or part of it, or are not permitted under the law of the Union or of the Member State concerned’; see Article 1 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n See Articles 4 and 5 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n See Article 4(1) CD 2019/797 (n 24), and Article 3 CR (n 24).\n See Article 6 CD 2019/797 (n 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nEuropean Union. Also, the list in the Annex ‘shall be reviewed at regular intervals and at least every 12 months’. Currently, the Annex does not contain any persons, entities or bodies. Most recently, however, Germany has announced that it will propose listing certain Russian individuals involved in a large-scale hack against the German Bundestag in 2015. Importantly, one of the individuals was most certainly working for the Russian GRU at the time of the event. At the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether Germany will be successful with its proposal.\nRecital 9 of the Council Decision notes that ‘[t]argeted restrictive measures should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyber-attacks to a third State. The application of targeted restrictive measures does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken on a case-by-case basis. Every Member State is free to make its own determination with respect to the attribution of cyber-attacks to a third State.’\nIn this context, it may be noted that there is no reference in the EU legal texts that the cyber sanctions regime is only restricted to sanctioning non-state actors who have no affiliation to a state. To the contrary, it seems to have been in the EU’s interests to also be able to impose sanctions on state actors, as the Implementing Guidelines note that restrictive measures could also be used ‘[i]n the case where the malicious cyber activity is being carried out by a State, as well as in the case when a State is deemed responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that is acting under its direction or control, or if this State recognizes and adopts the behaviour of such a non-state actor as its own’. Here, reference is clearly made to the rules of attribution enshrined in the ILC Articles and, to some extent, the language of Articles 8 and 11 ILC Articles is used.\nFor a state to be held responsible under international law, the act must be attributable to the state and constitute ‘a breach of an international obligation of the state.’ Thus, attribution of an act to a state alone does not lead to any consequences under the law of state responsibility. Politically, however, it is questionable how listing state-affiliated actors in the Annex – a decision taken by all EU member states in their sovereign capacity – can be done without undertaking a collective attribution through the EU. For example, if the EU decided to list the Russian individual allegedly working for the GRU and involved in the German Bundestag hack\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\n Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union [2012] OJ C326/47; cf General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Sanctions Guidelines – Update’ (4 May 2018) Doc 5664/18, 56.\n See Article 13(4) CR 2019/796 (n 24).\n German Federal Foreign Office, ‘Federal Foreign Office on the Hacker Attack on the German Bundestag’ (Press Release, 28 May 2020) <www.auswaertiges-amt.de en=\"\" hacker-attack-bundestag=\"\" newsroom=\"\" newss=\"\" 2345580=\"\">.\n Ibid.\n Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 5.\n Article 8 ILC Articles (n 9) stipulates that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.’; Article 11 stipulates that ‘[c]onduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.’\n Article 2 ILC Articles (n 9).</www.auswaertiges-amt.de>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\n- something the EU cyber sanctions regime enables the member states to do – the EU would officially condemn the actions of a Russian state organ.\nSecond, if all EU member states have to unanimously decide who will be added to this list, this act of collective attribution remains in their responsibility. One might assume that the EU is reluctant, from a foreign policy perspective, to condemn an entire state for committing a ‘malicious’ cyber activity. By listing only individuals and entities instead, attribution can be avoided and (hopefully) good relations with the affiliated state can be maintained. This cautious (and inconsistent) approach indicates the EU’s reluctance to undergo collective attribution efforts.\nRegarding evidentiary standards necessary for listing: According to the EU’s Sanctions Guidelines, listing proposals must contain ‘accurate, up-to-date and defendable statements of reasons’. The reasons for listings should moreover be ‘capable of being made public’. However, ‘[i]n exceptional cases, where it is considered that the reasons for the listing are not suitable for publication, because of considerations of privacy and security, the reasons will need to be addressed separately to the person, group or entity concerned.’ In any case, the evidence must be sufficient to withstand examination by the European Court of Justice.\nWhether listing certain actors under the Annex is defined as attribution or not, the EU’s cyber sanctions regime may, on the one hand, facilitate cooperative efforts to avoid impunity for ‘malicious’ cyber acts and, on the other hand, provide helpful indications what evidence states may find sufficient enough in order to publicly condemn a ‘malicious’ behaviour in cyberspace. Of course, this will only become possible as soon as someone will actually be listed in the Annex. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether clear conclusions may be drawn therefrom. As listing actors in the Annex needs to follow a unanimous decision, it is highly likely that the EU will only enforce measures against actors whose listings are not too harmful for the EU member states’ political interests.\n# 3. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nSimilar to the EU, NATO is a consensus-based alliance, which means that any decision taken by NATO is agreed unanimously by all its member states. Within this mechanism, NATO agreed in 2016 that cyberspace is a ‘domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself\n cf Article 4 ILC Articles (n 9).\n Sanctions Guidelines – Update (n 31) para 17.\n Ibid, Annex I, para 10.\n Ibid.\n cf European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Mellat v Council of the European Union (29 January 2013) Case T-496/10, para 77; European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Saderat Iran v Council of the European Union (5 February 2013) Case T-494/10, para 73.\n NATO’s practice of consensus-based decision-making has been applied since its founding, despite a lack of any specific provision in the founding documents requiring NATO member states to do so; for further details see T Gill and others (eds), Leuven Manual on the International Law Applicable to Peace Operations (Cambridge University Press 2017) 68f.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nas effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea’. Two years previously, NATO allies agreed that an ‘armed attack’ as referred to in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty may also be applicable to a cyber attack, as long as the cyber attack reaches the severity of an ‘armed attack’. According to Article 5, this would mean that such a cyber attack against one NATO member constitutes an attack against all NATO members, triggering their obligation to assist the harmed state in taking defensive measures to ‘restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.’ In order to take action, however, knowing who to defend against is crucial.\nIn cases of cyber operations below the threshold of an armed attack, Article 4 of the Washington Treaty calls on the NATO members to ‘consult together’ if the ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’. Here as well, attribution is important. The process of consultation includes exchanging information and opinions, and might also be used to discuss the attribution of the act to a state prior to launching a collaborative NATO operation. Article 4 thus likewise enables the sharing of intelligence especially in the context of cyber attribution. At least once, NATO has arguably already joined a collective attribution initiated by the Dutch and British governments in the cyber context, condemning the Russian hacking activities against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018. There is, however, no public information available whether NATO resorted to Article 4 in this context, nor whether it considered adhering to any evidentiary standards for attributing the act to Russia.\nThe consultation process can, in some circumstances, lead to a joint decision or action, which may include condemning acts of the wrongful state (after having attributed the activity successfully). It is clear, however, that this would have to happen in consensus with all NATO allies, which could require that – especially in the context of attribution – all NATO members are equally equipped with the necessary information and capacities to make a profound decision. To build this community of trust where NATO members can share information\n NATO Press Release, ‘Warsaw Summit Communiqué’ (9 July 2016) para 70, <www.nato.int cps=\"\" on=\"\" official_texts_133169.htm=\"\" natohq=\"\">.\n See NATO Press Release, ‘Wales Summit Declaration’ (5 September 2014) para 72, <www.nato.int cps=\"\" on=\"\" official_texts_112964.htm=\"\" natohq=\"\">; see also NATO Review Magazine, ‘NATO’s Role in Cyberspace’ (February 2019) <www.nato.int 2019=\"\" also-in-2019=\"\" natos-role-in-cyberspace-alliance-defence=\"\" den=\"\" index.htm=\"\" docu=\"\" review=\"\">; C Porter and K Jordan, ‘Don’t Let Cyber Attribution Debates Tear Apart the NATO Alliance’ (Lawfare Blog, 14 February 2019) <www.lawfareblog.com dont-let-cyber-attribution-debates-tear-apart-nato-alliance=\"\">; NATO has so far not specified what level of severity would be needed for an armed attack in the cyber context.

According to the NATO website, ‘almost all Allies have upgraded their cyber defences’ since adopting the Pledge.52 Measures such as these further facilitate intelligence-sharing between states, as states with a higher level of security will trust other ‘more cyber capable Allies’ more than those with less secure cyber defense mechanisms.53\nNATO is also cooperating with regional organisations, such as the EU, on questions regarding better intelligence-sharing to counter cyber threats. In a Joint Declaration in 2016, the EU and NATO noted the ‘urgent need to: Boost [the EU’s and NATO’s] ability to counter hybrid threats, including by bolstering resilience, working together on analysis, prevention, and early detection, through timely information sharing and, to the extent possible, intelligence sharing between staffs; and cooperating on strategic communication and response.’54 Also, amongst other initiatives, the EU Computer Emergency Response Team and the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability have concluded a ‘Technical Arrangement on Cyber Defence’ in 2016, providing a framework where both sides can better exchange information and share best practices on cyber defence.55\nIn sum, NATO has realised that there is a need to increase its capacities to become an effective platform of assistance and cooperation for its members to counter cyber threats (which also includes attribution). Measures such as the Cyber Defense Pledge or cooperation agreements with other organisations seem to help with capacity-building and better cooperation. However, it is evident that an institutionalised system comparable to the EU’s ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ does not exist.\n## 4. The US Cyber Deterrence Initiative\nThe concept of the so-called US Cyber Deterrence Initiative first appeared in the US National Cyber Strategy of September 2018.56 It is part of the US National Cyber Strategy’s Third Pillar (‘Preserve Peace Through Strength’) and entails the coordination with and support of like-minded states in combatting ‘malicious cyber behaviour’.57 This also includes, amongst others, supporting each other’s attribution claims, which – according to Robert Strayer, Deputy\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.whitehouse.gov></www.nato.int></www.nato.int>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nAssistant Secretary of State for cyber and international communications and information policy – is the second of the Initiative’s four elements.\nThe US Cyber Strategy describes methods of collective attribution as follows:\n‘Objective and actionable intelligence will be shared across the United States Government and with key partners to identify hostile foreign nation states [...]. The United States will work with like-minded states to coordinate and support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken, and joint imposition of consequences against malign actors’.\nConcerning evidentiary standards, the Cyber Strategy itself does not reveal much. However, in a paper titled ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence explains different levels of confidence (high, moderate and low) which analysts adhere to when assessing the available evidence. High confidence exists when responsibility of a certain actor can be proven ‘beyond reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative’. Moderate confidence is given when the evidence is clear and convincing, and low confidence is given when ‘more than half of the body of evidence points to one thing, but there are significant information gaps’. Still, the paper does not explicitly elaborate upon which level of confidence suffices in order to conduct an attribution. In case of high confidence, it will, however, most certainly be possible to undertake an attribution.\nIn order to bring more states on board for a collective attribution, states will have to be on similar levels regarding their capacities to attribute. Hence, similar to NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Strategy aims at building ‘international cyber capacity’ that ‘will empower international partners to implement policies and practices which allow them to be effective partners in the United States-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative’. Further details on how capacity-building will be achieved are also not publicly available.\nHowever, unlike mechanisms within NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative seems to allow more flexible alliances, which can differ depending on the activity to be attributed. While NATO and EU decisions are consensus-based and thus require the backing of all its member states, the US Initiative may enable the creation of ad hoc alliances. This may allow the Initiative to act more swiftly in critical situations. A potential downside of such an\n Ibid; cf T Starks, ‘Top State Cyber Official Talks Huawei, Deterrence’ (Politico, 20 March 2019) <www.politico.com 03=\"\" 20=\"\" 2019=\"\" newsletters=\"\" morning-cybersecurity=\"\" top-state-cyber-official-talks-huawei-deterrence-552356=\"\">; the first element entails making a decision on the type of activity the US would like to deter. The second element focuses on the improvement of methods of collective attribution. The third element is about focusing on the measures of imposing consequences on malicious actors. The fourth and last element is about the actual deterrence – publicly warning malicious actors of the consequences.\n See US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 21.\n See ODNI, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (n 1) 4.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 26; Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45).\n cf Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45); on possible advantages of such ad-hoc collaboration see K E Eichensehr, ‘The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution’ (forthcoming 2020) 67 UCLA Law Review 61.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.politico.com>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\narrangement, however, would be a lack of institutional knowledge between states that continuously work together to achieve a collective attribution. Regardless, there is no public information available whether this Initiative has ever been put to actual use.\n# 5. Conclusion\nTo summarise, there is potential within the EU's Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and its newly adopted sanctions regime, NATO's alliance and the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative, to tackle the 'attribution problem'. These collective mechanisms might help release the burden of attribution by one state and increase the political pressure on the alleged wrongful state, which might even perhaps deter future 'malicious' cyber incidents. However, the biggest issue for collective attribution seems to be a lack of trust between states, which, in turn, hinders them to take collective action. Without having the possibility to assess the evidence regarding attribution by other states themselves and the fact that states usually underline that there is no international obligation to share evidence,[65] states will most likely be reluctant to support attribution claims. Closely interlinked with this is the question whether common evidentiary standards might be helpful to solve this problem. In any event, states will tend to refuse to attribute if doing so could potentially harm their international relations with the alleged wrongful state. The lack of technical expertise and insecure cyber defence systems within some states compared to other technologically well-equipped states does not help with building trust either. Hence why capacity-building is crucial, also for a collective attribution effort. To conclude, although there seems to be potential within the above-mentioned mechanisms, it is questionable whether states will make use of them or remain fairly reluctant to attribute.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297",

Introduction\nWhile there is an increasing consensus that attribution in the cyber context is not entirely impossible, the actual act of attributing cyber operations to a state has remained difficult. Reasons include a lack of sufficient technical capacities within the victim states to attribute the attack, national security interests barring the states from disclosing intelligence on which a potential public attribution would be based, or the reluctance of states to undermine their good relations with alleged wrongful states. To overcome these political challenges, there has recently been an increased interest within academia, civil societies and private companies in the establishment of an independent body supervising the attribution of cyber operations to states. But also on an inter-state level, states have relatively recently undergone efforts of collective attribution, such as in the case of the NotPetya and WannaCry cyber incidents, and, most recently, the cyber operations against Georgia. Collective efforts have the advantage of increasing the credibility of attribution findings, and the attribution claim gains more political weight the more states join in, which in turn might have a beneficial deterrent effect on the\n See, *ia* Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (14 September 2018) 2, <www.dni.gov 00ni_a_guide_to_cyber_attribution.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" documents=\"\" cjb:ctiic=\"\" other=\"\" references=\"\" to=\"\" online=\"\" sources=\"\" the=\"\" to=\"\" where:=\"\">; references to online sources are accurate as of 3 July 2020.\n See *ia* Microsoft, ‘An Attribution Organization to Strengthen Trust Online’ (Microsoft Policy Papers, 2017) <www.microsoft.com an-attribution-organization-to-strengthen-trust-online=\"\" en-us=\"\" cybersecurity=\"\" content-hub=\"\">; J S Davis and others, ‘Stateless Attribution: Toward International Accountability in Cyberspace’ (Rand Corporation, 2017) <www.rand.org 2017=\"\" 12=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2018=\"\" j=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" nelson-states=\"\" press=\"\" pubs=\"\" research_reports=\"\" rn2081.html=\"\" www.rand.org=\"\">; S Charncy, ‘Cybersecurity Norms for Nation-States and the Global ICT Industry’ (Microsoft Blog, 23 June 2016) <blogs.microsoft.com 2016=\"\" 06=\"\" 06=\"\" 2018=\"\" cjb:=\"\" cjb:cti-industry=\"\" on-the-issues=\"\" online=\"\" research=\"\" www.artlantic.org=\"\" www.ratlantic.org=\"\"></blogs.microsoft.com></www.rand.org></www.racn-cry></www.racn-cry></www.dni.gov>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nwrongful state(s). This is perhaps also the reason why organisations such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have lately been working on strengthening their collective capabilities within the cyber realm. But also the United States, with its recently launched ‘Cyber Deterrence Initiative’, is focusing more on mobilising allied states to undertake collective attributions. This paper will thus provide an overview on these already existing developments of a potential international attribution mechanism for cyber operations at the EU and NATO level, as well as touch briefly on measures taken by the US in this context.\n## 2. The European Union\nThe EU has relatively recently taken up the challenge of building a collective cyber security mechanism across the EU. It has also realised that it needs to step up its game regarding its attribution capabilities. A significant milestone was finding consensus on creating a set of measures which the EU and its member states can resort to in the case of a cyber incident threatening the security of the Union. This set of measures was named the ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ (for further details see below) and also addresses the question how the EU attempts to deal with the issue of attributing these cyber incidents to state or non-state actors. Before addressing these measures, however, it is important to note how the EU defines ‘attribution’.\nAccording to an early draft version of the European External Action Service, attribution is defined as ‘the practice of assigning responsibility for malicious cyber activity to a specific actor or sponsor’. Regarding the fact that no specific reference is made to a state actor, this definition seems to imply that the EU regards ‘attribution’ in a broader sense than it is understood under the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles). Moreover, the EU is keen to note that attribution is a ‘sovereign political\n When referring to the European Union, reference is made to all main institutions – the European Commission, the Council, the European Council and the European Parliament, either collectively or in their singular capacity, as representing the EU as a whole, unless otherwise stated.\n For example, the EU adopted its first Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013, see European Commission Press Release, ‘EU Cybersecurity Plan to Protect Open Internet and Online Freedom and Opportunity’ (Digital Single Market News, 7 February 2013) <ec.europa.eu en=\"\" digital-single-market=\"\" eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity=\"\" news=\"\">.\n See eg European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, ‘Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council: Increasing Resilience and Bolstering Capabilities to Address Hybrid Threats’ (13 June 2018) JOIN (2018) 16 final, 8.\n See General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Council Conclusions on a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (“Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox”)’ (19 June 2017) Doc 10474/17, <data.consilium.europa.eu dec=\"\" document=\"\" en=\"\" pt=\"\" st-10474-2017-init=\"\">.\n European External Action Service, ‘Implementation of the Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities – Attribution of Malicious Cyber Activities – Discussion of a Revised Text’ (18 March 2019) Doc 6852/1/19 REV 1, 3, <www.statewatch.org 2019=\"\" eu-council-cyber-6852-rev-1-19.pdf=\"\" news=\"\" www.2019=\"\">; note, however, that this draft version is the only available version online.\n UN ILC, ‘Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (2001) GAOR, 53rd Session, Supp No 10; the ILC Articles are widely held to reflect customary international law; note that the EU heavily emphasises, in most of its documents regarding cyber security, that ‘existing international law is applicable to cyberspace’ (see for example Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler!

This is reflected in the recent establishment of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and the EU cyber sanctions regime. Both will be discussed in the following sub-chapters.\n## 2.1. The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\nThe EU has adopted the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox in June 2017. The Toolbox describes a set of measures with which the EU can respond to so-called ‘malicious’ cyber activities under its Common Foreign and Security Policy. To be specific, the Council of the European Union decides which measures to take, based on a proposal by a Member State or the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Measures that can be taken include démarches (i.e. diplomatic visits, usually to a state representative in charge of the dossier), public statements condemning the cyber activity, confidence-building measures, political dialogues or even restrictive measures (these will be addressed in a separate point below).\nThe Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (hereinafter: Draft Implementing Guidelines) note that in order to resort to some, but not all, measures, prior attribution of a cyber activity is required. They also seem to distinguish between measures that require firm attribution and those that do not (eg when contacting states whose territory may have been used to conduct a ‘malicious cyber activity’). What level of proof is required for a firm attribution and for any other attribution is not specified in the available documents. An earlier draft version of an EU paper on attribution contained a so-called ‘uncertainty yardstick’, developed by the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN), the intelligence body of the European External Action Service (EEAS),\n General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities’ (9 October 2017) Doc 13007/17, 13, <https: en=\"\" document=\"\" document?st-13007-2017-init=\"\" data.consilium.europa.eu=\"\" en=\"\" pdf=\"\">; the draft version is the only version available online; cf also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.) 4.\n See Council of the EU Press Release, ‘Cyber Attacks: EU Ready to Respond with a Range of Measures, Including Sanctions’ (19 June 2017) <www.consilium.europa.eu en=\"\" press=\"\" press-releases=\"\" 06=\"\" 19=\"\" 2017=\"\" cyber-diplomacy-toolbox=\"\"></www.consilium.europa.eu>; see also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.).\n The Council noted specifically that malicious cyber activities ‘may constitute wrongful acts under international law and could give rise to a joint EU response’, see EU Press Release (n 11).\n The Council consists of the respective ministers of each EU member state and is, next to the European Parliament and the European Commission, one of the three legislative bodies of the European Union.\n See Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 6ff.\n Ibid, 14; see also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.) 4.\n See Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 8: ‘When one or more Member States are impacted by a malicious cyber activity, it could be beneficial to jointly contact States exercising jurisdiction over these territories that have been used for conducting the malicious activity. [...] The benefit of such signalling is that it can generally be done without requiring firm attribution’ [emphasis added].\n The EEAS serves as a diplomatic body of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and exercises foreign ministry and defense ministry functions for the EU; the EU INTCEN is tasked with providing intelligence analyses to EU decision-making bodies, which are based on information voluntarily provided by the EU member states.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</https:>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nwhich divided the range of probabilities of an attribution into percentages from 0-5% (remote chance) to 95-100% (almost certain). This yardstick, however, was removed in a later draft version.\nIt is important to note that, despite the involvement of European cyber institutions to help in the process of attribution, the power to decide to attribute remains within the hands of the member states: The Council notes that the EU INTCEN, along with other competent European ‘cyber institutions’ (such as the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) network established under Article 12 of the EU Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive), the European Cybercrime Centre, European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) or the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions (CERT-EU)), ‘plays a valuable role [...] by sharing its analyses and information related to the origin of the malicious cyber activity’. Thus, institutions such as INTCEN are there to facilitate rather than make the decision to attribute a certain activity to a specific actor. This may entail collecting and assessing information received by member states, third states or collected on its own, followed by an analysis of the received and/or collected information. This analysis may, for example, contain a conclusion that the cyber activity, based on the available information, is with a high likelihood attributable to state X or Y. Member states may then assess this information based on their ‘sovereign prerogative’ of attribution and decide whether they agree with the analysis or not.\nWhether member states will have access to the information upon which INTCEN and others created their conclusions is not clear. Especially when it comes to classified information, it is highly unlikely that the information received by one member state or a third party can be shared with the rest of the member states. In this case, member states are supposed to decide whether they follow the conclusions made by these bodies without having access to the underlying information. This decision to attribute has to be taken unanimously by all member states, if taken by the EU as a whole.\nAn additional issue is that, according to the Implementing Guidelines ‘Member States are not obliged to provide information or analysis when it [sic] considers this as contrary to the essential interests of its [sic] national security.’ As the necessary information will usually be linked to essential interests of a state’s national security, it might be difficult to receive valuable information at all.\nIt is also not clear what level of proof the EU regards as having to be met in order to attribute successfully. As already mentioned above, there seems to have been a discussion about\n Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 10.\n Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 Concerning Measures for a High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Across the Union, OJ L194/1; the NIS Directive is the first EU legislation addressing cybersecurity, and seeks to improve and harmonise the level of cybersecurity within the EU.\n Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 13.\n Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 2.\n Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 11.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\ncategorising evidence into ranges of probability. This proposal has, however, been dropped. There is no official statement so far by the EU on this matter.\nTo conclude, despite having INTCEN and others undertake an analysis on attribution, the responsibility to attribute remains with the member states. This means that building trust between member states is crucial. In this respect, at least having a framework to task impartial bodies with the analysis might facilitate building trust and eventually, better intelligence-sharing between member states. This impartial body, however, still relies on information provided by member states.\n## 2.2. Cyber Sanctions Regime:\nOn 17 May 2019, Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 and Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against ‘cyber attacks’ threatening the EU or its member states have entered into force. The Decision, which initially applied until 18 May 2020, was amended on 14 May 2020 to apply until 18 May 2021. The Decision and the Regulation form the basis of the new ‘cyber sanctions regime’ adopted by the EU. They impose entry restrictions on, and the freezing of funds of, persons that are responsible for ‘cyber attacks’ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, persons who provide financial, technical or material support for or are otherwise involved in ‘cyber attacks’ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, or others associated with these persons.\nFor that purpose, and in line with the procedure in other sanctions regimes, an Annex to the Decision and Regulation shall contain a list of these ‘persons, entities and bodies’ whose funds shall be frozen and who shall be denied entry into the EU’s member states. These may be added by the Council, acting in unanimity ‘upon a proposal from a member state or from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy’. This means that all member states will have to agree on adding certain actors to this list, but can also veto any proposal made by a member state or the High Representative. Importantly, these listings can be challenged by the listed person or entity before the General Court of the European Union, in accordance with Articles 275(2) and 263(4) and (6) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the\n The EU’s cyber sanctions regime will only be analysed with regard to its relationship with ‘attribution’. Whether or not these sanctions are in conformity with international law will not be addressed in this paper.\n Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 of 17 May 2019 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States [2019] OJ L 129I/13; Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 of 17 May 2019 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States [2019] OJ LI 129/1.\n See Article 10 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/651 of 14 May 2020 Amending Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States; Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 (n 24) remains in force unamended.\n ‘Cyber attacks’ are defined as ‘actions involving any of the following: (a) access to information systems; (b) information system interference; (c) data interference; or (d) data interception, where such actions are not duly authorised by the owner or by another right holder of the system or data or part of it, or are not permitted under the law of the Union or of the Member State concerned’; see Article 1 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n See Articles 4 and 5 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n See Article 4(1) CD 2019/797 (n 24), and Article 3 CR (n 24).\n See Article 6 CD 2019/797 (n 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nEuropean Union. Also, the list in the Annex ‘shall be reviewed at regular intervals and at least every 12 months’. Currently, the Annex does not contain any persons, entities or bodies. Most recently, however, Germany has announced that it will propose listing certain Russian individuals involved in a large-scale hack against the German Bundestag in 2015. Importantly, one of the individuals was most certainly working for the Russian GRU at the time of the event. At the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether Germany will be successful with its proposal.\nRecital 9 of the Council Decision notes that ‘[t]argeted restrictive measures should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyber-attacks to a third State. The application of targeted restrictive measures does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken on a case-by-case basis. Every Member State is free to make its own determination with respect to the attribution of cyber-attacks to a third State.’\nIn this context, it may be noted that there is no reference in the EU legal texts that the cyber sanctions regime is only restricted to sanctioning non-state actors who have no affiliation to a state. To the contrary, it seems to have been in the EU’s interests to also be able to impose sanctions on state actors, as the Implementing Guidelines note that restrictive measures could also be used ‘[i]n the case where the malicious cyber activity is being carried out by a State, as well as in the case when a State is deemed responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that is acting under its direction or control, or if this State recognizes and adopts the behaviour of such a non-state actor as its own’. Here, reference is clearly made to the rules of attribution enshrined in the ILC Articles and, to some extent, the language of Articles 8 and 11 ILC Articles is used.\nFor a state to be held responsible under international law, the act must be attributable to the state and constitute ‘a breach of an international obligation of the state.’ Thus, attribution of an act to a state alone does not lead to any consequences under the law of state responsibility. Politically, however, it is questionable how listing state-affiliated actors in the Annex – a decision taken by all EU member states in their sovereign capacity – can be done without undertaking a collective attribution through the EU. For example, if the EU decided to list the Russian individual allegedly working for the GRU and involved in the German Bundestag hack\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\n Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union [2012] OJ C326/47; cf General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Sanctions Guidelines – Update’ (4 May 2018) Doc 5664/18, 56.\n See Article 13(4) CR 2019/796 (n 24).\n German Federal Foreign Office, ‘Federal Foreign Office on the Hacker Attack on the German Bundestag’ (Press Release, 28 May 2020) <www.auswaertiges-amt.de en=\"\" hacker-attack-bundestag=\"\" newsroom=\"\" newss=\"\" 2345580=\"\">.\n Ibid.\n Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 5.\n Article 8 ILC Articles (n 9) stipulates that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.’; Article 11 stipulates that ‘[c]onduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.’\n Article 2 ILC Articles (n 9).</www.auswaertiges-amt.de>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\n- something the EU cyber sanctions regime enables the member states to do – the EU would officially condemn the actions of a Russian state organ.\nSecond, if all EU member states have to unanimously decide who will be added to this list, this act of collective attribution remains in their responsibility. One might assume that the EU is reluctant, from a foreign policy perspective, to condemn an entire state for committing a ‘malicious’ cyber activity. By listing only individuals and entities instead, attribution can be avoided and (hopefully) good relations with the affiliated state can be maintained. This cautious (and inconsistent) approach indicates the EU’s reluctance to undergo collective attribution efforts.\nRegarding evidentiary standards necessary for listing: According to the EU’s Sanctions Guidelines, listing proposals must contain ‘accurate, up-to-date and defendable statements of reasons’. The reasons for listings should moreover be ‘capable of being made public’. However, ‘[i]n exceptional cases, where it is considered that the reasons for the listing are not suitable for publication, because of considerations of privacy and security, the reasons will need to be addressed separately to the person, group or entity concerned.’ In any case, the evidence must be sufficient to withstand examination by the European Court of Justice.\nWhether listing certain actors under the Annex is defined as attribution or not, the EU’s cyber sanctions regime may, on the one hand, facilitate cooperative efforts to avoid impunity for ‘malicious’ cyber acts and, on the other hand, provide helpful indications what evidence states may find sufficient enough in order to publicly condemn a ‘malicious’ behaviour in cyberspace. Of course, this will only become possible as soon as someone will actually be listed in the Annex. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether clear conclusions may be drawn therefrom. As listing actors in the Annex needs to follow a unanimous decision, it is highly likely that the EU will only enforce measures against actors whose listings are not too harmful for the EU member states’ political interests.\n# 3. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nSimilar to the EU, NATO is a consensus-based alliance, which means that any decision taken by NATO is agreed unanimously by all its member states. Within this mechanism, NATO agreed in 2016 that cyberspace is a ‘domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself\n cf Article 4 ILC Articles (n 9).\n Sanctions Guidelines – Update (n 31) para 17.\n Ibid, Annex I, para 10.\n Ibid.\n cf European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Mellat v Council of the European Union (29 January 2013) Case T-496/10, para 77; European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Saderat Iran v Council of the European Union (5 February 2013) Case T-494/10, para 73.\n NATO’s practice of consensus-based decision-making has been applied since its founding, despite a lack of any specific provision in the founding documents requiring NATO member states to do so; for further details see T Gill and others (eds), Leuven Manual on the International Law Applicable to Peace Operations (Cambridge University Press 2017) 68f.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nas effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea’. Two years previously, NATO allies agreed that an ‘armed attack’ as referred to in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty may also be applicable to a cyber attack, as long as the cyber attack reaches the severity of an ‘armed attack’. According to Article 5, this would mean that such a cyber attack against one NATO member constitutes an attack against all NATO members, triggering their obligation to assist the harmed state in taking defensive measures to ‘restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.’ In order to take action, however, knowing who to defend against is crucial.\nIn cases of cyber operations below the threshold of an armed attack, Article 4 of the Washington Treaty calls on the NATO members to ‘consult together’ if the ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’. Here as well, attribution is important. The process of consultation includes exchanging information and opinions, and might also be used to discuss the attribution of the act to a state prior to launching a collaborative NATO operation. Article 4 thus likewise enables the sharing of intelligence especially in the context of cyber attribution. At least once, NATO has arguably already joined a collective attribution initiated by the Dutch and British governments in the cyber context, condemning the Russian hacking activities against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018. There is, however, no public information available whether NATO resorted to Article 4 in this context, nor whether it considered adhering to any evidentiary standards for attributing the act to Russia.\nThe consultation process can, in some circumstances, lead to a joint decision or action, which may include condemning acts of the wrongful state (after having attributed the activity successfully). It is clear, however, that this would have to happen in consensus with all NATO allies, which could require that – especially in the context of attribution – all NATO members are equally equipped with the necessary information and capacities to make a profound decision. To build this community of trust where NATO members can share information\n NATO Press Release, ‘Warsaw Summit Communiqué’ (9 July 2016) para 70, <www.nato.int cps=\"\" on=\"\" official_texts_133169.htm=\"\" natohq=\"\">.\n See NATO Press Release, ‘Wales Summit Declaration’ (5 September 2014) para 72, <www.nato.int cps=\"\" on=\"\" official_texts_112964.htm=\"\" natohq=\"\">; see also NATO Review Magazine, ‘NATO’s Role in Cyberspace’ (February 2019) <www.nato.int 2019=\"\" also-in-2019=\"\" natos-role-in-cyberspace-alliance-defence=\"\" den=\"\" index.htm=\"\" docu=\"\" review=\"\">; C Porter and K Jordan, ‘Don’t Let Cyber Attribution Debates Tear Apart the NATO Alliance’ (Lawfare Blog, 14 February 2019) <www.lawfareblog.com dont-let-cyber-attribution-debates-tear-apart-nato-alliance=\"\">; NATO has so far not specified what level of severity would be needed for an armed attack in the cyber context.

According to the NATO website, ‘almost all Allies have upgraded their cyber defences’ since adopting the Pledge.52 Measures such as these further facilitate intelligence-sharing between states, as states with a higher level of security will trust other ‘more cyber capable Allies’ more than those with less secure cyber defense mechanisms.53\nNATO is also cooperating with regional organisations, such as the EU, on questions regarding better intelligence-sharing to counter cyber threats. In a Joint Declaration in 2016, the EU and NATO noted the ‘urgent need to: Boost [the EU’s and NATO’s] ability to counter hybrid threats, including by bolstering resilience, working together on analysis, prevention, and early detection, through timely information sharing and, to the extent possible, intelligence sharing between staffs; and cooperating on strategic communication and response.’54 Also, amongst other initiatives, the EU Computer Emergency Response Team and the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability have concluded a ‘Technical Arrangement on Cyber Defence’ in 2016, providing a framework where both sides can better exchange information and share best practices on cyber defence.55\nIn sum, NATO has realised that there is a need to increase its capacities to become an effective platform of assistance and cooperation for its members to counter cyber threats (which also includes attribution). Measures such as the Cyber Defense Pledge or cooperation agreements with other organisations seem to help with capacity-building and better cooperation. However, it is evident that an institutionalised system comparable to the EU’s ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ does not exist.\n## 4. The US Cyber Deterrence Initiative\nThe concept of the so-called US Cyber Deterrence Initiative first appeared in the US National Cyber Strategy of September 2018.56 It is part of the US National Cyber Strategy’s Third Pillar (‘Preserve Peace Through Strength’) and entails the coordination with and support of like-minded states in combatting ‘malicious cyber behaviour’.57 This also includes, amongst others, supporting each other’s attribution claims, which – according to Robert Strayer, Deputy\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.whitehouse.gov></www.nato.int></www.nato.int>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nAssistant Secretary of State for cyber and international communications and information policy – is the second of the Initiative’s four elements.\nThe US Cyber Strategy describes methods of collective attribution as follows:\n‘Objective and actionable intelligence will be shared across the United States Government and with key partners to identify hostile foreign nation states [...]. The United States will work with like-minded states to coordinate and support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken, and joint imposition of consequences against malign actors’.\nConcerning evidentiary standards, the Cyber Strategy itself does not reveal much. However, in a paper titled ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence explains different levels of confidence (high, moderate and low) which analysts adhere to when assessing the available evidence. High confidence exists when responsibility of a certain actor can be proven ‘beyond reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative’. Moderate confidence is given when the evidence is clear and convincing, and low confidence is given when ‘more than half of the body of evidence points to one thing, but there are significant information gaps’. Still, the paper does not explicitly elaborate upon which level of confidence suffices in order to conduct an attribution. In case of high confidence, it will, however, most certainly be possible to undertake an attribution.\nIn order to bring more states on board for a collective attribution, states will have to be on similar levels regarding their capacities to attribute. Hence, similar to NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Strategy aims at building ‘international cyber capacity’ that ‘will empower international partners to implement policies and practices which allow them to be effective partners in the United States-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative’. Further details on how capacity-building will be achieved are also not publicly available.\nHowever, unlike mechanisms within NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative seems to allow more flexible alliances, which can differ depending on the activity to be attributed. While NATO and EU decisions are consensus-based and thus require the backing of all its member states, the US Initiative may enable the creation of ad hoc alliances. This may allow the Initiative to act more swiftly in critical situations. A potential downside of such an\n Ibid; cf T Starks, ‘Top State Cyber Official Talks Huawei, Deterrence’ (Politico, 20 March 2019) <www.politico.com 03=\"\" 20=\"\" 2019=\"\" newsletters=\"\" morning-cybersecurity=\"\" top-state-cyber-official-talks-huawei-deterrence-552356=\"\">; the first element entails making a decision on the type of activity the US would like to deter. The second element focuses on the improvement of methods of collective attribution. The third element is about focusing on the measures of imposing consequences on malicious actors. The fourth and last element is about the actual deterrence – publicly warning malicious actors of the consequences.\n See US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 21.\n See ODNI, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (n 1) 4.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 26; Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45).\n cf Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45); on possible advantages of such ad-hoc collaboration see K E Eichensehr, ‘The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution’ (forthcoming 2020) 67 UCLA Law Review 61.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.politico.com>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\narrangement, however, would be a lack of institutional knowledge between states that continuously work together to achieve a collective attribution. Regardless, there is no public information available whether this Initiative has ever been put to actual use.\n# 5. Conclusion\nTo summarise, there is potential within the EU's Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and its newly adopted sanctions regime, NATO's alliance and the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative, to tackle the 'attribution problem'. These collective mechanisms might help release the burden of attribution by one state and increase the political pressure on the alleged wrongful state, which might even perhaps deter future 'malicious' cyber incidents. However, the biggest issue for collective attribution seems to be a lack of trust between states, which, in turn, hinders them to take collective action. Without having the possibility to assess the evidence regarding attribution by other states themselves and the fact that states usually underline that there is no international obligation to share evidence,[65] states will most likely be reluctant to support attribution claims. Closely interlinked with this is the question whether common evidentiary standards might be helpful to solve this problem. In any event, states will tend to refuse to attribute if doing so could potentially harm their international relations with the alleged wrongful state. The lack of technical expertise and insecure cyber defence systems within some states compared to other technologically well-equipped states does not help with building trust either. Hence why capacity-building is crucial, also for a collective attribution effort. To conclude, although there seems to be potential within the above-mentioned mechanisms, it is questionable whether states will make use of them or remain fairly reluctant to attribute.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297",

Introduction\nWhile there is an increasing consensus that attribution in the cyber context is not entirely impossible, the actual act of attributing cyber operations to a state has remained difficult. Reasons include a lack of sufficient technical capacities within the victim states to attribute the attack, national security interests barring the states from disclosing intelligence on which a potential public attribution would be based, or the reluctance of states to undermine their good relations with alleged wrongful states. To overcome these political challenges, there has recently been an increased interest within academia, civil societies and private companies in the establishment of an independent body supervising the attribution of cyber operations to states. But also on an inter-state level, states have relatively recently undergone efforts of collective attribution, such as in the case of the NotPetya and WannaCry cyber incidents, and, most recently, the cyber operations against Georgia. Collective efforts have the advantage of increasing the credibility of attribution findings, and the attribution claim gains more political weight the more states join in, which in turn might have a beneficial deterrent effect on the\n See, *ia* Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (14 September 2018) 2, <www.dni.gov 00ni_a_guide_to_cyber_attribution.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" documents=\"\" cjb:ctiic=\"\" other=\"\" references=\"\" to=\"\" online=\"\" sources=\"\" the=\"\" to=\"\" where:=\"\">; references to online sources are accurate as of 3 July 2020.\n See *ia* Microsoft, ‘An Attribution Organization to Strengthen Trust Online’ (Microsoft Policy Papers, 2017) <www.microsoft.com an-attribution-organization-to-strengthen-trust-online=\"\" en-us=\"\" cybersecurity=\"\" content-hub=\"\">; J S Davis and others, ‘Stateless Attribution: Toward International Accountability in Cyberspace’ (Rand Corporation, 2017) <www.rand.org 2017=\"\" 12=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2018=\"\" j=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" nelson-states=\"\" press=\"\" pubs=\"\" research_reports=\"\" rn2081.html=\"\" www.rand.org=\"\">; S Charncy, ‘Cybersecurity Norms for Nation-States and the Global ICT Industry’ (Microsoft Blog, 23 June 2016) <blogs.microsoft.com 2016=\"\" 06=\"\" 06=\"\" 2018=\"\" cjb:=\"\" cjb:cti-industry=\"\" on-the-issues=\"\" online=\"\" research=\"\" www.artlantic.org=\"\" www.ratlantic.org=\"\"></blogs.microsoft.com></www.rand.org></www.racn-cry></www.racn-cry></www.dni.gov>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nwrongful state(s). This is perhaps also the reason why organisations such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have lately been working on strengthening their collective capabilities within the cyber realm. But also the United States, with its recently launched ‘Cyber Deterrence Initiative’, is focusing more on mobilising allied states to undertake collective attributions. This paper will thus provide an overview on these already existing developments of a potential international attribution mechanism for cyber operations at the EU and NATO level, as well as touch briefly on measures taken by the US in this context.\n## 2. The European Union\nThe EU has relatively recently taken up the challenge of building a collective cyber security mechanism across the EU. It has also realised that it needs to step up its game regarding its attribution capabilities. A significant milestone was finding consensus on creating a set of measures which the EU and its member states can resort to in the case of a cyber incident threatening the security of the Union. This set of measures was named the ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ (for further details see below) and also addresses the question how the EU attempts to deal with the issue of attributing these cyber incidents to state or non-state actors. Before addressing these measures, however, it is important to note how the EU defines ‘attribution’.\nAccording to an early draft version of the European External Action Service, attribution is defined as ‘the practice of assigning responsibility for malicious cyber activity to a specific actor or sponsor’. Regarding the fact that no specific reference is made to a state actor, this definition seems to imply that the EU regards ‘attribution’ in a broader sense than it is understood under the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles). Moreover, the EU is keen to note that attribution is a ‘sovereign political\n When referring to the European Union, reference is made to all main institutions – the European Commission, the Council, the European Council and the European Parliament, either collectively or in their singular capacity, as representing the EU as a whole, unless otherwise stated.\n For example, the EU adopted its first Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013, see European Commission Press Release, ‘EU Cybersecurity Plan to Protect Open Internet and Online Freedom and Opportunity’ (Digital Single Market News, 7 February 2013) <ec.europa.eu en=\"\" digital-single-market=\"\" eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity=\"\" news=\"\">.\n See eg European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, ‘Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council: Increasing Resilience and Bolstering Capabilities to Address Hybrid Threats’ (13 June 2018) JOIN (2018) 16 final, 8.\n See General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Council Conclusions on a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (“Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox”)’ (19 June 2017) Doc 10474/17, <data.consilium.europa.eu dec=\"\" document=\"\" en=\"\" pt=\"\" st-10474-2017-init=\"\">.\n European External Action Service, ‘Implementation of the Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities – Attribution of Malicious Cyber Activities – Discussion of a Revised Text’ (18 March 2019) Doc 6852/1/19 REV 1, 3, <www.statewatch.org 2019=\"\" eu-council-cyber-6852-rev-1-19.pdf=\"\" news=\"\" www.2019=\"\">; note, however, that this draft version is the only available version online.\n UN ILC, ‘Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (2001) GAOR, 53rd Session, Supp No 10; the ILC Articles are widely held to reflect customary international law; note that the EU heavily emphasises, in most of its documents regarding cyber security, that ‘existing international law is applicable to cyberspace’ (see for example Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler!

This is reflected in the recent establishment of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and the EU cyber sanctions regime. Both will be discussed in the following sub-chapters.\n## 2.1. The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\nThe EU has adopted the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox in June 2017. The Toolbox describes a set of measures with which the EU can respond to so-called ‘malicious’ cyber activities under its Common Foreign and Security Policy. To be specific, the Council of the European Union decides which measures to take, based on a proposal by a Member State or the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Measures that can be taken include démarches (i.e. diplomatic visits, usually to a state representative in charge of the dossier), public statements condemning the cyber activity, confidence-building measures, political dialogues or even restrictive measures (these will be addressed in a separate point below).\nThe Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (hereinafter: Draft Implementing Guidelines) note that in order to resort to some, but not all, measures, prior attribution of a cyber activity is required. They also seem to distinguish between measures that require firm attribution and those that do not (eg when contacting states whose territory may have been used to conduct a ‘malicious cyber activity’). What level of proof is required for a firm attribution and for any other attribution is not specified in the available documents. An earlier draft version of an EU paper on attribution contained a so-called ‘uncertainty yardstick’, developed by the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN), the intelligence body of the European External Action Service (EEAS),\n General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities’ (9 October 2017) Doc 13007/17, 13, <https: en=\"\" document=\"\" document?st-13007-2017-init=\"\" data.consilium.europa.eu=\"\" en=\"\" pdf=\"\">; the draft version is the only version available online; cf also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.) 4.\n See Council of the EU Press Release, ‘Cyber Attacks: EU Ready to Respond with a Range of Measures, Including Sanctions’ (19 June 2017) <www.consilium.europa.eu en=\"\" press=\"\" press-releases=\"\" 06=\"\" 19=\"\" 2017=\"\" cyber-diplomacy-toolbox=\"\"></www.consilium.europa.eu>; see also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.).\n The Council noted specifically that malicious cyber activities ‘may constitute wrongful acts under international law and could give rise to a joint EU response’, see EU Press Release (n 11).\n The Council consists of the respective ministers of each EU member state and is, next to the European Parliament and the European Commission, one of the three legislative bodies of the European Union.\n See Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 6ff.\n Ibid, 14; see also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.) 4.\n See Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 8: ‘When one or more Member States are impacted by a malicious cyber activity, it could be beneficial to jointly contact States exercising jurisdiction over these territories that have been used for conducting the malicious activity. [...] The benefit of such signalling is that it can generally be done without requiring firm attribution’ [emphasis added].\n The EEAS serves as a diplomatic body of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and exercises foreign ministry and defense ministry functions for the EU; the EU INTCEN is tasked with providing intelligence analyses to EU decision-making bodies, which are based on information voluntarily provided by the EU member states.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</https:>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nwhich divided the range of probabilities of an attribution into percentages from 0-5% (remote chance) to 95-100% (almost certain). This yardstick, however, was removed in a later draft version.\nIt is important to note that, despite the involvement of European cyber institutions to help in the process of attribution, the power to decide to attribute remains within the hands of the member states: The Council notes that the EU INTCEN, along with other competent European ‘cyber institutions’ (such as the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) network established under Article 12 of the EU Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive), the European Cybercrime Centre, European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) or the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions (CERT-EU)), ‘plays a valuable role [...] by sharing its analyses and information related to the origin of the malicious cyber activity’. Thus, institutions such as INTCEN are there to facilitate rather than make the decision to attribute a certain activity to a specific actor. This may entail collecting and assessing information received by member states, third states or collected on its own, followed by an analysis of the received and/or collected information. This analysis may, for example, contain a conclusion that the cyber activity, based on the available information, is with a high likelihood attributable to state X or Y. Member states may then assess this information based on their ‘sovereign prerogative’ of attribution and decide whether they agree with the analysis or not.\nWhether member states will have access to the information upon which INTCEN and others created their conclusions is not clear. Especially when it comes to classified information, it is highly unlikely that the information received by one member state or a third party can be shared with the rest of the member states. In this case, member states are supposed to decide whether they follow the conclusions made by these bodies without having access to the underlying information. This decision to attribute has to be taken unanimously by all member states, if taken by the EU as a whole.\nAn additional issue is that, according to the Implementing Guidelines ‘Member States are not obliged to provide information or analysis when it [sic] considers this as contrary to the essential interests of its [sic] national security.’ As the necessary information will usually be linked to essential interests of a state’s national security, it might be difficult to receive valuable information at all.\nIt is also not clear what level of proof the EU regards as having to be met in order to attribute successfully. As already mentioned above, there seems to have been a discussion about\n Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 10.\n Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 Concerning Measures for a High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Across the Union, OJ L194/1; the NIS Directive is the first EU legislation addressing cybersecurity, and seeks to improve and harmonise the level of cybersecurity within the EU.\n Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 13.\n Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 2.\n Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 11.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\ncategorising evidence into ranges of probability. This proposal has, however, been dropped. There is no official statement so far by the EU on this matter.\nTo conclude, despite having INTCEN and others undertake an analysis on attribution, the responsibility to attribute remains with the member states. This means that building trust between member states is crucial. In this respect, at least having a framework to task impartial bodies with the analysis might facilitate building trust and eventually, better intelligence-sharing between member states. This impartial body, however, still relies on information provided by member states.\n## 2.2. Cyber Sanctions Regime:\nOn 17 May 2019, Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 and Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against ‘cyber attacks’ threatening the EU or its member states have entered into force. The Decision, which initially applied until 18 May 2020, was amended on 14 May 2020 to apply until 18 May 2021. The Decision and the Regulation form the basis of the new ‘cyber sanctions regime’ adopted by the EU. They impose entry restrictions on, and the freezing of funds of, persons that are responsible for ‘cyber attacks’ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, persons who provide financial, technical or material support for or are otherwise involved in ‘cyber attacks’ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, or others associated with these persons.\nFor that purpose, and in line with the procedure in other sanctions regimes, an Annex to the Decision and Regulation shall contain a list of these ‘persons, entities and bodies’ whose funds shall be frozen and who shall be denied entry into the EU’s member states. These may be added by the Council, acting in unanimity ‘upon a proposal from a member state or from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy’. This means that all member states will have to agree on adding certain actors to this list, but can also veto any proposal made by a member state or the High Representative.

Also, the list in the Annex ‘shall be reviewed at regular intervals and at least every 12 months’. Currently, the Annex does not contain any persons, entities or bodies. Most recently, however, Germany has announced that it will propose listing certain Russian individuals involved in a large-scale hack against the German Bundestag in 2015. Importantly, one of the individuals was most certainly working for the Russian GRU at the time of the event. At the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether Germany will be successful with its proposal.\nRecital 9 of the Council Decision notes that ‘[t]argeted restrictive measures should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyber-attacks to a third State. The application of targeted restrictive measures does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken on a case-by-case basis. Every Member State is free to make its own determination with respect to the attribution of cyber-attacks to a third State.’\nIn this context, it may be noted that there is no reference in the EU legal texts that the cyber sanctions regime is only restricted to sanctioning non-state actors who have no affiliation to a state. To the contrary, it seems to have been in the EU’s interests to also be able to impose sanctions on state actors, as the Implementing Guidelines note that restrictive measures could also be used ‘[i]n the case where the malicious cyber activity is being carried out by a State, as well as in the case when a State is deemed responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that is acting under its direction or control, or if this State recognizes and adopts the behaviour of such a non-state actor as its own’. Here, reference is clearly made to the rules of attribution enshrined in the ILC Articles and, to some extent, the language of Articles 8 and 11 ILC Articles is used.\nFor a state to be held responsible under international law, the act must be attributable to the state and constitute ‘a breach of an international obligation of the state.’ Thus, attribution of an act to a state alone does not lead to any consequences under the law of state responsibility. Politically, however, it is questionable how listing state-affiliated actors in the Annex – a decision taken by all EU member states in their sovereign capacity – can be done without undertaking a collective attribution through the EU. For example, if the EU decided to list the Russian individual allegedly working for the GRU and involved in the German Bundestag hack\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\n Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union [2012] OJ C326/47; cf General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Sanctions Guidelines – Update’ (4 May 2018) Doc 5664/18, 56.\n See Article 13(4) CR 2019/796 (n 24).\n German Federal Foreign Office, ‘Federal Foreign Office on the Hacker Attack on the German Bundestag’ (Press Release, 28 May 2020) <www.auswaertiges-amt.de en=\"\" hacker-attack-bundestag=\"\" newsroom=\"\" newss=\"\" 2345580=\"\">.\n Ibid.\n Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 5.\n Article 8 ILC Articles (n 9) stipulates that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.’; Article 11 stipulates that ‘[c]onduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.’\n Article 2 ILC Articles (n 9).</www.auswaertiges-amt.de>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\n- something the EU cyber sanctions regime enables the member states to do – the EU would officially condemn the actions of a Russian state organ.\nSecond, if all EU member states have to unanimously decide who will be added to this list, this act of collective attribution remains in their responsibility. One might assume that the EU is reluctant, from a foreign policy perspective, to condemn an entire state for committing a ‘malicious’ cyber activity. By listing only individuals and entities instead, attribution can be avoided and (hopefully) good relations with the affiliated state can be maintained. This cautious (and inconsistent) approach indicates the EU’s reluctance to undergo collective attribution efforts.\nRegarding evidentiary standards necessary for listing: According to the EU’s Sanctions Guidelines, listing proposals must contain ‘accurate, up-to-date and defendable statements of reasons’. The reasons for listings should moreover be ‘capable of being made public’. However, ‘[i]n exceptional cases, where it is considered that the reasons for the listing are not suitable for publication, because of considerations of privacy and security, the reasons will need to be addressed separately to the person, group or entity concerned.’ In any case, the evidence must be sufficient to withstand examination by the European Court of Justice.\nWhether listing certain actors under the Annex is defined as attribution or not, the EU’s cyber sanctions regime may, on the one hand, facilitate cooperative efforts to avoid impunity for ‘malicious’ cyber acts and, on the other hand, provide helpful indications what evidence states may find sufficient enough in order to publicly condemn a ‘malicious’ behaviour in cyberspace. Of course, this will only become possible as soon as someone will actually be listed in the Annex. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether clear conclusions may be drawn therefrom. As listing actors in the Annex needs to follow a unanimous decision, it is highly likely that the EU will only enforce measures against actors whose listings are not too harmful for the EU member states’ political interests.\n# 3. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nSimilar to the EU, NATO is a consensus-based alliance, which means that any decision taken by NATO is agreed unanimously by all its member states. Within this mechanism, NATO agreed in 2016 that cyberspace is a ‘domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself\n cf Article 4 ILC Articles (n 9).\n Sanctions Guidelines – Update (n 31) para 17.\n Ibid, Annex I, para 10.\n Ibid.\n cf European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Mellat v Council of the European Union (29 January 2013) Case T-496/10, para 77; European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Saderat Iran v Council of the European Union (5 February 2013) Case T-494/10, para 73.\n NATO’s practice of consensus-based decision-making has been applied since its founding, despite a lack of any specific provision in the founding documents requiring NATO member states to do so; for further details see T Gill and others (eds), Leuven Manual on the International Law Applicable to Peace Operations (Cambridge University Press 2017) 68f.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nas effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea’. Two years previously, NATO allies agreed that an ‘armed attack’ as referred to in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty may also be applicable to a cyber attack, as long as the cyber attack reaches the severity of an ‘armed attack’. According to Article 5, this would mean that such a cyber attack against one NATO member constitutes an attack against all NATO members, triggering their obligation to assist the harmed state in taking defensive measures to ‘restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.’ In order to take action, however, knowing who to defend against is crucial.\nIn cases of cyber operations below the threshold of an armed attack, Article 4 of the Washington Treaty calls on the NATO members to ‘consult together’ if the ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’. Here as well, attribution is important. The process of consultation includes exchanging information and opinions, and might also be used to discuss the attribution of the act to a state prior to launching a collaborative NATO operation. Article 4 thus likewise enables the sharing of intelligence especially in the context of cyber attribution. At least once, NATO has arguably already joined a collective attribution initiated by the Dutch and British governments in the cyber context, condemning the Russian hacking activities against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018. There is, however, no public information available whether NATO resorted to Article 4 in this context, nor whether it considered adhering to any evidentiary standards for attributing the act to Russia.\nThe consultation process can, in some circumstances, lead to a joint decision or action, which may include condemning acts of the wrongful state (after having attributed the activity successfully). It is clear, however, that this would have to happen in consensus with all NATO allies, which could require that – especially in the context of attribution – all NATO members are equally equipped with the necessary information and capacities to make a profound decision. To build this community of trust where NATO members can share information\n NATO Press Release, ‘Warsaw Summit Communiqué’ (9 July 2016) para 70, <www.nato.int cps=\"\" on=\"\" official_texts_133169.htm=\"\" natohq=\"\">.\n See NATO Press Release, ‘Wales Summit Declaration’ (5 September 2014) para 72, <www.nato.int cps=\"\" on=\"\" official_texts_112964.htm=\"\" natohq=\"\">; see also NATO Review Magazine, ‘NATO’s Role in Cyberspace’ (February 2019) <www.nato.int 2019=\"\" also-in-2019=\"\" natos-role-in-cyberspace-alliance-defence=\"\" den=\"\" index.htm=\"\" docu=\"\" review=\"\">; C Porter and K Jordan, ‘Don’t Let Cyber Attribution Debates Tear Apart the NATO Alliance’ (Lawfare Blog, 14 February 2019) <www.lawfareblog.com dont-let-cyber-attribution-debates-tear-apart-nato-alliance=\"\">; NATO has so far not specified what level of severity would be needed for an armed attack in the cyber context.

According to the NATO website, ‘almost all Allies have upgraded their cyber defences’ since adopting the Pledge.52 Measures such as these further facilitate intelligence-sharing between states, as states with a higher level of security will trust other ‘more cyber capable Allies’ more than those with less secure cyber defense mechanisms.53\nNATO is also cooperating with regional organisations, such as the EU, on questions regarding better intelligence-sharing to counter cyber threats. In a Joint Declaration in 2016, the EU and NATO noted the ‘urgent need to: Boost [the EU’s and NATO’s] ability to counter hybrid threats, including by bolstering resilience, working together on analysis, prevention, and early detection, through timely information sharing and, to the extent possible, intelligence sharing between staffs; and cooperating on strategic communication and response.’54 Also, amongst other initiatives, the EU Computer Emergency Response Team and the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability have concluded a ‘Technical Arrangement on Cyber Defence’ in 2016, providing a framework where both sides can better exchange information and share best practices on cyber defence.55\nIn sum, NATO has realised that there is a need to increase its capacities to become an effective platform of assistance and cooperation for its members to counter cyber threats (which also includes attribution). Measures such as the Cyber Defense Pledge or cooperation agreements with other organisations seem to help with capacity-building and better cooperation. However, it is evident that an institutionalised system comparable to the EU’s ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ does not exist.\n## 4. The US Cyber Deterrence Initiative\nThe concept of the so-called US Cyber Deterrence Initiative first appeared in the US National Cyber Strategy of September 2018.56 It is part of the US National Cyber Strategy’s Third Pillar (‘Preserve Peace Through Strength’) and entails the coordination with and support of like-minded states in combatting ‘malicious cyber behaviour’.57 This also includes, amongst others, supporting each other’s attribution claims, which – according to Robert Strayer, Deputy\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.whitehouse.gov></www.nato.int></www.nato.int>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nAssistant Secretary of State for cyber and international communications and information policy – is the second of the Initiative’s four elements.\nThe US Cyber Strategy describes methods of collective attribution as follows:\n‘Objective and actionable intelligence will be shared across the United States Government and with key partners to identify hostile foreign nation states [...]. The United States will work with like-minded states to coordinate and support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken, and joint imposition of consequences against malign actors’.\nConcerning evidentiary standards, the Cyber Strategy itself does not reveal much. However, in a paper titled ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence explains different levels of confidence (high, moderate and low) which analysts adhere to when assessing the available evidence. High confidence exists when responsibility of a certain actor can be proven ‘beyond reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative’. Moderate confidence is given when the evidence is clear and convincing, and low confidence is given when ‘more than half of the body of evidence points to one thing, but there are significant information gaps’. Still, the paper does not explicitly elaborate upon which level of confidence suffices in order to conduct an attribution. In case of high confidence, it will, however, most certainly be possible to undertake an attribution.\nIn order to bring more states on board for a collective attribution, states will have to be on similar levels regarding their capacities to attribute. Hence, similar to NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Strategy aims at building ‘international cyber capacity’ that ‘will empower international partners to implement policies and practices which allow them to be effective partners in the United States-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative’. Further details on how capacity-building will be achieved are also not publicly available.\nHowever, unlike mechanisms within NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative seems to allow more flexible alliances, which can differ depending on the activity to be attributed. While NATO and EU decisions are consensus-based and thus require the backing of all its member states, the US Initiative may enable the creation of ad hoc alliances. This may allow the Initiative to act more swiftly in critical situations. A potential downside of such an\n Ibid; cf T Starks, ‘Top State Cyber Official Talks Huawei, Deterrence’ (Politico, 20 March 2019) <www.politico.com 03=\"\" 20=\"\" 2019=\"\" newsletters=\"\" morning-cybersecurity=\"\" top-state-cyber-official-talks-huawei-deterrence-552356=\"\">; the first element entails making a decision on the type of activity the US would like to deter. The second element focuses on the improvement of methods of collective attribution. The third element is about focusing on the measures of imposing consequences on malicious actors. The fourth and last element is about the actual deterrence – publicly warning malicious actors of the consequences.\n See US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 21.\n See ODNI, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (n 1) 4.\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 26; Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45).\n cf Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45); on possible advantages of such ad-hoc collaboration see K E Eichensehr, ‘The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution’ (forthcoming 2020) 67 UCLA Law Review 61.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.politico.com>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\narrangement, however, would be a lack of institutional knowledge between states that continuously work together to achieve a collective attribution. Regardless, there is no public information available whether this Initiative has ever been put to actual use.\n# 5. Conclusion\nTo summarise, there is potential within the EU's Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and its newly adopted sanctions regime, NATO's alliance and the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative, to tackle the 'attribution problem'. These collective mechanisms might help release the burden of attribution by one state and increase the political pressure on the alleged wrongful state, which might even perhaps deter future 'malicious' cyber incidents. However, the biggest issue for collective attribution seems to be a lack of trust between states, which, in turn, hinders them to take collective action. Without having the possibility to assess the evidence regarding attribution by other states themselves and the fact that states usually underline that there is no international obligation to share evidence,[65] states will most likely be reluctant to support attribution claims. Closely interlinked with this is the question whether common evidentiary standards might be helpful to solve this problem. In any event, states will tend to refuse to attribute if doing so could potentially harm their international relations with the alleged wrongful state. The lack of technical expertise and insecure cyber defence systems within some states compared to other technologically well-equipped states does not help with building trust either. Hence why capacity-building is crucial, also for a collective attribution effort. To conclude, although there seems to be potential within the above-mentioned mechanisms, it is questionable whether states will make use of them or remain fairly reluctant to attribute.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297"

Introduction\nWhile there is an increasing consensus that attribution in the cyber context is not entirely impossible,¹ the actual act of attributing cyber operations to a state has remained difficult. Reasons include a lack of sufficient technical capacities within the victim states to attribute the attack, national security interests barring the states from disclosing intelligence on which a potential public attribution would be based, or the reluctance of states to undermine their good relations with alleged wrongful states. To overcome these political challenges, there has recently been an increased interest within academia, civil societies and private companies in the establishment of an independent body supervising the attribution of cyber operations to states.² But also on an inter-state level, states have relatively recently undergone efforts of collective attribution, such as in the case of the NotPetya and WannaCry cyber incidents, and, most recently, the cyber operations against Georgia.³ Collective efforts have the advantage of increasing the credibility of attribution findings, and the attribution claim gains more political weight the more states join in, which in turn might have a beneficial deterrent effect on the\n¹ See, *ia* Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (14 September 2018) 2, <www.dni.gov 00ni_a_guide_to_cyber_attribution.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" documents=\"\" cjb:ctiic=\"\" other=\"\" references=\"\" to=\"\" online=\"\" sources=\"\" the=\"\" to=\"\" where:=\"\">; references to online sources are accurate as of 3 July 2020.\n² See *ia* Microsoft, ‘An Attribution Organization to Strengthen Trust Online’ (Microsoft Policy Papers, 2017) <www.microsoft.com an-attribution-organization-to-strengthen-trust-online=\"\" en-us=\"\" cybersecurity=\"\" content-hub=\"\">; J S Davis and others, ‘Stateless Attribution: Toward International Accountability in Cyberspace’ (Rand Corporation, 2017) <www.rand.org 2017=\"\" 12=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" icct4peace-2018=\"\" j=\"\" icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\" nelson-states=\"\" press=\"\" pubs=\"\" research_reports=\"\" rn2081.html=\"\" www.rand.org=\"\">; S Charncy, ‘Cybersecurity Norms for Nation-States and the Global ICT Industry’ (Microsoft Blog, 23 June 2016) <blogs.microsoft.com 2016=\"\" 06=\"\" 06=\"\" 2018=\"\" cjb:=\"\" cjb:cti-industry=\"\" on-the-issues=\"\" online=\"\" research=\"\" www.artlantic.org=\"\" www.ratlantic.org=\"\"></blogs.microsoft.com></www.rand.org></www.racn-cry></www.racn-cry></www.dni.gov>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nwrongful state(s). This is perhaps also the reason why organisations such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have lately been working on strengthening their collective capabilities within the cyber realm. But also the United States, with its recently launched ‘Cyber Deterrence Initiative’, is focusing more on mobilising allied states to undertake collective attributions. This paper will thus provide an overview on these already existing developments of a potential international attribution mechanism for cyber operations at the EU and NATO level, as well as touch briefly on measures taken by the US in this context.\n## 2. The European Union⁴\nThe EU has relatively recently taken up the challenge of building a collective cyber security mechanism across the EU.⁵ It has also realised that it needs to step up its game regarding its attribution capabilities.⁶ A significant milestone was finding consensus on creating a set of measures which the EU and its member states can resort to in the case of a cyber incident threatening the security of the Union. This set of measures was named the ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ (for further details see below) and also addresses the question how the EU attempts to deal with the issue of attributing these cyber incidents to state or non-state actors.⁷ Before addressing these measures, however, it is important to note how the EU defines ‘attribution’.\nAccording to an early draft version of the European External Action Service, attribution is defined as ‘the practice of assigning responsibility for malicious cyber activity to a specific actor or sponsor’.⁸ Regarding the fact that no specific reference is made to a state actor, this definition seems to imply that the EU regards ‘attribution’ in a broader sense than it is understood under the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles).⁹ Moreover, the EU is keen to note that attribution is a ‘sovereign political\n⁴ When referring to the European Union, reference is made to all main institutions – the European Commission, the Council, the European Council and the European Parliament, either collectively or in their singular capacity, as representing the EU as a whole, unless otherwise stated.\n⁵ For example, the EU adopted its first Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013, see European Commission Press Release, ‘EU Cybersecurity Plan to Protect Open Internet and Online Freedom and Opportunity’ (Digital Single Market News, 7 February 2013) <ec.europa.eu en=\"\" digital-single-market=\"\" eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity=\"\" news=\"\">.\n⁶ See eg European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, ‘Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council: Increasing Resilience and Bolstering Capabilities to Address Hybrid Threats’ (13 June 2018) JOIN (2018) 16 final, 8.\n⁷ See General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Council Conclusions on a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (“Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox”)’ (19 June 2017) Doc 10474/17, <data.consilium.europa.eu dec=\"\" document=\"\" en=\"\" pt=\"\" st-10474-2017-init=\"\">.\n⁸ European External Action Service, ‘Implementation of the Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities – Attribution of Malicious Cyber Activities – Discussion of a Revised Text’ (18 March 2019) Doc 6852/1/19 REV 1, 3, <www.statewatch.org 2019=\"\" eu-council-cyber-6852-rev-1-19.pdf=\"\" news=\"\" www.2019=\"\">; note, however, that this draft version is the only available version online.\n⁹ UN ILC, ‘Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (2001) GAOR, 53rd Session, Supp No 10; the ILC Articles are widely held to reflect customary international law; note that the EU heavily emphasises, in most of its documents regarding cyber security, that ‘existing international law is applicable to cyberspace’ (see for example Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler!

This is reflected in the recent establishment of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and the EU cyber sanctions regime. Both will be discussed in the following sub-chapters.\n## 2.1. The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\nThe EU has adopted the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox in June 2017.¹¹ The Toolbox describes a set of measures with which the EU can respond to so-called ‘malicious’ cyber activities¹² under its Common Foreign and Security Policy. To be specific, the Council of the European Union¹³ decides which measures to take, based on a proposal by a Member State or the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Measures that can be taken include démarches (i.e. diplomatic visits, usually to a state representative in charge of the dossier), public statements condemning the cyber activity, confidence-building measures, political dialogues or even restrictive measures (these will be addressed in a separate point below).¹⁴\nThe Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (hereinafter: Draft Implementing Guidelines) note that in order to resort to some, but not all, measures, prior attribution of a cyber activity is required.¹⁵ They also seem to distinguish between measures that require firm attribution and those that do not (eg when contacting states whose territory may have been used to conduct a ‘malicious cyber activity’).¹⁶ What level of proof is required for a firm attribution and for any other attribution is not specified in the available documents. An earlier draft version of an EU paper on attribution contained a so-called ‘uncertainty yardstick’, developed by the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN), the intelligence body of the European External Action Service (EEAS)¹⁷,\n¹⁰ General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities’ (9 October 2017) Doc 13007/17, 13, <https: en=\"\" document=\"\" document?st-13007-2017-init=\"\" data.consilium.europa.eu=\"\" en=\"\" pdf=\"\">; the draft version is the only version available online; cf also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler!

Textmarke nicht definiert.) 4.\n¹⁶ See Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 8: ‘When one or more Member States are impacted by a malicious cyber activity, it could be beneficial to jointly contact States exercising jurisdiction over these territories that have been used for conducting the malicious activity. [...] The benefit of such signalling is that it can generally be done without requiring firm attribution’ [emphasis added].\n¹⁷ The EEAS serves as a diplomatic body of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and exercises foreign ministry and defense ministry functions for the EU; the EU INTCEN is tasked with providing intelligence analyses to EU decision-making bodies, which are based on information voluntarily provided by the EU member states.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</https:>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nwhich divided the range of probabilities of an attribution into percentages from 0-5% (remote chance) to 95-100% (almost certain). This yardstick, however, was removed in a later draft version.¹⁸\nIt is important to note that, despite the involvement of European cyber institutions to help in the process of attribution, the power to decide to attribute remains within the hands of the member states: The Council notes that the EU INTCEN, along with other competent European ‘cyber institutions’ (such as the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) network established under Article 12 of the EU Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)¹⁹, the European Cybercrime Centre, European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) or the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions (CERT-EU)), ‘plays a valuable role [...] by sharing its analyses and information related to the origin of the malicious cyber activity’.²⁰ Thus, institutions such as INTCEN are there to facilitate rather than make the decision to attribute a certain activity to a specific actor. This may entail collecting and assessing information received by member states, third states or collected on its own, followed by an analysis of the received and/or collected information. This analysis may, for example, contain a conclusion that the cyber activity, based on the available information, is with a high likelihood attributable to state X or Y. Member states may then assess this information based on their ‘sovereign prerogative’ of attribution and decide whether they agree with the analysis or not.\nWhether member states will have access to the information upon which INTCEN and others created their conclusions is not clear. Especially when it comes to classified information, it is highly unlikely that the information received by one member state or a third party can be shared with the rest of the member states. In this case, member states are supposed to decide whether they follow the conclusions made by these bodies without having access to the underlying information. This decision to attribute has to be taken unanimously by all member states, if taken by the EU as a whole.²¹\nAn additional issue is that, according to the Implementing Guidelines ‘Member States are not obliged to provide information or analysis when it [sic] considers this as contrary to the essential interests of its [sic] national security.’²² As the necessary information will usually be linked to essential interests of a state’s national security, it might be difficult to receive valuable information at all.\nIt is also not clear what level of proof the EU regards as having to be met in order to attribute successfully. As already mentioned above, there seems to have been a discussion about\n¹⁸ Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 10.\n¹⁹ Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 Concerning Measures for a High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Across the Union, OJ L194/1; the NIS Directive is the first EU legislation addressing cybersecurity, and seeks to improve and harmonise the level of cybersecurity within the EU.\n²⁰ Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 13.\n²¹ Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 2.\n²² Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 11.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\ncategorising evidence into ranges of probability. This proposal has, however, been dropped. There is no official statement so far by the EU on this matter.\nTo conclude, despite having INTCEN and others undertake an analysis on attribution, the responsibility to attribute remains with the member states. This means that building trust between member states is crucial. In this respect, at least having a framework to task impartial bodies with the analysis might facilitate building trust and eventually, better intelligence-sharing between member states. This impartial body, however, still relies on information provided by member states.\n## 2.2. Cyber Sanctions Regime:²³\nOn 17 May 2019, Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 and Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against ‘cyber attacks’ threatening the EU or its member states have entered into force.²⁴ The Decision, which initially applied until 18 May 2020,²⁵ was amended on 14 May 2020 to apply until 18 May 2021.²⁶ The Decision and the Regulation form the basis of the new ‘cyber sanctions regime’ adopted by the EU. They impose entry restrictions on, and the freezing of funds of, persons that are responsible for ‘cyber attacks’²⁷ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, persons who provide financial, technical or material support for or are otherwise involved in ‘cyber attacks’ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, or others associated with these persons.²⁸\nFor that purpose, and in line with the procedure in other sanctions regimes, an Annex to the Decision and Regulation shall contain a list of these ‘persons, entities and bodies’ whose funds shall be frozen and who shall be denied entry into the EU’s member states.²⁹ These may be added by the Council, acting in unanimity ‘upon a proposal from a member state or from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy’.³⁰ This means that all member states will have to agree on adding certain actors to this list, but can also veto any proposal made by a member state or the High Representative. Importantly, these listings can be challenged by the listed person or entity before the General Court of the European Union, in accordance with Articles 275(2) and 263(4) and (6) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the\n²³ The EU’s cyber sanctions regime will only be analysed with regard to its relationship with ‘attribution’. Whether or not these sanctions are in conformity with international law will not be addressed in this paper.\n²⁴ Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 of 17 May 2019 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States  OJ L 129I/13; Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 of 17 May 2019 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States  OJ LI 129/1.\n²⁵ See Article 10 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n²⁶ Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/651 of 14 May 2020 Amending Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States; Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 (n 24) remains in force unamended.\n²⁷ ‘Cyber attacks’ are defined as ‘actions involving any of the following: (a) access to information systems; (b) information system interference; (c) data interference; or (d) data interception, where such actions are not duly authorised by the owner or by another right holder of the system or data or part of it, or are not permitted under the law of the Union or of the Member State concerned’; see Article 1 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n²⁸ See Articles 4 and 5 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n²⁹ See Article 4(1) CD 2019/797 (n 24), and Article 3 CR (n 24).\n³⁰ See Article 6 CD 2019/797 (n 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nEuropean Union.³¹ Also, the list in the Annex ‘shall be reviewed at regular intervals and at least every 12 months’.³² Currently, the Annex does not contain any persons, entities or bodies. Most recently, however, Germany has announced that it will propose listing certain Russian individuals involved in a large-scale hack against the German Bundestag in 2015.³³ Importantly, one of the individuals was most certainly working for the Russian GRU at the time of the event.³⁴ At the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether Germany will be successful with its proposal.\nRecital 9 of the Council Decision notes that ‘[t]argeted restrictive measures should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyber-attacks to a third State. The application of targeted restrictive measures does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken on a case-by-case basis. Every Member State is free to make its own determination with respect to the attribution of cyber-attacks to a third State.’\nIn this context, it may be noted that there is no reference in the EU legal texts that the cyber sanctions regime is only restricted to sanctioning non-state actors who have no affiliation to a state. To the contrary, it seems to have been in the EU’s interests to also be able to impose sanctions on state actors, as the Implementing Guidelines note that restrictive measures could also be used ‘[i]n the case where the malicious cyber activity is being carried out by a State, as well as in the case when a State is deemed responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that is acting under its direction or control, or if this State recognizes and adopts the behaviour of such a non-state actor as its own’.³⁵ Here, reference is clearly made to the rules of attribution enshrined in the ILC Articles and, to some extent, the language of Articles 8 and 11 ILC Articles is used.³⁶\nFor a state to be held responsible under international law, the act must be attributable to the state and constitute ‘a breach of an international obligation of the state.’³⁷ Thus, attribution of an act to a state alone does not lead to any consequences under the law of state responsibility. Politically, however, it is questionable how listing state-affiliated actors in the Annex – a decision taken by all EU member states in their sovereign capacity – can be done without undertaking a collective attribution through the EU. For example, if the EU decided to list the Russian individual allegedly working for the GRU and involved in the German Bundestag hack\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\n³¹ Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  OJ C326/47; cf General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Sanctions Guidelines – Update’ (4 May 2018) Doc 5664/18, 56.\n³² See Article 13(4) CR 2019/796 (n 24).\n³³ German Federal Foreign Office, ‘Federal Foreign Office on the Hacker Attack on the German Bundestag’ (Press Release, 28 May 2020) <www.auswaertiges-amt.de en=\"\" hacker-attack-bundestag=\"\" newsroom=\"\" newss=\"\" 2345580=\"\">.\n³⁴ Ibid.\n³⁵ Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 5.\n³⁶ Article 8 ILC Articles (n 9) stipulates that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.’; Article 11 stipulates that ‘[c]onduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.’\n³⁷ Article 2 ILC Articles (n 9).</www.auswaertiges-amt.de>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\n- something the EU cyber sanctions regime enables the member states to do – the EU would officially condemn the actions of a Russian state organ.³⁸\nSecond, if all EU member states have to unanimously decide who will be added to this list, this act of collective attribution remains in their responsibility. One might assume that the EU is reluctant, from a foreign policy perspective, to condemn an entire state for committing a ‘malicious’ cyber activity. By listing only individuals and entities instead, attribution can be avoided and (hopefully) good relations with the affiliated state can be maintained. This cautious (and inconsistent) approach indicates the EU’s reluctance to undergo collective attribution efforts.\nRegarding evidentiary standards necessary for listing: According to the EU’s Sanctions Guidelines, listing proposals must contain ‘accurate, up-to-date and defendable statements of reasons’.³⁹ The reasons for listings should moreover be ‘capable of being made public’.⁴⁰ However, ‘[i]n exceptional cases, where it is considered that the reasons for the listing are not suitable for publication, because of considerations of privacy and security, the reasons will need to be addressed separately to the person, group or entity concerned.’⁴¹ In any case, the evidence must be sufficient to withstand examination by the European Court of Justice.⁴²\nWhether listing certain actors under the Annex is defined as attribution or not, the EU’s cyber sanctions regime may, on the one hand, facilitate cooperative efforts to avoid impunity for ‘malicious’ cyber acts and, on the other hand, provide helpful indications what evidence states may find sufficient enough in order to publicly condemn a ‘malicious’ behaviour in cyberspace. Of course, this will only become possible as soon as someone will actually be listed in the Annex. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether clear conclusions may be drawn therefrom. As listing actors in the Annex needs to follow a unanimous decision, it is highly likely that the EU will only enforce measures against actors whose listings are not too harmful for the EU member states’ political interests.\n# 3. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nSimilar to the EU, NATO is a consensus-based alliance, which means that any decision taken by NATO is agreed unanimously by all its member states.⁴³ Within this mechanism, NATO agreed in 2016 that cyberspace is a ‘domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself\n³⁸ cf Article 4 ILC Articles (n 9).\n³⁹ Sanctions Guidelines – Update (n 31) para 17.\n⁴⁰ Ibid, Annex I, para 10.\n⁴¹ Ibid.\n⁴² cf European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Mellat v Council of the European Union (29 January 2013) Case T-496/10, para 77; European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Saderat Iran v Council of the European Union (5 February 2013) Case T-494/10, para 73.\n⁴³ NATO’s practice of consensus-based decision-making has been applied since its founding, despite a lack of any specific provision in the founding documents requiring NATO member states to do so; for further details see T Gill and others (eds), Leuven Manual on the International Law Applicable to Peace Operations (Cambridge University Press 2017) 68f.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nas effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea’.⁴⁴ Two years previously, NATO allies agreed that an ‘armed attack’ as referred to in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty may also be applicable to a cyber attack, as long as the cyber attack reaches the severity of an ‘armed attack’.⁴⁵ According to Article 5, this would mean that such a cyber attack against one NATO member constitutes an attack against all NATO members, triggering their obligation to assist the harmed state in taking defensive measures to ‘restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.’⁴⁶ In order to take action, however, knowing who to defend against is crucial.\nIn cases of cyber operations below the threshold of an armed attack, Article 4 of the Washington Treaty calls on the NATO members to ‘consult together’ if the ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’.⁴⁷ Here as well, attribution is important. The process of consultation includes exchanging information and opinions,⁴⁸ and might also be used to discuss the attribution of the act to a state prior to launching a collaborative NATO operation. Article 4 thus likewise enables the sharing of intelligence especially in the context of cyber attribution.⁴⁹ At least once, NATO has arguably already joined a collective attribution initiated by the Dutch and British governments in the cyber context, condemning the Russian hacking activities against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018.⁵⁰ There is, however, no public information available whether NATO resorted to Article 4 in this context, nor whether it considered adhering to any evidentiary standards for attributing the act to Russia.\nThe consultation process can, in some circumstances, lead to a joint decision or action,⁵¹ which may include condemning acts of the wrongful state (after having attributed the activity successfully). It is clear, however, that this would have to happen in consensus with all NATO allies, which could require that – especially in the context of attribution – all NATO members are equally equipped with the necessary information and capacities to make a profound decision. To build this community of trust where NATO members can share information\n⁴⁴ NATO Press Release, ‘Warsaw Summit Communiqué’ (9 July 2016) para 70, <www.nato.int cps=\"\" on=\"\" official_texts_133169.htm=\"\" natohq=\"\">.\n⁴⁵ See NATO Press Release, ‘Wales Summit Declaration’ (5 September 2014) para 72, <www.nato.int cps=\"\" on=\"\" official_texts_112964.htm=\"\" natohq=\"\">; see also NATO Review Magazine, ‘NATO’s Role in Cyberspace’ (February 2019) <www.nato.int 2019=\"\" also-in-2019=\"\" natos-role-in-cyberspace-alliance-defence=\"\" den=\"\" index.htm=\"\" docu=\"\" review=\"\">; C Porter and K Jordan, ‘Don’t Let Cyber Attribution Debates Tear Apart the NATO Alliance’ (Lawfare Blog, 14 February 2019) <www.lawfareblog.com dont-let-cyber-attribution-debates-tear-apart-nato-alliance=\"\">; NATO has so far not specified what level of severity would be needed for an armed attack in the cyber context.

According to the NATO website, ‘almost all Allies have upgraded their cyber defences’ since adopting the Pledge.52 Measures such as these further facilitate intelligence-sharing between states, as states with a higher level of security will trust other ‘more cyber capable Allies’ more than those with less secure cyber defense mechanisms.53\nNATO is also cooperating with regional organisations, such as the EU, on questions regarding better intelligence-sharing to counter cyber threats. In a Joint Declaration in 2016, the EU and NATO noted the ‘urgent need to: Boost [the EU’s and NATO’s] ability to counter hybrid threats, including by bolstering resilience, working together on analysis, prevention, and early detection, through timely information sharing and, to the extent possible, intelligence sharing between staffs; and cooperating on strategic communication and response.’54 Also, amongst other initiatives, the EU Computer Emergency Response Team and the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability have concluded a ‘Technical Arrangement on Cyber Defence’ in 2016, providing a framework where both sides can better exchange information and share best practices on cyber defence.55\nIn sum, NATO has realised that there is a need to increase its capacities to become an effective platform of assistance and cooperation for its members to counter cyber threats (which also includes attribution). Measures such as the Cyber Defense Pledge or cooperation agreements with other organisations seem to help with capacity-building and better cooperation. However, it is evident that an institutionalised system comparable to the EU’s ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ does not exist.\n## 4. The US Cyber Deterrence Initiative\nThe concept of the so-called US Cyber Deterrence Initiative first appeared in the US National Cyber Strategy of September 2018.56 It is part of the US National Cyber Strategy’s Third Pillar (‘Preserve Peace Through Strength’) and entails the coordination with and support of like-minded states in combatting ‘malicious cyber behaviour’.57 This also includes, amongst others, supporting each other’s attribution claims, which – according to Robert Strayer, Deputy\n52 NATO Website, ‘Cyber Defense’ (16 July 2018) <www.nato.int en=\"\" cps=\"\" natohq=\"\" topics_78170.htm=\"\">.\n53 cf J Shea ‘How is NATO Meeting the Challenge of Cyberspace?’, Prism 7, No 2 (21 December 2017) 22-23.\n54 NATO Press Release, ‘Joint Declaration by the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission, and the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’ (8 July 2016) <www.nato.int cps=\"\" en=\"\" natohq=\"\" official_texts_133163.htm=\"\">.\n55 NATO Website, ‘NATO and the European Union Enhance Cyber Defence Cooperation’ (10 February 2016) <www.nato.int en=\"\" cps=\"\" natohq=\"\" news_127836.htm=\"\">.\n56 See The White House, ‘National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America’ (September 2018) 21, <www.whitehouse.gov 2018=\"\" 09=\"\" national-cyber-strategy.pdf=\"\" wp-content=\"\" uploads=\"\">.\n57 Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.whitehouse.gov></www.nato.int></www.nato.int>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\nAssistant Secretary of State for cyber and international communications and information policy – is the second of the Initiative’s four elements.⁵⁸\nThe US Cyber Strategy describes methods of collective attribution as follows:\n‘Objective and actionable intelligence will be shared across the United States Government and with key partners to identify hostile foreign nation states [...]. The United States will work with like-minded states to coordinate and support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken, and joint imposition of consequences against malign actors’.⁵⁹\nConcerning evidentiary standards, the Cyber Strategy itself does not reveal much. However, in a paper titled ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence explains different levels of confidence (high, moderate and low) which analysts adhere to when assessing the available evidence.⁶⁰ High confidence exists when responsibility of a certain actor can be proven ‘beyond reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative’.⁶¹ Moderate confidence is given when the evidence is clear and convincing, and low confidence is given when ‘more than half of the body of evidence points to one thing, but there are significant information gaps’.⁶² Still, the paper does not explicitly elaborate upon which level of confidence suffices in order to conduct an attribution. In case of high confidence, it will, however, most certainly be possible to undertake an attribution.\nIn order to bring more states on board for a collective attribution, states will have to be on similar levels regarding their capacities to attribute. Hence, similar to NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Strategy aims at building ‘international cyber capacity’ that ‘will empower international partners to implement policies and practices which allow them to be effective partners in the United States-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative’.⁶³ Further details on how capacity-building will be achieved are also not publicly available.\nHowever, unlike mechanisms within NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative seems to allow more flexible alliances, which can differ depending on the activity to be attributed. While NATO and EU decisions are consensus-based and thus require the backing of all its member states, the US Initiative may enable the creation of ad hoc alliances.⁶⁴ This may allow the Initiative to act more swiftly in critical situations. A potential downside of such an\n⁵⁸ Ibid; cf T Starks, ‘Top State Cyber Official Talks Huawei, Deterrence’ (Politico, 20 March 2019) <www.politico.com 03=\"\" 20=\"\" 2019=\"\" newsletters=\"\" morning-cybersecurity=\"\" top-state-cyber-official-talks-huawei-deterrence-552356=\"\">; the first element entails making a decision on the type of activity the US would like to deter. The second element focuses on the improvement of methods of collective attribution. The third element is about focusing on the measures of imposing consequences on malicious actors. The fourth and last element is about the actual deterrence – publicly warning malicious actors of the consequences.\n⁵⁹ See US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 21.\n⁶⁰ See ODNI, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (n 1) 4.\n⁶¹ Ibid.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 26; Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45).\n⁶⁴ cf Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45); on possible advantages of such ad-hoc collaboration see K E Eichensehr, ‘The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution’ (forthcoming 2020) 67 UCLA Law Review 61.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.politico.com>\nIsabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna\narrangement, however, would be a lack of institutional knowledge between states that continuously work together to achieve a collective attribution. Regardless, there is no public information available whether this Initiative has ever been put to actual use.\n# 5. Conclusion\nTo summarise, there is potential within the EU's Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and its newly adopted sanctions regime, NATO's alliance and the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative, to tackle the 'attribution problem'. These collective mechanisms might help release the burden of attribution by one state and increase the political pressure on the alleged wrongful state, which might even perhaps deter future 'malicious' cyber incidents. However, the biggest issue for collective attribution seems to be a lack of trust between states, which, in turn, hinders them to take collective action. Without having the possibility to assess the evidence regarding attribution by other states themselves and the fact that states usually underline that there is no international obligation to share evidence, states will most likely be reluctant to support attribution claims. Closely interlinked with this is the question whether common evidentiary standards might be helpful to solve this problem. In any event, states will tend to refuse to attribute if doing so could potentially harm their international relations with the alleged wrongful state. The lack of technical expertise and insecure cyber defence systems within some states compared to other technologically well-equipped states does not help with building trust either. Hence why capacity-building is crucial, also for a collective attribution effort. To conclude, although there seems to be potential within the above-mentioned mechanisms, it is questionable whether states will make use of them or remain fairly reluctant to attribute.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297"

Introduction While there is an increasing consensus that attribution in the cyber context is not entirely impossible,¹ the actual act of attributing cyber operations to a state has remained difficult. Reasons include a lack of sufficient technical capacities within the victim states to attribute the attack, national security interests barring the states from disclosing intelligence on which a potential public attribution would be based, or the reluctance of states to undermine their good relations with alleged wrongful states. To overcome these political challenges, there has recently been an increased interest within academia, civil societies and private companies in the establishment of an independent body supervising the attribution of cyber operations to states.² But also on an inter-state level, states have relatively recently undergone efforts of collective attribution, such as in the case of the NotPetya and WannaCry cyber incidents, and, most recently, the cyber operations against Georgia.³ Collective efforts have the advantage of increasing the credibility of attribution findings, and the attribution claim gains more political weight the more states join in, which in turn might have a beneficial deterrent effect on the ¹ See, *ia* Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (14 September 2018) 2, <www.dni.gov 00ni_a_guide_to_cyber_attribution.pdf=\"\"files=\"\"documents=\"\"cjb:ctiic=\"\"other=\"\"references=\"\"to=\"\"online=\"\"sources=\"\"the=\"\"to=\"\"where:=\"\">; references to online sources are accurate as of 3 July 2020.\n² See *ia* Microsoft, ‘An Attribution Organization to Strengthen Trust Online’ (Microsoft Policy Papers, 2017) <www.microsoft.com an-attribution-organization-to-strengthen-trust-online=\"\"en-us=\"\"cybersecurity=\"\"content-hub=\"\">; J S Davis and others, ‘Stateless Attribution: Toward International Accountability in Cyberspace’ (Rand Corporation, 2017) <www.rand.org 2017=\"\"12=\"\"icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\"icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\"icct4peace-2018=\"\"j=\"\"icct4peace-2019-trust-and-attribution-in-cyberspace.pdf=\"\"nelson-states=\"\"press=\"\"pubs=\"\"research_reports=\"\"rn2081.html=\"\"www.rand.org=\"\">; S Charncy, ‘Cybersecurity Norms for Nation-States and the Global ICT Industry’ (Microsoft Blog, 23 June 2016) <blogs.microsoft.com 2016=\"\"06=\"\"06=\"\"2018=\"\"cjb:=\"\"cjb:cti-industry=\"\"on-the-issues=\"\"online=\"\"research=\"\"www.artlantic.org=\"\"www.ratlantic.org=\"\"></blogs.microsoft.com></www.rand.org></www.racn-cry></www.racn-cry></www.dni.gov> Isabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna wrongful state(s). This is perhaps also the reason why organisations such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have lately been working on strengthening their collective capabilities within the cyber realm. But also the United States, with its recently launched ‘Cyber Deterrence Initiative’, is focusing more on mobilising allied states to undertake collective attributions. This paper will thus provide an overview on these already existing developments of a potential international attribution mechanism for cyber operations at the EU and NATO level, as well as touch briefly on measures taken by the US in this context.\n## 2. The European Union⁴ The EU has relatively recently taken up the challenge of building a collective cyber security mechanism across the EU.⁵ It has also realised that it needs to step up its game regarding its attribution capabilities.⁶ A significant milestone was finding consensus on creating a set of measures which the EU and its member states can resort to in the case of a cyber incident threatening the security of the Union. This set of measures was named the ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ (for further details see below) and also addresses the question how the EU attempts to deal with the issue of attributing these cyber incidents to state or non-state actors.⁷ Before addressing these measures, however, it is important to note how the EU defines ‘attribution’.\nAccording to an early draft version of the European External Action Service, attribution is defined as ‘the practice of assigning responsibility for malicious cyber activity to a specific actor or sponsor’.⁸ Regarding the fact that no specific reference is made to a state actor, this definition seems to imply that the EU regards ‘attribution’ in a broader sense than it is understood under the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles).⁹ Moreover, the EU is keen to note that attribution is a ‘sovereign political ⁴ When referring to the European Union, reference is made to all main institutions – the European Commission, the Council, the European Council and the European Parliament, either collectively or in their singular capacity, as representing the EU as a whole, unless otherwise stated.\n⁵ For example, the EU adopted its first Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013, see European Commission Press Release, ‘EU Cybersecurity Plan to Protect Open Internet and Online Freedom and Opportunity’ (Digital Single Market News, 7 February 2013) <ec.europa.eu en=\"\"digital-single-market=\"\"eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity=\"\"news=\"\">.\n⁶ See eg European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, ‘Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council: Increasing Resilience and Bolstering Capabilities to Address Hybrid Threats’ (13 June 2018) JOIN (2018) 16 final, 8.\n⁷ See General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Council Conclusions on a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (“Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox”)’ (19 June 2017) Doc 10474/17, <data.consilium.europa.eu dec=\"\"document=\"\"en=\"\"pt=\"\"st-10474-2017-init=\"\">.\n⁸ European External Action Service, ‘Implementation of the Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities – Attribution of Malicious Cyber Activities – Discussion of a Revised Text’ (18 March 2019) Doc 6852/1/19 REV 1, 3, <www.statewatch.org 2019=\"\"eu-council-cyber-6852-rev-1-19.pdf=\"\"news=\"\"www.2019=\"\">; note, however, that this draft version is the only available version online.\n⁹ UN ILC, ‘Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (2001) GAOR, 53rd Session, Supp No 10; the ILC Articles are widely held to reflect customary international law; note that the EU heavily emphasises, in most of its documents regarding cyber security, that ‘existing international law is applicable to cyberspace’ (see for example Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler!

This is reflected in the recent establishment of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and the EU cyber sanctions regime. Both will be discussed in the following sub-chapters.\n## 2.1. The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox The EU has adopted the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox in June 2017.¹¹ The Toolbox describes a set of measures with which the EU can respond to so-called ‘malicious’ cyber activities¹² under its Common Foreign and Security Policy. To be specific, the Council of the European Union¹³ decides which measures to take, based on a proposal by a Member State or the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Measures that can be taken include démarches (i.e. diplomatic visits, usually to a state representative in charge of the dossier), public statements condemning the cyber activity, confidence-building measures, political dialogues or even restrictive measures (these will be addressed in a separate point below).¹⁴ The Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (hereinafter: Draft Implementing Guidelines) note that in order to resort to some, but not all, measures, prior attribution of a cyber activity is required.¹⁵ They also seem to distinguish between measures that require firm attribution and those that do not (eg when contacting states whose territory may have been used to conduct a ‘malicious cyber activity’).¹⁶ What level of proof is required for a firm attribution and for any other attribution is not specified in the available documents. An earlier draft version of an EU paper on attribution contained a so-called ‘uncertainty yardstick’, developed by the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN), the intelligence body of the European External Action Service (EEAS)¹⁷, ¹⁰ General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Draft Implementing Guidelines for the Framework on a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities’ (9 October 2017) Doc 13007/17, 13, <https: en=\"\"document=\"\"document?st-13007-2017-init=\"\"data.consilium.europa.eu=\"\"en=\"\"pdf=\"\">; the draft version is the only version available online; cf also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.) 4.\n¹¹ See Council of the EU Press Release, ‘Cyber Attacks: EU Ready to Respond with a Range of Measures, Including Sanctions’ (19 June 2017) <www.consilium.europa.eu en=\"\"press=\"\"press-releases=\"\"06=\"\"19=\"\"2017=\"\"cyber-diplomacy-toolbox=\"\"></www.consilium.europa.eu>; see also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.).\n¹² The Council noted specifically that malicious cyber activities ‘may constitute wrongful acts under international law and could give rise to a joint EU response’, see EU Press Release (n 11).\n¹³ The Council consists of the respective ministers of each EU member state and is, next to the European Parliament and the European Commission, one of the three legislative bodies of the European Union.\n¹⁴ See Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 6ff.\n¹⁵ Ibid, 14; see also Toolbox Council Conclusions (n Fehler! Textmarke nicht definiert.) 4.\n¹⁶ See Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 8: ‘When one or more Member States are impacted by a malicious cyber activity, it could be beneficial to jointly contact States exercising jurisdiction over these territories that have been used for conducting the malicious activity. [...] The benefit of such signalling is that it can generally be done without requiring firm attribution’ [emphasis added].\n¹⁷ The EEAS serves as a diplomatic body of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and exercises foreign ministry and defense ministry functions for the EU; the EU INTCEN is tasked with providing intelligence analyses to EU decision-making bodies, which are based on information voluntarily provided by the EU member states.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</https:> Isabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna which divided the range of probabilities of an attribution into percentages from 0-5% (remote chance) to 95-100% (almost certain). This yardstick, however, was removed in a later draft version.¹⁸ It is important to note that, despite the involvement of European cyber institutions to help in the process of attribution, the power to decide to attribute remains within the hands of the member states: The Council notes that the EU INTCEN, along with other competent European ‘cyber institutions’ (such as the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) network established under Article 12 of the EU Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)¹⁹, the European Cybercrime Centre, European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) or the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions (CERT-EU)), ‘plays a valuable role [...] by sharing its analyses and information related to the origin of the malicious cyber activity’.²⁰ Thus, institutions such as INTCEN are there to facilitate rather than make the decision to attribute a certain activity to a specific actor. This may entail collecting and assessing information received by member states, third states or collected on its own, followed by an analysis of the received and/or collected information. This analysis may, for example, contain a conclusion that the cyber activity, based on the available information, is with a high likelihood attributable to state X or Y. Member states may then assess this information based on their ‘sovereign prerogative’ of attribution and decide whether they agree with the analysis or not.\nWhether member states will have access to the information upon which INTCEN and others created their conclusions is not clear. Especially when it comes to classified information, it is highly unlikely that the information received by one member state or a third party can be shared with the rest of the member states. In this case, member states are supposed to decide whether they follow the conclusions made by these bodies without having access to the underlying information. This decision to attribute has to be taken unanimously by all member states, if taken by the EU as a whole.²¹ An additional issue is that, according to the Implementing Guidelines ‘Member States are not obliged to provide information or analysis when it [sic] considers this as contrary to the essential interests of its [sic] national security.’²² As the necessary information will usually be linked to essential interests of a state’s national security, it might be difficult to receive valuable information at all.\nIt is also not clear what level of proof the EU regards as having to be met in order to attribute successfully. As already mentioned above, there seems to have been a discussion about ¹⁸ Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 10.\n¹⁹ Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 Concerning Measures for a High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Across the Union, OJ L194/1; the NIS Directive is the first EU legislation addressing cybersecurity, and seeks to improve and harmonise the level of cybersecurity within the EU.\n²⁰ Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 13.\n²¹ Attribution Draft Paper (n 8) 2.\n²² Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 11.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297 Isabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna categorising evidence into ranges of probability. This proposal has, however, been dropped. There is no official statement so far by the EU on this matter.\nTo conclude, despite having INTCEN and others undertake an analysis on attribution, the responsibility to attribute remains with the member states. This means that building trust between member states is crucial. In this respect, at least having a framework to task impartial bodies with the analysis might facilitate building trust and eventually, better intelligence-sharing between member states. This impartial body, however, still relies on information provided by member states.\n## 2.2. Cyber Sanctions Regime:²³ On 17 May 2019, Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 and Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 concerning restrictive measures against ‘cyber attacks’ threatening the EU or its member states have entered into force.²⁴ The Decision, which initially applied until 18 May 2020,²⁵ was amended on 14 May 2020 to apply until 18 May 2021.²⁶ The Decision and the Regulation form the basis of the new ‘cyber sanctions regime’ adopted by the EU. They impose entry restrictions on, and the freezing of funds of, persons that are responsible for ‘cyber attacks’²⁷ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, persons who provide financial, technical or material support for or are otherwise involved in ‘cyber attacks’ or attempted ‘cyber attacks’, or others associated with these persons.²⁸ For that purpose, and in line with the procedure in other sanctions regimes, an Annex to the Decision and Regulation shall contain a list of these ‘persons, entities and bodies’ whose funds shall be frozen and who shall be denied entry into the EU’s member states.²⁹ These may be added by the Council, acting in unanimity ‘upon a proposal from a member state or from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy’.³⁰ This means that all member states will have to agree on adding certain actors to this list, but can also veto any proposal made by a member state or the High Representative. Importantly, these listings can be challenged by the listed person or entity before the General Court of the European Union, in accordance with Articles 275(2) and 263(4) and (6) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the ²³ The EU’s cyber sanctions regime will only be analysed with regard to its relationship with ‘attribution’. Whether or not these sanctions are in conformity with international law will not be addressed in this paper.\n²⁴ Council Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 of 17 May 2019 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States [2019] OJ L 129I/13; Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 of 17 May 2019 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States [2019] OJ LI 129/1.\n²⁵ See Article 10 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n²⁶ Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/651 of 14 May 2020 Amending Decision (CFSP) 2019/797 Concerning Restrictive Measures Against Cyber-Attacks Threatening the Union or its Member States; Council Regulation (EU) 2019/796 (n 24) remains in force unamended.\n²⁷ ‘Cyber attacks’ are defined as ‘actions involving any of the following: (a) access to information systems; (b) information system interference; (c) data interference; or (d) data interception, where such actions are not duly authorised by the owner or by another right holder of the system or data or part of it, or are not permitted under the law of the Union or of the Member State concerned’; see Article 1 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n²⁸ See Articles 4 and 5 CD 2019/797 (n 24).\n²⁹ See Article 4(1) CD 2019/797 (n 24), and Article 3 CR (n 24).\n³⁰ See Article 6 CD 2019/797 (n 25).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297 Isabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna European Union.³¹ Also, the list in the Annex ‘shall be reviewed at regular intervals and at least every 12 months’.³² Currently, the Annex does not contain any persons, entities or bodies. Most recently, however, Germany has announced that it will propose listing certain Russian individuals involved in a large-scale hack against the German Bundestag in 2015.³³ Importantly, one of the individuals was most certainly working for the Russian GRU at the time of the event.³⁴ At the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether Germany will be successful with its proposal.\nRecital 9 of the Council Decision notes that ‘[t]argeted restrictive measures should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyber-attacks to a third State. The application of targeted restrictive measures does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken on a case-by-case basis. Every Member State is free to make its own determination with respect to the attribution of cyber-attacks to a third State.’ In this context, it may be noted that there is no reference in the EU legal texts that the cyber sanctions regime is only restricted to sanctioning non-state actors who have no affiliation to a state. To the contrary, it seems to have been in the EU’s interests to also be able to impose sanctions on state actors, as the Implementing Guidelines note that restrictive measures could also be used ‘[i]n the case where the malicious cyber activity is being carried out by a State, as well as in the case when a State is deemed responsible for the actions of a non-state actor that is acting under its direction or control, or if this State recognizes and adopts the behaviour of such a non-state actor as its own’.³⁵ Here, reference is clearly made to the rules of attribution enshrined in the ILC Articles and, to some extent, the language of Articles 8 and 11 ILC Articles is used.³⁶ For a state to be held responsible under international law, the act must be attributable to the state and constitute ‘a breach of an international obligation of the state.’³⁷ Thus, attribution of an act to a state alone does not lead to any consequences under the law of state responsibility. Politically, however, it is questionable how listing state-affiliated actors in the Annex – a decision taken by all EU member states in their sovereign capacity – can be done without undertaking a collective attribution through the EU. For example, if the EU decided to list the Russian individual allegedly working for the GRU and involved in the German Bundestag hack Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297 ³¹ Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union [2012] OJ C326/47; cf General Secretariat of the Council, ‘Sanctions Guidelines – Update’ (4 May 2018) Doc 5664/18, 56.\n³² See Article 13(4) CR 2019/796 (n 24).\n³³ German Federal Foreign Office, ‘Federal Foreign Office on the Hacker Attack on the German Bundestag’ (Press Release, 28 May 2020) <www.auswaertiges-amt.de en=\"\"hacker-attack-bundestag=\"\"newsroom=\"\"newss=\"\"2345580=\"\">.\n³⁴ Ibid.\n³⁵ Draft Implementing Guidelines (n 10) 5.\n³⁶ Article 8 ILC Articles (n 9) stipulates that ‘[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.’; Article 11 stipulates that ‘[c]onduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.’ ³⁷ Article 2 ILC Articles (n 9).</www.auswaertiges-amt.de> Isabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna - something the EU cyber sanctions regime enables the member states to do – the EU would officially condemn the actions of a Russian state organ.³⁸ Second, if all EU member states have to unanimously decide who will be added to this list, this act of collective attribution remains in their responsibility. One might assume that the EU is reluctant, from a foreign policy perspective, to condemn an entire state for committing a ‘malicious’ cyber activity. By listing only individuals and entities instead, attribution can be avoided and (hopefully) good relations with the affiliated state can be maintained. This cautious (and inconsistent) approach indicates the EU’s reluctance to undergo collective attribution efforts.\nRegarding evidentiary standards necessary for listing: According to the EU’s Sanctions Guidelines, listing proposals must contain ‘accurate, up-to-date and defendable statements of reasons’.³⁹ The reasons for listings should moreover be ‘capable of being made public’.⁴⁰ However, ‘[i]n exceptional cases, where it is considered that the reasons for the listing are not suitable for publication, because of considerations of privacy and security, the reasons will need to be addressed separately to the person, group or entity concerned.’⁴¹ In any case, the evidence must be sufficient to withstand examination by the European Court of Justice.⁴² Whether listing certain actors under the Annex is defined as attribution or not, the EU’s cyber sanctions regime may, on the one hand, facilitate cooperative efforts to avoid impunity for ‘malicious’ cyber acts and, on the other hand, provide helpful indications what evidence states may find sufficient enough in order to publicly condemn a ‘malicious’ behaviour in cyberspace. Of course, this will only become possible as soon as someone will actually be listed in the Annex. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether clear conclusions may be drawn therefrom. As listing actors in the Annex needs to follow a unanimous decision, it is highly likely that the EU will only enforce measures against actors whose listings are not too harmful for the EU member states’ political interests.\n# 3. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Similar to the EU, NATO is a consensus-based alliance, which means that any decision taken by NATO is agreed unanimously by all its member states.⁴³ Within this mechanism, NATO agreed in 2016 that cyberspace is a ‘domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself ³⁸ cf Article 4 ILC Articles (n 9).\n³⁹ Sanctions Guidelines – Update (n 31) para 17.\n⁴⁰ Ibid, Annex I, para 10.\n⁴¹ Ibid.\n⁴² cf European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Mellat v Council of the European Union (29 January 2013) Case T-496/10, para 77; European Court of Justice, Judgment of the General Court, Bank Saderat Iran v Council of the European Union (5 February 2013) Case T-494/10, para 73.\n⁴³ NATO’s practice of consensus-based decision-making has been applied since its founding, despite a lack of any specific provision in the founding documents requiring NATO member states to do so; for further details see T Gill and others (eds), Leuven Manual on the International Law Applicable to Peace Operations (Cambridge University Press 2017) 68f.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297 Isabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea’.⁴⁴ Two years previously, NATO allies agreed that an ‘armed attack’ as referred to in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty may also be applicable to a cyber attack, as long as the cyber attack reaches the severity of an ‘armed attack’.⁴⁵ According to Article 5, this would mean that such a cyber attack against one NATO member constitutes an attack against all NATO members, triggering their obligation to assist the harmed state in taking defensive measures to ‘restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.’⁴⁶ In order to take action, however, knowing who to defend against is crucial.\nIn cases of cyber operations below the threshold of an armed attack, Article 4 of the Washington Treaty calls on the NATO members to ‘consult together’ if the ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’.⁴⁷ Here as well, attribution is important. The process of consultation includes exchanging information and opinions,⁴⁸ and might also be used to discuss the attribution of the act to a state prior to launching a collaborative NATO operation. Article 4 thus likewise enables the sharing of intelligence especially in the context of cyber attribution.⁴⁹ At least once, NATO has arguably already joined a collective attribution initiated by the Dutch and British governments in the cyber context, condemning the Russian hacking activities against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018.⁵⁰ There is, however, no public information available whether NATO resorted to Article 4 in this context, nor whether it considered adhering to any evidentiary standards for attributing the act to Russia.\nThe consultation process can, in some circumstances, lead to a joint decision or action,⁵¹ which may include condemning acts of the wrongful state (after having attributed the activity successfully). It is clear, however, that this would have to happen in consensus with all NATO allies, which could require that – especially in the context of attribution – all NATO members are equally equipped with the necessary information and capacities to make a profound decision. To build this community of trust where NATO members can share information ⁴⁴ NATO Press Release, ‘Warsaw Summit Communiqué’ (9 July 2016) para 70, <www.nato.int cps=\"\"on=\"\"official_texts_133169.htm=\"\"natohq=\"\">.\n⁴⁵ See NATO Press Release, ‘Wales Summit Declaration’ (5 September 2014) para 72, <www.nato.int cps=\"\"on=\"\"official_texts_112964.htm=\"\"natohq=\"\">; see also NATO Review Magazine, ‘NATO’s Role in Cyberspace’ <www.nato.int 2019=\"\"also-in-2019=\"\"natos-role-in-cyberspace-alliance-defence=\"\"den=\"\"index.htm=\"\"docu=\"\"review=\"\">; C Porter and K Jordan, ‘Don’t Let Cyber Attribution Debates Tear Apart the NATO Alliance’ (Lawfare Blog, 14 February 2019) <www.lawfareblog.com dont-let-cyber-attribution-debates-tear-apart-nato-alliance=\"\">; NATO has so far not specified what level of severity would be needed for an armed attack in the cyber context.

According to the NATO website, ‘almost all Allies have upgraded their cyber defences’ since adopting the Pledge.52 Measures such as these further facilitate intelligence-sharing between states, as states with a higher level of security will trust other ‘more cyber capable Allies’ more than those with less secure cyber defense mechanisms.53 NATO is also cooperating with regional organisations, such as the EU, on questions regarding better intelligence-sharing to counter cyber threats. In a Joint Declaration in 2016, the EU and NATO noted the ‘urgent need to: Boost [the EU’s and NATO’s] ability to counter hybrid threats, including by bolstering resilience, working together on analysis, prevention, and early detection, through timely information sharing and, to the extent possible, intelligence sharing between staffs; and cooperating on strategic communication and response.’54 Also, amongst other initiatives, the EU Computer Emergency Response Team and the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability have concluded a ‘Technical Arrangement on Cyber Defence’ in 2016, providing a framework where both sides can better exchange information and share best practices on cyber defence.55 In sum, NATO has realised that there is a need to increase its capacities to become an effective platform of assistance and cooperation for its members to counter cyber threats (which also includes attribution). Measures such as the Cyber Defense Pledge or cooperation agreements with other organisations seem to help with capacity-building and better cooperation. However, it is evident that an institutionalised system comparable to the EU’s ‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’ does not exist.\n## 4. The US Cyber Deterrence Initiative The concept of the so-called US Cyber Deterrence Initiative first appeared in the US National Cyber Strategy of September 2018.56 It is part of the US National Cyber Strategy’s Third Pillar (‘Preserve Peace Through Strength’) and entails the coordination with and support of like-minded states in combatting ‘malicious cyber behaviour’.57 This also includes, amongst others, supporting each other’s attribution claims, which – according to Robert Strayer, Deputy Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.whitehouse.gov></www.nato.int></www.nato.int> Isabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna Assistant Secretary of State for cyber and international communications and information policy – is the second of the Initiative’s four elements.⁵⁸ The US Cyber Strategy describes methods of collective attribution as follows: ‘Objective and actionable intelligence will be shared across the United States Government and with key partners to identify hostile foreign nation states [...]. The United States will work with like-minded states to coordinate and support each other’s responses to significant malicious cyber incidents, including through intelligence sharing, buttressing of attribution claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken, and joint imposition of consequences against malign actors’.⁵⁹ Concerning evidentiary standards, the Cyber Strategy itself does not reveal much. However, in a paper titled ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence explains different levels of confidence (high, moderate and low) which analysts adhere to when assessing the available evidence.⁶⁰ High confidence exists when responsibility of a certain actor can be proven ‘beyond reasonable doubt with no reasonable alternative’.⁶¹ Moderate confidence is given when the evidence is clear and convincing, and low confidence is given when ‘more than half of the body of evidence points to one thing, but there are significant information gaps’.⁶² Still, the paper does not explicitly elaborate upon which level of confidence suffices in order to conduct an attribution. In case of high confidence, it will, however, most certainly be possible to undertake an attribution.\nIn order to bring more states on board for a collective attribution, states will have to be on similar levels regarding their capacities to attribute. Hence, similar to NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Strategy aims at building ‘international cyber capacity’ that ‘will empower international partners to implement policies and practices which allow them to be effective partners in the United States-led Cyber Deterrence Initiative’.⁶³ Further details on how capacity-building will be achieved are also not publicly available.\nHowever, unlike mechanisms within NATO and the EU, the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative seems to allow more flexible alliances, which can differ depending on the activity to be attributed. While NATO and EU decisions are consensus-based and thus require the backing of all its member states, the US Initiative may enable the creation of ad hoc alliances.⁶⁴ This may allow the Initiative to act more swiftly in critical situations. A potential downside of such an ⁵⁸ Ibid; cf T Starks, ‘Top State Cyber Official Talks Huawei, Deterrence’ (Politico, 20 March 2019) <www.politico.com 03=\"\"20=\"\"2019=\"\"newsletters=\"\"morning-cybersecurity=\"\"top-state-cyber-official-talks-huawei-deterrence-552356=\"\">; the first element entails making a decision on the type of activity the US would like to deter. The second element focuses on the improvement of methods of collective attribution. The third element is about focusing on the measures of imposing consequences on malicious actors. The fourth and last element is about the actual deterrence – publicly warning malicious actors of the consequences.\n⁵⁹ See US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 21.\n⁶⁰ See ODNI, ‘A Guide to Cyber Attribution’ (n 1) 4.\n⁶¹ Ibid.\n⁶² Ibid.\n⁶³ US National Cyber Strategy (n 56) 26; Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45).\n⁶⁴ cf Porter/Jordan, ‘Cyber Attribution Debates’ (n 45); on possible advantages of such ad-hoc collaboration see K E Eichensehr, ‘The Law &amp; Politics of Cyberattack Attribution’ (forthcoming 2020) 67 UCLA Law Review 61.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297</www.politico.com> Isabella Brunner, PhD Candidate in International Law, Researcher and Lecturer at University of Vienna arrangement, however, would be a lack of institutional knowledge between states that continuously work together to achieve a collective attribution. Regardless, there is no public information available whether this Initiative has ever been put to actual use.\n# 5. Conclusion To summarise, there is potential within the EU's Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox and its newly adopted sanctions regime, NATO's alliance and the US Cyber Deterrence Initiative, to tackle the 'attribution problem'. These collective mechanisms might help release the burden of attribution by one state and increase the political pressure on the alleged wrongful state, which might even perhaps deter future 'malicious' cyber incidents. However, the biggest issue for collective attribution seems to be a lack of trust between states, which, in turn, hinders them to take collective action. Without having the possibility to assess the evidence regarding attribution by other states themselves and the fact that states usually underline that there is no international obligation to share evidence,[65] states will most likely be reluctant to support attribution claims. Closely interlinked with this is the question whether common evidentiary standards might be helpful to solve this problem. In any event, states will tend to refuse to attribute if doing so could potentially harm their international relations with the alleged wrongful state. The lack of technical expertise and insecure cyber defence systems within some states compared to other technologically well-equipped states does not help with building trust either. Hence why capacity-building is crucial, also for a collective attribution effort. To conclude, although there seems to be potential within the above-mentioned mechanisms, it is questionable whether states will make use of them or remain fairly reluctant to attribute.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3986297"
