We begin by exploring opportunities for borrowing well-established rules of harm prevention and due diligence from the more advanced, but not dissimilar, field of international environmental law. We argue that these rules can provide a legal foundation for the emerging field of international cyber law, and have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. We then draw on the experience of international environmental law with conceptual notions such as ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, as well as with institutional models such as multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies. We highlight the risks and drawbacks of the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a commons in the ‘virtual’ world of cyberspace.\n\nKEYWORDS: International Environmental Law, Non-State Actors, State Responsibility, Transboundary Harm Prevention, Due Diligence, Global Commons, Shared Resources, Institutional Framework\n\nI. Introduction\n\nFor international lawyers, the body of rules that should govern cyberspace and harmful cyber activities is still an emerging field.

Many State-controlled cyber attacks remain below the thresholds of the use of force framework, engaging instead the basic rules requiring that States not cause harm to other States or to areas beyond State jurisdiction. Others may amount not to a ‘use of force,’ but to illegal intervention. The legal consequences, as a result, will be governed by the law of State responsibility, not the law on the use of force. The same applies, arguably, in situations in which a cyber attack might be likened to a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter),³ but not an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 UN Charter.⁴ Furthermore, and quite apart from the question whether actions fall within the ambit of the rules on the use of force or another set of rules, many cyber acts are not undertaken by States or their agents, such that States would be directly responsible for them. Rather, a large proportion of such actions are undertaken by non-State actors, who operate within the territories or otherwise under the jurisdiction of various States. It is the legal regime for this wide array of ‘peacetime’ cyber operations that we consider in this chapter, focusing in particular on the primary obligations of States in relation to non-State actions occurring under their jurisdiction.\n\nIn exploring this terrain, we draw on the evolution and legal building blocks of international environmental law, which we believe holds a number of important lessons for the emerging field of international cyberspace law. International environmental law evolved in a way that is not dissimilar to what is now occurring in relation to cyberspace. When the first environmental problems arose, there existed no specific rules on environmental impacts in international law. Recourse had to be had to the general rules that govern the rights and obligations attached to\n\n² See e.g., Peter Margulies, Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility, Melbourne Journal of International Law 14 (2013), 1; Michael N.

But dealing with international environmental problems often requires cooperation and finely calibrated response measures that can address complex problems and adapt as the problems or human understanding of them and technical capacity to solve them evolve. International environmental law and the emerging field of international cyberspace law are similar also in some important structural respects. Notably, one of the distinctive features of international environmental law is that it must almost always deal with impacts that are generated by private actors. Furthermore, like the potential consequences of cyber activities, environmental consequences of actions in one State are often felt in another State’s territory or in areas beyond State jurisdiction – the ‘commons’.\n\nHowever, if one were to undertake an assessment of the state of international environmental law in 2014, one might conclude that, at least in some respects, it is coming full circle. In the 1980s and 1990s, the field experienced rapid growth through the emergence of specialised rules and principles, and the subsequent proliferation and progressive expansion of more and more elaborate treaty regimes and treaty-based standard-setting processes relating to a wide array of regional and global issues.⁵ Today, new environmental agreements have become a rarity and even the further development of existing regimes through treaty-based international environmental law-making seems to have slowed. Indeed, in the case of the perhaps most complex international environmental challenge – climate change – international environmental law appears to be undergoing a fundamental shift from ‘top-down’ standard-setting to a more flexible, ‘bottom-up’ approach.⁶ Whether by coincidence or in response to these patterns, the foundational principles of international environmental law have seen something of a renaissance. In the last few years, States have invoked basic rules concerning transboundary impacts and have turned to international courts and tribunals for clarification of the attendant procedural obligations and due diligence requirements. In other words, some of the recent developments in international environmental law can be traced all the way back to its roots in basic principles concerning sovereign rights and in the iconic cases that developed these principles, such as the *Island of Palmas* arbitration or the *Corfu Channel* case.⁷\n\n⁵ For an overview on this evolution, see *Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey*, Mapping the Field, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2008), 1.\n\n⁶ See *e.g.* *Daniel Bodansky*, A Tale of Two Architectures: The Once and Future U.N.

We first discuss the application of these concepts in the environmental context, considering how they may contribute to the development of norms for the regulation of harmful activities in cyberspace. We will show that the obligations of harm prevention and due diligence have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. Many cyber security and legal scholars,⁸ as well as governments⁹ and international organisations,¹⁰ have recognised States’ obligation to exercise due diligence in order to prevent cyber activities that are harmful to other States from occurring in their territories. We then turn to the notions of ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, concepts that are prominent in international environmental law but have been controversial or of limited relevance in the cyber context. We discuss them mainly to highlight the potential and risks of efforts to regulate not only harm caused by States to other States in relation to cyberspace, but also harm caused to cyberspace itself as a common resource. Finally, drawing on the experience with the design of multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies, we offer some observations on institutional models, and highlight some of the potential drawbacks of these models in the cyber context.

We will suggest that the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a 'commons' is unlikely to be feasible or even desirable. Our goal in this chapter is to explore opportunities and post warning signs for those in the 'virtual' world of cyberspace who seek to learn from the 'real' world of international environmental law.\n\n## II. The No Harm Rule and Related Principles\n\nOne of the most straightforward approaches to building international cyberspace law may be to apply the legal principles on harm prevention and due diligence to cyberspace issues. These principles are not only well established, but also anchored in foundational principles of international law that are designed to balance competing sovereign interests. For example, in the *Island of Palmas* case, the Arbitrator held that “[t]erritorial sovereignty [...] has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability.”¹¹ Similarly, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its decision in the *Corfu Channel* case, found that it is “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹²\n\nInternational environmental law, in the absence of specific rules, adapted these general rules to the environmental setting. The salient principles evolved into the proposition that States' rights to use their territories and resources are limited by the obligation to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control do not cause significant transboundary harm. This 'no harm' rule has since been affirmed and fleshed out through a series of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and other international instruments, as well as several arbitral and judicial decisions.¹³ The ICJ confirmed in its advisory opinion on the *Legality of the Threat* or\n\n¹¹ *Island of Palmas Case* (note 7), 839.\n\n¹² ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 7), 22.\n\n¹³ See e.g., *Trail Smelter Case* (USA, Canada), Arbitral Award of 16 April 1938 and 11 March 1941, RIAA III, 1905, 1965; *Lac Lamnac Arbitration* (France, Spain), Arbitral Award of 16 November 1957,",

We believe that this fact alone is a crucial advantage. In addition, international environmental law offers rich State practice and judicial opinions that provide guidance on the nature of the due diligence obligations that flow from the exercise of sovereign rights. Two recent cases are of particular interest in this respect – the ICJ’s Pulp Mills case and the advisory opinion on Activities in the Area of the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS Chamber).¹⁷ The discussion below focuses on the elements of each decision that flesh out the no harm rule with respect to due diligence, the attendant procedural obligations, and the relationship between harm prevention and precaution.

International Environmental Law and Norm Evolution\nin International Cyberspace Law\n\nIn the Pulp Mills decision, the ICJ emphasised two important features of the no harm rule. First, it encompasses an obligation to prevent harm. Second, “the principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory.”¹⁸ This obligation to act with due diligence entails “not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators.”¹⁹\n\nThe ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion on Activities in the Area, in turn, was concerned with the responsibility of States to take appropriate measures to ensure that private entities operating in the deep seabed do not cause harm in that ‘commons’ area. Perhaps most importantly for present purposes, the Chamber highlighted the contextual nature of the due diligence standard. The Chamber observed that the due diligence standard “may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or technological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity [...] [and] be more severe for the riskier activities.”²⁰ Due diligence may vary also in light of the capacity of the State concerned, although this point appears to be more controversial. Some leading commentators on international environmental law, citing numerous international instruments that accommodate developing countries’ lesser technological and regulatory capacity, including the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change,²¹ compared the flexibility of the due diligence standard to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.²² However, the ITLOS Chamber made a point of emphasising that different treatment for developed and developing States is warranted only when the underlying international legal obligations provide for it.²³\n\n¹⁸ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 101.\n¹⁹ Ibid., para. 197.\n²⁰ ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), para. 117.\n²¹ See supra, note 13.\n²² Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell, International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149.\n²³ ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), paras. 151–163.",

The Ad hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (Advisory Group), established by the Council of Europe, explicitly referred to the use of the no harm principle in the environmental law context, and relied on it to “underline the primary nature of the proposed commitments of a state to prevent, manage and respond to significant transboundary disruption of or interference with the stability, robustness, resilience and openness of the Internet.”²⁴ Some States have also recognised a general due diligence obligation in cyberspace. The United States (US), for instance, considers cyber security due diligence to be an emerging norm according to which “States should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse,”²⁵ while recognising that “unique attributes of networked technology require additional work to clarify how these norms apply.”²⁶ A duty “not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies” was also recognised by China and Russia in 2011.²⁷ Russia argued for inclusion of a more specific duty to “take all necessary steps to prevent any destructive information action originating from their own territory or using the information infrastructure under their jurisdiction, as well as cooperate to locate the source of computer attacks carried out with the use of their territory, to repel these attacks and to eliminate their consequences” in a proposed international information security convention.²⁸\n\nThe obligation to prevent harm to other States from cyber attacks and other malicious cyber activities conducted in their territories is generally considered to\n\n²⁴ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 64.\n²⁵ US International Strategy for Cyberspace (note 9), 10.\n²⁶ Ibid., 9.\n²⁷ United Nations General Assembly, Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

Specifically, it noted that “an efficient observance of a due diligence commitment is understood as the implementation of those measures which would be commensurate with the overall capabilities of the country concerned to address the risks,”³⁸ and that legislative, administrative, or other action necessary to implement a States’ due diligence commitments “should be subject to the capabilities of the state concerned.”³⁹\n\nThe scope of States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations in cyberspace were also considered in the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), a document prepared by an independent international group of experts comprised of practitioners and scholars (Tallinn Manual Group of Experts).⁴⁰ While the Manual deals primarily with cyber warfare, it recognises the no harm obligation as a rule of “a general international legal nature” applicable to “the relationship between states, cyber infrastructure, and cyber operations” and extending to “all cyber activities from one State’s territory that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another States’ territory [...] irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State.”⁴¹\n\nAgain in keeping with the approach in international environmental law, the Tallinn Manual considers that the no harm prevention and due diligence obligations encompass the requirement that States “use all means at [their] disposal\n\n³⁶ Ibid., paras. 71–73.\n³⁷ Ibid., para. 74.\n³⁸ Ibid.\n³⁹ Ibid., para. 77.\n⁴⁰ Tallinn Manual (note 2).\n⁴¹ Ibid., 15, 26, 27.",

In international environmental law, the *Trail Smelter Case* posited a “serious consequence” standard with respect to transboundary air pollution,⁴³ although today a “significant harm” standard, intended to exclude *de minimis* harm, is more common.⁴⁴ The Tallinn Manual only requires a “negative effect” to result from the cyberspace activity, which need not involve physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals.⁴⁵ However, the Manual does not specify what harm *would* be considered as having a sufficiently “negative effect” in this context.\n\n## 2. Areas of Controversy\n\nIt appears then that the duty to prevent harm and the due diligence obligation are already informing the cyberspace discourse, thereby eliminating, at least in part, the need to ‘reinvent the wheel’ with regard to the regulation of harmful conduct in cyberspace. However, while the relevance of these principles in the cyberspace context has been widely recognised, their precise nature and scope remain contested, and therefore in need of further development and clarification. In this regard, there appears to be several broad areas of controversy, all related in one way or another to the challenges of attribution and to questions surrounding how heavy a harm prevention burden to place on States in relation to non-State activities. After all, hackers and other cyber actors can draw from a rich menu of options for concealing their identities and evading attribution.⁴⁶\n\nHence, some have doubted the political as well as practical feasibility of no harm and due diligence obligations of States in the cyberspace context, as opposed to reliance on the stringent requirements of the law of State responsibility for direct attribution of harmful actions to States.⁴⁷ A viable due diligence framework, some\n\n⁴² *Ibid.*, 28, para. 9.\n⁴³ *Healey/Pitts* (note 8), 378.\n⁴⁴ ILC Draft Articles Transboundary Harm (note 16), 41–42.\n⁴⁵ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 5.\n⁴⁶ For example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets can be intercepted or spoofed mid-route, making it difficult to trace them back to their source.

And, even if agreed, such a general standard may not suffice. “Because of the speed with which cyber weapons could be deployed,” some observers claim, “relying only upon cyber due diligence presents too great a risk of intrusion by unfriendly actors.”⁵¹ This challenge is further complicated by “the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character,”⁵² as well as precisely “the ease with which deception can be mounted through cyber infrastructure,”⁵³ which may make it impossible for a State to prevent injury to another State.⁵⁴\n\nSome interpretations of due diligence in cyberspace have attempted to take the unique nature of cyber acts into account. For instance, the Advisory Group has limited the applicability of States’ “due diligence commitments of prevention, management and response” to situations where the State is the actual operator or manager of critical internet resources. Where it is not, the Group suggests that “the principle of subsidiarity or non-involvement of states in the ordinary administration of the network or operational issues” prevails, recognising the fact that “the private sector takes the lead in the day-to-day operations of the\n\n⁴⁸ *Sean Kanuck*, Sovereign Discourse on Cyber Conflict Under International Law, Texas Law Review (Tex.

While the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts agreed that the obligations would be triggered if a State had “actual knowledge” of the acts in question, it could not agree on whether they would also obtain if a State had only “constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge,” for instance where a State fails to use due care in policing cyber activities on its territory and is therefore unaware of the acts.59 Some have argued that “a state’s duty to prevent cyber attacks should not be based on a state’s knowledge of a particular cyber attack before it occurs, but rather on its actions to prevent cyber attacks in general,” since such attacks are “extremely difficult for host-states to detect prior to the commission of a specific attack.”60 While this approach would be in line with the general thrust of the harm prevention and due diligence obligations as they have developed in international environmental law, it has been criticised for going too far in reducing the knowledge requirement in the cyber context.61 Others have contended that “presumptive knowledge is sufficient to trigger the duty” if the cyber attack can reasonably be considered to belong to a series of cyber attacks” originating from a State’s territory.62 The position of the Advisory Group in this regard is close to the stance of international environmental law; it is that “the disruption and interference should be foreseeable and the state concerned must know or should have known under the circumstances that the given activity involved a risk of significant consequences.”63\n\n55 Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), paras. 77, 78.\n56 Tallinn Manual (note 2), 34, paras. 3–4.\n57 Fleck (note 2), 339.\n58 Margulies (note 2), 16–17.\n59 Tallinn Manual (note 2), 28, para. 11.\n60 Sklerov (note 29), 71.\n61 Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 136, 137; Pirker (note 29), 205.\n62 Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 136.\n63 Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 74.",

Notably, given the “difficulty of mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats,” the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts could not agree on whether or not these general obligations should be applied to “situations in which the relevant acts are merely prospective” as opposed to those that are already underway.⁶⁴ In other words, the Group could not agree on a general precautionary duty of States to undertake all appropriate measures with regard to potential cyber threats at an early stage and before a concrete risk of harm occurs,⁶⁵ a concept with roots in international environmental law that we discuss in more detail below. Furthermore, the Group could not reach a consensus on the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations to States through which cyber operations merely transit, in light of the “unique routing processes of cyber transmissions.”⁶⁶ By contrast, certain scholars have suggested that “reasonable measures to prevent [...] prospective acts are required”⁶⁷ and that even a mere transit State “has an obligation to prevent a cyber attack.”⁶⁸ However, there is no consensus on this issue as of yet.⁶⁹\n\nThese contentious issues, among others, must be resolved in order for the no harm principle to effectively regulate activities in cyberspace. International consensus should be achieved on the general content and limits of the due diligence standard applicable to cyberspace. Agreement is also needed on the relationship between States’ responsibility for failure to take diligent harm prevention measures and their responsibility for non-State acts directly attributable to them under the law of State responsibility. Arguably, both types of responsibility obtain, and each applies to a distinct type of ‘failure’ by a State. But, absent consensus on the issue, developing an effective normative and regulatory framework for cyberspace on the basis of the duty to prevent harm and the law of State responsibility will be difficult.⁷⁰ With the caveats noted above, the development of these principles in the environmental context, and particularly the contextual approach adopted by the ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion, may be\n\n⁶⁴ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 7.\n⁶⁵ Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 169.\n⁶⁶ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 28, 29, para. 12.\n⁶⁷ Pirker (note 29), 208.\n⁶⁸ Ibid., 209.\n⁶⁹ Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 137, 138.\n⁷⁰ Kirsch (note 2), 638; Kanuck (note 48), 1592; Kulesza, State Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks on International Peace and Security (note 8), 151; Gary Brown/Keira Poellet, The Customary International Law of Cyberspace, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 126, 141.",

Applying such an approach in the cyberspace context could allow for a flexible, contextual application of the due diligence standard. One might also envision a contextual interpretation of the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility in accordance with new technological developments and the evolving nature of cyberspace. However, as in the debates surrounding the attribution of non-State actor conduct for the purposes of the law on the use of force, many States and other observers will likely have misgivings about modifying (and thereby potentially eroding) what is meant to be a general framework for specific purposes. The due diligence standard is therefore likely to be the most promising conceptual hook for the necessary fine-tuning; the precise contours of this standard could change over time and in accordance with the gravity of the transboundary cyber harm caused.\n\n## B. Procedural Obligations\n\nThe no harm rule entails a series of procedural obligations, including the obligation to notify or warn potentially affected States,⁷¹ the obligation to exchange information, to consult and negotiate,⁷² and the general obligation to cooperate to prevent harm.⁷³ The Pulp Mills case confirms that these procedural obligations, on the one hand, have a separate existence as customary norms (that can be violated on their own terms – even when harm is ultimately not caused), and, on the other hand, are implied in the substantive obligation to prevent environmental harm (e.g. a State may have to notify or consult with another about potential harm in order to meet its obligation of diligent harm prevention).⁷⁴\n\nIn the cyberspace context, similar cooperative requirements and processes have been emphasised in light of its rapidly changing technological nature,⁷⁵ its “global character”,⁷⁶ and because protection from cyber threats requires “collaborative relationships for exchanging cyber defense data and an ability to establish trusted relationships.”⁷⁷ Accordingly, the duty to cooperate has been considered to be\n\n⁷¹ ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 7).\n\n⁷² Lac Lamocx Arbitration (note 13).\n\n⁷³ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 145 (tracing the obligation to cooperate to the good faith principle in international law).\n\n⁷⁴ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), paras. 78, 79.\n\n⁷⁵ Rolf Weber, Future Design of Cyberspace Law, Journal of Politics and Law 5 (2012), 1.\n\n⁷⁶ Ziolkowski (note 29), 177.\n\n⁷⁷ Diego Vázquez et al., Conceptual Framework for Cyber Defense Information Sharing within Trust Relationships, in: Czosseck/Ottis/Ziolkowski (eds.)

Precaution\n\nIn the environmental context, at least, due diligence also appears to have become a conceptual bridge between the duty to prevent harm and the proposition that States, in certain circumstances, also must take precautionary measures. As traditionally conceived, the no harm rule is engaged when there is a known or objectively determined risk of significant environmental harm.⁹⁹ By contrast, the precautionary principle, as articulated in Principle 15 Rio Declaration,¹⁰⁰ is triggered by ‘threats of serious or irreversible damage’ and its lower evidentiary threshold could strengthen the protective potential of international environmental law.

A “precautionary approach” was expressly recognised by the Advisory Group, which considered the identification, assessment, and notification of possible or actual risks of adverse transboundary effects on the internet, and the prior and timely notification of such risks, to form part of States’ prevention obligation in cyberspace.¹¹⁹ The Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, as we have already noted,¹²⁰ adopted a more conservative approach and did not encompass prospective acts or acts of which States ‘should have known’ in the obligation to prevent cyber harm to other States.¹²¹ Therefore, while both groups of experts seem to agree on the basic need for States to exercise due diligence in order to prevent transboundary cyber harm, their interpretations of the nature and scope of these obligations diverge.\n\nOne possible explanation for this divergence is the different nature, purpose, and mandate of each of these groups of experts. The Advisory Group, comprised of European experts in fields such as law, information, and telecommunications, was set up by the Steering Committee on the Media and New Communication Service of the Council of Europe. It was instructed to examine “the shared or mutual responsibilities of states in ensuring that critical Internet resources are managed in the public interest and as a public asset” and “make proposals [...] relating to the prevention and management of events [...] falling within member states’ jurisdictions or territories, which could block or significantly impede Internet access [...] with the objective of guaranteeing the ongoing functioning and universal nature and integrity of the Internet.”¹²² The mandate of the Advisory\n\n¹¹⁶ Robin Geiß/Henning Lehmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

Some doctrine emanating from the US, as well as European politicians and international law scholars, view cyberspace as \"the fifth battlefield\" and therefore, like the Tallinn Manual, emphasise States' obligations in terms of use of force, self-defence, and countermeasures, rather than in terms of harm prevention and due diligence.

Cyberspace as a Global Commons or a Shared Resource?\n\nIn the environmental context, it is accepted that States have an obligation to prevent harm to the territory of another State, or to areas beyond national control – global commons.¹³¹ However, the full legal ramifications of this ‘commons’ aspect of the harm prevention obligation are far from settled.¹³² Notably, there is no direct State practice on the question of who can invoke a State’s responsibility for harm to the commons. When it comes to applying the rules concerning harm to the commons to cyberspace, a prior question looms large: Is cyberspace a ‘commons’ in the first place? Alternatively, might it be a ‘shared resource’ of States?\n\nSome have identified the cyber domain as a global commons, together with the high seas, air, and space, and view these as “domains that are not controlled by any single state” but are rather “universally needed and thus should be shared.”¹³³ The Advisory Group, for instance, regarded “critical Internet resources” as global commons “under the stewardship of the international Internet community as a whole.”¹³⁴ The US and Japan have also regarded cyberspace as a global commons;\n\n¹³⁰ Kulesza, International Internet Law (note 8), 359–360.\n¹³¹ See Stockholm Declaration (note 13), Principle 21; Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 2.

From a definitional, or practical, perspective, the cyber domain is distinguishable from the other global commons on account of being a human creation and involving both physical infrastructure located in national territories and intangible features that transcend territorial borders.¹³⁶ Furthermore, unlike the sea, Antarctica, and outer space, “there is a ‘population’ or community in cyberspace and [...] [it] is not an entirely independent international space or concern that is beyond national regulation.”¹³⁷ According to some observers, in order for cyberspace to become a global commons, “long-established rights of sovereignty and property ownership recognized by the numerous domestic jurisdictions involved” in cyberspace would have to be overridden and legitimate and illegitimate users would have to be positively identified for the enforcement of norms or collective solutions. Neither of these conditions is currently satisfied in the cyberspace context.¹³⁸\n\nFrom a conceptual perspective, the identification of cyberspace as a global commons has thus far failed to clarify States’ obligations. The Advisory Group, for instance, emphasised the need for harm to be caused to another State, rather than to cyberspace as a resource, in order to trigger States’ obligations, notwithstanding its explicit reference to the internet as a global commons.¹³⁹ Moreover, the global commons concept does not necessarily make cyberspace any easier to regulate.¹⁴⁰ It has been argued, for instance, that while in the context of other global commons, users have “successfully self-organized for sustainable use of a commons” in the absence of government control, in the case of cyberspace the “affordances of the cyber technologies — that is, the way the technologies enable their use — and the mentalities of the users” have resulted in a “tragedy of the commons” that prevents effective self-organisation for sustainable use of\n\n¹³⁵ United States Department of Defense, The Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support (2005), 12, available at: https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=454976 (accessed on 23 October 2015); Ziolkowski (note 29), 183.\n¹³⁶ Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 22–23.\n¹³⁷ Kam Wai Chik, ‘Customary internet-ional law’: Creating a body of customary law for cyberspace, Part 1: Developing rules for transitioning custom into law, Computer Law &amp; Security Review 26 (2010), 3, 13.\n¹³⁸ Kanuck (note 48), 1577, 1579.\n¹³⁹ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 69.\n¹⁴⁰ Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 23.",

Even in the environmental context, the legal status of spaces or resources beyond the exclusive jurisdiction of States tends to be controversial. Aside from well-established examples of geographic areas like the high seas, Antarctica, or outer space, States have avoided the ‘commons’ label, precisely because it implies both the absence of sovereignty and certain collective rights and obligations.¹⁴⁴\n\nOne might alternatively consider the potential relevance of the notion of ‘shared resource’. This concept certainly fits key aspects of cyberspace, perhaps better than the notion of a ‘commons’, because it applies to resources that are under the jurisdiction of States but are quintessentially transboundary in nature. This paradigm permits States that share such a resource to devise norms and rules that take into account their respective sovereign interests, their mutual interests in the use and protection of the resource, and their obligations under international law. In the environmental context, States have often avoided using this umbrella concept, arguably because of the implication of less than full sovereignty and the broader implications the concept might have for other resources, and have used more issue-specific concepts, like ‘international watercourse’.¹⁴⁵\n\n¹⁴¹ Roger Hurwitz, Depleted Trust in the Cyber Commons, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 20, 21; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 366.\n\n¹⁴² But see Scott Shackelford, Toward Cyberpeace: Managing Cyberattacks Through Polycentric Governance, American University Law Review 62 (2013), 1273, 1293 (suggesting that cyberspace be treated as ‘pseudocommons’, “comprised of a shared global infrastructure that is controlled by public and private entities subject to national and international regulations”).\n\n¹⁴³ Ronald Deibert/Masashi Crets-Nishibata, Global Governance and the Spread of Cyberspace Controls, Global Governance 18 (2012), 341, 343, 345; Joanna Kuleczy/Roy Balleste, Signs and Portents in Cyberspace: The Rise of Jus Internet as a New Order in International Law, Fordham Intellectual Property, Media and Entertainment Law Journal 23 (2013), 1320.\n\n¹⁴⁴ Brunnie, Common Areas, Common Heritage, Common Concern (note 132).\n\n¹⁴⁵ See Jutta Brunnie/Stephen Toupe, Environmental Security and Freshwater Resources: Ecosystem Regime Building, American Journal of International Law 91 (1997), 26; Kanuck (note 48), 1580.",

These principles may encourage States to undertake all necessary means in order to preserve the internet for future generations, which implies a proactive countering of cyber threats, an obligation to take precautionary measures, and restraint from any action that could hamper the availability and reliability of the internet.¹⁴⁷ In short, a ‘shared resource’ model could promote stewardship in cyberspace, rather than sovereignty.¹⁴⁸ While it may not resolve fundamental definitional issues, such a model could provide an alternative conceptual framework that shifts the focus from States’ obligations to each other to States’ obligations to cyberspace as a shared resource, thereby facilitating the development of norms and rules for its governance.\n\n## IV.

International Environmental Governance\n\nIn the environmental context, so-called framework agreements have played a prominent role. They help in dealing with complex, evolving issues by allowing parties to begin by defining the common concern at hand, agreeing on principles to guide States’ actions, and establishing institutions and decision-making procedures for subsequent regime-development.^[150]^\n\nMany environmental regimes create, or collaborate with, bodies that facilitate exchange among scientific or technical experts. Such bodies are important in building consensus around the nature of collective concerns and the collective action that is required to address them. Scientific or technical expert bodies also make important contributions in the further elaboration, refinement, or adjustment of regulatory strategies.^[151]^ In the cyber context one could easily see the usefulness of such an approach, for example in relation to the constantly shifting needs of cyber security and the related due diligence standards. Environmental regime development *per se* is usually in the hands of a plenary body, which facilitates regular, long-term engagements between technical experts, policy-makers, lawyers, and relevant non-State actors (international organisations, non-governmental organisations, or business entities).^[152]^ Although, in a formal sense, law-making remains in the hands of States, non-State actors can provide input into law-making processes or even help shape their outcomes.^[153]^\n\nEnvironmental standard-setting itself occurs through decisions of plenary bodies, without subsequent formal consent by individual States. In most cases, the resulting standards are not legally binding, notwithstanding the mandatory language they may contain.^[154]^ This approach facilitates agreement on collective action and standards that are applicable to all parties – an important feature for efforts to address collective concerns. Equally important is that soft regulatory processes enable speedier regime development and adjustment than processes that require subsequent ratification by individual States.

In the climate context, for example, it took more than twenty years for parties to agree on the precise meaning of the regime objective – to forestall dangerous climate change – and parties are still struggling to achieve consensus on the parameters of one of the regime’s core principles, the notion of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities’.¹⁵⁵ On the latter concept, the positions of developed and developing countries have diverged quite dramatically, with some developing countries continuing to insist that developed countries shoulder the primary burdens of addressing climate change.¹⁵⁶ To be sure, the claims of ‘historical responsibility’ that developing countries have leveled against developed countries in relation to global carbon emissions will have no comparable basis in the cyber context. Still, a global regime-building effort in the cyber context, could also invite arguments by developing countries that States’ common responsibilities should be differentiated so as to lessen their burden or entitle them to technical or financial assistance. It seems sensible, even inevitable; to assist less developed countries in addressing the underlying common concern. In fact, most MEAs today do provide for various kinds of assistance, including through multilateral funds designed to finance conversion to new technologies or otherwise address capacity limitations.¹⁵⁷ But it is highly unlikely that major States, such as the US, will be any more inclined to accept formal differentiation or assistance obligations in the cyber context than they have been in the climate context (which is not to say ‘no assistance’).¹⁵⁸ Finally, experience with MEAs, especially the climate regime, also shows the potential pitfalls of treaty-based standard-setting.

International Cyberspace Governance\n\nAs with the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations, standard-setting bodies and multilateral agreements for cyberspace governance already exist or are being created. Their precise scope, authority, and norm-developing processes, however, remain unclear and may therefore benefit from considering the environmental governance experience.\n\nThere are many intergovernmental organisations, both specialised and general, that address different aspects of cyberspace regulation, however their ability to constitute, or form the foundation for, a universal normative or regulatory regime for cyberspace is doubtful. In terms of technical standard-setting, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a UN specialised agency, has been active “with regard to International Public Policy Issues Pertaining to the Internet and the Management of Internet Resources, including Domain Names and Addresses.”¹⁶⁰ However, it has been criticised for being unable to adjust to the rapid changes in the cyberspace environment,¹⁶¹ being potentially unrepresentative of the views of all of its members, and being ill-equipped to regulate other, non-technical, areas of cyberspace such as international and criminal law.¹⁶² Similarly, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regards “[p]reserving and enhancing the operational stability, reliability, security, and global interoperability of the Internet” as one of its core objectives, and makes binding decisions and policies on various, mostly technical, internet-related issues.¹⁶³ However, its powers continue to be largely derived from, and dependant on, the US government; it has therefore been criticised for essentially being a State actor rather than an “international organization with a fully democratic legitimation.”¹⁶⁴\n\n---\n\n¹⁵⁹ See discussion in *Brunnée/Tonpe*, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law (note 155).\n\n¹⁶⁰ *Sabine von Schorlemer*, Telecommunications, International Regulation, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International LawMPEPIL, Vol. IX (2012), 818 et seq.\n\n¹⁶¹ *Ibid.*\n\n¹⁶² *David Gross et al.*, Cyber Security Governance: Existing Structures, International Approaches and the Private Sector, in: Lord/Sharp (eds.)

Nonetheless, they have become increasingly politicised, and “distrust by some nations may prevent them from making and enforcing any unilateral policy determinations going forward.”¹⁶⁶ As for more general intergovernmental and regional organisations active in the cyberspace arena, such as the European Union (EU), Council of Europe, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, NATO, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and others, their activities with respect to cyberspace norm-development include issuing reports, organising conferences and summits, devising and promoting policies and conventions, and establishing working groups.¹⁶⁷ However, the respective responsibilities of these organisations, as well as their standard-setting authority, remain unclear; there is often little cooperation among them; and their efforts have been conflicting at times.¹⁶⁸\n\nThe limited utility of these bodies for cyberspace norm-creation arguably stems from the lack of international consensus on their precise role in cyberspace governance and the appropriate institutional character of any future regulatory regime. At the 2003 and 2005 World Summits on the Information Society (WSIS I and II),¹⁶⁹ for instance, some developed countries, led by the US, adopted a ‘non-governmental’ approach and regarded the private sector influence and in particular the mandate of ICANN as sufficient for regulatory purposes.

The EU and the US continue to object to ITU governance of the internet,¹⁷² despite growing calls for “an equal role and responsibility for international Internet governance” for all governments,¹⁷³ and the IGF remains merely a forum for discussion, without any powers of supervision or decision-making.¹⁷⁴ As a result, there is still no effective institutional authority that is universally accepted. Ultimately, it has been said that any intergovernmental institution or regime established to regulate and govern cyberspace must have sufficient expertise and technical capability for norm-creation, be perceived as having sufficient legitimacy by the international community, and be able to generate “both high level and specific behavioral norms that are widely accepted as legitimate.”¹⁷⁵\n\nA possible alternative to an intergovernmental or non-governmental regulatory institution is a treaty-based regime resembling the one established with respect to climate change.

It is not clear as of yet whether this apparent shift, notably in the UN climate change regime, reflects significant and lasting structural change in international environmental treaty making from ‘top-down’ to ‘bottom-up’ approaches.[181] At any rate, in the cyberspace context, treaty-based standard-setting and norm-creation already has been criticised for being too ‘top-down’ for the needs of the medium and, as in the environmental context, as likely to suffer from the “lowest common denominator effect.”[182] Also, creating a multilateral treaty on cyberspace regulation is bound to be a protracted process, and some observers suggest that “an adequate legal framework is only realisable if the foundation is done on an informal law-making basis.”[183] Such informal law-making efforts have in fact been attempted, for instance by China, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, who in 2011 submitted to the UN a proposal for an international code of conduct for information security.[184] While this initiative has since been discussed in various international forums,[185] its viability is doubtful in light of objections by the US and\n\n179 See e.g., Charles Dunlap, Perspectives for Cyber Strategists on Law for Cyberwar, Strategic Studies Quarterly 5 (2011), 81; Louise Arimatsu, A Treaty for Governing Cyber-Weapons: Potential Benefits and Practical Limitations, in: Czosseck/Ottis/Ziolkowski (eds.)

As already mentioned, such reluctance is evident in the disagreements concerning the allocation of a greater governance role to the ITU. Liberal democracies are concerned that the intergovernmental model of internet governance would be “fragmented, slow and not interoperable” and facilitate censorship in authoritarian States.¹⁹¹ In turn, developing States that are not able to deal with cyber threats tend to blame the flaws in internet security on the ICANN-led governance structure and seek a new, government-controlled model.¹⁹² During the 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications,¹⁹³ 89 governments, including many developing States, supported an enhanced role for the ITU over internet regulation and approved revisions to the International Telecommunication Regulations intended to transfer authority for regulating critical aspects of the internet from ICANN to the ITU.¹⁹⁴ 54 countries, including the US, the EU, and most other developed countries, however, advocated for the existing model of internet oversight by multi-stakeholder, non-governmental institutions, and refused to sign the revised text of the Regulations.¹⁹⁵ While some observers considered the outcome of the Conference to signal a “digital Cold War,”¹⁹⁶ the long term implications of these partially adopted revisions have yet to emerge.¹⁹⁷\n\nMoreover, any conceptual and/or regulatory framework for cyberspace governance would have to include non-State actors, particularly the private sector, in law-making or norm-development processes, as has been explicitly recognised.¹⁹⁸ The 2005 WSIS II Tunis Agenda, for instance, stated that the “international\n\n¹⁹¹ Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar, Cyber Diplomacy: Agenda, Challenges and Mission, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

The need to bridge the ‘digital divide’, the “social and spatial inequalities in internet access” between developed and developing countries,²⁰⁴ has long been recognised. For instance, the primary objectives of the WSIS I and II conferences were “to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society” and to “pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society.”²⁰⁵ Similarly, the recent NETmundial statement emphasised that “Internet governance institutions\n\n¹⁹⁹ Tunis Agenda (note 169), para. 29; Woltag (note 81).\n²⁰⁰ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), paras. 58, 59.\n²⁰¹ Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial), NETmundial: The beginning of a process, available at: http://netmundial.br/about/ (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n²⁰² NETmundial, NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement, 24 April 2014, available at: http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n²⁰³ Gross et al.

Here, too, lessons may be learned from the environmental context, including concerning the challenges involved.²⁰⁹\n\nIn sum, the need for multi-stakeholder involvement and global representation in the development of norms and regulatory mechanisms to govern cyberspace seems to be widely recognised. Less formal frameworks based on ‘soft law’, rather than intergovernmental agreements or institutions, may be more conducive to the development of such norms and mechanisms. Still, the involvement and cooperation of States seems equally important in light of the fact that they retain control over cyberspace infrastructure and the enforcement of cyberspace regulation, and that some form of State responsibility for harmful cyberspace activities emanating from their territories is required. Ultimately, therefore, an effective regulatory framework for cyberspace may require a “multi-layered structure”²¹⁰ that combines informal norm-developing networks, institutions for multi-stakeholder consultation, technical standard-setting bodies, and treaties for intergovernmental cooperation and regulation. As has been suggested elsewhere, “the legal framework [for cyberspace] is to be based on networks established by the concerned communities and linked together through interconnection mechanisms.”²¹¹ Such an interconnected system is necessary in order for international consensus to be achieved on the controversial elements of cyberspace governance discussed in this chapter, including the legal nature and conception of\n\n²⁰⁶ NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement (note 202).\n²⁰⁷ Warf (note 204), 21.\n²⁰⁸ Antonio Segura-Serrano, Internet Regulation and the Role of International Law, Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law 10 (2006), 191, 259, available at: www.mpii.de/files/pdf3/06_antonov1.pdf (accessed on 21 October 2010).\n²⁰⁹ See supra, notes 153–160 and accompanying text.\n²¹⁰ Weber (note 75), 7.\n²¹¹ Ibid., 4.",

Conclusion\n\nAnd so we return to the no harm rule. Our conclusion is that, at least in the short run, the most promising foundation for international cyberspace law is the harm prevention/due diligence framework that has already gained considerable traction in this context. One of this framework's main advantages is precisely that it does not require wholesale norm-creation or big normative battles, as would be required in an effort to develop norms for the governance of cyberspace itself as a 'shared' or 'commons' resource. The basic norms already exist and apply to activities and harms that involve cyberspace just as to any other activity that occurs under the jurisdiction of States.\n\nIn this regard, the evolution of international environmental law is instructive, especially in relation to the efforts to flesh out the concepts of harm prevention and due diligence. The Interim Report of the Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet is an excellent illustration of how the same could be accomplished in the cyber context. It articulates adaptations of the general principles of prevention, diligence, procedural obligations, and precaution, including to a multi-stakeholder context, and highlights the need for the development of common standards and best practices. Such standards need not be developed in legally binding form or in a multilateral treaty to be influential, or to flesh out the binding prevention and diligence obligations that exist at custom. As we have shown, although international agreements have played a crucial role in global environmental protection, we appear to be witnessing a certain return to basic principles in the regulation of transboundary environmental harm. The harm prevention/due diligence framework may offer the most suitable approach also in the cyber context, where the potential benefits of a treaty-based approach arguably are outweighed by the drawbacks. The development of cyberspace norms can rather take place through relatively informal legal means in an interconnected, multi-stakeholder system that incorporates States and non-State actors, thereby bypassing lumbering and often stalled treaty-based processes.\n\nNonetheless, the development of such norms requires some degree of international consensus on the nature of cyberspace governance, the content of basic principles, and the degree and type of regulation required. Unlike the liberal approach adopted by the Advisory Group, it seems that the Tallinn Manual Group",

Nonetheless, it is worth noting that some of the Tallinn Manual’s experts have now turned their attention to the application of international law principles, such as the use of countermeasures, to cyberspace activities in peacetime, noting that “few, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold.”²¹³ It will be interesting to see, therefore, if and how the original positions taken in the Tallinn Manual shift in this new context.\n\nNotwithstanding the usefulness of analogies with international environmental law, cyberspace really is a different kind of space, perhaps leaving for international law only the relatively limited task of holding States to appropriate standards of diligence.

We begin by exploring opportunities for borrowing well-established rules of harm prevention and due diligence from the more advanced, but not dissimilar, field of international environmental law. We argue that these rules can provide a legal foundation for the emerging field of international cyber law, and have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. We then draw on the experience of international environmental law with conceptual notions such as ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, as well as with institutional models such as multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies. We highlight the risks and drawbacks of the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a commons in the ‘virtual’ world of cyberspace.\nKEYWORDS: International Environmental Law, Non-State Actors, State Responsibility, Transboundary Harm Prevention, Due Diligence, Global Commons, Shared Resources, Institutional Framework\nI. Introduction\nFor international lawyers, the body of rules that should govern cyberspace and harmful cyber activities is still an emerging field. Much has been written in recent years about the circumstances in which cyber actions by States, or attributable to States, should be considered equivalent to ‘armed attacks’ that might trigger\n¹ The title is borrowed from *Jody Freeman*, Teaching an Old Law New Tricks, The New York Times, 30 May 2014, available at: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/opinion/teaching-an-old-law-new-tricks.html?emc=edit_tv_20140530&amp;nl=opinion&amp;nlid=28076609 (accessed on 3 July 2014) (commenting on the *Ohama* Administration’s recourse to existing clean air legislation in the face of Congress’ failure to regulate greenhouse gas emissions).\n* Professor of Law and Metcalf Chair in Environmental Law, Faculty of Law, University of Toronto.\n** SJD Candidate, University of Toronto Faculty of Law; Research Fellow, Max Planck Institute for International, European and Regulatory Procedural Law.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nanother State’s right to self-defence.² But the legal toolkit of the law on the use of force is not appropriate for dealing with the vast majority of ‘cyber attacks’ and, in any case, is not applicable. Many State-controlled cyber attacks remain below the thresholds of the use of force framework, engaging instead the basic rules requiring that States not cause harm to other States or to areas beyond State jurisdiction. Others may amount not to a ‘use of force,’ but to illegal intervention. The legal consequences, as a result, will be governed by the law of State responsibility, not the law on the use of force. The same applies, arguably, in situations in which a cyber attack might be likened to a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter),³ but not an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 UN Charter.⁴ Furthermore, and quite apart from the question whether actions fall within the ambit of the rules on the use of force or another set of rules, many cyber acts are not undertaken by States or their agents, such that States would be directly responsible for them. Rather, a large proportion of such actions are undertaken by non-State actors, who operate within the territories or otherwise under the jurisdiction of various States. It is the legal regime for this wide array of ‘peacetime’ cyber operations that we consider in this chapter, focusing in particular on the primary obligations of States in relation to non-State actions occurring under their jurisdiction.\nIn exploring this terrain, we draw on the evolution and legal building blocks of international environmental law, which we believe holds a number of important lessons for the emerging field of international cyberspace law. International environmental law evolved in a way that is not dissimilar to what is now occurring in relation to cyberspace. When the first environmental problems arose, there existed no specific rules on environmental impacts in international law. Recourse had to be had to the general rules that govern the rights and obligations attached to\n² See e.g., Peter Margulies, Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility, Melbourne Journal of International Law 14 (2013), 1; Michael N.

But dealing with international environmental problems often requires cooperation and finely calibrated response measures that can address complex problems and adapt as the problems or human understanding of them and technical capacity to solve them evolve. International environmental law and the emerging field of international cyberspace law are similar also in some important structural respects. Notably, one of the distinctive features of international environmental law is that it must almost always deal with impacts that are generated by private actors. Furthermore, like the potential consequences of cyber activities, environmental consequences of actions in one State are often felt in another State’s territory or in areas beyond State jurisdiction – the ‘commons’.\nHowever, if one were to undertake an assessment of the state of international environmental law in 2014, one might conclude that, at least in some respects, it is coming full circle. In the 1980s and 1990s, the field experienced rapid growth through the emergence of specialised rules and principles, and the subsequent proliferation and progressive expansion of more and more elaborate treaty regimes and treaty-based standard-setting processes relating to a wide array of regional and global issues.⁵ Today, new environmental agreements have become a rarity and even the further development of existing regimes through treaty-based international environmental law-making seems to have slowed. Indeed, in the case of the perhaps most complex international environmental challenge – climate change – international environmental law appears to be undergoing a fundamental shift from ‘top-down’ standard-setting to a more flexible, ‘bottom-up’ approach.⁶ Whether by coincidence or in response to these patterns, the foundational principles of international environmental law have seen something of a renaissance. In the last few years, States have invoked basic rules concerning transboundary impacts and have turned to international courts and tribunals for clarification of the attendant procedural obligations and due diligence requirements. In other words, some of the recent developments in international environmental law can be traced all the way back to its roots in basic principles concerning sovereign rights and in the iconic cases that developed these principles, such as the *Island of Palmas* arbitration or the *Corfu Channel* case.⁷\n⁵ For an overview on this evolution, see *Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey*, Mapping the Field, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2008), 1.\n⁶ See *e.g.* *Daniel Bodansky*, A Tale of Two Architectures: The Once and Future U.N.

We first discuss the application of these concepts in the environmental context, considering how they may contribute to the development of norms for the regulation of harmful activities in cyberspace. We will show that the obligations of harm prevention and due diligence have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. Many cyber security and legal scholars,⁸ as well as governments⁹ and international organisations,¹⁰ have recognised States’ obligation to exercise due diligence in order to prevent cyber activities that are harmful to other States from occurring in their territories. We then turn to the notions of ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, concepts that are prominent in international environmental law but have been controversial or of limited relevance in the cyber context. We discuss them mainly to highlight the potential and risks of efforts to regulate not only harm caused by States to other States in relation to cyberspace, but also harm caused to cyberspace itself as a common resource. Finally, drawing on the experience with the design of multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies, we offer some observations on institutional models, and highlight some of the potential drawbacks of these models in the cyber context. At this point, in any case, multilateral treaty-based regimes are largely absent in the\n⁸ See e.g., Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace, International Law Studies 89 (2013), 123, 138; Jan Messerschmidt, Hackback: Permitting Retaliatory Hacking by Non-State Actors as Proportionate Countermeasures to Transboundary Cyberharm, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 52 (2013), 275; Margulies (note 2), 16, 18, 19; Katharina Ziolkowski, Ius ad bellum in Cyberspace – Some Thoughts on the “Schmitt-Criteria” for Use of Force, in: Christian Czosseck/Rain Ottis/Katharina Ziolkowski (eds.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Proceedings (2012), 306, 307; Joanna Kulesza, International Internet Law, Global Change, Peace &amp; Security 24 (2012), 351; Tallinn Manual (note 2), 26–28; Jason Healey/Hannah Pitts, Applying International Environmental Legal Norms to Cyber Statecraft, I/S: A Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society 8 (2012), 356; Matthew E.

We will suggest that the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a 'commons' is unlikely to be feasible or even desirable. Our goal in this chapter is to explore opportunities and post warning signs for those in the 'virtual' world of cyberspace who seek to learn from the 'real' world of international environmental law.\n## II. The No Harm Rule and Related Principles\nOne of the most straightforward approaches to building international cyberspace law may be to apply the legal principles on harm prevention and due diligence to cyberspace issues. These principles are not only well established, but also anchored in foundational principles of international law that are designed to balance competing sovereign interests. For example, in the *Island of Palmas* case, the Arbitrator held that “[t]erritorial sovereignty [...] has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability.”¹¹ Similarly, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its decision in the *Corfu Channel* case, found that it is “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹²\nInternational environmental law, in the absence of specific rules, adapted these general rules to the environmental setting. The salient principles evolved into the proposition that States' rights to use their territories and resources are limited by the obligation to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control do not cause significant transboundary harm. This 'no harm' rule has since been affirmed and fleshed out through a series of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and other international instruments, as well as several arbitral and judicial decisions.¹³ The ICJ confirmed in its advisory opinion on the *Legality of the Threat* or\n¹¹ *Island of Palmas Case* (note 7), 839.\n¹² ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 7), 22.\n¹³ See e.g., *Trail Smelter Case* (USA, Canada), Arbitral Award of 16 April 1938 and 11 March 1941, RIAA III, 1905, 1965; *Lac Lamnac Arbitration* (France, Spain), Arbitral Award of 16 November 1957,\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nUse of Nuclear Weapons that “the general obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States or of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the environment.”¹⁴ The Court reiterated this conclusion in its decision in the Gabilikovo-Nagymaros case and its decision in the Pulp Mills case.¹⁵ The International Law Commission’s (ILC) Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities too confirmed States’ obligation to “take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.”¹⁶\nThe key point for our present purposes is that looking to international environmental law ultimately means turning to basic principles, applicable to any harm caused to States’ territories, including cyber-related harm, without the need for ‘norm creation’. We believe that this fact alone is a crucial advantage. In addition, international environmental law offers rich State practice and judicial opinions that provide guidance on the nature of the due diligence obligations that flow from the exercise of sovereign rights. Two recent cases are of particular interest in this respect – the ICJ’s Pulp Mills case and the advisory opinion on Activities in the Area of the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS Chamber).¹⁷ The discussion below focuses on the elements of each decision that flesh out the no harm rule with respect to due diligence, the attendant procedural obligations, and the relationship between harm prevention and precaution. As we proceed, we explore the extent to which the approach in international environmental law finds parallels in the emerging international cyberspace law.\nRIAA XII, 281; Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

Harm Prevention and Due Diligence\n1. International Environmental Law and Norm Evolution\nin International Cyberspace Law\nIn the Pulp Mills decision, the ICJ emphasised two important features of the no harm rule. First, it encompasses an obligation to prevent harm. Second, “the principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory.”¹⁸ This obligation to act with due diligence entails “not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators.”¹⁹\nThe ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion on Activities in the Area, in turn, was concerned with the responsibility of States to take appropriate measures to ensure that private entities operating in the deep seabed do not cause harm in that ‘commons’ area. Perhaps most importantly for present purposes, the Chamber highlighted the contextual nature of the due diligence standard. The Chamber observed that the due diligence standard “may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or technological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity [...] [and] be more severe for the riskier activities.”²⁰ Due diligence may vary also in light of the capacity of the State concerned, although this point appears to be more controversial. Some leading commentators on international environmental law, citing numerous international instruments that accommodate developing countries’ lesser technological and regulatory capacity, including the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change,²¹ compared the flexibility of the due diligence standard to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.²² However, the ITLOS Chamber made a point of emphasising that different treatment for developed and developing States is warranted only when the underlying international legal obligations provide for it.²³\n¹⁸ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 101.\n¹⁹ Ibid., para. 197.\n²⁰ ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), para. 117.\n²¹ See supra, note 13.\n²² Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell, International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149.\n²³ ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), paras. 151–163.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nThe general requirement of harm prevention, and its attendant due diligence obligation, has already been recognised as a basis for States' obligations with respect to cyberspace activities. The Ad hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (Advisory Group), established by the Council of Europe, explicitly referred to the use of the no harm principle in the environmental law context, and relied on it to “underline the primary nature of the proposed commitments of a state to prevent, manage and respond to significant transboundary disruption of or interference with the stability, robustness, resilience and openness of the Internet.”²⁴ Some States have also recognised a general due diligence obligation in cyberspace. The United States (US), for instance, considers cyber security due diligence to be an emerging norm according to which “States should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse,”²⁵ while recognising that “unique attributes of networked technology require additional work to clarify how these norms apply.”²⁶ A duty “not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies” was also recognised by China and Russia in 2011.²⁷ Russia argued for inclusion of a more specific duty to “take all necessary steps to prevent any destructive information action originating from their own territory or using the information infrastructure under their jurisdiction, as well as cooperate to locate the source of computer attacks carried out with the use of their territory, to repel these attacks and to eliminate their consequences” in a proposed international information security convention.²⁸\nThe obligation to prevent harm to other States from cyber attacks and other malicious cyber activities conducted in their territories is generally considered to\n²⁴ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 64.\n²⁵ US International Strategy for Cyberspace (note 9), 10.\n²⁶ Ibid., 9.\n²⁷ United Nations General Assembly, Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

Specifically, it noted that “an efficient observance of a due diligence commitment is understood as the implementation of those measures which would be commensurate with the overall capabilities of the country concerned to address the risks,”³⁸ and that legislative, administrative, or other action necessary to implement a States’ due diligence commitments “should be subject to the capabilities of the state concerned.”³⁹\nThe scope of States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations in cyberspace were also considered in the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), a document prepared by an independent international group of experts comprised of practitioners and scholars (Tallinn Manual Group of Experts).⁴⁰ While the Manual deals primarily with cyber warfare, it recognises the no harm obligation as a rule of “a general international legal nature” applicable to “the relationship between states, cyber infrastructure, and cyber operations” and extending to “all cyber activities from one State’s territory that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another States’ territory [...] irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State.”⁴¹\nAgain in keeping with the approach in international environmental law, the Tallinn Manual considers that the no harm prevention and due diligence obligations encompass the requirement that States “use all means at [their] disposal\n³⁶ Ibid., paras. 71–73.\n³⁷ Ibid., para. 74.\n³⁸ Ibid.\n³⁹ Ibid., para. 77.\n⁴⁰ Tallinn Manual (note 2).\n⁴¹ Ibid., 15, 26, 27.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 11\nto require [private entities]” to take remedial action to terminate a harmful activity.⁴² The Manual also addresses one important issue that has remained underspecified thus far: the level of harm required to trigger the harm prevention duty. In international environmental law, the *Trail Smelter Case* posited a “serious consequence” standard with respect to transboundary air pollution,⁴³ although today a “significant harm” standard, intended to exclude *de minimis* harm, is more common.⁴⁴ The Tallinn Manual only requires a “negative effect” to result from the cyberspace activity, which need not involve physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals.⁴⁵ However, the Manual does not specify what harm *would* be considered as having a sufficiently “negative effect” in this context.\n## 2. Areas of Controversy\nIt appears then that the duty to prevent harm and the due diligence obligation are already informing the cyberspace discourse, thereby eliminating, at least in part, the need to ‘reinvent the wheel’ with regard to the regulation of harmful conduct in cyberspace. However, while the relevance of these principles in the cyberspace context has been widely recognised, their precise nature and scope remain contested, and therefore in need of further development and clarification. In this regard, there appears to be several broad areas of controversy, all related in one way or another to the challenges of attribution and to questions surrounding how heavy a harm prevention burden to place on States in relation to non-State activities. After all, hackers and other cyber actors can draw from a rich menu of options for concealing their identities and evading attribution.⁴⁶\nHence, some have doubted the political as well as practical feasibility of no harm and due diligence obligations of States in the cyberspace context, as opposed to reliance on the stringent requirements of the law of State responsibility for direct attribution of harmful actions to States.⁴⁷ A viable due diligence framework, some\n⁴² *Ibid.*, 28, para. 9.\n⁴³ *Healey/Pitts* (note 8), 378.\n⁴⁴ ILC Draft Articles Transboundary Harm (note 16), 41–42.\n⁴⁵ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 5.\n⁴⁶ For example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets can be intercepted or spoofed mid-route, making it difficult to trace them back to their source. Alternatively, reliance on “botnets”, robot networks of malware-infected personal computers, allows attackers to remain anonymous by assuming the identity of someone else in order to perform malicious actions. See *Shackelford/Andres* (note 2), 982 and *Mauno Pibelgas*, Back-Tracing and Anonymity in Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 28), 46, 47. We are grateful to *Alex Ognihone* for assisting us with this point.\n⁴⁷ *Ziolkowski* (note 8), 307.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nargue, may be difficult to achieve as “it is unclear that any state is prepared (politically or technologically) to take full responsibility for all harm emanating from gateway routers, very small aperture terminals [...] wireless mobile devices, and other devices within its territory or jurisdiction.”⁴⁸ Therefore, States may not be willing to agree on criteria for a more expansive regime of indirect responsibility for non-State actors’ cyber activities, based on the ‘no harm’ principle.⁴⁹ In short, it may seem sensible and even self-evident that States should enact and enforce criminal laws regarding cross-border cyber attacks, in line with the ICJ’s finding in *Pulp Mills* that diligence requires States to “adopt appropriate rules and measures” and “take all appropriate measures to enforce” them.⁵⁰ But it may be exceedingly difficult to define in a concrete and also manageable manner what exactly are “appropriate” standards and efforts to prevent harm from cyber attacks and other hostile acts. And, even if agreed, such a general standard may not suffice. “Because of the speed with which cyber weapons could be deployed,” some observers claim, “relying only upon cyber due diligence presents too great a risk of intrusion by unfriendly actors.”⁵¹ This challenge is further complicated by “the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character,”⁵² as well as precisely “the ease with which deception can be mounted through cyber infrastructure,”⁵³ which may make it impossible for a State to prevent injury to another State.⁵⁴\nSome interpretations of due diligence in cyberspace have attempted to take the unique nature of cyber acts into account. For instance, the Advisory Group has limited the applicability of States’ “due diligence commitments of prevention, management and response” to situations where the State is the actual operator or manager of critical internet resources. Where it is not, the Group suggests that “the principle of subsidiarity or non-involvement of states in the ordinary administration of the network or operational issues” prevails, recognising the fact that “the private sector takes the lead in the day-to-day operations of the\n⁴⁸ *Sean Kanuck*, Sovereign Discourse on Cyber Conflict Under International Law, Texas Law Review (Tex.

See also *Kirsch* (note 2), 637–638 (arguing that “placing the responsibility on states for cyber attacks committed within their borders potentially unleashes a Pandora’s box of problems, particularly in determining whether the state initiated adequate control measures over the hackers”).\n⁴⁹ *Heintschel von Heinegg* (note 8), 139; *Eric Jensen*, Cyber Warfare and Precautions Against the Effects of Attacks, Tex.

While the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts agreed that the obligations would be triggered if a State had “actual knowledge” of the acts in question, it could not agree on whether they would also obtain if a State had only “constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge,” for instance where a State fails to use due care in policing cyber activities on its territory and is therefore unaware of the acts.59 Some have argued that “a state’s duty to prevent cyber attacks should not be based on a state’s knowledge of a particular cyber attack before it occurs, but rather on its actions to prevent cyber attacks in general,” since such attacks are “extremely difficult for host-states to detect prior to the commission of a specific attack.”60 While this approach would be in line with the general thrust of the harm prevention and due diligence obligations as they have developed in international environmental law, it has been criticised for going too far in reducing the knowledge requirement in the cyber context.61 Others have contended that “presumptive knowledge is sufficient to trigger the duty” if the cyber attack can reasonably be considered to belong to a series of cyber attacks” originating from a State’s territory.62 The position of the Advisory Group in this regard is close to the stance of international environmental law; it is that “the disruption and interference should be foreseeable and the state concerned must know or should have known under the circumstances that the given activity involved a risk of significant consequences.”63\n55 Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), paras. 77, 78.\n56 Tallinn Manual (note 2), 34, paras. 3–4.\n57 Fleck (note 2), 339.\n58 Margulies (note 2), 16–17.\n59 Tallinn Manual (note 2), 28, para. 11.\n60 Sklerov (note 29), 71.\n61 Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 136, 137; Pirker (note 29), 205.\n62 Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 136.\n63 Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 74.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nFinally, and relatedly, there seems to be a lack of consensus regarding the precise scope of the no harm and due diligence obligations in cyberspace. Notably, given the “difficulty of mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats,” the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts could not agree on whether or not these general obligations should be applied to “situations in which the relevant acts are merely prospective” as opposed to those that are already underway.⁶⁴ In other words, the Group could not agree on a general precautionary duty of States to undertake all appropriate measures with regard to potential cyber threats at an early stage and before a concrete risk of harm occurs,⁶⁵ a concept with roots in international environmental law that we discuss in more detail below. Furthermore, the Group could not reach a consensus on the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations to States through which cyber operations merely transit, in light of the “unique routing processes of cyber transmissions.”⁶⁶ By contrast, certain scholars have suggested that “reasonable measures to prevent [...] prospective acts are required”⁶⁷ and that even a mere transit State “has an obligation to prevent a cyber attack.”⁶⁸ However, there is no consensus on this issue as of yet.⁶⁹\nThese contentious issues, among others, must be resolved in order for the no harm principle to effectively regulate activities in cyberspace. International consensus should be achieved on the general content and limits of the due diligence standard applicable to cyberspace. Agreement is also needed on the relationship between States’ responsibility for failure to take diligent harm prevention measures and their responsibility for non-State acts directly attributable to them under the law of State responsibility. Arguably, both types of responsibility obtain, and each applies to a distinct type of ‘failure’ by a State. But, absent consensus on the issue, developing an effective normative and regulatory framework for cyberspace on the basis of the duty to prevent harm and the law of State responsibility will be difficult.⁷⁰ With the caveats noted above, the development of these principles in the environmental context, and particularly the contextual approach adopted by the ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion, may be\n⁶⁴ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 7.\n⁶⁵ Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 169.\n⁶⁶ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 28, 29, para. 12.\n⁶⁷ Pirker (note 29), 208.\n⁶⁸ Ibid., 209.\n⁶⁹ Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 137, 138.\n⁷⁰ Kirsch (note 2), 638; Kanuck (note 48), 1592; Kulesza, State Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks on International Peace and Security (note 8), 151; Gary Brown/Keira Poellet, The Customary International Law of Cyberspace, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 126, 141.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 15\nhelpful in this regard. Applying such an approach in the cyberspace context could allow for a flexible, contextual application of the due diligence standard. One might also envision a contextual interpretation of the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility in accordance with new technological developments and the evolving nature of cyberspace. However, as in the debates surrounding the attribution of non-State actor conduct for the purposes of the law on the use of force, many States and other observers will likely have misgivings about modifying (and thereby potentially eroding) what is meant to be a general framework for specific purposes. The due diligence standard is therefore likely to be the most promising conceptual hook for the necessary fine-tuning; the precise contours of this standard could change over time and in accordance with the gravity of the transboundary cyber harm caused.\n## B. Procedural Obligations\nThe no harm rule entails a series of procedural obligations, including the obligation to notify or warn potentially affected States,⁷¹ the obligation to exchange information, to consult and negotiate,⁷² and the general obligation to cooperate to prevent harm.⁷³ The Pulp Mills case confirms that these procedural obligations, on the one hand, have a separate existence as customary norms (that can be violated on their own terms – even when harm is ultimately not caused), and, on the other hand, are implied in the substantive obligation to prevent environmental harm (e.g. a State may have to notify or consult with another about potential harm in order to meet its obligation of diligent harm prevention).⁷⁴\nIn the cyberspace context, similar cooperative requirements and processes have been emphasised in light of its rapidly changing technological nature,⁷⁵ its “global character”,⁷⁶ and because protection from cyber threats requires “collaborative relationships for exchanging cyber defense data and an ability to establish trusted relationships.”⁷⁷ Accordingly, the duty to cooperate has been considered to be\n⁷¹ ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 7).\n⁷² Lac Lamocx Arbitration (note 13).\n⁷³ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 145 (tracing the obligation to cooperate to the good faith principle in international law).\n⁷⁴ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), paras. 78, 79.\n⁷⁵ Rolf Weber, Future Design of Cyberspace Law, Journal of Politics and Law 5 (2012), 1.\n⁷⁶ Ziolkowski (note 29), 177.\n⁷⁷ Diego Vázquez et al., Conceptual Framework for Cyber Defense Information Sharing within Trust Relationships, in: Czosseck/Ottis/Ziolkowski (eds.) (note 8), 2012, 4th International\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nrelevant as a general principle of international law,⁷⁸ as well as a legal obligation of States in the arena of cyber security.⁷⁹ Reliance on traditional means of international cooperation in areas such as cybercrime, however, has been viewed as incapable of offering the timely response needed.⁸⁰ Therefore, new cooperative mechanisms have been developed in this context, such as the 24/7 international assistance network established under the Budapest Convention for investigations and evidence collection concerning cybercrime.⁸¹\nThis broad duty to cooperate has been recognised as part and parcel of the obligation to prevent harm in the cyberspace context.⁸² It includes the obligation to undertake a risk assessment, to exchange information, to inform, notify, and consult other States in concrete cases of risk of significant transboundary harm,⁸³ and to cooperate “with the victim-states of cyber attacks that originated from within their borders” during investigations and prosecutions.⁸⁴ The Advisory Group, for instance, stated as general requirements that “States should co-operate mutually, in good faith and in consultation with each other and with concerned stakeholders at all stages of designing and implementing policies in relation to the Internet,”⁸⁵ and “should take all reasonable measures to provide prior and timely notification and relevant information to states that may be potentially affected.”⁸⁶ These requirements envision “participation of states within whose jurisdiction disruptions or interferences with the Internet stability, robustness and resilience may originate, and states likely to be affected or actually affected, in action aimed at prevention of, preparedness for and response to risks and threats to critical Internet resources.”⁸⁷\nConference on Cyber Conflict Proceedings (NATO CCD COE Publications 2012), 429.\n⁷⁸ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 75.\n⁷⁹ Ziolkowski (note 29), 177, 178.\n⁸⁰ United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime: Draft (February 2013), xi, available at: http://www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n⁸¹ Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Art. 35; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Internet, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. VI (2012), 227.\n⁸² Ziolkowski (note 29), 186.\n⁸³ Ibid., 169; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 376.\n⁸⁴ Sklerov (note 29), 62; Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 135.\n⁸⁵ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 18.\n⁸⁶ Ibid., 21.\n⁸⁷ Ibid., para. 75.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 17\nIn more practical terms, the Advisory Group noted that States should, in particular, “co-operate in the creation of public awareness about the risks and opportunities of cross border Internet traffic and the development of educational tools to enable citizens to share responsibilities for a safer Internet,” as well as take legislative action in order to overcome barriers to international cooperation.⁸⁸ Moreover, “states may establish mechanisms that are suitable for monitoring the implementation of their preparedness and prevention commitments in respect of disruptions and interference with the infrastructure of the Internet.”⁸⁹ The Advisory Group also set out detailed standards for information exchange and coordinated action, some of which were explicitly ‘borrowed’ from the international environmental context.⁹⁰ These include the development of common rules and practices for information sharing, incident reporting, and for deploying internet resilience technologies; timely notification of transboundary risks and vulnerabilities; assessment of possible or actual adverse transboundary effects; coordination of emergency and response policies; and mutual consultations and assistance.⁹¹ Some of these obligations have also been included in the Budapest Convention.⁹²\nThe reality remains, however, that some States from which cyber attacks originate refuse to accept responsibility or cooperate with investigations,⁹³ that a clear framework for effective and timely exchange of information on critical infrastructure protection is lacking,⁹⁴ and that outside the realm of cyber crime there has been little international cooperation in reducing the transboundary impact of malicious activities in cyberspace.⁹⁵ Since States continue to have “wide discretion as to how to fulfill the legal obligation to cooperate in the cyber realm,”⁹⁶ there is a clear need for consensus to be reached on a uniform standard for cooperation. Such consensus, moreover, cannot include only States. In light of the dominant role of the private sector and civil society in internet governance, a multi-stakeholder approach must be applied in the discussion and formulation of\n⁸⁸ Ibid., paras. 76, 79.\n⁸⁹ Ibid., para. 80.\n⁹⁰ Ibid., para. 93.\n⁹¹ Ibid., paras. 91–102.\n⁹² Such as mutual assistance, see Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Chapter III.\n⁹³ Kirsch (note 2), 638.\n⁹⁴ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 91.\n⁹⁵ Heaby/Pitts (note 8), at 366.\n⁹⁶ Ziolkowski (note 29), 178.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nprocedural obligations such as the duty to cooperate.⁹⁷ This approach requires public-private collaboration, including internet service provider assistance, as well as data exchanges and partnerships, to form part of any international legal framework or standard for cyberspace cooperation.⁹⁸\n## C. Precaution\nIn the environmental context, at least, due diligence also appears to have become a conceptual bridge between the duty to prevent harm and the proposition that States, in certain circumstances, also must take precautionary measures. As traditionally conceived, the no harm rule is engaged when there is a known or objectively determined risk of significant environmental harm.⁹⁹ By contrast, the precautionary principle, as articulated in Principle 15 Rio Declaration,¹⁰⁰ is triggered by ‘threats of serious or irreversible damage’ and its lower evidentiary threshold could strengthen the protective potential of international environmental law. However, debate persists among States and academic commentators as to the precise contents of the principle, and whether or not it has acquired customary law status.¹⁰¹ International courts and tribunals, while acknowledging the wisdom of precautionary approaches to environmental protection,¹⁰² have avoided pronouncing on its legal status.¹⁰³\nThe ITLOS Chamber, in the *Activities in the Area* advisory opinion, suggested that there was a trend “towards making [the precautionary] approach part of customary international law,”¹⁰⁴ and observed that it “is also an integral part of the general obligation of due diligence.”¹⁰⁵ This obligation requires States “to take all\n---\n⁹⁷ Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, *Principles of International Internet Law*, German Law Journal 11 (2010), 1245, 1261, 1262.\n⁹⁸ *Eneken Tikk*, *Establishing Rules for Cyber Security*, in: Scott Jasper (ed.), *Conflict and Cooperation in the Global Commons* (2012), 222–224.\n⁹⁹ See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 153.\n¹⁰⁰ Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 15.\n¹⁰¹ See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 154–164.\n¹⁰² See ICJ, *Gablikoro-Nagymaros* (note 15), para. 140; id., *Pulp Mills* (note 15), paras. 164, 185.

Indeed, it has been suggested that States are obliged “to take (general) precautionary measures with regard to potential cyber threats posing a significant risk of damage of a transboundary nature.”¹¹⁰ This obligation has also been said to form part of States’ due diligence obligation in this context,¹¹¹ and to include “the duty to undertake all appropriate regulatory measures at an early stage, and well before the (concrete) risk of harm occurs,”¹¹² although the precise degree of knowledge of such a risk required from States in order to trigger the duty, as already mentioned, remains controversial.¹¹³ Precautionary measures in this context would include “the implementation of strategic, political, organisational, administrative, legal and technical measures [...] aimed at general prevention” of misuse of cyberspace for malicious activities by non-State actors,¹¹⁴ although what precisely such measures would entail remains to be clarified by “future State practice.”¹¹⁵ Such State practice can be seen, for instance, in recent domestic legislative initiatives attempting to impose a legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to\n¹⁰⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ The ITLOS Chamber may have spelled out what the ICJ merely alluded to in its *Gablōkoon-Nagymarus* and *Pulp Mills* decisions by noting that ‘in the field of environmental protection, vigilance and prevention are required on account of the often irreversible character of damage and of the limitations inherent in the very mechanism of reparation of this type of damage’.

A “precautionary approach” was expressly recognised by the Advisory Group, which considered the identification, assessment, and notification of possible or actual risks of adverse transboundary effects on the internet, and the prior and timely notification of such risks, to form part of States’ prevention obligation in cyberspace.¹¹⁹ The Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, as we have already noted,¹²⁰ adopted a more conservative approach and did not encompass prospective acts or acts of which States ‘should have known’ in the obligation to prevent cyber harm to other States.¹²¹ Therefore, while both groups of experts seem to agree on the basic need for States to exercise due diligence in order to prevent transboundary cyber harm, their interpretations of the nature and scope of these obligations diverge.\nOne possible explanation for this divergence is the different nature, purpose, and mandate of each of these groups of experts. The Advisory Group, comprised of European experts in fields such as law, information, and telecommunications, was set up by the Steering Committee on the Media and New Communication Service of the Council of Europe. It was instructed to examine “the shared or mutual responsibilities of states in ensuring that critical Internet resources are managed in the public interest and as a public asset” and “make proposals [...] relating to the prevention and management of events [...] falling within member states’ jurisdictions or territories, which could block or significantly impede Internet access [...] with the objective of guaranteeing the ongoing functioning and universal nature and integrity of the Internet.”¹²² The mandate of the Advisory\n¹¹⁶ Robin Geiß/Henning Lehmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

In so doing, it focused on States’ due diligence and procedural obligations while excluding such controversial issues as State responsibility, cyber warfare, and countermeasures.¹²³\nThe Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, on the other hand, was comprised of both European and non-European legal and technical experts (but all from Western States), many of whom with experience or expertise related to armed conflict, national defence, or security policy.¹²⁴ It was set up by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, an international military organisation,¹²⁵ and tasked with producing “a manual on the law governing cyber warfare.”¹²⁶ Accordingly, the Manual explicitly excluded any detailed discussion of cyber activities “that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.”¹²⁷ While it addressed the application of general international legal rules to cyberspace in times of peace, including States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations, the focus of the Manual was on cyber warfare and the application of international laws of armed conflict to it. Having to decide on such controversial issues, which were avoided by the Advisory Group, as well as the background of some of the experts in the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, may have influenced the tone of the Manual and its perspective, resulting in a more conservative and narrow stance with respect to States’ obligations in cyberspace.¹²⁸ As one commentator noted, “the Experts were very cautious to avoid taking any risks when drafting the rules” and, since unanimity was required to formulate the rules, “the most controversial international law aspects of cyber operations were therefore left unresolved.”¹²⁹\nThe different approaches taken by the Advisory Group and the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts reflect some of the underlying disagreements and confusion that\n¹²³ The Advisory Group explicitly drew a distinction between States’ commitments to prevent and manage cross-border disruptions of or interferences with the internet and international law rules governing responsibility for internationally wrongful acts, Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 20, para. 85.\n¹²⁴ See “the international group of experts and participants” in the Tallinn Manual (note 2), x–xiii.\n¹²⁵ Although the Tallinn Manual does not represent the views of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, its sponsoring nations, or NATO, Tallinn Manual (note 2), 11.\n¹²⁶ Ibid., (note 2), at 1.\n¹²⁷ Ibid., 4.\n¹²⁸ It has been suggested, for instance, that there may be an overtly close connection between the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts and the military and a potential resulting bias in the substance of the Manual, Pirkor (note 29), 190.\n¹²⁹ Marco Rossini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (2014), 31.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\npersist in the cyberspace context with regard to States' harm prevention and due diligence obligations, what precisely these obligations entail, and when they apply. Some doctrine emanating from the US, as well as European politicians and international law scholars, view cyberspace as \"the fifth battlefield\" and therefore, like the Tallinn Manual, emphasise States' obligations in terms of use of force, self-defence, and countermeasures, rather than in terms of harm prevention and due diligence. An opposite view is that said to be represented by the Advisory Group, which \"holds that states are obliged to observe due diligence in preventing cyber attacks and they may only be held responsible for a cyber attack if it can be demonstrated that they have failed to meet the due diligence standard.\"¹³⁰\n## III. Cyberspace as a Global Commons or a Shared Resource?\nIn the environmental context, it is accepted that States have an obligation to prevent harm to the territory of another State, or to areas beyond national control – global commons.¹³¹ However, the full legal ramifications of this ‘commons’ aspect of the harm prevention obligation are far from settled.¹³² Notably, there is no direct State practice on the question of who can invoke a State’s responsibility for harm to the commons. When it comes to applying the rules concerning harm to the commons to cyberspace, a prior question looms large: Is cyberspace a ‘commons’ in the first place? Alternatively, might it be a ‘shared resource’ of States?\nSome have identified the cyber domain as a global commons, together with the high seas, air, and space, and view these as “domains that are not controlled by any single state” but are rather “universally needed and thus should be shared.”¹³³ The Advisory Group, for instance, regarded “critical Internet resources” as global commons “under the stewardship of the international Internet community as a whole.”¹³⁴ The US and Japan have also regarded cyberspace as a global commons;\n¹³⁰ Kulesza, International Internet Law (note 8), 359–360.\n¹³¹ See Stockholm Declaration (note 13), Principle 21; Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 2.

From a definitional, or practical, perspective, the cyber domain is distinguishable from the other global commons on account of being a human creation and involving both physical infrastructure located in national territories and intangible features that transcend territorial borders.¹³⁶ Furthermore, unlike the sea, Antarctica, and outer space, “there is a ‘population’ or community in cyberspace and [...] [it] is not an entirely independent international space or concern that is beyond national regulation.”¹³⁷ According to some observers, in order for cyberspace to become a global commons, “long-established rights of sovereignty and property ownership recognized by the numerous domestic jurisdictions involved” in cyberspace would have to be overridden and legitimate and illegitimate users would have to be positively identified for the enforcement of norms or collective solutions. Neither of these conditions is currently satisfied in the cyberspace context.¹³⁸\nFrom a conceptual perspective, the identification of cyberspace as a global commons has thus far failed to clarify States’ obligations. The Advisory Group, for instance, emphasised the need for harm to be caused to another State, rather than to cyberspace as a resource, in order to trigger States’ obligations, notwithstanding its explicit reference to the internet as a global commons.¹³⁹ Moreover, the global commons concept does not necessarily make cyberspace any easier to regulate.¹⁴⁰ It has been argued, for instance, that while in the context of other global commons, users have “successfully self-organized for sustainable use of a commons” in the absence of government control, in the case of cyberspace the “affordances of the cyber technologies — that is, the way the technologies enable their use — and the mentalities of the users” have resulted in a “tragedy of the commons” that prevents effective self-organisation for sustainable use of\n¹³⁵ United States Department of Defense, The Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support (2005), 12, available at: https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=454976 (accessed on 23 October 2015); Ziolkowski (note 29), 183.\n¹³⁶ Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 22–23.\n¹³⁷ Kam Wai Chik, ‘Customary internet-ional law’: Creating a body of customary law for cyberspace, Part 1: Developing rules for transitioning custom into law, Computer Law &amp; Security Review 26 (2010), 3, 13.\n¹³⁸ Kanuck (note 48), 1577, 1579.\n¹³⁹ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 69.\n¹⁴⁰ Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 23.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ncyberspace.¹⁴¹ The concept of cyberspace as a commons, therefore, does not seem to have contributed much to the development of clear norms to regulate its use, and may even hinder this process.¹⁴²\nSome academic observers have warned against what they view as a gradual move away from the perception of cyberspace as a global commons and toward a State-based governance regime, considering it to constitute “norm regression” in the global governance of cyberspace.¹⁴³ But however intuitive it may seem to think of cyberspace as a type of commons, the idea remains controversial and in any event would not necessarily advance the effort to develop norms for the regulation of cyberspace, such as the duty to prevent harm. Even in the environmental context, the legal status of spaces or resources beyond the exclusive jurisdiction of States tends to be controversial. Aside from well-established examples of geographic areas like the high seas, Antarctica, or outer space, States have avoided the ‘commons’ label, precisely because it implies both the absence of sovereignty and certain collective rights and obligations.¹⁴⁴\nOne might alternatively consider the potential relevance of the notion of ‘shared resource’. This concept certainly fits key aspects of cyberspace, perhaps better than the notion of a ‘commons’, because it applies to resources that are under the jurisdiction of States but are quintessentially transboundary in nature. This paradigm permits States that share such a resource to devise norms and rules that take into account their respective sovereign interests, their mutual interests in the use and protection of the resource, and their obligations under international law. In the environmental context, States have often avoided using this umbrella concept, arguably because of the implication of less than full sovereignty and the broader implications the concept might have for other resources, and have used more issue-specific concepts, like ‘international watercourse’.¹⁴⁵\n¹⁴¹ Roger Hurwitz, Depleted Trust in the Cyber Commons, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 20, 21; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 366.\n¹⁴² But see Scott Shackelford, Toward Cyberpeace: Managing Cyberattacks Through Polycentric Governance, American University Law Review 62 (2013), 1273, 1293 (suggesting that cyberspace be treated as ‘pseudocommons’, “comprised of a shared global infrastructure that is controlled by public and private entities subject to national and international regulations”).\n¹⁴³ Ronald Deibert/Masashi Crets-Nishibata, Global Governance and the Spread of Cyberspace Controls, Global Governance 18 (2012), 341, 343, 345; Joanna Kuleczy/Roy Balleste, Signs and Portents in Cyberspace: The Rise of Jus Internet as a New Order in International Law, Fordham Intellectual Property, Media and Entertainment Law Journal 23 (2013), 1320.\n¹⁴⁴ Brunnie, Common Areas, Common Heritage, Common Concern (note 132).\n¹⁴⁵ See Jutta Brunnie/Stephen Toupe, Environmental Security and Freshwater Resources: Ecosystem Regime Building, American Journal of International Law 91 (1997), 26; Kanuck (note 48), 1580.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 25\nNonetheless, this conception could be helpful in relation to cyberspace since it would allow States to maintain certain sovereign rights, although these would not be absolute and would be balanced against the interests of other States and the international community.¹⁴⁶ While the concept of ‘shared resource’ is not a panacea for the difficulties already discussed with respect to defining and applying the no harm and due diligence obligations to cyberspace, it has been suggested that such a tailored model may present an alternative avenue for establishing States’ legal obligation to cooperate in this context through such principles as the sustainable and equitable use of shared resources. These principles may encourage States to undertake all necessary means in order to preserve the internet for future generations, which implies a proactive countering of cyber threats, an obligation to take precautionary measures, and restraint from any action that could hamper the availability and reliability of the internet.¹⁴⁷ In short, a ‘shared resource’ model could promote stewardship in cyberspace, rather than sovereignty.¹⁴⁸ While it may not resolve fundamental definitional issues, such a model could provide an alternative conceptual framework that shifts the focus from States’ obligations to each other to States’ obligations to cyberspace as a shared resource, thereby facilitating the development of norms and rules for its governance.\n## IV. Institutional Frameworks\nIt has been said that “there are structural similarities between the milieus of international law and of the Internet: neither is completely hierarchical and both must deal with ‘commons’ problems.”¹⁴⁹ Whether the future cyberspace governance regime will be grounded in the no harm and due diligence framework or in a ‘commons’ framework that may evolve over time, an additional question concerns the appropriate process for developing and maintaining the attendant normative and regulatory framework. International environmental law offers some models for governance regimes, and we thus turn to an examination of its normative and regulatory structures.\n¹⁴⁶ Ibid., 1580.\n¹⁴⁷ Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 179–181.\n¹⁴⁸ See Duncan Hollis, Stewardship versus Sovereignty?

International Environmental Governance\nIn the environmental context, so-called framework agreements have played a prominent role. They help in dealing with complex, evolving issues by allowing parties to begin by defining the common concern at hand, agreeing on principles to guide States’ actions, and establishing institutions and decision-making procedures for subsequent regime-development.^[150]^\nMany environmental regimes create, or collaborate with, bodies that facilitate exchange among scientific or technical experts. Such bodies are important in building consensus around the nature of collective concerns and the collective action that is required to address them. Scientific or technical expert bodies also make important contributions in the further elaboration, refinement, or adjustment of regulatory strategies.^[151]^ In the cyber context one could easily see the usefulness of such an approach, for example in relation to the constantly shifting needs of cyber security and the related due diligence standards. Environmental regime development *per se* is usually in the hands of a plenary body, which facilitates regular, long-term engagements between technical experts, policy-makers, lawyers, and relevant non-State actors (international organisations, non-governmental organisations, or business entities).^[152]^ Although, in a formal sense, law-making remains in the hands of States, non-State actors can provide input into law-making processes or even help shape their outcomes.^[153]^\nEnvironmental standard-setting itself occurs through decisions of plenary bodies, without subsequent formal consent by individual States. In most cases, the resulting standards are not legally binding, notwithstanding the mandatory language they may contain.^[154]^ This approach facilitates agreement on collective action and standards that are applicable to all parties – an important feature for efforts to address collective concerns. Equally important is that soft regulatory processes enable speedier regime development and adjustment than processes that require subsequent ratification by individual States. In the cyber context both of these features could be significant, since (as in the environmental context) cyber\n^[150]^ See *Jutta Brunnée*, Toward Effective International Environmental Law – Trends and Developments, in: Steven Kennett (ed.), Law and Process in Environmental Management (1993), 222–229.\n^[151]^ For a detailed discussion, see *ead*, Coping with Consent: Lawmaking under Multilateral Environmental Agreements, Leiden Journal of International Law 15 (2002), 1.\n^[152]^ *Ibid.*, 15, 16.\n^[153]^ *Ibid.*, 14.\n^[154]^ *Ibid.*, 25, 26.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 27\nproblems, or relevant technical understanding or capacity, as well as political dynamics, typically evolve over time, often rapidly.\nWith respect to treaty making, the experience with MEAs shows that even an apparently straightforward matter as agreeing on the nature and scope of the underlying concern and the principles that should govern it may be fraught with difficulties. In the climate context, for example, it took more than twenty years for parties to agree on the precise meaning of the regime objective – to forestall dangerous climate change – and parties are still struggling to achieve consensus on the parameters of one of the regime’s core principles, the notion of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities’.¹⁵⁵ On the latter concept, the positions of developed and developing countries have diverged quite dramatically, with some developing countries continuing to insist that developed countries shoulder the primary burdens of addressing climate change.¹⁵⁶ To be sure, the claims of ‘historical responsibility’ that developing countries have leveled against developed countries in relation to global carbon emissions will have no comparable basis in the cyber context. Still, a global regime-building effort in the cyber context, could also invite arguments by developing countries that States’ common responsibilities should be differentiated so as to lessen their burden or entitle them to technical or financial assistance. It seems sensible, even inevitable; to assist less developed countries in addressing the underlying common concern. In fact, most MEAs today do provide for various kinds of assistance, including through multilateral funds designed to finance conversion to new technologies or otherwise address capacity limitations.¹⁵⁷ But it is highly unlikely that major States, such as the US, will be any more inclined to accept formal differentiation or assistance obligations in the cyber context than they have been in the climate context (which is not to say ‘no assistance’).¹⁵⁸ Finally, experience with MEAs, especially the climate regime, also shows the potential pitfalls of treaty-based standard-setting. The need for agreement by a significant majority of parties (typically 3/4) and the common practice of consensus decision-making can easily stall progress or result\n¹⁵⁵ See Jutta Brunnée/Stephen Toupe, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (2010), Chapter 4.\n¹⁵⁶ See Jutta Brunnée/Charlotte Streck, The UNFCCC as a Negotiating Forum: Towards Common but more Differentiated Responsibilities, Climate Policy 13 (2013), 589.\n¹⁵⁷ For an overview, see Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, Technical and Financial Assistance, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.) (note 5), 947.\n¹⁵⁸ It is precisely this dimension of the principle that prompted the United States to declare that Principle 7 Rio Declaration (one prominent articulation of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’) did not ‘imply a recognition or acceptance by the United States of any international obligations or liabilities, or any diminution of the responsibilities of developing countries under international law’, see UN Report of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg, South Africa, 26 August – 4 September 2002, UN Doc. A/CONF.199/20 (2002), 145.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nin lowest-common-denominator standard-setting,¹⁵⁹ a concern that has been raised also in the cyber context and will be further discussed below.\n## B. International Cyberspace Governance\nAs with the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations, standard-setting bodies and multilateral agreements for cyberspace governance already exist or are being created. Their precise scope, authority, and norm-developing processes, however, remain unclear and may therefore benefit from considering the environmental governance experience.\nThere are many intergovernmental organisations, both specialised and general, that address different aspects of cyberspace regulation, however their ability to constitute, or form the foundation for, a universal normative or regulatory regime for cyberspace is doubtful. In terms of technical standard-setting, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a UN specialised agency, has been active “with regard to International Public Policy Issues Pertaining to the Internet and the Management of Internet Resources, including Domain Names and Addresses.”¹⁶⁰ However, it has been criticised for being unable to adjust to the rapid changes in the cyberspace environment,¹⁶¹ being potentially unrepresentative of the views of all of its members, and being ill-equipped to regulate other, non-technical, areas of cyberspace such as international and criminal law.¹⁶² Similarly, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regards “[p]reserving and enhancing the operational stability, reliability, security, and global interoperability of the Internet” as one of its core objectives, and makes binding decisions and policies on various, mostly technical, internet-related issues.¹⁶³ However, its powers continue to be largely derived from, and dependant on, the US government; it has therefore been criticised for essentially being a State actor rather than an “international organization with a fully democratic legitimation.”¹⁶⁴\n---\n¹⁵⁹ See discussion in *Brunnée/Tonpe*, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law (note 155).\n¹⁶⁰ *Sabine von Schorlemer*, Telecommunications, International Regulation, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International LawMPEPIL, Vol. IX (2012), 818 et seq.\n¹⁶¹ *Ibid.*\n¹⁶² *David Gross et al.*, Cyber Security Governance: Existing Structures, International Approaches and the Private Sector, in: Lord/Sharp (eds.) (note 162), 114, 116.\n¹⁶³ *Woltag* (note 81).\n¹⁶⁴ *Ibid.*\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 29\nThese essentially technical bodies,¹⁶⁵ moreover, lack any formal law-making ability. Nonetheless, they have become increasingly politicised, and “distrust by some nations may prevent them from making and enforcing any unilateral policy determinations going forward.”¹⁶⁶ As for more general intergovernmental and regional organisations active in the cyberspace arena, such as the European Union (EU), Council of Europe, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, NATO, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and others, their activities with respect to cyberspace norm-development include issuing reports, organising conferences and summits, devising and promoting policies and conventions, and establishing working groups.¹⁶⁷ However, the respective responsibilities of these organisations, as well as their standard-setting authority, remain unclear; there is often little cooperation among them; and their efforts have been conflicting at times.¹⁶⁸\nThe limited utility of these bodies for cyberspace norm-creation arguably stems from the lack of international consensus on their precise role in cyberspace governance and the appropriate institutional character of any future regulatory regime. At the 2003 and 2005 World Summits on the Information Society (WSIS I and II),¹⁶⁹ for instance, some developed countries, led by the US, adopted a ‘non-governmental’ approach and regarded the private sector influence and in particular the mandate of ICANN as sufficient for regulatory purposes. A majority of developing countries, including China, however, called for a ‘government-centered’ approach involving intergovernmental management of the internet, for example by the ITU.¹⁷⁰ It was ultimately decided to maintain the existing governance system, while establishing a new Internet Governance Forum (IGF) within the UN for\n¹⁶⁵ As well as others, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the Internet Society (ISOC), the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n¹⁶⁶ Deibert/Crete-Nishibata (note 141), 346, 347; Gross et al.

The EU and the US continue to object to ITU governance of the internet,¹⁷² despite growing calls for “an equal role and responsibility for international Internet governance” for all governments,¹⁷³ and the IGF remains merely a forum for discussion, without any powers of supervision or decision-making.¹⁷⁴ As a result, there is still no effective institutional authority that is universally accepted. Ultimately, it has been said that any intergovernmental institution or regime established to regulate and govern cyberspace must have sufficient expertise and technical capability for norm-creation, be perceived as having sufficient legitimacy by the international community, and be able to generate “both high level and specific behavioral norms that are widely accepted as legitimate.”¹⁷⁵\nA possible alternative to an intergovernmental or non-governmental regulatory institution is a treaty-based regime resembling the one established with respect to climate change. The development of such a regime was attempted, for instance, with respect to the regulation of cyber crime through the creation of the Budapest Convention. However, the Convention has only been ratified by 47 States thus far,¹⁷⁶ and is unlikely to be universally adopted since many nations view it as a ‘European’ document.¹⁷⁷ Multilateral treaties to regulate certain aspects of cyberspace, including cyber security, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, have also been suggested by scholars,¹⁷⁸ as well as States such as Russia.

It is not clear as of yet whether this apparent shift, notably in the UN climate change regime, reflects significant and lasting structural change in international environmental treaty making from ‘top-down’ to ‘bottom-up’ approaches.[181] At any rate, in the cyberspace context, treaty-based standard-setting and norm-creation already has been criticised for being too ‘top-down’ for the needs of the medium and, as in the environmental context, as likely to suffer from the “lowest common denominator effect.”[182] Also, creating a multilateral treaty on cyberspace regulation is bound to be a protracted process, and some observers suggest that “an adequate legal framework is only realisable if the foundation is done on an informal law-making basis.”[183] Such informal law-making efforts have in fact been attempted, for instance by China, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, who in 2011 submitted to the UN a proposal for an international code of conduct for information security.[184] While this initiative has since been discussed in various international forums,[185] its viability is doubtful in light of objections by the US and\n179 See e.g., Charles Dunlap, Perspectives for Cyber Strategists on Law for Cyberwar, Strategic Studies Quarterly 5 (2011), 81; Louise Arimatsu, A Treaty for Governing Cyber-Weapons: Potential Benefits and Practical Limitations, in: Czosseck/Ottis/Ziolkowski (eds.)

This type of norm-building effort would have to overcome several obstacles, quite apart from State security interests.

As already mentioned, such reluctance is evident in the disagreements concerning the allocation of a greater governance role to the ITU. Liberal democracies are concerned that the intergovernmental model of internet governance would be “fragmented, slow and not interoperable” and facilitate censorship in authoritarian States.¹⁹¹ In turn, developing States that are not able to deal with cyber threats tend to blame the flaws in internet security on the ICANN-led governance structure and seek a new, government-controlled model.¹⁹² During the 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications,¹⁹³ 89 governments, including many developing States, supported an enhanced role for the ITU over internet regulation and approved revisions to the International Telecommunication Regulations intended to transfer authority for regulating critical aspects of the internet from ICANN to the ITU.¹⁹⁴ 54 countries, including the US, the EU, and most other developed countries, however, advocated for the existing model of internet oversight by multi-stakeholder, non-governmental institutions, and refused to sign the revised text of the Regulations.¹⁹⁵ While some observers considered the outcome of the Conference to signal a “digital Cold War,”¹⁹⁶ the long term implications of these partially adopted revisions have yet to emerge.¹⁹⁷\nMoreover, any conceptual and/or regulatory framework for cyberspace governance would have to include non-State actors, particularly the private sector, in law-making or norm-development processes, as has been explicitly recognised.¹⁹⁸ The 2005 WSIS II Tunis Agenda, for instance, stated that the “international\n¹⁹¹ Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar, Cyber Diplomacy: Agenda, Challenges and Mission, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

The need to bridge the ‘digital divide’, the “social and spatial inequalities in internet access” between developed and developing countries,²⁰⁴ has long been recognised. For instance, the primary objectives of the WSIS I and II conferences were “to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society” and to “pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society.”²⁰⁵ Similarly, the recent NETmundial statement emphasised that “Internet governance institutions\n¹⁹⁹ Tunis Agenda (note 169), para. 29; Woltag (note 81).\n²⁰⁰ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), paras. 58, 59.\n²⁰¹ Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial), NETmundial: The beginning of a process, available at: http://netmundial.br/about/ (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n²⁰² NETmundial, NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement, 24 April 2014, available at: http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n²⁰³ Gross et al.

Here, too, lessons may be learned from the environmental context, including concerning the challenges involved.²⁰⁹\nIn sum, the need for multi-stakeholder involvement and global representation in the development of norms and regulatory mechanisms to govern cyberspace seems to be widely recognised. Less formal frameworks based on ‘soft law’, rather than intergovernmental agreements or institutions, may be more conducive to the development of such norms and mechanisms. Still, the involvement and cooperation of States seems equally important in light of the fact that they retain control over cyberspace infrastructure and the enforcement of cyberspace regulation, and that some form of State responsibility for harmful cyberspace activities emanating from their territories is required. Ultimately, therefore, an effective regulatory framework for cyberspace may require a “multi-layered structure”²¹⁰ that combines informal norm-developing networks, institutions for multi-stakeholder consultation, technical standard-setting bodies, and treaties for intergovernmental cooperation and regulation. As has been suggested elsewhere, “the legal framework [for cyberspace] is to be based on networks established by the concerned communities and linked together through interconnection mechanisms.”²¹¹ Such an interconnected system is necessary in order for international consensus to be achieved on the controversial elements of cyberspace governance discussed in this chapter, including the legal nature and conception of\n²⁰⁶ NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement (note 202).\n²⁰⁷ Warf (note 204), 21.\n²⁰⁸ Antonio Segura-Serrano, Internet Regulation and the Role of International Law, Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law 10 (2006), 191, 259, available at: www.mpii.de/files/pdf3/06_antonov1.pdf (accessed on 21 October 2010).\n²⁰⁹ See supra, notes 153–160 and accompanying text.\n²¹⁰ Weber (note 75), 7.\n²¹¹ Ibid., 4.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ncyberspace and the content and limits of States' obligations in relation to peacetime cyberspace activities.\n## V. Conclusion\nAnd so we return to the no harm rule. Our conclusion is that, at least in the short run, the most promising foundation for international cyberspace law is the harm prevention/due diligence framework that has already gained considerable traction in this context. One of this framework's main advantages is precisely that it does not require wholesale norm-creation or big normative battles, as would be required in an effort to develop norms for the governance of cyberspace itself as a 'shared' or 'commons' resource. The basic norms already exist and apply to activities and harms that involve cyberspace just as to any other activity that occurs under the jurisdiction of States.\nIn this regard, the evolution of international environmental law is instructive, especially in relation to the efforts to flesh out the concepts of harm prevention and due diligence. The Interim Report of the Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet is an excellent illustration of how the same could be accomplished in the cyber context. It articulates adaptations of the general principles of prevention, diligence, procedural obligations, and precaution, including to a multi-stakeholder context, and highlights the need for the development of common standards and best practices. Such standards need not be developed in legally binding form or in a multilateral treaty to be influential, or to flesh out the binding prevention and diligence obligations that exist at custom. As we have shown, although international agreements have played a crucial role in global environmental protection, we appear to be witnessing a certain return to basic principles in the regulation of transboundary environmental harm. The harm prevention/due diligence framework may offer the most suitable approach also in the cyber context, where the potential benefits of a treaty-based approach arguably are outweighed by the drawbacks. The development of cyberspace norms can rather take place through relatively informal legal means in an interconnected, multi-stakeholder system that incorporates States and non-State actors, thereby bypassing lumbering and often stalled treaty-based processes.\nNonetheless, the development of such norms requires some degree of international consensus on the nature of cyberspace governance, the content of basic principles, and the degree and type of regulation required. Unlike the liberal approach adopted by the Advisory Group, it seems that the Tallinn Manual Group\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 37\nof Experts took a more conservative stance and could not agree on certain issues, notably the question whether there is a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent any cyber activity with a ‘negative effect,’ or just a duty not to knowingly allow harmful acts that are underway to continue.²¹² As we have suggested, the different nature, focus, and purpose of these two groups of experts may account for their divergent approaches to States’ obligations in this context. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that some of the Tallinn Manual’s experts have now turned their attention to the application of international law principles, such as the use of countermeasures, to cyberspace activities in peacetime, noting that “few, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold.”²¹³ It will be interesting to see, therefore, if and how the original positions taken in the Tallinn Manual shift in this new context.\nNotwithstanding the usefulness of analogies with international environmental law, cyberspace really is a different kind of space, perhaps leaving for international law only the relatively limited task of holding States to appropriate standards of diligence. Although consensus has yet to be achieved on the content and limits of these norms as they apply to this unique, virtual ‘ecosystem’, we believe that it is worth teaching an old law new tricks!\n²¹² Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, 28, paras. 7, 11.\n²¹³ Schmitt, Cyber Operations (note 2), 1.\nTSpace Research Repository\ntspace.library.utoronto.ca\nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO\nLIBRARIES",

We begin by exploring opportunities for borrowing well-established rules of harm prevention and due diligence from the more advanced, but not dissimilar, field of international environmental law. We argue that these rules can provide a legal foundation for the emerging field of international cyber law, and have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. We then draw on the experience of international environmental law with conceptual notions such as ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, as well as with institutional models such as multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies. We highlight the risks and drawbacks of the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a commons in the ‘virtual’ world of cyberspace.\nKEYWORDS: International Environmental Law, Non-State Actors, State Responsibility, Transboundary Harm Prevention, Due Diligence, Global Commons, Shared Resources, Institutional Framework\nI. Introduction\nFor international lawyers, the body of rules that should govern cyberspace and harmful cyber activities is still an emerging field.

But the legal toolkit of the law on the use of force is not appropriate for dealing with the vast majority of ‘cyber attacks’ and, in any case, is not applicable. Many State-controlled cyber attacks remain below the thresholds of the use of force framework, engaging instead the basic rules requiring that States not cause harm to other States or to areas beyond State jurisdiction. Others may amount not to a ‘use of force,’ but to illegal intervention. The legal consequences, as a result, will be governed by the law of State responsibility, not the law on the use of force. The same applies, arguably, in situations in which a cyber attack might be likened to a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter), but not an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 UN Charter. Furthermore, and quite apart from the question whether actions fall within the ambit of the rules on the use of force or another set of rules, many cyber acts are not undertaken by States or their agents, such that States would be directly responsible for them. Rather, a large proportion of such actions are undertaken by non-State actors, who operate within the territories or otherwise under the jurisdiction of various States. It is the legal regime for this wide array of ‘peacetime’ cyber operations that we consider in this chapter, focusing in particular on the primary obligations of States in relation to non-State actions occurring under their jurisdiction.\nIn exploring this terrain, we draw on the evolution and legal building blocks of international environmental law, which we believe holds a number of important lessons for the emerging field of international cyberspace law. International environmental law evolved in a way that is not dissimilar to what is now occurring in relation to cyberspace. When the first environmental problems arose, there existed no specific rules on environmental impacts in international law. Recourse had to be had to the general rules that govern the rights and obligations attached to\n See e.g., Peter Margulies, Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility, Melbourne Journal of International Law 14 (2013), 1; Michael N.

Schmitt, International Law in Cyberspace: The Kob Speech and Tallinn Manual Juxtaposed, Harvard International Law Journal 54 (2012), 13, 20.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 3\nState sovereignty. But dealing with international environmental problems often requires cooperation and finely calibrated response measures that can address complex problems and adapt as the problems or human understanding of them and technical capacity to solve them evolve. International environmental law and the emerging field of international cyberspace law are similar also in some important structural respects. Notably, one of the distinctive features of international environmental law is that it must almost always deal with impacts that are generated by private actors. Furthermore, like the potential consequences of cyber activities, environmental consequences of actions in one State are often felt in another State’s territory or in areas beyond State jurisdiction – the ‘commons’.\nHowever, if one were to undertake an assessment of the state of international environmental law in 2014, one might conclude that, at least in some respects, it is coming full circle. In the 1980s and 1990s, the field experienced rapid growth through the emergence of specialised rules and principles, and the subsequent proliferation and progressive expansion of more and more elaborate treaty regimes and treaty-based standard-setting processes relating to a wide array of regional and global issues. Today, new environmental agreements have become a rarity and even the further development of existing regimes through treaty-based international environmental law-making seems to have slowed. Indeed, in the case of the perhaps most complex international environmental challenge – climate change – international environmental law appears to be undergoing a fundamental shift from ‘top-down’ standard-setting to a more flexible, ‘bottom-up’ approach. Whether by coincidence or in response to these patterns, the foundational principles of international environmental law have seen something of a renaissance. In the last few years, States have invoked basic rules concerning transboundary impacts and have turned to international courts and tribunals for clarification of the attendant procedural obligations and due diligence requirements. In other words, some of the recent developments in international environmental law can be traced all the way back to its roots in basic principles concerning sovereign rights and in the iconic cases that developed these principles, such as the *Island of Palmas* arbitration or the *Corfu Channel* case.\n For an overview on this evolution, see *Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey*, Mapping the Field, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2008), 1.\n See *e.g.* *Daniel Bodansky*, A Tale of Two Architectures: The Once and Future U.N.

We first discuss the application of these concepts in the environmental context, considering how they may contribute to the development of norms for the regulation of harmful activities in cyberspace. We will show that the obligations of harm prevention and due diligence have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. Many cyber security and legal scholars, as well as governments and international organisations, have recognised States’ obligation to exercise due diligence in order to prevent cyber activities that are harmful to other States from occurring in their territories. We then turn to the notions of ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, concepts that are prominent in international environmental law but have been controversial or of limited relevance in the cyber context. We discuss them mainly to highlight the potential and risks of efforts to regulate not only harm caused by States to other States in relation to cyberspace, but also harm caused to cyberspace itself as a common resource. Finally, drawing on the experience with the design of multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies, we offer some observations on institutional models, and highlight some of the potential drawbacks of these models in the cyber context. At this point, in any case, multilateral treaty-based regimes are largely absent in the\n See e.g., Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace, International Law Studies 89 (2013), 123, 138; Jan Messerschmidt, Hackback: Permitting Retaliatory Hacking by Non-State Actors as Proportionate Countermeasures to Transboundary Cyberharm, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 52 (2013), 275; Margulies (note 2), 16, 18, 19; Katharina Ziolkowski, Ius ad bellum in Cyberspace – Some Thoughts on the “Schmitt-Criteria” for Use of Force, in: Christian Czosseck/Rain Ottis/Katharina Ziolkowski (eds.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Proceedings (2012), 306, 307; Joanna Kulesza, International Internet Law, Global Change, Peace &amp; Security 24 (2012), 351; Tallinn Manual (note 2), 26–28; Jason Healey/Hannah Pitts, Applying International Environmental Legal Norms to Cyber Statecraft, I/S: A Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society 8 (2012), 356; Matthew E.

We will suggest that the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a 'commons' is unlikely to be feasible or even desirable. Our goal in this chapter is to explore opportunities and post warning signs for those in the 'virtual' world of cyberspace who seek to learn from the 'real' world of international environmental law.\n## II. The No Harm Rule and Related Principles\nOne of the most straightforward approaches to building international cyberspace law may be to apply the legal principles on harm prevention and due diligence to cyberspace issues. These principles are not only well established, but also anchored in foundational principles of international law that are designed to balance competing sovereign interests. For example, in the *Island of Palmas* case, the Arbitrator held that “[t]erritorial sovereignty [...] has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability.” Similarly, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its decision in the *Corfu Channel* case, found that it is “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”\nInternational environmental law, in the absence of specific rules, adapted these general rules to the environmental setting. The salient principles evolved into the proposition that States' rights to use their territories and resources are limited by the obligation to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control do not cause significant transboundary harm. This 'no harm' rule has since been affirmed and fleshed out through a series of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and other international instruments, as well as several arbitral and judicial decisions. The ICJ confirmed in its advisory opinion on the *Legality of the Threat* or\n *Island of Palmas Case* (note 7), 839.\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 7), 22.\n See e.g., *Trail Smelter Case* (USA, Canada), Arbitral Award of 16 April 1938 and 11 March 1941, RIAA III, 1905, 1965; *Lac Lamnac Arbitration* (France, Spain), Arbitral Award of 16 November 1957,\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nUse of Nuclear Weapons that “the general obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States or of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the environment.” The Court reiterated this conclusion in its decision in the Gabilikovo-Nagymaros case and its decision in the Pulp Mills case. The International Law Commission’s (ILC) Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities too confirmed States’ obligation to “take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.”\nThe key point for our present purposes is that looking to international environmental law ultimately means turning to basic principles, applicable to any harm caused to States’ territories, including cyber-related harm, without the need for ‘norm creation’. We believe that this fact alone is a crucial advantage. In addition, international environmental law offers rich State practice and judicial opinions that provide guidance on the nature of the due diligence obligations that flow from the exercise of sovereign rights. Two recent cases are of particular interest in this respect – the ICJ’s Pulp Mills case and the advisory opinion on Activities in the Area of the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS Chamber). The discussion below focuses on the elements of each decision that flesh out the no harm rule with respect to due diligence, the attendant procedural obligations, and the relationship between harm prevention and precaution.

Harm Prevention and Due Diligence\n1. International Environmental Law and Norm Evolution\nin International Cyberspace Law\nIn the Pulp Mills decision, the ICJ emphasised two important features of the no harm rule. First, it encompasses an obligation to prevent harm. Second, “the principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory.” This obligation to act with due diligence entails “not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators.”\nThe ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion on Activities in the Area, in turn, was concerned with the responsibility of States to take appropriate measures to ensure that private entities operating in the deep seabed do not cause harm in that ‘commons’ area. Perhaps most importantly for present purposes, the Chamber highlighted the contextual nature of the due diligence standard. The Chamber observed that the due diligence standard “may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or technological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity [...] [and] be more severe for the riskier activities.” Due diligence may vary also in light of the capacity of the State concerned, although this point appears to be more controversial. Some leading commentators on international environmental law, citing numerous international instruments that accommodate developing countries’ lesser technological and regulatory capacity, including the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change, compared the flexibility of the due diligence standard to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. However, the ITLOS Chamber made a point of emphasising that different treatment for developed and developing States is warranted only when the underlying international legal obligations provide for it.\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 101.\n Ibid., para. 197.\n ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), para. 117.\n See supra, note 13.\n Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell, International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149.\n ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), paras. 151–163.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nThe general requirement of harm prevention, and its attendant due diligence obligation, has already been recognised as a basis for States' obligations with respect to cyberspace activities. The Ad hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (Advisory Group), established by the Council of Europe, explicitly referred to the use of the no harm principle in the environmental law context, and relied on it to “underline the primary nature of the proposed commitments of a state to prevent, manage and respond to significant transboundary disruption of or interference with the stability, robustness, resilience and openness of the Internet.” Some States have also recognised a general due diligence obligation in cyberspace. The United States (US), for instance, considers cyber security due diligence to be an emerging norm according to which “States should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse,” while recognising that “unique attributes of networked technology require additional work to clarify how these norms apply.” A duty “not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies” was also recognised by China and Russia in 2011. Russia argued for inclusion of a more specific duty to “take all necessary steps to prevent any destructive information action originating from their own territory or using the information infrastructure under their jurisdiction, as well as cooperate to locate the source of computer attacks carried out with the use of their territory, to repel these attacks and to eliminate their consequences” in a proposed international information security convention.\nThe obligation to prevent harm to other States from cyber attacks and other malicious cyber activities conducted in their territories is generally considered to\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 64.\n US International Strategy for Cyberspace (note 9), 10.\n Ibid., 9.\n United Nations General Assembly, Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

These obligations have been distilled from international judicial decisions, such as in the Corfu Channel case, and confirmed by State practice, notably States’ treatment of cyber attacks under their criminal laws, UN and States’ declarations, and the European Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention). Hence, a due diligence duty is seen by some observers as forming part of customary international law also in the cyber context. The duty has also been interpreted as “an obligation to render best efforts, calling for a state to take all ‘reasonable and necessary’ measures in order to prevent a given event, however, without warranting that such an event will not occur.” Some have also argued that an assessment of compliance with this duty would depend on “the conduct of the host-state itself in addressing the potential threat and in attaining a realistic result in light of the factual circumstances.”\nThe Advisory Group considered the due diligence duty to mean, in general terms, that States must “take all appropriate measures at [their] disposal to prevent and minimise foreseeable significant transboundary harm.” The Group further suggested that the obligation could be satisfied by States’ “accession to relevant international law instruments such as the Budapest Convention and participation in their follow up arrangements;” by their participation in “the development and implementation of Internet user education and public awareness programmes; their promotion and facilitation of dialogue with stakeholders as well as other appropriate measures;” and by informing themselves of “factual and legal components that relate to transboundary disruptions or interferences with the\n Matthew J.

Specifically, it noted that “an efficient observance of a due diligence commitment is understood as the implementation of those measures which would be commensurate with the overall capabilities of the country concerned to address the risks,” and that legislative, administrative, or other action necessary to implement a States’ due diligence commitments “should be subject to the capabilities of the state concerned.”\nThe scope of States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations in cyberspace were also considered in the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), a document prepared by an independent international group of experts comprised of practitioners and scholars (Tallinn Manual Group of Experts). While the Manual deals primarily with cyber warfare, it recognises the no harm obligation as a rule of “a general international legal nature” applicable to “the relationship between states, cyber infrastructure, and cyber operations” and extending to “all cyber activities from one State’s territory that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another States’ territory [...] irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State.”\nAgain in keeping with the approach in international environmental law, the Tallinn Manual considers that the no harm prevention and due diligence obligations encompass the requirement that States “use all means at [their] disposal\n Ibid., paras. 71–73.\n Ibid., para. 74.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., para. 77.\n Tallinn Manual (note 2).\n Ibid., 15, 26, 27.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 11\nto require [private entities]” to take remedial action to terminate a harmful activity. The Manual also addresses one important issue that has remained underspecified thus far: the level of harm required to trigger the harm prevention duty. In international environmental law, the *Trail Smelter Case* posited a “serious consequence” standard with respect to transboundary air pollution, although today a “significant harm” standard, intended to exclude *de minimis* harm, is more common. The Tallinn Manual only requires a “negative effect” to result from the cyberspace activity, which need not involve physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals. However, the Manual does not specify what harm *would* be considered as having a sufficiently “negative effect” in this context.\n## 2. Areas of Controversy\nIt appears then that the duty to prevent harm and the due diligence obligation are already informing the cyberspace discourse, thereby eliminating, at least in part, the need to ‘reinvent the wheel’ with regard to the regulation of harmful conduct in cyberspace. However, while the relevance of these principles in the cyberspace context has been widely recognised, their precise nature and scope remain contested, and therefore in need of further development and clarification. In this regard, there appears to be several broad areas of controversy, all related in one way or another to the challenges of attribution and to questions surrounding how heavy a harm prevention burden to place on States in relation to non-State activities. After all, hackers and other cyber actors can draw from a rich menu of options for concealing their identities and evading attribution.\nHence, some have doubted the political as well as practical feasibility of no harm and due diligence obligations of States in the cyberspace context, as opposed to reliance on the stringent requirements of the law of State responsibility for direct attribution of harmful actions to States. A viable due diligence framework, some\n *Ibid.*, 28, para. 9.\n *Healey/Pitts* (note 8), 378.\n ILC Draft Articles Transboundary Harm (note 16), 41–42.\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 5.\n For example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets can be intercepted or spoofed mid-route, making it difficult to trace them back to their source. Alternatively, reliance on “botnets”, robot networks of malware-infected personal computers, allows attackers to remain anonymous by assuming the identity of someone else in order to perform malicious actions. See *Shackelford/Andres* (note 2), 982 and *Mauno Pibelgas*, Back-Tracing and Anonymity in Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 28), 46, 47. We are grateful to *Alex Ognihone* for assisting us with this point.\n *Ziolkowski* (note 8), 307.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nargue, may be difficult to achieve as “it is unclear that any state is prepared (politically or technologically) to take full responsibility for all harm emanating from gateway routers, very small aperture terminals [...] wireless mobile devices, and other devices within its territory or jurisdiction.” Therefore, States may not be willing to agree on criteria for a more expansive regime of indirect responsibility for non-State actors’ cyber activities, based on the ‘no harm’ principle. In short, it may seem sensible and even self-evident that States should enact and enforce criminal laws regarding cross-border cyber attacks, in line with the ICJ’s finding in *Pulp Mills* that diligence requires States to “adopt appropriate rules and measures” and “take all appropriate measures to enforce” them. But it may be exceedingly difficult to define in a concrete and also manageable manner what exactly are “appropriate” standards and efforts to prevent harm from cyber attacks and other hostile acts. And, even if agreed, such a general standard may not suffice. “Because of the speed with which cyber weapons could be deployed,” some observers claim, “relying only upon cyber due diligence presents too great a risk of intrusion by unfriendly actors.” This challenge is further complicated by “the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character,” as well as precisely “the ease with which deception can be mounted through cyber infrastructure,” which may make it impossible for a State to prevent injury to another State.\nSome interpretations of due diligence in cyberspace have attempted to take the unique nature of cyber acts into account. For instance, the Advisory Group has limited the applicability of States’ “due diligence commitments of prevention, management and response” to situations where the State is the actual operator or manager of critical internet resources. Where it is not, the Group suggests that “the principle of subsidiarity or non-involvement of states in the ordinary administration of the network or operational issues” prevails, recognising the fact that “the private sector takes the lead in the day-to-day operations of the\n *Sean Kanuck*, Sovereign Discourse on Cyber Conflict Under International Law, Texas Law Review (Tex.

See also *Kirsch* (note 2), 637–638 (arguing that “placing the responsibility on states for cyber attacks committed within their borders potentially unleashes a Pandora’s box of problems, particularly in determining whether the state initiated adequate control measures over the hackers”).\n *Heintschel von Heinegg* (note 8), 139; *Eric Jensen*, Cyber Warfare and Precautions Against the Effects of Attacks, Tex.

While the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts agreed that the obligations would be triggered if a State had “actual knowledge” of the acts in question, it could not agree on whether they would also obtain if a State had only “constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge,” for instance where a State fails to use due care in policing cyber activities on its territory and is therefore unaware of the acts.59 Some have argued that “a state’s duty to prevent cyber attacks should not be based on a state’s knowledge of a particular cyber attack before it occurs, but rather on its actions to prevent cyber attacks in general,” since such attacks are “extremely difficult for host-states to detect prior to the commission of a specific attack.”60 While this approach would be in line with the general thrust of the harm prevention and due diligence obligations as they have developed in international environmental law, it has been criticised for going too far in reducing the knowledge requirement in the cyber context.61 Others have contended that “presumptive knowledge is sufficient to trigger the duty” if the cyber attack can reasonably be considered to belong to a series of cyber attacks” originating from a State’s territory.62 The position of the Advisory Group in this regard is close to the stance of international environmental law; it is that “the disruption and interference should be foreseeable and the state concerned must know or should have known under the circumstances that the given activity involved a risk of significant consequences.”63\n\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nFinally, and relatedly, there seems to be a lack of consensus regarding the precise scope of the no harm and due diligence obligations in cyberspace. Notably, given the “difficulty of mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats,” the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts could not agree on whether or not these general obligations should be applied to “situations in which the relevant acts are merely prospective” as opposed to those that are already underway. In other words, the Group could not agree on a general precautionary duty of States to undertake all appropriate measures with regard to potential cyber threats at an early stage and before a concrete risk of harm occurs, a concept with roots in international environmental law that we discuss in more detail below. Furthermore, the Group could not reach a consensus on the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations to States through which cyber operations merely transit, in light of the “unique routing processes of cyber transmissions.” By contrast, certain scholars have suggested that “reasonable measures to prevent [...] prospective acts are required” and that even a mere transit State “has an obligation to prevent a cyber attack.” However, there is no consensus on this issue as of yet.\nThese contentious issues, among others, must be resolved in order for the no harm principle to effectively regulate activities in cyberspace. International consensus should be achieved on the general content and limits of the due diligence standard applicable to cyberspace. Agreement is also needed on the relationship between States’ responsibility for failure to take diligent harm prevention measures and their responsibility for non-State acts directly attributable to them under the law of State responsibility. Arguably, both types of responsibility obtain, and each applies to a distinct type of ‘failure’ by a State. But, absent consensus on the issue, developing an effective normative and regulatory framework for cyberspace on the basis of the duty to prevent harm and the law of State responsibility will be difficult. With the caveats noted above, the development of these principles in the environmental context, and particularly the contextual approach adopted by the ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion, may be\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 7.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 169.\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 28, 29, para. 12.\n Pirker (note 29), 208.\n Ibid., 209.\n Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 137, 138.\n Kirsch (note 2), 638; Kanuck (note 48), 1592; Kulesza, State Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks on International Peace and Security (note 8), 151; Gary Brown/Keira Poellet, The Customary International Law of Cyberspace, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 126, 141.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 15\nhelpful in this regard. Applying such an approach in the cyberspace context could allow for a flexible, contextual application of the due diligence standard. One might also envision a contextual interpretation of the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility in accordance with new technological developments and the evolving nature of cyberspace. However, as in the debates surrounding the attribution of non-State actor conduct for the purposes of the law on the use of force, many States and other observers will likely have misgivings about modifying (and thereby potentially eroding) what is meant to be a general framework for specific purposes. The due diligence standard is therefore likely to be the most promising conceptual hook for the necessary fine-tuning; the precise contours of this standard could change over time and in accordance with the gravity of the transboundary cyber harm caused.\n## B. Procedural Obligations\nThe no harm rule entails a series of procedural obligations, including the obligation to notify or warn potentially affected States, the obligation to exchange information, to consult and negotiate, and the general obligation to cooperate to prevent harm. The Pulp Mills case confirms that these procedural obligations, on the one hand, have a separate existence as customary norms (that can be violated on their own terms – even when harm is ultimately not caused), and, on the other hand, are implied in the substantive obligation to prevent environmental harm (e.g. a State may have to notify or consult with another about potential harm in order to meet its obligation of diligent harm prevention).\nIn the cyberspace context, similar cooperative requirements and processes have been emphasised in light of its rapidly changing technological nature, its “global character”, and because protection from cyber threats requires “collaborative relationships for exchanging cyber defense data and an ability to establish trusted relationships.” Accordingly, the duty to cooperate has been considered to be\n ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 7).\n Lac Lamocx Arbitration (note 13).\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 145 (tracing the obligation to cooperate to the good faith principle in international law).\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), paras. 78, 79.\n Rolf Weber, Future Design of Cyberspace Law, Journal of Politics and Law 5 (2012), 1.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 177.\n Diego Vázquez et al., Conceptual Framework for Cyber Defense Information Sharing within Trust Relationships, in: Czosseck/Ottis/Ziolkowski (eds.) (note 8), 2012, 4th International\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nrelevant as a general principle of international law, as well as a legal obligation of States in the arena of cyber security. Reliance on traditional means of international cooperation in areas such as cybercrime, however, has been viewed as incapable of offering the timely response needed. Therefore, new cooperative mechanisms have been developed in this context, such as the 24/7 international assistance network established under the Budapest Convention for investigations and evidence collection concerning cybercrime.\nThis broad duty to cooperate has been recognised as part and parcel of the obligation to prevent harm in the cyberspace context. It includes the obligation to undertake a risk assessment, to exchange information, to inform, notify, and consult other States in concrete cases of risk of significant transboundary harm, and to cooperate “with the victim-states of cyber attacks that originated from within their borders” during investigations and prosecutions. The Advisory Group, for instance, stated as general requirements that “States should co-operate mutually, in good faith and in consultation with each other and with concerned stakeholders at all stages of designing and implementing policies in relation to the Internet,” and “should take all reasonable measures to provide prior and timely notification and relevant information to states that may be potentially affected.” These requirements envision “participation of states within whose jurisdiction disruptions or interferences with the Internet stability, robustness and resilience may originate, and states likely to be affected or actually affected, in action aimed at prevention of, preparedness for and response to risks and threats to critical Internet resources.”\nConference on Cyber Conflict Proceedings (NATO CCD COE Publications 2012), 429.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 75.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 177, 178.\n United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime: Draft (February 2013), xi, available at: http://www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Art. 35; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Internet, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. VI (2012), 227.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 186.\n Ibid., 169; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 376.\n Sklerov (note 29), 62; Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 135.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 18.\n Ibid., 21.\n Ibid., para. 75.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 17\nIn more practical terms, the Advisory Group noted that States should, in particular, “co-operate in the creation of public awareness about the risks and opportunities of cross border Internet traffic and the development of educational tools to enable citizens to share responsibilities for a safer Internet,” as well as take legislative action in order to overcome barriers to international cooperation. Moreover, “states may establish mechanisms that are suitable for monitoring the implementation of their preparedness and prevention commitments in respect of disruptions and interference with the infrastructure of the Internet.” The Advisory Group also set out detailed standards for information exchange and coordinated action, some of which were explicitly ‘borrowed’ from the international environmental context. These include the development of common rules and practices for information sharing, incident reporting, and for deploying internet resilience technologies; timely notification of transboundary risks and vulnerabilities; assessment of possible or actual adverse transboundary effects; coordination of emergency and response policies; and mutual consultations and assistance. Some of these obligations have also been included in the Budapest Convention.\nThe reality remains, however, that some States from which cyber attacks originate refuse to accept responsibility or cooperate with investigations, that a clear framework for effective and timely exchange of information on critical infrastructure protection is lacking, and that outside the realm of cyber crime there has been little international cooperation in reducing the transboundary impact of malicious activities in cyberspace. Since States continue to have “wide discretion as to how to fulfill the legal obligation to cooperate in the cyber realm,” there is a clear need for consensus to be reached on a uniform standard for cooperation. Such consensus, moreover, cannot include only States. In light of the dominant role of the private sector and civil society in internet governance, a multi-stakeholder approach must be applied in the discussion and formulation of\n Ibid., paras. 76, 79.\n Ibid., para. 80.\n Ibid., para. 93.\n Ibid., paras. 91–102.\n Such as mutual assistance, see Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Chapter III.\n Kirsch (note 2), 638.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 91.\n Heaby/Pitts (note 8), at 366.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 178.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nprocedural obligations such as the duty to cooperate. This approach requires public-private collaboration, including internet service provider assistance, as well as data exchanges and partnerships, to form part of any international legal framework or standard for cyberspace cooperation.\n## C. Precaution\nIn the environmental context, at least, due diligence also appears to have become a conceptual bridge between the duty to prevent harm and the proposition that States, in certain circumstances, also must take precautionary measures. As traditionally conceived, the no harm rule is engaged when there is a known or objectively determined risk of significant environmental harm. By contrast, the precautionary principle, as articulated in Principle 15 Rio Declaration, is triggered by ‘threats of serious or irreversible damage’ and its lower evidentiary threshold could strengthen the protective potential of international environmental law. However, debate persists among States and academic commentators as to the precise contents of the principle, and whether or not it has acquired customary law status. International courts and tribunals, while acknowledging the wisdom of precautionary approaches to environmental protection, have avoided pronouncing on its legal status.\nThe ITLOS Chamber, in the *Activities in the Area* advisory opinion, suggested that there was a trend “towards making [the precautionary] approach part of customary international law,” and observed that it “is also an integral part of the general obligation of due diligence.” This obligation requires States “to take all\n---\n Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, *Principles of International Internet Law*, German Law Journal 11 (2010), 1245, 1261, 1262.\n *Eneken Tikk*, *Establishing Rules for Cyber Security*, in: Scott Jasper (ed.), *Conflict and Cooperation in the Global Commons* (2012), 222–224.\n See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 153.\n Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 15.\n See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 154–164.\n See ICJ, *Gablikoro-Nagymaros* (note 15), para. 140; id., *Pulp Mills* (note 15), paras. 164, 185.

As such it would seem to be highly relevant to the cyber context. Indeed, it has been suggested that States are obliged “to take (general) precautionary measures with regard to potential cyber threats posing a significant risk of damage of a transboundary nature.” This obligation has also been said to form part of States’ due diligence obligation in this context, and to include “the duty to undertake all appropriate regulatory measures at an early stage, and well before the (concrete) risk of harm occurs,” although the precise degree of knowledge of such a risk required from States in order to trigger the duty, as already mentioned, remains controversial. Precautionary measures in this context would include “the implementation of strategic, political, organisational, administrative, legal and technical measures [...] aimed at general prevention” of misuse of cyberspace for malicious activities by non-State actors, although what precisely such measures would entail remains to be clarified by “future State practice.” Such State practice can be seen, for instance, in recent domestic legislative initiatives attempting to impose a legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n The ITLOS Chamber may have spelled out what the ICJ merely alluded to in its *Gablōkoon-Nagymarus* and *Pulp Mills* decisions by noting that ‘in the field of environmental protection, vigilance and prevention are required on account of the often irreversible character of damage and of the limitations inherent in the very mechanism of reparation of this type of damage’.

Finally, precautionary principles also form part of the ‘good neighborliness’ principle, which in the environmental law context is said to include “the duty to cooperate in investigating, identifying, and avoiding environmental harm.” This principle has also been applied to cyberspace in the form of an obligation “to take preventive and precautionary measures” with regard to cyber threats, as well as “to inform, notify, and consult in concrete cases of risk of significant transboundary harm.”\nIt is interesting to note the different approaches taken by the Advisory Group and the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts in this regard. A “precautionary approach” was expressly recognised by the Advisory Group, which considered the identification, assessment, and notification of possible or actual risks of adverse transboundary effects on the internet, and the prior and timely notification of such risks, to form part of States’ prevention obligation in cyberspace. The Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, as we have already noted, adopted a more conservative approach and did not encompass prospective acts or acts of which States ‘should have known’ in the obligation to prevent cyber harm to other States. Therefore, while both groups of experts seem to agree on the basic need for States to exercise due diligence in order to prevent transboundary cyber harm, their interpretations of the nature and scope of these obligations diverge.\nOne possible explanation for this divergence is the different nature, purpose, and mandate of each of these groups of experts. The Advisory Group, comprised of European experts in fields such as law, information, and telecommunications, was set up by the Steering Committee on the Media and New Communication Service of the Council of Europe. It was instructed to examine “the shared or mutual responsibilities of states in ensuring that critical Internet resources are managed in the public interest and as a public asset” and “make proposals [...] relating to the prevention and management of events [...] falling within member states’ jurisdictions or territories, which could block or significantly impede Internet access [...] with the objective of guaranteeing the ongoing functioning and universal nature and integrity of the Internet.” The mandate of the Advisory\n Robin Geiß/Henning Lehmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

In so doing, it focused on States’ due diligence and procedural obligations while excluding such controversial issues as State responsibility, cyber warfare, and countermeasures.\nThe Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, on the other hand, was comprised of both European and non-European legal and technical experts (but all from Western States), many of whom with experience or expertise related to armed conflict, national defence, or security policy. It was set up by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, an international military organisation, and tasked with producing “a manual on the law governing cyber warfare.” Accordingly, the Manual explicitly excluded any detailed discussion of cyber activities “that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.” While it addressed the application of general international legal rules to cyberspace in times of peace, including States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations, the focus of the Manual was on cyber warfare and the application of international laws of armed conflict to it. Having to decide on such controversial issues, which were avoided by the Advisory Group, as well as the background of some of the experts in the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, may have influenced the tone of the Manual and its perspective, resulting in a more conservative and narrow stance with respect to States’ obligations in cyberspace. As one commentator noted, “the Experts were very cautious to avoid taking any risks when drafting the rules” and, since unanimity was required to formulate the rules, “the most controversial international law aspects of cyber operations were therefore left unresolved.”\nThe different approaches taken by the Advisory Group and the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts reflect some of the underlying disagreements and confusion that\n The Advisory Group explicitly drew a distinction between States’ commitments to prevent and manage cross-border disruptions of or interferences with the internet and international law rules governing responsibility for internationally wrongful acts, Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 20, para. 85.\n See “the international group of experts and participants” in the Tallinn Manual (note 2), x–xiii.\n Although the Tallinn Manual does not represent the views of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, its sponsoring nations, or NATO, Tallinn Manual (note 2), 11.\n Ibid., (note 2), at 1.\n Ibid., 4.\n It has been suggested, for instance, that there may be an overtly close connection between the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts and the military and a potential resulting bias in the substance of the Manual, Pirkor (note 29), 190.\n Marco Rossini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (2014), 31.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\npersist in the cyberspace context with regard to States' harm prevention and due diligence obligations, what precisely these obligations entail, and when they apply. Some doctrine emanating from the US, as well as European politicians and international law scholars, view cyberspace as \"the fifth battlefield\" and therefore, like the Tallinn Manual, emphasise States' obligations in terms of use of force, self-defence, and countermeasures, rather than in terms of harm prevention and due diligence. An opposite view is that said to be represented by the Advisory Group, which \"holds that states are obliged to observe due diligence in preventing cyber attacks and they may only be held responsible for a cyber attack if it can be demonstrated that they have failed to meet the due diligence standard.\"\n## III. Cyberspace as a Global Commons or a Shared Resource?\nIn the environmental context, it is accepted that States have an obligation to prevent harm to the territory of another State, or to areas beyond national control – global commons. However, the full legal ramifications of this ‘commons’ aspect of the harm prevention obligation are far from settled. Notably, there is no direct State practice on the question of who can invoke a State’s responsibility for harm to the commons. When it comes to applying the rules concerning harm to the commons to cyberspace, a prior question looms large: Is cyberspace a ‘commons’ in the first place? Alternatively, might it be a ‘shared resource’ of States?\nSome have identified the cyber domain as a global commons, together with the high seas, air, and space, and view these as “domains that are not controlled by any single state” but are rather “universally needed and thus should be shared.” The Advisory Group, for instance, regarded “critical Internet resources” as global commons “under the stewardship of the international Internet community as a whole.” The US and Japan have also regarded cyberspace as a global commons;\n Kulesza, International Internet Law (note 8), 359–360.\n See Stockholm Declaration (note 13), Principle 21; Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 2. And see ICJ, Legality of Nuclear Weapons (note 14), para. 29; id., Gabilikovo-Nagymaros (note 15), para. 53; and id., Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 101.\n Jutta Brunnée, Common Areas, Common Heritage, Common Concern, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.)

From a definitional, or practical, perspective, the cyber domain is distinguishable from the other global commons on account of being a human creation and involving both physical infrastructure located in national territories and intangible features that transcend territorial borders. Furthermore, unlike the sea, Antarctica, and outer space, “there is a ‘population’ or community in cyberspace and [...] [it] is not an entirely independent international space or concern that is beyond national regulation.” According to some observers, in order for cyberspace to become a global commons, “long-established rights of sovereignty and property ownership recognized by the numerous domestic jurisdictions involved” in cyberspace would have to be overridden and legitimate and illegitimate users would have to be positively identified for the enforcement of norms or collective solutions. Neither of these conditions is currently satisfied in the cyberspace context.\nFrom a conceptual perspective, the identification of cyberspace as a global commons has thus far failed to clarify States’ obligations. The Advisory Group, for instance, emphasised the need for harm to be caused to another State, rather than to cyberspace as a resource, in order to trigger States’ obligations, notwithstanding its explicit reference to the internet as a global commons. Moreover, the global commons concept does not necessarily make cyberspace any easier to regulate. It has been argued, for instance, that while in the context of other global commons, users have “successfully self-organized for sustainable use of a commons” in the absence of government control, in the case of cyberspace the “affordances of the cyber technologies — that is, the way the technologies enable their use — and the mentalities of the users” have resulted in a “tragedy of the commons” that prevents effective self-organisation for sustainable use of\n United States Department of Defense, The Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support (2005), 12, available at: https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=454976 (accessed on 23 October 2015); Ziolkowski (note 29), 183.\n Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 22–23.\n Kam Wai Chik, ‘Customary internet-ional law’: Creating a body of customary law for cyberspace, Part 1: Developing rules for transitioning custom into law, Computer Law &amp; Security Review 26 (2010), 3, 13.\n Kanuck (note 48), 1577, 1579.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 69.\n Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 23.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ncyberspace. The concept of cyberspace as a commons, therefore, does not seem to have contributed much to the development of clear norms to regulate its use, and may even hinder this process.\nSome academic observers have warned against what they view as a gradual move away from the perception of cyberspace as a global commons and toward a State-based governance regime, considering it to constitute “norm regression” in the global governance of cyberspace. But however intuitive it may seem to think of cyberspace as a type of commons, the idea remains controversial and in any event would not necessarily advance the effort to develop norms for the regulation of cyberspace, such as the duty to prevent harm. Even in the environmental context, the legal status of spaces or resources beyond the exclusive jurisdiction of States tends to be controversial. Aside from well-established examples of geographic areas like the high seas, Antarctica, or outer space, States have avoided the ‘commons’ label, precisely because it implies both the absence of sovereignty and certain collective rights and obligations.\nOne might alternatively consider the potential relevance of the notion of ‘shared resource’. This concept certainly fits key aspects of cyberspace, perhaps better than the notion of a ‘commons’, because it applies to resources that are under the jurisdiction of States but are quintessentially transboundary in nature. This paradigm permits States that share such a resource to devise norms and rules that take into account their respective sovereign interests, their mutual interests in the use and protection of the resource, and their obligations under international law. In the environmental context, States have often avoided using this umbrella concept, arguably because of the implication of less than full sovereignty and the broader implications the concept might have for other resources, and have used more issue-specific concepts, like ‘international watercourse’.\n Roger Hurwitz, Depleted Trust in the Cyber Commons, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 20, 21; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 366.\n But see Scott Shackelford, Toward Cyberpeace: Managing Cyberattacks Through Polycentric Governance, American University Law Review 62 (2013), 1273, 1293 (suggesting that cyberspace be treated as ‘pseudocommons’, “comprised of a shared global infrastructure that is controlled by public and private entities subject to national and international regulations”).\n Ronald Deibert/Masashi Crets-Nishibata, Global Governance and the Spread of Cyberspace Controls, Global Governance 18 (2012), 341, 343, 345; Joanna Kuleczy/Roy Balleste, Signs and Portents in Cyberspace: The Rise of Jus Internet as a New Order in International Law, Fordham Intellectual Property, Media and Entertainment Law Journal 23 (2013), 1320.\n Brunnie, Common Areas, Common Heritage, Common Concern (note 132).\n See Jutta Brunnie/Stephen Toupe, Environmental Security and Freshwater Resources: Ecosystem Regime Building, American Journal of International Law 91 (1997), 26; Kanuck (note 48), 1580.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 25\nNonetheless, this conception could be helpful in relation to cyberspace since it would allow States to maintain certain sovereign rights, although these would not be absolute and would be balanced against the interests of other States and the international community. While the concept of ‘shared resource’ is not a panacea for the difficulties already discussed with respect to defining and applying the no harm and due diligence obligations to cyberspace, it has been suggested that such a tailored model may present an alternative avenue for establishing States’ legal obligation to cooperate in this context through such principles as the sustainable and equitable use of shared resources. These principles may encourage States to undertake all necessary means in order to preserve the internet for future generations, which implies a proactive countering of cyber threats, an obligation to take precautionary measures, and restraint from any action that could hamper the availability and reliability of the internet. In short, a ‘shared resource’ model could promote stewardship in cyberspace, rather than sovereignty. While it may not resolve fundamental definitional issues, such a model could provide an alternative conceptual framework that shifts the focus from States’ obligations to each other to States’ obligations to cyberspace as a shared resource, thereby facilitating the development of norms and rules for its governance.\n## IV. Institutional Frameworks\nIt has been said that “there are structural similarities between the milieus of international law and of the Internet: neither is completely hierarchical and both must deal with ‘commons’ problems.” Whether the future cyberspace governance regime will be grounded in the no harm and due diligence framework or in a ‘commons’ framework that may evolve over time, an additional question concerns the appropriate process for developing and maintaining the attendant normative and regulatory framework. International environmental law offers some models for governance regimes, and we thus turn to an examination of its normative and regulatory structures.\n Ibid., 1580.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 179–181.\n See Duncan Hollis, Stewardship versus Sovereignty?

International Environmental Governance\nIn the environmental context, so-called framework agreements have played a prominent role. They help in dealing with complex, evolving issues by allowing parties to begin by defining the common concern at hand, agreeing on principles to guide States’ actions, and establishing institutions and decision-making procedures for subsequent regime-development.^[150]^\nMany environmental regimes create, or collaborate with, bodies that facilitate exchange among scientific or technical experts. Such bodies are important in building consensus around the nature of collective concerns and the collective action that is required to address them. Scientific or technical expert bodies also make important contributions in the further elaboration, refinement, or adjustment of regulatory strategies.^[151]^ In the cyber context one could easily see the usefulness of such an approach, for example in relation to the constantly shifting needs of cyber security and the related due diligence standards. Environmental regime development *per se* is usually in the hands of a plenary body, which facilitates regular, long-term engagements between technical experts, policy-makers, lawyers, and relevant non-State actors (international organisations, non-governmental organisations, or business entities).^[152]^ Although, in a formal sense, law-making remains in the hands of States, non-State actors can provide input into law-making processes or even help shape their outcomes.^[153]^\nEnvironmental standard-setting itself occurs through decisions of plenary bodies, without subsequent formal consent by individual States. In most cases, the resulting standards are not legally binding, notwithstanding the mandatory language they may contain.^[154]^ This approach facilitates agreement on collective action and standards that are applicable to all parties – an important feature for efforts to address collective concerns. Equally important is that soft regulatory processes enable speedier regime development and adjustment than processes that require subsequent ratification by individual States. In the cyber context both of these features could be significant, since (as in the environmental context) cyber\n^[150]^ See *Jutta Brunnée*, Toward Effective International Environmental Law – Trends and Developments, in: Steven Kennett (ed.), Law and Process in Environmental Management (1993), 222–229.\n^[151]^ For a detailed discussion, see *ead*, Coping with Consent: Lawmaking under Multilateral Environmental Agreements, Leiden Journal of International Law 15 (2002), 1.\n^[152]^ *Ibid.*, 15, 16.\n^[153]^ *Ibid.*, 14.\n^[154]^ *Ibid.*, 25, 26.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 27\nproblems, or relevant technical understanding or capacity, as well as political dynamics, typically evolve over time, often rapidly.\nWith respect to treaty making, the experience with MEAs shows that even an apparently straightforward matter as agreeing on the nature and scope of the underlying concern and the principles that should govern it may be fraught with difficulties. In the climate context, for example, it took more than twenty years for parties to agree on the precise meaning of the regime objective – to forestall dangerous climate change – and parties are still struggling to achieve consensus on the parameters of one of the regime’s core principles, the notion of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities’. On the latter concept, the positions of developed and developing countries have diverged quite dramatically, with some developing countries continuing to insist that developed countries shoulder the primary burdens of addressing climate change. To be sure, the claims of ‘historical responsibility’ that developing countries have leveled against developed countries in relation to global carbon emissions will have no comparable basis in the cyber context. Still, a global regime-building effort in the cyber context, could also invite arguments by developing countries that States’ common responsibilities should be differentiated so as to lessen their burden or entitle them to technical or financial assistance. It seems sensible, even inevitable; to assist less developed countries in addressing the underlying common concern. In fact, most MEAs today do provide for various kinds of assistance, including through multilateral funds designed to finance conversion to new technologies or otherwise address capacity limitations. But it is highly unlikely that major States, such as the US, will be any more inclined to accept formal differentiation or assistance obligations in the cyber context than they have been in the climate context (which is not to say ‘no assistance’). Finally, experience with MEAs, especially the climate regime, also shows the potential pitfalls of treaty-based standard-setting. The need for agreement by a significant majority of parties (typically 3/4) and the common practice of consensus decision-making can easily stall progress or result\n See Jutta Brunnée/Stephen Toupe, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (2010), Chapter 4.\n See Jutta Brunnée/Charlotte Streck, The UNFCCC as a Negotiating Forum: Towards Common but more Differentiated Responsibilities, Climate Policy 13 (2013), 589.\n For an overview, see Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, Technical and Financial Assistance, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.) (note 5), 947.\n It is precisely this dimension of the principle that prompted the United States to declare that Principle 7 Rio Declaration (one prominent articulation of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’) did not ‘imply a recognition or acceptance by the United States of any international obligations or liabilities, or any diminution of the responsibilities of developing countries under international law’, see UN Report of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg, South Africa, 26 August – 4 September 2002, UN Doc. A/CONF.199/20 (2002), 145.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nin lowest-common-denominator standard-setting, a concern that has been raised also in the cyber context and will be further discussed below.\n## B. International Cyberspace Governance\nAs with the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations, standard-setting bodies and multilateral agreements for cyberspace governance already exist or are being created. Their precise scope, authority, and norm-developing processes, however, remain unclear and may therefore benefit from considering the environmental governance experience.\nThere are many intergovernmental organisations, both specialised and general, that address different aspects of cyberspace regulation, however their ability to constitute, or form the foundation for, a universal normative or regulatory regime for cyberspace is doubtful. In terms of technical standard-setting, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a UN specialised agency, has been active “with regard to International Public Policy Issues Pertaining to the Internet and the Management of Internet Resources, including Domain Names and Addresses.” However, it has been criticised for being unable to adjust to the rapid changes in the cyberspace environment, being potentially unrepresentative of the views of all of its members, and being ill-equipped to regulate other, non-technical, areas of cyberspace such as international and criminal law. Similarly, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regards “[p]reserving and enhancing the operational stability, reliability, security, and global interoperability of the Internet” as one of its core objectives, and makes binding decisions and policies on various, mostly technical, internet-related issues. However, its powers continue to be largely derived from, and dependant on, the US government; it has therefore been criticised for essentially being a State actor rather than an “international organization with a fully democratic legitimation.”\n---\n See discussion in *Brunnée/Tonpe*, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law (note 155).\n *Sabine von Schorlemer*, Telecommunications, International Regulation, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International LawMPEPIL, Vol. IX (2012), 818 et seq.\n *Ibid.*\n *David Gross et al.*, Cyber Security Governance: Existing Structures, International Approaches and the Private Sector, in: Lord/Sharp (eds.) (note 162), 114, 116.\n *Woltag* (note 81).\n *Ibid.*\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 29\nThese essentially technical bodies, moreover, lack any formal law-making ability. Nonetheless, they have become increasingly politicised, and “distrust by some nations may prevent them from making and enforcing any unilateral policy determinations going forward.” As for more general intergovernmental and regional organisations active in the cyberspace arena, such as the European Union (EU), Council of Europe, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, NATO, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and others, their activities with respect to cyberspace norm-development include issuing reports, organising conferences and summits, devising and promoting policies and conventions, and establishing working groups. However, the respective responsibilities of these organisations, as well as their standard-setting authority, remain unclear; there is often little cooperation among them; and their efforts have been conflicting at times.\nThe limited utility of these bodies for cyberspace norm-creation arguably stems from the lack of international consensus on their precise role in cyberspace governance and the appropriate institutional character of any future regulatory regime. At the 2003 and 2005 World Summits on the Information Society (WSIS I and II), for instance, some developed countries, led by the US, adopted a ‘non-governmental’ approach and regarded the private sector influence and in particular the mandate of ICANN as sufficient for regulatory purposes. A majority of developing countries, including China, however, called for a ‘government-centered’ approach involving intergovernmental management of the internet, for example by the ITU. It was ultimately decided to maintain the existing governance system, while establishing a new Internet Governance Forum (IGF) within the UN for\n As well as others, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the Internet Society (ISOC), the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n Deibert/Crete-Nishibata (note 141), 346, 347; Gross et al.

The EU and the US continue to object to ITU governance of the internet, despite growing calls for “an equal role and responsibility for international Internet governance” for all governments, and the IGF remains merely a forum for discussion, without any powers of supervision or decision-making. As a result, there is still no effective institutional authority that is universally accepted. Ultimately, it has been said that any intergovernmental institution or regime established to regulate and govern cyberspace must have sufficient expertise and technical capability for norm-creation, be perceived as having sufficient legitimacy by the international community, and be able to generate “both high level and specific behavioral norms that are widely accepted as legitimate.”\nA possible alternative to an intergovernmental or non-governmental regulatory institution is a treaty-based regime resembling the one established with respect to climate change. The development of such a regime was attempted, for instance, with respect to the regulation of cyber crime through the creation of the Budapest Convention. However, the Convention has only been ratified by 47 States thus far, and is unlikely to be universally adopted since many nations view it as a ‘European’ document. Multilateral treaties to regulate certain aspects of cyberspace, including cyber security, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, have also been suggested by scholars, as well as States such as Russia.

It is not clear as of yet whether this apparent shift, notably in the UN climate change regime, reflects significant and lasting structural change in international environmental treaty making from ‘top-down’ to ‘bottom-up’ approaches.[181] At any rate, in the cyberspace context, treaty-based standard-setting and norm-creation already has been criticised for being too ‘top-down’ for the needs of the medium and, as in the environmental context, as likely to suffer from the “lowest common denominator effect.”[182] Also, creating a multilateral treaty on cyberspace regulation is bound to be a protracted process, and some observers suggest that “an adequate legal framework is only realisable if the foundation is done on an informal law-making basis.”[183] Such informal law-making efforts have in fact been attempted, for instance by China, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, who in 2011 submitted to the UN a proposal for an international code of conduct for information security.[184] While this initiative has since been discussed in various international forums,[185] its viability is doubtful in light of objections by the US and\n\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nmost Western countries to its State-centric model for internet governance. It seems, therefore, that before any international regulatory regime can be devised, a conceptual framework for cyberspace governance must be agreed upon, on the basis of which such a regime could function.\nIt is possible that such a framework could be created around the protection of cyberspace itself, for instance by adopting the notion of a ‘commons’ or ‘shared resource’ regime as discussed above, or in the form of a multilateral treaty regime for the prevention of transboundary impacts, such as that established under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention). The LRTAP Convention, one of the earliest MEAs, has been successful in facilitating preventive regulation and integrated policy-making based on scientific assessments and economic modeling. As one commentator has noted, “experience with multilateral environmental treaties has shown that investigation and monitoring can be important tools underlying a dynamic regulatory framework that can adapt to changes in levels of risk identified.” In the case of the LRTAP Convention, this ‘science-policy interaction’ has been successful in achieving emission reductions of air pollutants in light of such factors as: the direct link between relevant science and policy preparation; multiple scenarios that present policy options; accessibility of science to all participants; a framework offered for countries to provide their own data; the consensus based way of working; and the ability to adapt scientific and policy frameworks to developments in science and policy. Devising a treaty regime along the lines of the LRTAP Convention model may be particularly useful in the cyberspace context, which is similarly dynamic and scientific/technical in nature.\nHowever, it seems fair to say that the development of such a conceptual framework or treaty regime is unlikely to be successful at this point in time. This type of norm-building effort would have to overcome several obstacles, quite apart from State security interests. These range from States’ general reluctance to declare\nhttp://www.unidir.org/files/files/TH_Madrid_21Mar14.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n UNIDIR High-Level Seminar (note 185), 3; Roger Hurwitz, A New Normal?

As already mentioned, such reluctance is evident in the disagreements concerning the allocation of a greater governance role to the ITU. Liberal democracies are concerned that the intergovernmental model of internet governance would be “fragmented, slow and not interoperable” and facilitate censorship in authoritarian States. In turn, developing States that are not able to deal with cyber threats tend to blame the flaws in internet security on the ICANN-led governance structure and seek a new, government-controlled model. During the 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications, 89 governments, including many developing States, supported an enhanced role for the ITU over internet regulation and approved revisions to the International Telecommunication Regulations intended to transfer authority for regulating critical aspects of the internet from ICANN to the ITU. 54 countries, including the US, the EU, and most other developed countries, however, advocated for the existing model of internet oversight by multi-stakeholder, non-governmental institutions, and refused to sign the revised text of the Regulations. While some observers considered the outcome of the Conference to signal a “digital Cold War,” the long term implications of these partially adopted revisions have yet to emerge.\nMoreover, any conceptual and/or regulatory framework for cyberspace governance would have to include non-State actors, particularly the private sector, in law-making or norm-development processes, as has been explicitly recognised. The 2005 WSIS II Tunis Agenda, for instance, stated that the “international\n Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar, Cyber Diplomacy: Agenda, Challenges and Mission, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

This sentiment was echoed by the Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet, which strongly emphasised the need for multi-stakeholder participation. Most recently, in April 2014, the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial) brought together representatives from civil society, the private sector, academia, and the technical community, supported by several governmental representatives, to “establish strategic guidelines related to the use and development of the Internet in the world.” The Meeting resulted in the Multistakeholder Statement, a non-binding document that set out “Internet Governance Process Principles” emphasising inclusiveness, collaboration, meaningful participation, and consensus driven governance. Nonetheless, it has been argued that “some nations and [intergovernmental organisations] still must embrace further the value of collaboration beyond merely with state actors,” suggesting that there is room for improvement with the involvement of non-State actors in policy-making and norm-development processes relating to cyberspace.\nIn addition, as in the international environmental context, cyberspace governance must also address tensions between the developed and developing worlds, which are reflected in disagreements over cyber governance issues such as the role of the ITU and further complicate efforts to establish a global normative/regulatory regime. The need to bridge the ‘digital divide’, the “social and spatial inequalities in internet access” between developed and developing countries, has long been recognised. For instance, the primary objectives of the WSIS I and II conferences were “to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society” and to “pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society.” Similarly, the recent NETmundial statement emphasised that “Internet governance institutions\n Tunis Agenda (note 169), para. 29; Woltag (note 81).\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), paras. 58, 59.\n Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial), NETmundial: The beginning of a process, available at: http://netmundial.br/about/ (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n NETmundial, NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement, 24 April 2014, available at: http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n Gross et al.

However, while the risk of the internet “reinforce[ing] or even deepen[ing] existing divisions between the haves and have-nots, between the developed and developing worlds” has been acknowledged, no mechanism for the even distribution of the “benefits of the information technology revolution” has thus far been created, with the exception of a voluntary “Digital Solidarity Fund” established pursuant to the WSIS. Therefore, for any truly global regulatory regime of cyberspace to succeed, the interests and capabilities of developing countries must be taken into account both in its development process and in its content. Here, too, lessons may be learned from the environmental context, including concerning the challenges involved.\nIn sum, the need for multi-stakeholder involvement and global representation in the development of norms and regulatory mechanisms to govern cyberspace seems to be widely recognised. Less formal frameworks based on ‘soft law’, rather than intergovernmental agreements or institutions, may be more conducive to the development of such norms and mechanisms. Still, the involvement and cooperation of States seems equally important in light of the fact that they retain control over cyberspace infrastructure and the enforcement of cyberspace regulation, and that some form of State responsibility for harmful cyberspace activities emanating from their territories is required. Ultimately, therefore, an effective regulatory framework for cyberspace may require a “multi-layered structure” that combines informal norm-developing networks, institutions for multi-stakeholder consultation, technical standard-setting bodies, and treaties for intergovernmental cooperation and regulation. As has been suggested elsewhere, “the legal framework [for cyberspace] is to be based on networks established by the concerned communities and linked together through interconnection mechanisms.” Such an interconnected system is necessary in order for international consensus to be achieved on the controversial elements of cyberspace governance discussed in this chapter, including the legal nature and conception of\n NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement (note 202).\n Warf (note 204), 21.\n Antonio Segura-Serrano, Internet Regulation and the Role of International Law, Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law 10 (2006), 191, 259, available at: www.mpii.de/files/pdf3/06_antonov1.pdf (accessed on 21 October 2010).\n See supra, notes 153–160 and accompanying text.\n Weber (note 75), 7.\n Ibid., 4.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ncyberspace and the content and limits of States' obligations in relation to peacetime cyberspace activities.\n## V. Conclusion\nAnd so we return to the no harm rule. Our conclusion is that, at least in the short run, the most promising foundation for international cyberspace law is the harm prevention/due diligence framework that has already gained considerable traction in this context. One of this framework's main advantages is precisely that it does not require wholesale norm-creation or big normative battles, as would be required in an effort to develop norms for the governance of cyberspace itself as a 'shared' or 'commons' resource. The basic norms already exist and apply to activities and harms that involve cyberspace just as to any other activity that occurs under the jurisdiction of States.\nIn this regard, the evolution of international environmental law is instructive, especially in relation to the efforts to flesh out the concepts of harm prevention and due diligence. The Interim Report of the Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet is an excellent illustration of how the same could be accomplished in the cyber context. It articulates adaptations of the general principles of prevention, diligence, procedural obligations, and precaution, including to a multi-stakeholder context, and highlights the need for the development of common standards and best practices. Such standards need not be developed in legally binding form or in a multilateral treaty to be influential, or to flesh out the binding prevention and diligence obligations that exist at custom. As we have shown, although international agreements have played a crucial role in global environmental protection, we appear to be witnessing a certain return to basic principles in the regulation of transboundary environmental harm. The harm prevention/due diligence framework may offer the most suitable approach also in the cyber context, where the potential benefits of a treaty-based approach arguably are outweighed by the drawbacks. The development of cyberspace norms can rather take place through relatively informal legal means in an interconnected, multi-stakeholder system that incorporates States and non-State actors, thereby bypassing lumbering and often stalled treaty-based processes.\nNonetheless, the development of such norms requires some degree of international consensus on the nature of cyberspace governance, the content of basic principles, and the degree and type of regulation required. Unlike the liberal approach adopted by the Advisory Group, it seems that the Tallinn Manual Group\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 37\nof Experts took a more conservative stance and could not agree on certain issues, notably the question whether there is a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent any cyber activity with a ‘negative effect,’ or just a duty not to knowingly allow harmful acts that are underway to continue. As we have suggested, the different nature, focus, and purpose of these two groups of experts may account for their divergent approaches to States’ obligations in this context. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that some of the Tallinn Manual’s experts have now turned their attention to the application of international law principles, such as the use of countermeasures, to cyberspace activities in peacetime, noting that “few, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold.” It will be interesting to see, therefore, if and how the original positions taken in the Tallinn Manual shift in this new context.\nNotwithstanding the usefulness of analogies with international environmental law, cyberspace really is a different kind of space, perhaps leaving for international law only the relatively limited task of holding States to appropriate standards of diligence. Although consensus has yet to be achieved on the content and limits of these norms as they apply to this unique, virtual ‘ecosystem’, we believe that it is worth teaching an old law new tricks!\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, 28, paras. 7, 11.\n Schmitt, Cyber Operations (note 2), 1.\nTSpace Research Repository\ntspace.library.utoronto.ca\nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO\nLIBRARIES",

We begin by exploring opportunities for borrowing well-established rules of harm prevention and due diligence from the more advanced, but not dissimilar, field of international environmental law. We argue that these rules can provide a legal foundation for the emerging field of international cyber law, and have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. We then draw on the experience of international environmental law with conceptual notions such as ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, as well as with institutional models such as multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies. We highlight the risks and drawbacks of the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a commons in the ‘virtual’ world of cyberspace.\nKEYWORDS: International Environmental Law, Non-State Actors, State Responsibility, Transboundary Harm Prevention, Due Diligence, Global Commons, Shared Resources, Institutional Framework\nI.

But the legal toolkit of the law on the use of force is not appropriate for dealing with the vast majority of ‘cyber attacks’ and, in any case, is not applicable. Many State-controlled cyber attacks remain below the thresholds of the use of force framework, engaging instead the basic rules requiring that States not cause harm to other States or to areas beyond State jurisdiction. Others may amount not to a ‘use of force,’ but to illegal intervention. The legal consequences, as a result, will be governed by the law of State responsibility, not the law on the use of force. The same applies, arguably, in situations in which a cyber attack might be likened to a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter), but not an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 UN Charter. Furthermore, and quite apart from the question whether actions fall within the ambit of the rules on the use of force or another set of rules, many cyber acts are not undertaken by States or their agents, such that States would be directly responsible for them. Rather, a large proportion of such actions are undertaken by non-State actors, who operate within the territories or otherwise under the jurisdiction of various States. It is the legal regime for this wide array of ‘peacetime’ cyber operations that we consider in this chapter, focusing in particular on the primary obligations of States in relation to non-State actions occurring under their jurisdiction.\nIn exploring this terrain, we draw on the evolution and legal building blocks of international environmental law, which we believe holds a number of important lessons for the emerging field of international cyberspace law. International environmental law evolved in a way that is not dissimilar to what is now occurring in relation to cyberspace. When the first environmental problems arose, there existed no specific rules on environmental impacts in international law. Recourse had to be had to the general rules that govern the rights and obligations attached to\n See e.g., Peter Margulies, Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility, Melbourne Journal of International Law 14 (2013), 1; Michael N.

But dealing with international environmental problems often requires cooperation and finely calibrated response measures that can address complex problems and adapt as the problems or human understanding of them and technical capacity to solve them evolve. International environmental law and the emerging field of international cyberspace law are similar also in some important structural respects. Notably, one of the distinctive features of international environmental law is that it must almost always deal with impacts that are generated by private actors. Furthermore, like the potential consequences of cyber activities, environmental consequences of actions in one State are often felt in another State’s territory or in areas beyond State jurisdiction – the ‘commons’.\nHowever, if one were to undertake an assessment of the state of international environmental law in 2014, one might conclude that, at least in some respects, it is coming full circle. In the 1980s and 1990s, the field experienced rapid growth through the emergence of specialised rules and principles, and the subsequent proliferation and progressive expansion of more and more elaborate treaty regimes and treaty-based standard-setting processes relating to a wide array of regional and global issues. Today, new environmental agreements have become a rarity and even the further development of existing regimes through treaty-based international environmental law-making seems to have slowed. Indeed, in the case of the perhaps most complex international environmental challenge – climate change – international environmental law appears to be undergoing a fundamental shift from ‘top-down’ standard-setting to a more flexible, ‘bottom-up’ approach. Whether by coincidence or in response to these patterns, the foundational principles of international environmental law have seen something of a renaissance. In the last few years, States have invoked basic rules concerning transboundary impacts and have turned to international courts and tribunals for clarification of the attendant procedural obligations and due diligence requirements. In other words, some of the recent developments in international environmental law can be traced all the way back to its roots in basic principles concerning sovereign rights and in the iconic cases that developed these principles, such as the *Island of Palmas* arbitration or the *Corfu Channel* case.\n For an overview on this evolution, see *Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey*, Mapping the Field, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2008), 1.\n See *e.g.* *Daniel Bodansky*, A Tale of Two Architectures: The Once and Future U.N.

We first discuss the application of these concepts in the environmental context, considering how they may contribute to the development of norms for the regulation of harmful activities in cyberspace. We will show that the obligations of harm prevention and due diligence have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. Many cyber security and legal scholars, as well as governments and international organisations, have recognised States’ obligation to exercise due diligence in order to prevent cyber activities that are harmful to other States from occurring in their territories. We then turn to the notions of ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, concepts that are prominent in international environmental law but have been controversial or of limited relevance in the cyber context. We discuss them mainly to highlight the potential and risks of efforts to regulate not only harm caused by States to other States in relation to cyberspace, but also harm caused to cyberspace itself as a common resource. Finally, drawing on the experience with the design of multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies, we offer some observations on institutional models, and highlight some of the potential drawbacks of these models in the cyber context. At this point, in any case, multilateral treaty-based regimes are largely absent in the\n See e.g., Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace, International Law Studies 89 (2013), 123, 138; Jan Messerschmidt, Hackback: Permitting Retaliatory Hacking by Non-State Actors as Proportionate Countermeasures to Transboundary Cyberharm, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 52 (2013), 275; Margulies (note 2), 16, 18, 19; Katharina Ziolkowski, Ius ad bellum in Cyberspace – Some Thoughts on the “Schmitt-Criteria” for Use of Force, in: Christian Czosseck/Rain Ottis/Katharina Ziolkowski (eds.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Proceedings (2012), 306, 307; Joanna Kulesza, International Internet Law, Global Change, Peace &amp; Security 24 (2012), 351; Tallinn Manual (note 2), 26–28; Jason Healey/Hannah Pitts, Applying International Environmental Legal Norms to Cyber Statecraft, I/S: A Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society 8 (2012), 356; Matthew E.

We will suggest that the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a 'commons' is unlikely to be feasible or even desirable. Our goal in this chapter is to explore opportunities and post warning signs for those in the 'virtual' world of cyberspace who seek to learn from the 'real' world of international environmental law.\n## II. The No Harm Rule and Related Principles\nOne of the most straightforward approaches to building international cyberspace law may be to apply the legal principles on harm prevention and due diligence to cyberspace issues. These principles are not only well established, but also anchored in foundational principles of international law that are designed to balance competing sovereign interests. For example, in the *Island of Palmas* case, the Arbitrator held that “[t]erritorial sovereignty [...] has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability.” Similarly, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its decision in the *Corfu Channel* case, found that it is “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”\nInternational environmental law, in the absence of specific rules, adapted these general rules to the environmental setting. The salient principles evolved into the proposition that States' rights to use their territories and resources are limited by the obligation to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control do not cause significant transboundary harm. This 'no harm' rule has since been affirmed and fleshed out through a series of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and other international instruments, as well as several arbitral and judicial decisions. The ICJ confirmed in its advisory opinion on the *Legality of the Threat* or\n *Island of Palmas Case* (note 7), 839.\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 7), 22.\n See e.g., *Trail Smelter Case* (USA, Canada), Arbitral Award of 16 April 1938 and 11 March 1941, RIAA III, 1905, 1965; *Lac Lamnac Arbitration* (France, Spain), Arbitral Award of 16 November 1957,\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nUse of Nuclear Weapons that “the general obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States or of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the environment.” The Court reiterated this conclusion in its decision in the Gabilikovo-Nagymaros case and its decision in the Pulp Mills case. The International Law Commission’s (ILC) Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities too confirmed States’ obligation to “take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.”\nThe key point for our present purposes is that looking to international environmental law ultimately means turning to basic principles, applicable to any harm caused to States’ territories, including cyber-related harm, without the need for ‘norm creation’. We believe that this fact alone is a crucial advantage. In addition, international environmental law offers rich State practice and judicial opinions that provide guidance on the nature of the due diligence obligations that flow from the exercise of sovereign rights. Two recent cases are of particular interest in this respect – the ICJ’s Pulp Mills case and the advisory opinion on Activities in the Area of the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS Chamber). The discussion below focuses on the elements of each decision that flesh out the no harm rule with respect to due diligence, the attendant procedural obligations, and the relationship between harm prevention and precaution.

Harm Prevention and Due Diligence\n1. International Environmental Law and Norm Evolution\nin International Cyberspace Law\nIn the Pulp Mills decision, the ICJ emphasised two important features of the no harm rule. First, it encompasses an obligation to prevent harm. Second, “the principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory.” This obligation to act with due diligence entails “not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators.”\nThe ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion on Activities in the Area, in turn, was concerned with the responsibility of States to take appropriate measures to ensure that private entities operating in the deep seabed do not cause harm in that ‘commons’ area. Perhaps most importantly for present purposes, the Chamber highlighted the contextual nature of the due diligence standard. The Chamber observed that the due diligence standard “may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or technological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity [...] [and] be more severe for the riskier activities.” Due diligence may vary also in light of the capacity of the State concerned, although this point appears to be more controversial. Some leading commentators on international environmental law, citing numerous international instruments that accommodate developing countries’ lesser technological and regulatory capacity, including the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change, compared the flexibility of the due diligence standard to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. However, the ITLOS Chamber made a point of emphasising that different treatment for developed and developing States is warranted only when the underlying international legal obligations provide for it.\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 101.\n Ibid., para. 197.\n ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), para. 117.\n See supra, note 13.\n Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell, International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149.\n ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), paras. 151–163.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nThe general requirement of harm prevention, and its attendant due diligence obligation, has already been recognised as a basis for States' obligations with respect to cyberspace activities. The Ad hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (Advisory Group), established by the Council of Europe, explicitly referred to the use of the no harm principle in the environmental law context, and relied on it to “underline the primary nature of the proposed commitments of a state to prevent, manage and respond to significant transboundary disruption of or interference with the stability, robustness, resilience and openness of the Internet.” Some States have also recognised a general due diligence obligation in cyberspace. The United States (US), for instance, considers cyber security due diligence to be an emerging norm according to which “States should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse,” while recognising that “unique attributes of networked technology require additional work to clarify how these norms apply.” A duty “not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies” was also recognised by China and Russia in 2011. Russia argued for inclusion of a more specific duty to “take all necessary steps to prevent any destructive information action originating from their own territory or using the information infrastructure under their jurisdiction, as well as cooperate to locate the source of computer attacks carried out with the use of their territory, to repel these attacks and to eliminate their consequences” in a proposed international information security convention.\nThe obligation to prevent harm to other States from cyber attacks and other malicious cyber activities conducted in their territories is generally considered to\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 64.\n US International Strategy for Cyberspace (note 9), 10.\n Ibid., 9.\n United Nations General Assembly, Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

These obligations have been distilled from international judicial decisions, such as in the Corfu Channel case, and confirmed by State practice, notably States’ treatment of cyber attacks under their criminal laws, UN and States’ declarations, and the European Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention). Hence, a due diligence duty is seen by some observers as forming part of customary international law also in the cyber context. The duty has also been interpreted as “an obligation to render best efforts, calling for a state to take all ‘reasonable and necessary’ measures in order to prevent a given event, however, without warranting that such an event will not occur.” Some have also argued that an assessment of compliance with this duty would depend on “the conduct of the host-state itself in addressing the potential threat and in attaining a realistic result in light of the factual circumstances.”\nThe Advisory Group considered the due diligence duty to mean, in general terms, that States must “take all appropriate measures at [their] disposal to prevent and minimise foreseeable significant transboundary harm.” The Group further suggested that the obligation could be satisfied by States’ “accession to relevant international law instruments such as the Budapest Convention and participation in their follow up arrangements;” by their participation in “the development and implementation of Internet user education and public awareness programmes; their promotion and facilitation of dialogue with stakeholders as well as other appropriate measures;” and by informing themselves of “factual and legal components that relate to transboundary disruptions or interferences with the\n Matthew J.

Specifically, it noted that “an efficient observance of a due diligence commitment is understood as the implementation of those measures which would be commensurate with the overall capabilities of the country concerned to address the risks,” and that legislative, administrative, or other action necessary to implement a States’ due diligence commitments “should be subject to the capabilities of the state concerned.”\nThe scope of States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations in cyberspace were also considered in the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), a document prepared by an independent international group of experts comprised of practitioners and scholars (Tallinn Manual Group of Experts). While the Manual deals primarily with cyber warfare, it recognises the no harm obligation as a rule of “a general international legal nature” applicable to “the relationship between states, cyber infrastructure, and cyber operations” and extending to “all cyber activities from one State’s territory that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another States’ territory [...] irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State.”\nAgain in keeping with the approach in international environmental law, the Tallinn Manual considers that the no harm prevention and due diligence obligations encompass the requirement that States “use all means at [their] disposal\n Ibid., paras. 71–73.\n Ibid., para. 74.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., para. 77.\n Tallinn Manual (note 2).\n Ibid., 15, 26, 27.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 11\nto require [private entities]” to take remedial action to terminate a harmful activity. The Manual also addresses one important issue that has remained underspecified thus far: the level of harm required to trigger the harm prevention duty. In international environmental law, the *Trail Smelter Case* posited a “serious consequence” standard with respect to transboundary air pollution, although today a “significant harm” standard, intended to exclude *de minimis* harm, is more common. The Tallinn Manual only requires a “negative effect” to result from the cyberspace activity, which need not involve physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals. However, the Manual does not specify what harm *would* be considered as having a sufficiently “negative effect” in this context.\n## 2. Areas of Controversy\nIt appears then that the duty to prevent harm and the due diligence obligation are already informing the cyberspace discourse, thereby eliminating, at least in part, the need to ‘reinvent the wheel’ with regard to the regulation of harmful conduct in cyberspace. However, while the relevance of these principles in the cyberspace context has been widely recognised, their precise nature and scope remain contested, and therefore in need of further development and clarification. In this regard, there appears to be several broad areas of controversy, all related in one way or another to the challenges of attribution and to questions surrounding how heavy a harm prevention burden to place on States in relation to non-State activities. After all, hackers and other cyber actors can draw from a rich menu of options for concealing their identities and evading attribution.\nHence, some have doubted the political as well as practical feasibility of no harm and due diligence obligations of States in the cyberspace context, as opposed to reliance on the stringent requirements of the law of State responsibility for direct attribution of harmful actions to States. A viable due diligence framework, some\n *Ibid.*, 28, para. 9.\n *Healey/Pitts* (note 8), 378.\n ILC Draft Articles Transboundary Harm (note 16), 41–42.\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 5.\n For example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets can be intercepted or spoofed mid-route, making it difficult to trace them back to their source. Alternatively, reliance on “botnets”, robot networks of malware-infected personal computers, allows attackers to remain anonymous by assuming the identity of someone else in order to perform malicious actions. See *Shackelford/Andres* (note 2), 982 and *Mauno Pibelgas*, Back-Tracing and Anonymity in Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 28), 46, 47. We are grateful to *Alex Ognihone* for assisting us with this point.\n *Ziolkowski* (note 8), 307.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nargue, may be difficult to achieve as “it is unclear that any state is prepared (politically or technologically) to take full responsibility for all harm emanating from gateway routers, very small aperture terminals [...] wireless mobile devices, and other devices within its territory or jurisdiction.” Therefore, States may not be willing to agree on criteria for a more expansive regime of indirect responsibility for non-State actors’ cyber activities, based on the ‘no harm’ principle. In short, it may seem sensible and even self-evident that States should enact and enforce criminal laws regarding cross-border cyber attacks, in line with the ICJ’s finding in *Pulp Mills* that diligence requires States to “adopt appropriate rules and measures” and “take all appropriate measures to enforce” them. But it may be exceedingly difficult to define in a concrete and also manageable manner what exactly are “appropriate” standards and efforts to prevent harm from cyber attacks and other hostile acts. And, even if agreed, such a general standard may not suffice. “Because of the speed with which cyber weapons could be deployed,” some observers claim, “relying only upon cyber due diligence presents too great a risk of intrusion by unfriendly actors.” This challenge is further complicated by “the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character,” as well as precisely “the ease with which deception can be mounted through cyber infrastructure,” which may make it impossible for a State to prevent injury to another State.\nSome interpretations of due diligence in cyberspace have attempted to take the unique nature of cyber acts into account. For instance, the Advisory Group has limited the applicability of States’ “due diligence commitments of prevention, management and response” to situations where the State is the actual operator or manager of critical internet resources. Where it is not, the Group suggests that “the principle of subsidiarity or non-involvement of states in the ordinary administration of the network or operational issues” prevails, recognising the fact that “the private sector takes the lead in the day-to-day operations of the\n *Sean Kanuck*, Sovereign Discourse on Cyber Conflict Under International Law, Texas Law Review (Tex.

See also *Kirsch* (note 2), 637–638 (arguing that “placing the responsibility on states for cyber attacks committed within their borders potentially unleashes a Pandora’s box of problems, particularly in determining whether the state initiated adequate control measures over the hackers”).\n *Heintschel von Heinegg* (note 8), 139; *Eric Jensen*, Cyber Warfare and Precautions Against the Effects of Attacks, Tex.

While the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts agreed that the obligations would be triggered if a State had “actual knowledge” of the acts in question, it could not agree on whether they would also obtain if a State had only “constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge,” for instance where a State fails to use due care in policing cyber activities on its territory and is therefore unaware of the acts.59 Some have argued that “a state’s duty to prevent cyber attacks should not be based on a state’s knowledge of a particular cyber attack before it occurs, but rather on its actions to prevent cyber attacks in general,” since such attacks are “extremely difficult for host-states to detect prior to the commission of a specific attack.”60 While this approach would be in line with the general thrust of the harm prevention and due diligence obligations as they have developed in international environmental law, it has been criticised for going too far in reducing the knowledge requirement in the cyber context.61 Others have contended that “presumptive knowledge is sufficient to trigger the duty” if the cyber attack can reasonably be considered to belong to a series of cyber attacks” originating from a State’s territory.62 The position of the Advisory Group in this regard is close to the stance of international environmental law; it is that “the disruption and interference should be foreseeable and the state concerned must know or should have known under the circumstances that the given activity involved a risk of significant consequences.”63\n\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nFinally, and relatedly, there seems to be a lack of consensus regarding the precise scope of the no harm and due diligence obligations in cyberspace. Notably, given the “difficulty of mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats,” the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts could not agree on whether or not these general obligations should be applied to “situations in which the relevant acts are merely prospective” as opposed to those that are already underway. In other words, the Group could not agree on a general precautionary duty of States to undertake all appropriate measures with regard to potential cyber threats at an early stage and before a concrete risk of harm occurs, a concept with roots in international environmental law that we discuss in more detail below. Furthermore, the Group could not reach a consensus on the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations to States through which cyber operations merely transit, in light of the “unique routing processes of cyber transmissions.” By contrast, certain scholars have suggested that “reasonable measures to prevent [...] prospective acts are required” and that even a mere transit State “has an obligation to prevent a cyber attack.” However, there is no consensus on this issue as of yet.\nThese contentious issues, among others, must be resolved in order for the no harm principle to effectively regulate activities in cyberspace. International consensus should be achieved on the general content and limits of the due diligence standard applicable to cyberspace. Agreement is also needed on the relationship between States’ responsibility for failure to take diligent harm prevention measures and their responsibility for non-State acts directly attributable to them under the law of State responsibility. Arguably, both types of responsibility obtain, and each applies to a distinct type of ‘failure’ by a State. But, absent consensus on the issue, developing an effective normative and regulatory framework for cyberspace on the basis of the duty to prevent harm and the law of State responsibility will be difficult. With the caveats noted above, the development of these principles in the environmental context, and particularly the contextual approach adopted by the ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion, may be\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 7.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 169.\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 28, 29, para. 12.\n Pirker (note 29), 208.\n Ibid., 209.\n Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 137, 138.\n Kirsch (note 2), 638; Kanuck (note 48), 1592; Kulesza, State Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks on International Peace and Security (note 8), 151; Gary Brown/Keira Poellet, The Customary International Law of Cyberspace, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 126, 141.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 15\nhelpful in this regard. Applying such an approach in the cyberspace context could allow for a flexible, contextual application of the due diligence standard. One might also envision a contextual interpretation of the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility in accordance with new technological developments and the evolving nature of cyberspace. However, as in the debates surrounding the attribution of non-State actor conduct for the purposes of the law on the use of force, many States and other observers will likely have misgivings about modifying (and thereby potentially eroding) what is meant to be a general framework for specific purposes. The due diligence standard is therefore likely to be the most promising conceptual hook for the necessary fine-tuning; the precise contours of this standard could change over time and in accordance with the gravity of the transboundary cyber harm caused.\n## B. Procedural Obligations\nThe no harm rule entails a series of procedural obligations, including the obligation to notify or warn potentially affected States, the obligation to exchange information, to consult and negotiate, and the general obligation to cooperate to prevent harm. The Pulp Mills case confirms that these procedural obligations, on the one hand, have a separate existence as customary norms (that can be violated on their own terms – even when harm is ultimately not caused), and, on the other hand, are implied in the substantive obligation to prevent environmental harm (e.g. a State may have to notify or consult with another about potential harm in order to meet its obligation of diligent harm prevention).\nIn the cyberspace context, similar cooperative requirements and processes have been emphasised in light of its rapidly changing technological nature, its “global character”, and because protection from cyber threats requires “collaborative relationships for exchanging cyber defense data and an ability to establish trusted relationships.” Accordingly, the duty to cooperate has been considered to be\n ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 7).\n Lac Lamocx Arbitration (note 13).\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 145 (tracing the obligation to cooperate to the good faith principle in international law).\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), paras. 78, 79.\n Rolf Weber, Future Design of Cyberspace Law, Journal of Politics and Law 5 (2012), 1.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 177.\n Diego Vázquez et al., Conceptual Framework for Cyber Defense Information Sharing within Trust Relationships, in: Czosseck/Ottis/Ziolkowski (eds.) (note 8), 2012, 4th International\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nrelevant as a general principle of international law, as well as a legal obligation of States in the arena of cyber security. Reliance on traditional means of international cooperation in areas such as cybercrime, however, has been viewed as incapable of offering the timely response needed. Therefore, new cooperative mechanisms have been developed in this context, such as the 24/7 international assistance network established under the Budapest Convention for investigations and evidence collection concerning cybercrime.\nThis broad duty to cooperate has been recognised as part and parcel of the obligation to prevent harm in the cyberspace context. It includes the obligation to undertake a risk assessment, to exchange information, to inform, notify, and consult other States in concrete cases of risk of significant transboundary harm, and to cooperate “with the victim-states of cyber attacks that originated from within their borders” during investigations and prosecutions. The Advisory Group, for instance, stated as general requirements that “States should co-operate mutually, in good faith and in consultation with each other and with concerned stakeholders at all stages of designing and implementing policies in relation to the Internet,” and “should take all reasonable measures to provide prior and timely notification and relevant information to states that may be potentially affected.” These requirements envision “participation of states within whose jurisdiction disruptions or interferences with the Internet stability, robustness and resilience may originate, and states likely to be affected or actually affected, in action aimed at prevention of, preparedness for and response to risks and threats to critical Internet resources.”\nConference on Cyber Conflict Proceedings (NATO CCD COE Publications 2012), 429.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 75.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 177, 178.\n United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime: Draft (February 2013), xi, available at: http://www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Art. 35; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Internet, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. VI (2012), 227.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 186.\n Ibid., 169; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 376.\n Sklerov (note 29), 62; Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 135.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 18.\n Ibid., 21.\n Ibid., para. 75.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 17\nIn more practical terms, the Advisory Group noted that States should, in particular, “co-operate in the creation of public awareness about the risks and opportunities of cross border Internet traffic and the development of educational tools to enable citizens to share responsibilities for a safer Internet,” as well as take legislative action in order to overcome barriers to international cooperation. Moreover, “states may establish mechanisms that are suitable for monitoring the implementation of their preparedness and prevention commitments in respect of disruptions and interference with the infrastructure of the Internet.” The Advisory Group also set out detailed standards for information exchange and coordinated action, some of which were explicitly ‘borrowed’ from the international environmental context. These include the development of common rules and practices for information sharing, incident reporting, and for deploying internet resilience technologies; timely notification of transboundary risks and vulnerabilities; assessment of possible or actual adverse transboundary effects; coordination of emergency and response policies; and mutual consultations and assistance. Some of these obligations have also been included in the Budapest Convention.\nThe reality remains, however, that some States from which cyber attacks originate refuse to accept responsibility or cooperate with investigations, that a clear framework for effective and timely exchange of information on critical infrastructure protection is lacking, and that outside the realm of cyber crime there has been little international cooperation in reducing the transboundary impact of malicious activities in cyberspace. Since States continue to have “wide discretion as to how to fulfill the legal obligation to cooperate in the cyber realm,” there is a clear need for consensus to be reached on a uniform standard for cooperation. Such consensus, moreover, cannot include only States. In light of the dominant role of the private sector and civil society in internet governance, a multi-stakeholder approach must be applied in the discussion and formulation of\n Ibid., paras. 76, 79.\n Ibid., para. 80.\n Ibid., para. 93.\n Ibid., paras. 91–102.\n Such as mutual assistance, see Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Chapter III.\n Kirsch (note 2), 638.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 91.\n Heaby/Pitts (note 8), at 366.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 178.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nprocedural obligations such as the duty to cooperate. This approach requires public-private collaboration, including internet service provider assistance, as well as data exchanges and partnerships, to form part of any international legal framework or standard for cyberspace cooperation.\n## C. Precaution\nIn the environmental context, at least, due diligence also appears to have become a conceptual bridge between the duty to prevent harm and the proposition that States, in certain circumstances, also must take precautionary measures. As traditionally conceived, the no harm rule is engaged when there is a known or objectively determined risk of significant environmental harm. By contrast, the precautionary principle, as articulated in Principle 15 Rio Declaration, is triggered by ‘threats of serious or irreversible damage’ and its lower evidentiary threshold could strengthen the protective potential of international environmental law. However, debate persists among States and academic commentators as to the precise contents of the principle, and whether or not it has acquired customary law status. International courts and tribunals, while acknowledging the wisdom of precautionary approaches to environmental protection, have avoided pronouncing on its legal status.\nThe ITLOS Chamber, in the *Activities in the Area* advisory opinion, suggested that there was a trend “towards making [the precautionary] approach part of customary international law,” and observed that it “is also an integral part of the general obligation of due diligence.” This obligation requires States “to take all\n---\n Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, *Principles of International Internet Law*, German Law Journal 11 (2010), 1245, 1261, 1262.\n *Eneken Tikk*, *Establishing Rules for Cyber Security*, in: Scott Jasper (ed.), *Conflict and Cooperation in the Global Commons* (2012), 222–224.\n See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 153.\n Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 15.\n See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 154–164.\n See ICJ, *Gablikoro-Nagymaros* (note 15), para. 140; id., *Pulp Mills* (note 15), paras. 164, 185.

As such it would seem to be highly relevant to the cyber context. Indeed, it has been suggested that States are obliged “to take (general) precautionary measures with regard to potential cyber threats posing a significant risk of damage of a transboundary nature.” This obligation has also been said to form part of States’ due diligence obligation in this context, and to include “the duty to undertake all appropriate regulatory measures at an early stage, and well before the (concrete) risk of harm occurs,” although the precise degree of knowledge of such a risk required from States in order to trigger the duty, as already mentioned, remains controversial. Precautionary measures in this context would include “the implementation of strategic, political, organisational, administrative, legal and technical measures [...] aimed at general prevention” of misuse of cyberspace for malicious activities by non-State actors, although what precisely such measures would entail remains to be clarified by “future State practice.” Such State practice can be seen, for instance, in recent domestic legislative initiatives attempting to impose a legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n The ITLOS Chamber may have spelled out what the ICJ merely alluded to in its *Gablōkoon-Nagymarus* and *Pulp Mills* decisions by noting that ‘in the field of environmental protection, vigilance and prevention are required on account of the often irreversible character of damage and of the limitations inherent in the very mechanism of reparation of this type of damage’.

Finally, precautionary principles also form part of the ‘good neighborliness’ principle, which in the environmental law context is said to include “the duty to cooperate in investigating, identifying, and avoiding environmental harm.” This principle has also been applied to cyberspace in the form of an obligation “to take preventive and precautionary measures” with regard to cyber threats, as well as “to inform, notify, and consult in concrete cases of risk of significant transboundary harm.”\nIt is interesting to note the different approaches taken by the Advisory Group and the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts in this regard. A “precautionary approach” was expressly recognised by the Advisory Group, which considered the identification, assessment, and notification of possible or actual risks of adverse transboundary effects on the internet, and the prior and timely notification of such risks, to form part of States’ prevention obligation in cyberspace. The Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, as we have already noted, adopted a more conservative approach and did not encompass prospective acts or acts of which States ‘should have known’ in the obligation to prevent cyber harm to other States. Therefore, while both groups of experts seem to agree on the basic need for States to exercise due diligence in order to prevent transboundary cyber harm, their interpretations of the nature and scope of these obligations diverge.\nOne possible explanation for this divergence is the different nature, purpose, and mandate of each of these groups of experts. The Advisory Group, comprised of European experts in fields such as law, information, and telecommunications, was set up by the Steering Committee on the Media and New Communication Service of the Council of Europe. It was instructed to examine “the shared or mutual responsibilities of states in ensuring that critical Internet resources are managed in the public interest and as a public asset” and “make proposals [...] relating to the prevention and management of events [...] falling within member states’ jurisdictions or territories, which could block or significantly impede Internet access [...] with the objective of guaranteeing the ongoing functioning and universal nature and integrity of the Internet.” The mandate of the Advisory\n Robin Geiß/Henning Lehmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

In so doing, it focused on States’ due diligence and procedural obligations while excluding such controversial issues as State responsibility, cyber warfare, and countermeasures.\nThe Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, on the other hand, was comprised of both European and non-European legal and technical experts (but all from Western States), many of whom with experience or expertise related to armed conflict, national defence, or security policy. It was set up by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, an international military organisation, and tasked with producing “a manual on the law governing cyber warfare.” Accordingly, the Manual explicitly excluded any detailed discussion of cyber activities “that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.” While it addressed the application of general international legal rules to cyberspace in times of peace, including States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations, the focus of the Manual was on cyber warfare and the application of international laws of armed conflict to it. Having to decide on such controversial issues, which were avoided by the Advisory Group, as well as the background of some of the experts in the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, may have influenced the tone of the Manual and its perspective, resulting in a more conservative and narrow stance with respect to States’ obligations in cyberspace. As one commentator noted, “the Experts were very cautious to avoid taking any risks when drafting the rules” and, since unanimity was required to formulate the rules, “the most controversial international law aspects of cyber operations were therefore left unresolved.”\nThe different approaches taken by the Advisory Group and the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts reflect some of the underlying disagreements and confusion that\n The Advisory Group explicitly drew a distinction between States’ commitments to prevent and manage cross-border disruptions of or interferences with the internet and international law rules governing responsibility for internationally wrongful acts, Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 20, para. 85.\n See “the international group of experts and participants” in the Tallinn Manual (note 2), x–xiii.\n Although the Tallinn Manual does not represent the views of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, its sponsoring nations, or NATO, Tallinn Manual (note 2), 11.\n Ibid., (note 2), at 1.\n Ibid., 4.\n It has been suggested, for instance, that there may be an overtly close connection between the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts and the military and a potential resulting bias in the substance of the Manual, Pirkor (note 29), 190.\n Marco Rossini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (2014), 31.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\npersist in the cyberspace context with regard to States' harm prevention and due diligence obligations, what precisely these obligations entail, and when they apply. Some doctrine emanating from the US, as well as European politicians and international law scholars, view cyberspace as \"the fifth battlefield\" and therefore, like the Tallinn Manual, emphasise States' obligations in terms of use of force, self-defence, and countermeasures, rather than in terms of harm prevention and due diligence. An opposite view is that said to be represented by the Advisory Group, which \"holds that states are obliged to observe due diligence in preventing cyber attacks and they may only be held responsible for a cyber attack if it can be demonstrated that they have failed to meet the due diligence standard.\"\n## III. Cyberspace as a Global Commons or a Shared Resource?\nIn the environmental context, it is accepted that States have an obligation to prevent harm to the territory of another State, or to areas beyond national control – global commons. However, the full legal ramifications of this ‘commons’ aspect of the harm prevention obligation are far from settled. Notably, there is no direct State practice on the question of who can invoke a State’s responsibility for harm to the commons. When it comes to applying the rules concerning harm to the commons to cyberspace, a prior question looms large: Is cyberspace a ‘commons’ in the first place? Alternatively, might it be a ‘shared resource’ of States?\nSome have identified the cyber domain as a global commons, together with the high seas, air, and space, and view these as “domains that are not controlled by any single state” but are rather “universally needed and thus should be shared.” The Advisory Group, for instance, regarded “critical Internet resources” as global commons “under the stewardship of the international Internet community as a whole.” The US and Japan have also regarded cyberspace as a global commons;\n Kulesza, International Internet Law (note 8), 359–360.\n See Stockholm Declaration (note 13), Principle 21; Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 2. And see ICJ, Legality of Nuclear Weapons (note 14), para. 29; id., Gabilikovo-Nagymaros (note 15), para. 53; and id., Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 101.\n Jutta Brunnée, Common Areas, Common Heritage, Common Concern, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.)

From a definitional, or practical, perspective, the cyber domain is distinguishable from the other global commons on account of being a human creation and involving both physical infrastructure located in national territories and intangible features that transcend territorial borders. Furthermore, unlike the sea, Antarctica, and outer space, “there is a ‘population’ or community in cyberspace and [...] [it] is not an entirely independent international space or concern that is beyond national regulation.” According to some observers, in order for cyberspace to become a global commons, “long-established rights of sovereignty and property ownership recognized by the numerous domestic jurisdictions involved” in cyberspace would have to be overridden and legitimate and illegitimate users would have to be positively identified for the enforcement of norms or collective solutions. Neither of these conditions is currently satisfied in the cyberspace context.\nFrom a conceptual perspective, the identification of cyberspace as a global commons has thus far failed to clarify States’ obligations. The Advisory Group, for instance, emphasised the need for harm to be caused to another State, rather than to cyberspace as a resource, in order to trigger States’ obligations, notwithstanding its explicit reference to the internet as a global commons. Moreover, the global commons concept does not necessarily make cyberspace any easier to regulate. It has been argued, for instance, that while in the context of other global commons, users have “successfully self-organized for sustainable use of a commons” in the absence of government control, in the case of cyberspace the “affordances of the cyber technologies — that is, the way the technologies enable their use — and the mentalities of the users” have resulted in a “tragedy of the commons” that prevents effective self-organisation for sustainable use of\n United States Department of Defense, The Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support (2005), 12, available at: https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=454976 (accessed on 23 October 2015); Ziolkowski (note 29), 183.\n Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 22–23.\n Kam Wai Chik, ‘Customary internet-ional law’: Creating a body of customary law for cyberspace, Part 1: Developing rules for transitioning custom into law, Computer Law &amp; Security Review 26 (2010), 3, 13.\n Kanuck (note 48), 1577, 1579.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 69.\n Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 23.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ncyberspace. The concept of cyberspace as a commons, therefore, does not seem to have contributed much to the development of clear norms to regulate its use, and may even hinder this process.\nSome academic observers have warned against what they view as a gradual move away from the perception of cyberspace as a global commons and toward a State-based governance regime, considering it to constitute “norm regression” in the global governance of cyberspace. But however intuitive it may seem to think of cyberspace as a type of commons, the idea remains controversial and in any event would not necessarily advance the effort to develop norms for the regulation of cyberspace, such as the duty to prevent harm. Even in the environmental context, the legal status of spaces or resources beyond the exclusive jurisdiction of States tends to be controversial. Aside from well-established examples of geographic areas like the high seas, Antarctica, or outer space, States have avoided the ‘commons’ label, precisely because it implies both the absence of sovereignty and certain collective rights and obligations.\nOne might alternatively consider the potential relevance of the notion of ‘shared resource’. This concept certainly fits key aspects of cyberspace, perhaps better than the notion of a ‘commons’, because it applies to resources that are under the jurisdiction of States but are quintessentially transboundary in nature. This paradigm permits States that share such a resource to devise norms and rules that take into account their respective sovereign interests, their mutual interests in the use and protection of the resource, and their obligations under international law. In the environmental context, States have often avoided using this umbrella concept, arguably because of the implication of less than full sovereignty and the broader implications the concept might have for other resources, and have used more issue-specific concepts, like ‘international watercourse’.\n Roger Hurwitz, Depleted Trust in the Cyber Commons, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 20, 21; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 366.\n But see Scott Shackelford, Toward Cyberpeace: Managing Cyberattacks Through Polycentric Governance, American University Law Review 62 (2013), 1273, 1293 (suggesting that cyberspace be treated as ‘pseudocommons’, “comprised of a shared global infrastructure that is controlled by public and private entities subject to national and international regulations”).\n Ronald Deibert/Masashi Crets-Nishibata, Global Governance and the Spread of Cyberspace Controls, Global Governance 18 (2012), 341, 343, 345; Joanna Kuleczy/Roy Balleste, Signs and Portents in Cyberspace: The Rise of Jus Internet as a New Order in International Law, Fordham Intellectual Property, Media and Entertainment Law Journal 23 (2013), 1320.\n Brunnie, Common Areas, Common Heritage, Common Concern (note 132).\n See Jutta Brunnie/Stephen Toupe, Environmental Security and Freshwater Resources: Ecosystem Regime Building, American Journal of International Law 91 (1997), 26; Kanuck (note 48), 1580.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 25\nNonetheless, this conception could be helpful in relation to cyberspace since it would allow States to maintain certain sovereign rights, although these would not be absolute and would be balanced against the interests of other States and the international community. While the concept of ‘shared resource’ is not a panacea for the difficulties already discussed with respect to defining and applying the no harm and due diligence obligations to cyberspace, it has been suggested that such a tailored model may present an alternative avenue for establishing States’ legal obligation to cooperate in this context through such principles as the sustainable and equitable use of shared resources. These principles may encourage States to undertake all necessary means in order to preserve the internet for future generations, which implies a proactive countering of cyber threats, an obligation to take precautionary measures, and restraint from any action that could hamper the availability and reliability of the internet. In short, a ‘shared resource’ model could promote stewardship in cyberspace, rather than sovereignty. While it may not resolve fundamental definitional issues, such a model could provide an alternative conceptual framework that shifts the focus from States’ obligations to each other to States’ obligations to cyberspace as a shared resource, thereby facilitating the development of norms and rules for its governance.\n## IV. Institutional Frameworks\nIt has been said that “there are structural similarities between the milieus of international law and of the Internet: neither is completely hierarchical and both must deal with ‘commons’ problems.” Whether the future cyberspace governance regime will be grounded in the no harm and due diligence framework or in a ‘commons’ framework that may evolve over time, an additional question concerns the appropriate process for developing and maintaining the attendant normative and regulatory framework. International environmental law offers some models for governance regimes, and we thus turn to an examination of its normative and regulatory structures.\n Ibid., 1580.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 179–181.\n See Duncan Hollis, Stewardship versus Sovereignty?

International Environmental Governance\nIn the environmental context, so-called framework agreements have played a prominent role. They help in dealing with complex, evolving issues by allowing parties to begin by defining the common concern at hand, agreeing on principles to guide States’ actions, and establishing institutions and decision-making procedures for subsequent regime-development.^[150]^\nMany environmental regimes create, or collaborate with, bodies that facilitate exchange among scientific or technical experts. Such bodies are important in building consensus around the nature of collective concerns and the collective action that is required to address them. Scientific or technical expert bodies also make important contributions in the further elaboration, refinement, or adjustment of regulatory strategies.^[151]^ In the cyber context one could easily see the usefulness of such an approach, for example in relation to the constantly shifting needs of cyber security and the related due diligence standards. Environmental regime development *per se* is usually in the hands of a plenary body, which facilitates regular, long-term engagements between technical experts, policy-makers, lawyers, and relevant non-State actors (international organisations, non-governmental organisations, or business entities).^[152]^ Although, in a formal sense, law-making remains in the hands of States, non-State actors can provide input into law-making processes or even help shape their outcomes.^[153]^\nEnvironmental standard-setting itself occurs through decisions of plenary bodies, without subsequent formal consent by individual States. In most cases, the resulting standards are not legally binding, notwithstanding the mandatory language they may contain.^[154]^ This approach facilitates agreement on collective action and standards that are applicable to all parties – an important feature for efforts to address collective concerns. Equally important is that soft regulatory processes enable speedier regime development and adjustment than processes that require subsequent ratification by individual States. In the cyber context both of these features could be significant, since (as in the environmental context) cyber\n^[150]^ See *Jutta Brunnée*, Toward Effective International Environmental Law – Trends and Developments, in: Steven Kennett (ed.), Law and Process in Environmental Management (1993), 222–229.\n^[151]^ For a detailed discussion, see *ead*, Coping with Consent: Lawmaking under Multilateral Environmental Agreements, Leiden Journal of International Law 15 (2002), 1.\n^[152]^ *Ibid.*, 15, 16.\n^[153]^ *Ibid.*, 14.\n^[154]^ *Ibid.*, 25, 26.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 27\nproblems, or relevant technical understanding or capacity, as well as political dynamics, typically evolve over time, often rapidly.\nWith respect to treaty making, the experience with MEAs shows that even an apparently straightforward matter as agreeing on the nature and scope of the underlying concern and the principles that should govern it may be fraught with difficulties. In the climate context, for example, it took more than twenty years for parties to agree on the precise meaning of the regime objective – to forestall dangerous climate change – and parties are still struggling to achieve consensus on the parameters of one of the regime’s core principles, the notion of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities’. On the latter concept, the positions of developed and developing countries have diverged quite dramatically, with some developing countries continuing to insist that developed countries shoulder the primary burdens of addressing climate change. To be sure, the claims of ‘historical responsibility’ that developing countries have leveled against developed countries in relation to global carbon emissions will have no comparable basis in the cyber context. Still, a global regime-building effort in the cyber context, could also invite arguments by developing countries that States’ common responsibilities should be differentiated so as to lessen their burden or entitle them to technical or financial assistance. It seems sensible, even inevitable; to assist less developed countries in addressing the underlying common concern. In fact, most MEAs today do provide for various kinds of assistance, including through multilateral funds designed to finance conversion to new technologies or otherwise address capacity limitations. But it is highly unlikely that major States, such as the US, will be any more inclined to accept formal differentiation or assistance obligations in the cyber context than they have been in the climate context (which is not to say ‘no assistance’). Finally, experience with MEAs, especially the climate regime, also shows the potential pitfalls of treaty-based standard-setting. The need for agreement by a significant majority of parties (typically 3/4) and the common practice of consensus decision-making can easily stall progress or result\n See Jutta Brunnée/Stephen Toupe, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (2010), Chapter 4.\n See Jutta Brunnée/Charlotte Streck, The UNFCCC as a Negotiating Forum: Towards Common but more Differentiated Responsibilities, Climate Policy 13 (2013), 589.\n For an overview, see Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, Technical and Financial Assistance, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.) (note 5), 947.\n It is precisely this dimension of the principle that prompted the United States to declare that Principle 7 Rio Declaration (one prominent articulation of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’) did not ‘imply a recognition or acceptance by the United States of any international obligations or liabilities, or any diminution of the responsibilities of developing countries under international law’, see UN Report of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg, South Africa, 26 August – 4 September 2002, UN Doc. A/CONF.199/20 (2002), 145.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nin lowest-common-denominator standard-setting, a concern that has been raised also in the cyber context and will be further discussed below.\n## B. International Cyberspace Governance\nAs with the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations, standard-setting bodies and multilateral agreements for cyberspace governance already exist or are being created. Their precise scope, authority, and norm-developing processes, however, remain unclear and may therefore benefit from considering the environmental governance experience.\nThere are many intergovernmental organisations, both specialised and general, that address different aspects of cyberspace regulation, however their ability to constitute, or form the foundation for, a universal normative or regulatory regime for cyberspace is doubtful. In terms of technical standard-setting, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a UN specialised agency, has been active “with regard to International Public Policy Issues Pertaining to the Internet and the Management of Internet Resources, including Domain Names and Addresses.” However, it has been criticised for being unable to adjust to the rapid changes in the cyberspace environment, being potentially unrepresentative of the views of all of its members, and being ill-equipped to regulate other, non-technical, areas of cyberspace such as international and criminal law. Similarly, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regards “[p]reserving and enhancing the operational stability, reliability, security, and global interoperability of the Internet” as one of its core objectives, and makes binding decisions and policies on various, mostly technical, internet-related issues. However, its powers continue to be largely derived from, and dependant on, the US government; it has therefore been criticised for essentially being a State actor rather than an “international organization with a fully democratic legitimation.”\n---\n See discussion in *Brunnée/Tonpe*, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law (note 155).\n *Sabine von Schorlemer*, Telecommunications, International Regulation, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International LawMPEPIL, Vol. IX (2012), 818 et seq.\n *Ibid.*\n *David Gross et al.*, Cyber Security Governance: Existing Structures, International Approaches and the Private Sector, in: Lord/Sharp (eds.) (note 162), 114, 116.\n *Woltag* (note 81).\n *Ibid.*\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 29\nThese essentially technical bodies, moreover, lack any formal law-making ability. Nonetheless, they have become increasingly politicised, and “distrust by some nations may prevent them from making and enforcing any unilateral policy determinations going forward.” As for more general intergovernmental and regional organisations active in the cyberspace arena, such as the European Union (EU), Council of Europe, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, NATO, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and others, their activities with respect to cyberspace norm-development include issuing reports, organising conferences and summits, devising and promoting policies and conventions, and establishing working groups. However, the respective responsibilities of these organisations, as well as their standard-setting authority, remain unclear; there is often little cooperation among them; and their efforts have been conflicting at times.\nThe limited utility of these bodies for cyberspace norm-creation arguably stems from the lack of international consensus on their precise role in cyberspace governance and the appropriate institutional character of any future regulatory regime. At the 2003 and 2005 World Summits on the Information Society (WSIS I and II), for instance, some developed countries, led by the US, adopted a ‘non-governmental’ approach and regarded the private sector influence and in particular the mandate of ICANN as sufficient for regulatory purposes. A majority of developing countries, including China, however, called for a ‘government-centered’ approach involving intergovernmental management of the internet, for example by the ITU. It was ultimately decided to maintain the existing governance system, while establishing a new Internet Governance Forum (IGF) within the UN for\n As well as others, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the Internet Society (ISOC), the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n Deibert/Crete-Nishibata (note 141), 346, 347; Gross et al.

The EU and the US continue to object to ITU governance of the internet, despite growing calls for “an equal role and responsibility for international Internet governance” for all governments, and the IGF remains merely a forum for discussion, without any powers of supervision or decision-making. As a result, there is still no effective institutional authority that is universally accepted. Ultimately, it has been said that any intergovernmental institution or regime established to regulate and govern cyberspace must have sufficient expertise and technical capability for norm-creation, be perceived as having sufficient legitimacy by the international community, and be able to generate “both high level and specific behavioral norms that are widely accepted as legitimate.”\nA possible alternative to an intergovernmental or non-governmental regulatory institution is a treaty-based regime resembling the one established with respect to climate change. The development of such a regime was attempted, for instance, with respect to the regulation of cyber crime through the creation of the Budapest Convention. However, the Convention has only been ratified by 47 States thus far, and is unlikely to be universally adopted since many nations view it as a ‘European’ document. Multilateral treaties to regulate certain aspects of cyberspace, including cyber security, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, have also been suggested by scholars, as well as States such as Russia.

It is not clear as of yet whether this apparent shift, notably in the UN climate change regime, reflects significant and lasting structural change in international environmental treaty making from ‘top-down’ to ‘bottom-up’ approaches.[181] At any rate, in the cyberspace context, treaty-based standard-setting and norm-creation already has been criticised for being too ‘top-down’ for the needs of the medium and, as in the environmental context, as likely to suffer from the “lowest common denominator effect.”[182] Also, creating a multilateral treaty on cyberspace regulation is bound to be a protracted process, and some observers suggest that “an adequate legal framework is only realisable if the foundation is done on an informal law-making basis.”[183] Such informal law-making efforts have in fact been attempted, for instance by China, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, who in 2011 submitted to the UN a proposal for an international code of conduct for information security.[184] While this initiative has since been discussed in various international forums,[185] its viability is doubtful in light of objections by the US and\n\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nmost Western countries to its State-centric model for internet governance. It seems, therefore, that before any international regulatory regime can be devised, a conceptual framework for cyberspace governance must be agreed upon, on the basis of which such a regime could function.\nIt is possible that such a framework could be created around the protection of cyberspace itself, for instance by adopting the notion of a ‘commons’ or ‘shared resource’ regime as discussed above, or in the form of a multilateral treaty regime for the prevention of transboundary impacts, such as that established under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention). The LRTAP Convention, one of the earliest MEAs, has been successful in facilitating preventive regulation and integrated policy-making based on scientific assessments and economic modeling. As one commentator has noted, “experience with multilateral environmental treaties has shown that investigation and monitoring can be important tools underlying a dynamic regulatory framework that can adapt to changes in levels of risk identified.” In the case of the LRTAP Convention, this ‘science-policy interaction’ has been successful in achieving emission reductions of air pollutants in light of such factors as: the direct link between relevant science and policy preparation; multiple scenarios that present policy options; accessibility of science to all participants; a framework offered for countries to provide their own data; the consensus based way of working; and the ability to adapt scientific and policy frameworks to developments in science and policy. Devising a treaty regime along the lines of the LRTAP Convention model may be particularly useful in the cyberspace context, which is similarly dynamic and scientific/technical in nature.\nHowever, it seems fair to say that the development of such a conceptual framework or treaty regime is unlikely to be successful at this point in time. This type of norm-building effort would have to overcome several obstacles, quite apart from State security interests. These range from States’ general reluctance to declare\nhttp://www.unidir.org/files/files/TH_Madrid_21Mar14.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n UNIDIR High-Level Seminar (note 185), 3; Roger Hurwitz, A New Normal?

As already mentioned, such reluctance is evident in the disagreements concerning the allocation of a greater governance role to the ITU. Liberal democracies are concerned that the intergovernmental model of internet governance would be “fragmented, slow and not interoperable” and facilitate censorship in authoritarian States. In turn, developing States that are not able to deal with cyber threats tend to blame the flaws in internet security on the ICANN-led governance structure and seek a new, government-controlled model. During the 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications, 89 governments, including many developing States, supported an enhanced role for the ITU over internet regulation and approved revisions to the International Telecommunication Regulations intended to transfer authority for regulating critical aspects of the internet from ICANN to the ITU. 54 countries, including the US, the EU, and most other developed countries, however, advocated for the existing model of internet oversight by multi-stakeholder, non-governmental institutions, and refused to sign the revised text of the Regulations. While some observers considered the outcome of the Conference to signal a “digital Cold War,” the long term implications of these partially adopted revisions have yet to emerge.\nMoreover, any conceptual and/or regulatory framework for cyberspace governance would have to include non-State actors, particularly the private sector, in law-making or norm-development processes, as has been explicitly recognised. The 2005 WSIS II Tunis Agenda, for instance, stated that the “international\n Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar, Cyber Diplomacy: Agenda, Challenges and Mission, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

(note 162).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nmanagement of the Internet should be multilateral, transparent and democratic, with the full involvement of governments, the private sector, civil society and international organizations. This sentiment was echoed by the Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet, which strongly emphasised the need for multi-stakeholder participation. Most recently, in April 2014, the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial) brought together representatives from civil society, the private sector, academia, and the technical community, supported by several governmental representatives, to “establish strategic guidelines related to the use and development of the Internet in the world.” The Meeting resulted in the Multistakeholder Statement, a non-binding document that set out “Internet Governance Process Principles” emphasising inclusiveness, collaboration, meaningful participation, and consensus driven governance. Nonetheless, it has been argued that “some nations and [intergovernmental organisations] still must embrace further the value of collaboration beyond merely with state actors,” suggesting that there is room for improvement with the involvement of non-State actors in policy-making and norm-development processes relating to cyberspace.\nIn addition, as in the international environmental context, cyberspace governance must also address tensions between the developed and developing worlds, which are reflected in disagreements over cyber governance issues such as the role of the ITU and further complicate efforts to establish a global normative/regulatory regime. The need to bridge the ‘digital divide’, the “social and spatial inequalities in internet access” between developed and developing countries, has long been recognised. For instance, the primary objectives of the WSIS I and II conferences were “to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society” and to “pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society.” Similarly, the recent NETmundial statement emphasised that “Internet governance institutions\n Tunis Agenda (note 169), para. 29; Woltag (note 81).\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), paras. 58, 59.\n Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial), NETmundial: The beginning of a process, available at: http://netmundial.br/about/ (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n NETmundial, NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement, 24 April 2014, available at: http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n Gross et al.

However, while the risk of the internet “reinforce[ing] or even deepen[ing] existing divisions between the haves and have-nots, between the developed and developing worlds” has been acknowledged, no mechanism for the even distribution of the “benefits of the information technology revolution” has thus far been created, with the exception of a voluntary “Digital Solidarity Fund” established pursuant to the WSIS. Therefore, for any truly global regulatory regime of cyberspace to succeed, the interests and capabilities of developing countries must be taken into account both in its development process and in its content. Here, too, lessons may be learned from the environmental context, including concerning the challenges involved.\nIn sum, the need for multi-stakeholder involvement and global representation in the development of norms and regulatory mechanisms to govern cyberspace seems to be widely recognised. Less formal frameworks based on ‘soft law’, rather than intergovernmental agreements or institutions, may be more conducive to the development of such norms and mechanisms. Still, the involvement and cooperation of States seems equally important in light of the fact that they retain control over cyberspace infrastructure and the enforcement of cyberspace regulation, and that some form of State responsibility for harmful cyberspace activities emanating from their territories is required. Ultimately, therefore, an effective regulatory framework for cyberspace may require a “multi-layered structure” that combines informal norm-developing networks, institutions for multi-stakeholder consultation, technical standard-setting bodies, and treaties for intergovernmental cooperation and regulation. As has been suggested elsewhere, “the legal framework [for cyberspace] is to be based on networks established by the concerned communities and linked together through interconnection mechanisms.” Such an interconnected system is necessary in order for international consensus to be achieved on the controversial elements of cyberspace governance discussed in this chapter, including the legal nature and conception of\n NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement (note 202).\n Warf (note 204), 21.\n Antonio Segura-Serrano, Internet Regulation and the Role of International Law, Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law 10 (2006), 191, 259, available at: www.mpii.de/files/pdf3/06_antonov1.pdf (accessed on 21 October 2010).\n See supra, notes 153–160 and accompanying text.\n Weber (note 75), 7.\n Ibid., 4.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ncyberspace and the content and limits of States' obligations in relation to peacetime cyberspace activities.\n## V. Conclusion\nAnd so we return to the no harm rule. Our conclusion is that, at least in the short run, the most promising foundation for international cyberspace law is the harm prevention/due diligence framework that has already gained considerable traction in this context. One of this framework's main advantages is precisely that it does not require wholesale norm-creation or big normative battles, as would be required in an effort to develop norms for the governance of cyberspace itself as a 'shared' or 'commons' resource. The basic norms already exist and apply to activities and harms that involve cyberspace just as to any other activity that occurs under the jurisdiction of States.\nIn this regard, the evolution of international environmental law is instructive, especially in relation to the efforts to flesh out the concepts of harm prevention and due diligence. The Interim Report of the Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet is an excellent illustration of how the same could be accomplished in the cyber context. It articulates adaptations of the general principles of prevention, diligence, procedural obligations, and precaution, including to a multi-stakeholder context, and highlights the need for the development of common standards and best practices. Such standards need not be developed in legally binding form or in a multilateral treaty to be influential, or to flesh out the binding prevention and diligence obligations that exist at custom. As we have shown, although international agreements have played a crucial role in global environmental protection, we appear to be witnessing a certain return to basic principles in the regulation of transboundary environmental harm. The harm prevention/due diligence framework may offer the most suitable approach also in the cyber context, where the potential benefits of a treaty-based approach arguably are outweighed by the drawbacks. The development of cyberspace norms can rather take place through relatively informal legal means in an interconnected, multi-stakeholder system that incorporates States and non-State actors, thereby bypassing lumbering and often stalled treaty-based processes.\nNonetheless, the development of such norms requires some degree of international consensus on the nature of cyberspace governance, the content of basic principles, and the degree and type of regulation required. Unlike the liberal approach adopted by the Advisory Group, it seems that the Tallinn Manual Group\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 37\nof Experts took a more conservative stance and could not agree on certain issues, notably the question whether there is a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent any cyber activity with a ‘negative effect,’ or just a duty not to knowingly allow harmful acts that are underway to continue. As we have suggested, the different nature, focus, and purpose of these two groups of experts may account for their divergent approaches to States’ obligations in this context. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that some of the Tallinn Manual’s experts have now turned their attention to the application of international law principles, such as the use of countermeasures, to cyberspace activities in peacetime, noting that “few, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold.” It will be interesting to see, therefore, if and how the original positions taken in the Tallinn Manual shift in this new context.\nNotwithstanding the usefulness of analogies with international environmental law, cyberspace really is a different kind of space, perhaps leaving for international law only the relatively limited task of holding States to appropriate standards of diligence. Although consensus has yet to be achieved on the content and limits of these norms as they apply to this unique, virtual ‘ecosystem’, we believe that it is worth teaching an old law new tricks!\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, 28, paras. 7, 11.\n Schmitt, Cyber Operations (note 2), 1.\nTSpace Research Repository\ntspace.library.utoronto.ca\nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO\nLIBRARIES",

We begin by exploring opportunities for borrowing well-established rules of harm prevention and due diligence from the more advanced, but not dissimilar, field of international environmental law. We argue that these rules can provide a legal foundation for the emerging field of international cyber law, and have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. We then draw on the experience of international environmental law with conceptual notions such as ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, as well as with institutional models such as multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies. We highlight the risks and drawbacks of the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a commons in the ‘virtual’ world of cyberspace.\nKEYWORDS: International Environmental Law, Non-State Actors, State Responsibility, Transboundary Harm Prevention, Due Diligence, Global Commons, Shared Resources, Institutional Framework\nI. Introduction\nFor international lawyers, the body of rules that should govern cyberspace and harmful cyber activities is still an emerging field. Much has been written in recent years about the circumstances in which cyber actions by States, or attributable to States, should be considered equivalent to ‘armed attacks’ that might trigger\n The title is borrowed from *Jody Freeman*, Teaching an Old Law New Tricks, The New York Times, 30 May 2014, available at: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/opinion/teaching-an-old-law-new-tricks.html?emc=edit_tv_20140530&amp;nl=opinion&amp;nlid=28076609 (accessed on 3 July 2014) (commenting on the *Ohama* Administration’s recourse to existing clean air legislation in the face of Congress’ failure to regulate greenhouse gas emissions).\n* Professor of Law and Metcalf Chair in Environmental Law, Faculty of Law, University of Toronto.\n** SJD Candidate, University of Toronto Faculty of Law; Research Fellow, Max Planck Institute for International, European and Regulatory Procedural Law.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nanother State’s right to self-defence. But the legal toolkit of the law on the use of force is not appropriate for dealing with the vast majority of ‘cyber attacks’ and, in any case, is not applicable. Many State-controlled cyber attacks remain below the thresholds of the use of force framework, engaging instead the basic rules requiring that States not cause harm to other States or to areas beyond State jurisdiction. Others may amount not to a ‘use of force,’ but to illegal intervention. The legal consequences, as a result, will be governed by the law of State responsibility, not the law on the use of force. The same applies, arguably, in situations in which a cyber attack might be likened to a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter), but not an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 UN Charter. Furthermore, and quite apart from the question whether actions fall within the ambit of the rules on the use of force or another set of rules, many cyber acts are not undertaken by States or their agents, such that States would be directly responsible for them. Rather, a large proportion of such actions are undertaken by non-State actors, who operate within the territories or otherwise under the jurisdiction of various States. It is the legal regime for this wide array of ‘peacetime’ cyber operations that we consider in this chapter, focusing in particular on the primary obligations of States in relation to non-State actions occurring under their jurisdiction.\nIn exploring this terrain, we draw on the evolution and legal building blocks of international environmental law, which we believe holds a number of important lessons for the emerging field of international cyberspace law. International environmental law evolved in a way that is not dissimilar to what is now occurring in relation to cyberspace. When the first environmental problems arose, there existed no specific rules on environmental impacts in international law. Recourse had to be had to the general rules that govern the rights and obligations attached to\n See e.g., Peter Margulies, Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility, Melbourne Journal of International Law 14 (2013), 1; Michael N.

But dealing with international environmental problems often requires cooperation and finely calibrated response measures that can address complex problems and adapt as the problems or human understanding of them and technical capacity to solve them evolve. International environmental law and the emerging field of international cyberspace law are similar also in some important structural respects. Notably, one of the distinctive features of international environmental law is that it must almost always deal with impacts that are generated by private actors. Furthermore, like the potential consequences of cyber activities, environmental consequences of actions in one State are often felt in another State’s territory or in areas beyond State jurisdiction – the ‘commons’.\nHowever, if one were to undertake an assessment of the state of international environmental law in 2014, one might conclude that, at least in some respects, it is coming full circle. In the 1980s and 1990s, the field experienced rapid growth through the emergence of specialised rules and principles, and the subsequent proliferation and progressive expansion of more and more elaborate treaty regimes and treaty-based standard-setting processes relating to a wide array of regional and global issues. Today, new environmental agreements have become a rarity and even the further development of existing regimes through treaty-based international environmental law-making seems to have slowed. Indeed, in the case of the perhaps most complex international environmental challenge – climate change – international environmental law appears to be undergoing a fundamental shift from ‘top-down’ standard-setting to a more flexible, ‘bottom-up’ approach. Whether by coincidence or in response to these patterns, the foundational principles of international environmental law have seen something of a renaissance. In the last few years, States have invoked basic rules concerning transboundary impacts and have turned to international courts and tribunals for clarification of the attendant procedural obligations and due diligence requirements. In other words, some of the recent developments in international environmental law can be traced all the way back to its roots in basic principles concerning sovereign rights and in the iconic cases that developed these principles, such as the *Island of Palmas* arbitration or the *Corfu Channel* case.\n For an overview on this evolution, see *Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey*, Mapping the Field, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2008), 1.\n See *e.g.* *Daniel Bodansky*, A Tale of Two Architectures: The Once and Future U.N.

We first discuss the application of these concepts in the environmental context, considering how they may contribute to the development of norms for the regulation of harmful activities in cyberspace. We will show that the obligations of harm prevention and due diligence have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. Many cyber security and legal scholars, as well as governments and international organisations, have recognised States’ obligation to exercise due diligence in order to prevent cyber activities that are harmful to other States from occurring in their territories. We then turn to the notions of ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, concepts that are prominent in international environmental law but have been controversial or of limited relevance in the cyber context. We discuss them mainly to highlight the potential and risks of efforts to regulate not only harm caused by States to other States in relation to cyberspace, but also harm caused to cyberspace itself as a common resource. Finally, drawing on the experience with the design of multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies, we offer some observations on institutional models, and highlight some of the potential drawbacks of these models in the cyber context. At this point, in any case, multilateral treaty-based regimes are largely absent in the\n See e.g., Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace, International Law Studies 89 (2013), 123, 138; Jan Messerschmidt, Hackback: Permitting Retaliatory Hacking by Non-State Actors as Proportionate Countermeasures to Transboundary Cyberharm, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 52 (2013), 275; Margulies (note 2), 16, 18, 19; Katharina Ziolkowski, Ius ad bellum in Cyberspace – Some Thoughts on the “Schmitt-Criteria” for Use of Force, in: Christian Czosseck/Rain Ottis/Katharina Ziolkowski (eds.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Proceedings (2012), 306, 307; Joanna Kulesza, International Internet Law, Global Change, Peace &amp; Security 24 (2012), 351; Tallinn Manual (note 2), 26–28; Jason Healey/Hannah Pitts, Applying International Environmental Legal Norms to Cyber Statecraft, I/S: A Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society 8 (2012), 356; Matthew E.

We will suggest that the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a 'commons' is unlikely to be feasible or even desirable. Our goal in this chapter is to explore opportunities and post warning signs for those in the 'virtual' world of cyberspace who seek to learn from the 'real' world of international environmental law.\n## II. The No Harm Rule and Related Principles\nOne of the most straightforward approaches to building international cyberspace law may be to apply the legal principles on harm prevention and due diligence to cyberspace issues. These principles are not only well established, but also anchored in foundational principles of international law that are designed to balance competing sovereign interests. For example, in the *Island of Palmas* case, the Arbitrator held that “[t]erritorial sovereignty [...] has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability.” Similarly, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its decision in the *Corfu Channel* case, found that it is “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”\nInternational environmental law, in the absence of specific rules, adapted these general rules to the environmental setting. The salient principles evolved into the proposition that States' rights to use their territories and resources are limited by the obligation to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control do not cause significant transboundary harm. This 'no harm' rule has since been affirmed and fleshed out through a series of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and other international instruments, as well as several arbitral and judicial decisions. The ICJ confirmed in its advisory opinion on the *Legality of the Threat* or\n *Island of Palmas Case* (note 7), 839.\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 7), 22.\n See e.g., *Trail Smelter Case* (USA, Canada), Arbitral Award of 16 April 1938 and 11 March 1941, RIAA III, 1905, 1965; *Lac Lamnac Arbitration* (France, Spain), Arbitral Award of 16 November 1957,\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nUse of Nuclear Weapons that “the general obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States or of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the environment.” The Court reiterated this conclusion in its decision in the Gabilikovo-Nagymaros case and its decision in the Pulp Mills case. The International Law Commission’s (ILC) Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities too confirmed States’ obligation to “take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.”\nThe key point for our present purposes is that looking to international environmental law ultimately means turning to basic principles, applicable to any harm caused to States’ territories, including cyber-related harm, without the need for ‘norm creation’. We believe that this fact alone is a crucial advantage. In addition, international environmental law offers rich State practice and judicial opinions that provide guidance on the nature of the due diligence obligations that flow from the exercise of sovereign rights. Two recent cases are of particular interest in this respect – the ICJ’s Pulp Mills case and the advisory opinion on Activities in the Area of the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS Chamber). The discussion below focuses on the elements of each decision that flesh out the no harm rule with respect to due diligence, the attendant procedural obligations, and the relationship between harm prevention and precaution. As we proceed, we explore the extent to which the approach in international environmental law finds parallels in the emerging international cyberspace law.\nRIAA XII, 281; Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

Harm Prevention and Due Diligence\n1. International Environmental Law and Norm Evolution\nin International Cyberspace Law\nIn the Pulp Mills decision, the ICJ emphasised two important features of the no harm rule. First, it encompasses an obligation to prevent harm. Second, “the principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory.” This obligation to act with due diligence entails “not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators.”\nThe ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion on Activities in the Area, in turn, was concerned with the responsibility of States to take appropriate measures to ensure that private entities operating in the deep seabed do not cause harm in that ‘commons’ area. Perhaps most importantly for present purposes, the Chamber highlighted the contextual nature of the due diligence standard. The Chamber observed that the due diligence standard “may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or technological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity [...] [and] be more severe for the riskier activities.” Due diligence may vary also in light of the capacity of the State concerned, although this point appears to be more controversial. Some leading commentators on international environmental law, citing numerous international instruments that accommodate developing countries’ lesser technological and regulatory capacity, including the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change, compared the flexibility of the due diligence standard to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. However, the ITLOS Chamber made a point of emphasising that different treatment for developed and developing States is warranted only when the underlying international legal obligations provide for it.\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 101.\n Ibid., para. 197.\n ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), para. 117.\n See supra, note 13.\n Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell, International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149.\n ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), paras. 151–163.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nThe general requirement of harm prevention, and its attendant due diligence obligation, has already been recognised as a basis for States' obligations with respect to cyberspace activities. The Ad hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (Advisory Group), established by the Council of Europe, explicitly referred to the use of the no harm principle in the environmental law context, and relied on it to “underline the primary nature of the proposed commitments of a state to prevent, manage and respond to significant transboundary disruption of or interference with the stability, robustness, resilience and openness of the Internet.” Some States have also recognised a general due diligence obligation in cyberspace. The United States (US), for instance, considers cyber security due diligence to be an emerging norm according to which “States should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse,” while recognising that “unique attributes of networked technology require additional work to clarify how these norms apply.” A duty “not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies” was also recognised by China and Russia in 2011. Russia argued for inclusion of a more specific duty to “take all necessary steps to prevent any destructive information action originating from their own territory or using the information infrastructure under their jurisdiction, as well as cooperate to locate the source of computer attacks carried out with the use of their territory, to repel these attacks and to eliminate their consequences” in a proposed international information security convention.\nThe obligation to prevent harm to other States from cyber attacks and other malicious cyber activities conducted in their territories is generally considered to\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 64.\n US International Strategy for Cyberspace (note 9), 10.\n Ibid., 9.\n United Nations General Assembly, Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

These obligations have been distilled from international judicial decisions, such as in the Corfu Channel case, and confirmed by State practice, notably States’ treatment of cyber attacks under their criminal laws, UN and States’ declarations, and the European Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention). Hence, a due diligence duty is seen by some observers as forming part of customary international law also in the cyber context. The duty has also been interpreted as “an obligation to render best efforts, calling for a state to take all ‘reasonable and necessary’ measures in order to prevent a given event, however, without warranting that such an event will not occur.” Some have also argued that an assessment of compliance with this duty would depend on “the conduct of the host-state itself in addressing the potential threat and in attaining a realistic result in light of the factual circumstances.”\nThe Advisory Group considered the due diligence duty to mean, in general terms, that States must “take all appropriate measures at [their] disposal to prevent and minimise foreseeable significant transboundary harm.” The Group further suggested that the obligation could be satisfied by States’ “accession to relevant international law instruments such as the Budapest Convention and participation in their follow up arrangements;” by their participation in “the development and implementation of Internet user education and public awareness programmes; their promotion and facilitation of dialogue with stakeholders as well as other appropriate measures;” and by informing themselves of “factual and legal components that relate to transboundary disruptions or interferences with the\n Matthew J.

Specifically, it noted that “an efficient observance of a due diligence commitment is understood as the implementation of those measures which would be commensurate with the overall capabilities of the country concerned to address the risks,” and that legislative, administrative, or other action necessary to implement a States’ due diligence commitments “should be subject to the capabilities of the state concerned.”\nThe scope of States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations in cyberspace were also considered in the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), a document prepared by an independent international group of experts comprised of practitioners and scholars (Tallinn Manual Group of Experts). While the Manual deals primarily with cyber warfare, it recognises the no harm obligation as a rule of “a general international legal nature” applicable to “the relationship between states, cyber infrastructure, and cyber operations” and extending to “all cyber activities from one State’s territory that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another States’ territory [...] irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State.”\nAgain in keeping with the approach in international environmental law, the Tallinn Manual considers that the no harm prevention and due diligence obligations encompass the requirement that States “use all means at [their] disposal\n Ibid., paras. 71–73.\n Ibid., para. 74.\n Ibid.\n Ibid., para. 77.\n Tallinn Manual (note 2).\n Ibid., 15, 26, 27.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 11\nto require [private entities]” to take remedial action to terminate a harmful activity. The Manual also addresses one important issue that has remained underspecified thus far: the level of harm required to trigger the harm prevention duty. In international environmental law, the *Trail Smelter Case* posited a “serious consequence” standard with respect to transboundary air pollution, although today a “significant harm” standard, intended to exclude *de minimis* harm, is more common. The Tallinn Manual only requires a “negative effect” to result from the cyberspace activity, which need not involve physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals. However, the Manual does not specify what harm *would* be considered as having a sufficiently “negative effect” in this context.\n## 2. Areas of Controversy\nIt appears then that the duty to prevent harm and the due diligence obligation are already informing the cyberspace discourse, thereby eliminating, at least in part, the need to ‘reinvent the wheel’ with regard to the regulation of harmful conduct in cyberspace. However, while the relevance of these principles in the cyberspace context has been widely recognised, their precise nature and scope remain contested, and therefore in need of further development and clarification. In this regard, there appears to be several broad areas of controversy, all related in one way or another to the challenges of attribution and to questions surrounding how heavy a harm prevention burden to place on States in relation to non-State activities. After all, hackers and other cyber actors can draw from a rich menu of options for concealing their identities and evading attribution.\nHence, some have doubted the political as well as practical feasibility of no harm and due diligence obligations of States in the cyberspace context, as opposed to reliance on the stringent requirements of the law of State responsibility for direct attribution of harmful actions to States. A viable due diligence framework, some\n *Ibid.*, 28, para. 9.\n *Healey/Pitts* (note 8), 378.\n ILC Draft Articles Transboundary Harm (note 16), 41–42.\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 5.\n For example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets can be intercepted or spoofed mid-route, making it difficult to trace them back to their source. Alternatively, reliance on “botnets”, robot networks of malware-infected personal computers, allows attackers to remain anonymous by assuming the identity of someone else in order to perform malicious actions. See *Shackelford/Andres* (note 2), 982 and *Mauno Pibelgas*, Back-Tracing and Anonymity in Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 28), 46, 47. We are grateful to *Alex Ognihone* for assisting us with this point.\n *Ziolkowski* (note 8), 307.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nargue, may be difficult to achieve as “it is unclear that any state is prepared (politically or technologically) to take full responsibility for all harm emanating from gateway routers, very small aperture terminals [...] wireless mobile devices, and other devices within its territory or jurisdiction.” Therefore, States may not be willing to agree on criteria for a more expansive regime of indirect responsibility for non-State actors’ cyber activities, based on the ‘no harm’ principle. In short, it may seem sensible and even self-evident that States should enact and enforce criminal laws regarding cross-border cyber attacks, in line with the ICJ’s finding in *Pulp Mills* that diligence requires States to “adopt appropriate rules and measures” and “take all appropriate measures to enforce” them. But it may be exceedingly difficult to define in a concrete and also manageable manner what exactly are “appropriate” standards and efforts to prevent harm from cyber attacks and other hostile acts. And, even if agreed, such a general standard may not suffice. “Because of the speed with which cyber weapons could be deployed,” some observers claim, “relying only upon cyber due diligence presents too great a risk of intrusion by unfriendly actors.” This challenge is further complicated by “the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character,” as well as precisely “the ease with which deception can be mounted through cyber infrastructure,” which may make it impossible for a State to prevent injury to another State.\nSome interpretations of due diligence in cyberspace have attempted to take the unique nature of cyber acts into account. For instance, the Advisory Group has limited the applicability of States’ “due diligence commitments of prevention, management and response” to situations where the State is the actual operator or manager of critical internet resources. Where it is not, the Group suggests that “the principle of subsidiarity or non-involvement of states in the ordinary administration of the network or operational issues” prevails, recognising the fact that “the private sector takes the lead in the day-to-day operations of the\n *Sean Kanuck*, Sovereign Discourse on Cyber Conflict Under International Law, Texas Law Review (Tex.

While the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts agreed that the obligations would be triggered if a State had “actual knowledge” of the acts in question, it could not agree on whether they would also obtain if a State had only “constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge,” for instance where a State fails to use due care in policing cyber activities on its territory and is therefore unaware of the acts.59 Some have argued that “a state’s duty to prevent cyber attacks should not be based on a state’s knowledge of a particular cyber attack before it occurs, but rather on its actions to prevent cyber attacks in general,” since such attacks are “extremely difficult for host-states to detect prior to the commission of a specific attack.”60 While this approach would be in line with the general thrust of the harm prevention and due diligence obligations as they have developed in international environmental law, it has been criticised for going too far in reducing the knowledge requirement in the cyber context.61 Others have contended that “presumptive knowledge is sufficient to trigger the duty” if the cyber attack can reasonably be considered to belong to a series of cyber attacks” originating from a State’s territory.62 The position of the Advisory Group in this regard is close to the stance of international environmental law; it is that “the disruption and interference should be foreseeable and the state concerned must know or should have known under the circumstances that the given activity involved a risk of significant consequences.”63\n\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nFinally, and relatedly, there seems to be a lack of consensus regarding the precise scope of the no harm and due diligence obligations in cyberspace. Notably, given the “difficulty of mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats,” the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts could not agree on whether or not these general obligations should be applied to “situations in which the relevant acts are merely prospective” as opposed to those that are already underway. In other words, the Group could not agree on a general precautionary duty of States to undertake all appropriate measures with regard to potential cyber threats at an early stage and before a concrete risk of harm occurs, a concept with roots in international environmental law that we discuss in more detail below. Furthermore, the Group could not reach a consensus on the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations to States through which cyber operations merely transit, in light of the “unique routing processes of cyber transmissions.” By contrast, certain scholars have suggested that “reasonable measures to prevent [...] prospective acts are required” and that even a mere transit State “has an obligation to prevent a cyber attack.” However, there is no consensus on this issue as of yet.\nThese contentious issues, among others, must be resolved in order for the no harm principle to effectively regulate activities in cyberspace. International consensus should be achieved on the general content and limits of the due diligence standard applicable to cyberspace. Agreement is also needed on the relationship between States’ responsibility for failure to take diligent harm prevention measures and their responsibility for non-State acts directly attributable to them under the law of State responsibility. Arguably, both types of responsibility obtain, and each applies to a distinct type of ‘failure’ by a State. But, absent consensus on the issue, developing an effective normative and regulatory framework for cyberspace on the basis of the duty to prevent harm and the law of State responsibility will be difficult. With the caveats noted above, the development of these principles in the environmental context, and particularly the contextual approach adopted by the ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion, may be\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 7.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 169.\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 28, 29, para. 12.\n Pirker (note 29), 208.\n Ibid., 209.\n Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 137, 138.\n Kirsch (note 2), 638; Kanuck (note 48), 1592; Kulesza, State Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks on International Peace and Security (note 8), 151; Gary Brown/Keira Poellet, The Customary International Law of Cyberspace, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 126, 141.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 15\nhelpful in this regard. Applying such an approach in the cyberspace context could allow for a flexible, contextual application of the due diligence standard. One might also envision a contextual interpretation of the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility in accordance with new technological developments and the evolving nature of cyberspace. However, as in the debates surrounding the attribution of non-State actor conduct for the purposes of the law on the use of force, many States and other observers will likely have misgivings about modifying (and thereby potentially eroding) what is meant to be a general framework for specific purposes. The due diligence standard is therefore likely to be the most promising conceptual hook for the necessary fine-tuning; the precise contours of this standard could change over time and in accordance with the gravity of the transboundary cyber harm caused.\n## B. Procedural Obligations\nThe no harm rule entails a series of procedural obligations, including the obligation to notify or warn potentially affected States, the obligation to exchange information, to consult and negotiate, and the general obligation to cooperate to prevent harm. The Pulp Mills case confirms that these procedural obligations, on the one hand, have a separate existence as customary norms (that can be violated on their own terms – even when harm is ultimately not caused), and, on the other hand, are implied in the substantive obligation to prevent environmental harm (e.g. a State may have to notify or consult with another about potential harm in order to meet its obligation of diligent harm prevention).\nIn the cyberspace context, similar cooperative requirements and processes have been emphasised in light of its rapidly changing technological nature, its “global character”, and because protection from cyber threats requires “collaborative relationships for exchanging cyber defense data and an ability to establish trusted relationships.” Accordingly, the duty to cooperate has been considered to be\n ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 7).\n Lac Lamocx Arbitration (note 13).\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 145 (tracing the obligation to cooperate to the good faith principle in international law).\n ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), paras. 78, 79.\n Rolf Weber, Future Design of Cyberspace Law, Journal of Politics and Law 5 (2012), 1.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 177.\n Diego Vázquez et al., Conceptual Framework for Cyber Defense Information Sharing within Trust Relationships, in: Czosseck/Ottis/Ziolkowski (eds.) (note 8), 2012, 4th International\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nrelevant as a general principle of international law, as well as a legal obligation of States in the arena of cyber security. Reliance on traditional means of international cooperation in areas such as cybercrime, however, has been viewed as incapable of offering the timely response needed. Therefore, new cooperative mechanisms have been developed in this context, such as the 24/7 international assistance network established under the Budapest Convention for investigations and evidence collection concerning cybercrime.\nThis broad duty to cooperate has been recognised as part and parcel of the obligation to prevent harm in the cyberspace context. It includes the obligation to undertake a risk assessment, to exchange information, to inform, notify, and consult other States in concrete cases of risk of significant transboundary harm, and to cooperate “with the victim-states of cyber attacks that originated from within their borders” during investigations and prosecutions. The Advisory Group, for instance, stated as general requirements that “States should co-operate mutually, in good faith and in consultation with each other and with concerned stakeholders at all stages of designing and implementing policies in relation to the Internet,” and “should take all reasonable measures to provide prior and timely notification and relevant information to states that may be potentially affected.” These requirements envision “participation of states within whose jurisdiction disruptions or interferences with the Internet stability, robustness and resilience may originate, and states likely to be affected or actually affected, in action aimed at prevention of, preparedness for and response to risks and threats to critical Internet resources.”\nConference on Cyber Conflict Proceedings (NATO CCD COE Publications 2012), 429.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 75.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 177, 178.\n United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime: Draft (February 2013), xi, available at: http://www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Art. 35; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Internet, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. VI (2012), 227.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 186.\n Ibid., 169; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 376.\n Sklerov (note 29), 62; Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 135.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 18.\n Ibid., 21.\n Ibid., para. 75.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 17\nIn more practical terms, the Advisory Group noted that States should, in particular, “co-operate in the creation of public awareness about the risks and opportunities of cross border Internet traffic and the development of educational tools to enable citizens to share responsibilities for a safer Internet,” as well as take legislative action in order to overcome barriers to international cooperation. Moreover, “states may establish mechanisms that are suitable for monitoring the implementation of their preparedness and prevention commitments in respect of disruptions and interference with the infrastructure of the Internet.” The Advisory Group also set out detailed standards for information exchange and coordinated action, some of which were explicitly ‘borrowed’ from the international environmental context. These include the development of common rules and practices for information sharing, incident reporting, and for deploying internet resilience technologies; timely notification of transboundary risks and vulnerabilities; assessment of possible or actual adverse transboundary effects; coordination of emergency and response policies; and mutual consultations and assistance. Some of these obligations have also been included in the Budapest Convention.\nThe reality remains, however, that some States from which cyber attacks originate refuse to accept responsibility or cooperate with investigations, that a clear framework for effective and timely exchange of information on critical infrastructure protection is lacking, and that outside the realm of cyber crime there has been little international cooperation in reducing the transboundary impact of malicious activities in cyberspace. Since States continue to have “wide discretion as to how to fulfill the legal obligation to cooperate in the cyber realm,” there is a clear need for consensus to be reached on a uniform standard for cooperation. Such consensus, moreover, cannot include only States. In light of the dominant role of the private sector and civil society in internet governance, a multi-stakeholder approach must be applied in the discussion and formulation of\n Ibid., paras. 76, 79.\n Ibid., para. 80.\n Ibid., para. 93.\n Ibid., paras. 91–102.\n Such as mutual assistance, see Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Chapter III.\n Kirsch (note 2), 638.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 91.\n Heaby/Pitts (note 8), at 366.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 178.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nprocedural obligations such as the duty to cooperate. This approach requires public-private collaboration, including internet service provider assistance, as well as data exchanges and partnerships, to form part of any international legal framework or standard for cyberspace cooperation.\n## C. Precaution\nIn the environmental context, at least, due diligence also appears to have become a conceptual bridge between the duty to prevent harm and the proposition that States, in certain circumstances, also must take precautionary measures. As traditionally conceived, the no harm rule is engaged when there is a known or objectively determined risk of significant environmental harm. By contrast, the precautionary principle, as articulated in Principle 15 Rio Declaration, is triggered by ‘threats of serious or irreversible damage’ and its lower evidentiary threshold could strengthen the protective potential of international environmental law. However, debate persists among States and academic commentators as to the precise contents of the principle, and whether or not it has acquired customary law status. International courts and tribunals, while acknowledging the wisdom of precautionary approaches to environmental protection, have avoided pronouncing on its legal status.\nThe ITLOS Chamber, in the *Activities in the Area* advisory opinion, suggested that there was a trend “towards making [the precautionary] approach part of customary international law,” and observed that it “is also an integral part of the general obligation of due diligence.” This obligation requires States “to take all\n---\n Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, *Principles of International Internet Law*, German Law Journal 11 (2010), 1245, 1261, 1262.\n *Eneken Tikk*, *Establishing Rules for Cyber Security*, in: Scott Jasper (ed.), *Conflict and Cooperation in the Global Commons* (2012), 222–224.\n See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 153.\n Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 15.\n See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 154–164.\n See ICJ, *Gablikoro-Nagymaros* (note 15), para. 140; id., *Pulp Mills* (note 15), paras. 164, 185.

As such it would seem to be highly relevant to the cyber context. Indeed, it has been suggested that States are obliged “to take (general) precautionary measures with regard to potential cyber threats posing a significant risk of damage of a transboundary nature.” This obligation has also been said to form part of States’ due diligence obligation in this context, and to include “the duty to undertake all appropriate regulatory measures at an early stage, and well before the (concrete) risk of harm occurs,” although the precise degree of knowledge of such a risk required from States in order to trigger the duty, as already mentioned, remains controversial. Precautionary measures in this context would include “the implementation of strategic, political, organisational, administrative, legal and technical measures [...] aimed at general prevention” of misuse of cyberspace for malicious activities by non-State actors, although what precisely such measures would entail remains to be clarified by “future State practice.” Such State practice can be seen, for instance, in recent domestic legislative initiatives attempting to impose a legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n The ITLOS Chamber may have spelled out what the ICJ merely alluded to in its *Gablōkoon-Nagymarus* and *Pulp Mills* decisions by noting that ‘in the field of environmental protection, vigilance and prevention are required on account of the often irreversible character of damage and of the limitations inherent in the very mechanism of reparation of this type of damage’.

Finally, precautionary principles also form part of the ‘good neighborliness’ principle, which in the environmental law context is said to include “the duty to cooperate in investigating, identifying, and avoiding environmental harm.” This principle has also been applied to cyberspace in the form of an obligation “to take preventive and precautionary measures” with regard to cyber threats, as well as “to inform, notify, and consult in concrete cases of risk of significant transboundary harm.”\nIt is interesting to note the different approaches taken by the Advisory Group and the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts in this regard. A “precautionary approach” was expressly recognised by the Advisory Group, which considered the identification, assessment, and notification of possible or actual risks of adverse transboundary effects on the internet, and the prior and timely notification of such risks, to form part of States’ prevention obligation in cyberspace. The Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, as we have already noted, adopted a more conservative approach and did not encompass prospective acts or acts of which States ‘should have known’ in the obligation to prevent cyber harm to other States. Therefore, while both groups of experts seem to agree on the basic need for States to exercise due diligence in order to prevent transboundary cyber harm, their interpretations of the nature and scope of these obligations diverge.\nOne possible explanation for this divergence is the different nature, purpose, and mandate of each of these groups of experts. The Advisory Group, comprised of European experts in fields such as law, information, and telecommunications, was set up by the Steering Committee on the Media and New Communication Service of the Council of Europe. It was instructed to examine “the shared or mutual responsibilities of states in ensuring that critical Internet resources are managed in the public interest and as a public asset” and “make proposals [...] relating to the prevention and management of events [...] falling within member states’ jurisdictions or territories, which could block or significantly impede Internet access [...] with the objective of guaranteeing the ongoing functioning and universal nature and integrity of the Internet.” The mandate of the Advisory\n Robin Geiß/Henning Lehmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

In so doing, it focused on States’ due diligence and procedural obligations while excluding such controversial issues as State responsibility, cyber warfare, and countermeasures.\nThe Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, on the other hand, was comprised of both European and non-European legal and technical experts (but all from Western States), many of whom with experience or expertise related to armed conflict, national defence, or security policy. It was set up by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, an international military organisation, and tasked with producing “a manual on the law governing cyber warfare.” Accordingly, the Manual explicitly excluded any detailed discussion of cyber activities “that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.” While it addressed the application of general international legal rules to cyberspace in times of peace, including States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations, the focus of the Manual was on cyber warfare and the application of international laws of armed conflict to it. Having to decide on such controversial issues, which were avoided by the Advisory Group, as well as the background of some of the experts in the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, may have influenced the tone of the Manual and its perspective, resulting in a more conservative and narrow stance with respect to States’ obligations in cyberspace. As one commentator noted, “the Experts were very cautious to avoid taking any risks when drafting the rules” and, since unanimity was required to formulate the rules, “the most controversial international law aspects of cyber operations were therefore left unresolved.”\nThe different approaches taken by the Advisory Group and the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts reflect some of the underlying disagreements and confusion that\n The Advisory Group explicitly drew a distinction between States’ commitments to prevent and manage cross-border disruptions of or interferences with the internet and international law rules governing responsibility for internationally wrongful acts, Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 20, para. 85.\n See “the international group of experts and participants” in the Tallinn Manual (note 2), x–xiii.\n Although the Tallinn Manual does not represent the views of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, its sponsoring nations, or NATO, Tallinn Manual (note 2), 11.\n Ibid., (note 2), at 1.\n Ibid., 4.\n It has been suggested, for instance, that there may be an overtly close connection between the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts and the military and a potential resulting bias in the substance of the Manual, Pirkor (note 29), 190.\n Marco Rossini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (2014), 31.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\npersist in the cyberspace context with regard to States' harm prevention and due diligence obligations, what precisely these obligations entail, and when they apply. Some doctrine emanating from the US, as well as European politicians and international law scholars, view cyberspace as \"the fifth battlefield\" and therefore, like the Tallinn Manual, emphasise States' obligations in terms of use of force, self-defence, and countermeasures, rather than in terms of harm prevention and due diligence. An opposite view is that said to be represented by the Advisory Group, which \"holds that states are obliged to observe due diligence in preventing cyber attacks and they may only be held responsible for a cyber attack if it can be demonstrated that they have failed to meet the due diligence standard.\"\n## III. Cyberspace as a Global Commons or a Shared Resource?\nIn the environmental context, it is accepted that States have an obligation to prevent harm to the territory of another State, or to areas beyond national control – global commons. However, the full legal ramifications of this ‘commons’ aspect of the harm prevention obligation are far from settled. Notably, there is no direct State practice on the question of who can invoke a State’s responsibility for harm to the commons. When it comes to applying the rules concerning harm to the commons to cyberspace, a prior question looms large: Is cyberspace a ‘commons’ in the first place? Alternatively, might it be a ‘shared resource’ of States?\nSome have identified the cyber domain as a global commons, together with the high seas, air, and space, and view these as “domains that are not controlled by any single state” but are rather “universally needed and thus should be shared.” The Advisory Group, for instance, regarded “critical Internet resources” as global commons “under the stewardship of the international Internet community as a whole.” The US and Japan have also regarded cyberspace as a global commons;\n Kulesza, International Internet Law (note 8), 359–360.\n See Stockholm Declaration (note 13), Principle 21; Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 2. And see ICJ, Legality of Nuclear Weapons (note 14), para. 29; id., Gabilikovo-Nagymaros (note 15), para. 53; and id., Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 101.\n Jutta Brunnée, Common Areas, Common Heritage, Common Concern, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.) (note 5), 550.\n Mika Aaltola/Joonas Sipilä/Valteri Vuorisalo, Securing Global Commons: A Small State Perspective, The Finnish Institute of International Affairs, Working Paper 71 (June 2011), 9, available at: http://www.fiia.fi/en/publication/198/securing_global_commons/ (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 14.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 23\nindeed, according to the US, “the global commons consist of international waters and airspace, space, and cyberspace.”\nHowever, the notion of cyberspace as a global commons poses both definitional and conceptual difficulties. From a definitional, or practical, perspective, the cyber domain is distinguishable from the other global commons on account of being a human creation and involving both physical infrastructure located in national territories and intangible features that transcend territorial borders. Furthermore, unlike the sea, Antarctica, and outer space, “there is a ‘population’ or community in cyberspace and [...] [it] is not an entirely independent international space or concern that is beyond national regulation.” According to some observers, in order for cyberspace to become a global commons, “long-established rights of sovereignty and property ownership recognized by the numerous domestic jurisdictions involved” in cyberspace would have to be overridden and legitimate and illegitimate users would have to be positively identified for the enforcement of norms or collective solutions. Neither of these conditions is currently satisfied in the cyberspace context.\nFrom a conceptual perspective, the identification of cyberspace as a global commons has thus far failed to clarify States’ obligations. The Advisory Group, for instance, emphasised the need for harm to be caused to another State, rather than to cyberspace as a resource, in order to trigger States’ obligations, notwithstanding its explicit reference to the internet as a global commons. Moreover, the global commons concept does not necessarily make cyberspace any easier to regulate. It has been argued, for instance, that while in the context of other global commons, users have “successfully self-organized for sustainable use of a commons” in the absence of government control, in the case of cyberspace the “affordances of the cyber technologies — that is, the way the technologies enable their use — and the mentalities of the users” have resulted in a “tragedy of the commons” that prevents effective self-organisation for sustainable use of\n United States Department of Defense, The Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support (2005), 12, available at: https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=454976 (accessed on 23 October 2015); Ziolkowski (note 29), 183.\n Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 22–23.\n Kam Wai Chik, ‘Customary internet-ional law’: Creating a body of customary law for cyberspace, Part 1: Developing rules for transitioning custom into law, Computer Law &amp; Security Review 26 (2010), 3, 13.\n Kanuck (note 48), 1577, 1579.\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 69.\n Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 23.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ncyberspace. The concept of cyberspace as a commons, therefore, does not seem to have contributed much to the development of clear norms to regulate its use, and may even hinder this process.\nSome academic observers have warned against what they view as a gradual move away from the perception of cyberspace as a global commons and toward a State-based governance regime, considering it to constitute “norm regression” in the global governance of cyberspace. But however intuitive it may seem to think of cyberspace as a type of commons, the idea remains controversial and in any event would not necessarily advance the effort to develop norms for the regulation of cyberspace, such as the duty to prevent harm. Even in the environmental context, the legal status of spaces or resources beyond the exclusive jurisdiction of States tends to be controversial. Aside from well-established examples of geographic areas like the high seas, Antarctica, or outer space, States have avoided the ‘commons’ label, precisely because it implies both the absence of sovereignty and certain collective rights and obligations.\nOne might alternatively consider the potential relevance of the notion of ‘shared resource’. This concept certainly fits key aspects of cyberspace, perhaps better than the notion of a ‘commons’, because it applies to resources that are under the jurisdiction of States but are quintessentially transboundary in nature. This paradigm permits States that share such a resource to devise norms and rules that take into account their respective sovereign interests, their mutual interests in the use and protection of the resource, and their obligations under international law. In the environmental context, States have often avoided using this umbrella concept, arguably because of the implication of less than full sovereignty and the broader implications the concept might have for other resources, and have used more issue-specific concepts, like ‘international watercourse’.\n Roger Hurwitz, Depleted Trust in the Cyber Commons, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 20, 21; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 366.\n But see Scott Shackelford, Toward Cyberpeace: Managing Cyberattacks Through Polycentric Governance, American University Law Review 62 (2013), 1273, 1293 (suggesting that cyberspace be treated as ‘pseudocommons’, “comprised of a shared global infrastructure that is controlled by public and private entities subject to national and international regulations”).\n Ronald Deibert/Masashi Crets-Nishibata, Global Governance and the Spread of Cyberspace Controls, Global Governance 18 (2012), 341, 343, 345; Joanna Kuleczy/Roy Balleste, Signs and Portents in Cyberspace: The Rise of Jus Internet as a New Order in International Law, Fordham Intellectual Property, Media and Entertainment Law Journal 23 (2013), 1320.\n Brunnie, Common Areas, Common Heritage, Common Concern (note 132).\n See Jutta Brunnie/Stephen Toupe, Environmental Security and Freshwater Resources: Ecosystem Regime Building, American Journal of International Law 91 (1997), 26; Kanuck (note 48), 1580.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 25\nNonetheless, this conception could be helpful in relation to cyberspace since it would allow States to maintain certain sovereign rights, although these would not be absolute and would be balanced against the interests of other States and the international community. While the concept of ‘shared resource’ is not a panacea for the difficulties already discussed with respect to defining and applying the no harm and due diligence obligations to cyberspace, it has been suggested that such a tailored model may present an alternative avenue for establishing States’ legal obligation to cooperate in this context through such principles as the sustainable and equitable use of shared resources. These principles may encourage States to undertake all necessary means in order to preserve the internet for future generations, which implies a proactive countering of cyber threats, an obligation to take precautionary measures, and restraint from any action that could hamper the availability and reliability of the internet. In short, a ‘shared resource’ model could promote stewardship in cyberspace, rather than sovereignty. While it may not resolve fundamental definitional issues, such a model could provide an alternative conceptual framework that shifts the focus from States’ obligations to each other to States’ obligations to cyberspace as a shared resource, thereby facilitating the development of norms and rules for its governance.\n## IV. Institutional Frameworks\nIt has been said that “there are structural similarities between the milieus of international law and of the Internet: neither is completely hierarchical and both must deal with ‘commons’ problems.” Whether the future cyberspace governance regime will be grounded in the no harm and due diligence framework or in a ‘commons’ framework that may evolve over time, an additional question concerns the appropriate process for developing and maintaining the attendant normative and regulatory framework. International environmental law offers some models for governance regimes, and we thus turn to an examination of its normative and regulatory structures.\n Ibid., 1580.\n Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 179–181.\n See Duncan Hollis, Stewardship versus Sovereignty?

International Environmental Governance\nIn the environmental context, so-called framework agreements have played a prominent role. They help in dealing with complex, evolving issues by allowing parties to begin by defining the common concern at hand, agreeing on principles to guide States’ actions, and establishing institutions and decision-making procedures for subsequent regime-development.^[150]^\nMany environmental regimes create, or collaborate with, bodies that facilitate exchange among scientific or technical experts. Such bodies are important in building consensus around the nature of collective concerns and the collective action that is required to address them. Scientific or technical expert bodies also make important contributions in the further elaboration, refinement, or adjustment of regulatory strategies.^[151]^ In the cyber context one could easily see the usefulness of such an approach, for example in relation to the constantly shifting needs of cyber security and the related due diligence standards. Environmental regime development *per se* is usually in the hands of a plenary body, which facilitates regular, long-term engagements between technical experts, policy-makers, lawyers, and relevant non-State actors (international organisations, non-governmental organisations, or business entities).^[152]^ Although, in a formal sense, law-making remains in the hands of States, non-State actors can provide input into law-making processes or even help shape their outcomes.^[153]^\nEnvironmental standard-setting itself occurs through decisions of plenary bodies, without subsequent formal consent by individual States. In most cases, the resulting standards are not legally binding, notwithstanding the mandatory language they may contain.^[154]^ This approach facilitates agreement on collective action and standards that are applicable to all parties – an important feature for efforts to address collective concerns. Equally important is that soft regulatory processes enable speedier regime development and adjustment than processes that require subsequent ratification by individual States. In the cyber context both of these features could be significant, since (as in the environmental context) cyber\n^[150]^ See *Jutta Brunnée*, Toward Effective International Environmental Law – Trends and Developments, in: Steven Kennett (ed.), Law and Process in Environmental Management (1993), 222–229.\n^[151]^ For a detailed discussion, see *ead*, Coping with Consent: Lawmaking under Multilateral Environmental Agreements, Leiden Journal of International Law 15 (2002), 1.\n^[152]^ *Ibid.*, 15, 16.\n^[153]^ *Ibid.*, 14.\n^[154]^ *Ibid.*, 25, 26.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 27\nproblems, or relevant technical understanding or capacity, as well as political dynamics, typically evolve over time, often rapidly.\nWith respect to treaty making, the experience with MEAs shows that even an apparently straightforward matter as agreeing on the nature and scope of the underlying concern and the principles that should govern it may be fraught with difficulties. In the climate context, for example, it took more than twenty years for parties to agree on the precise meaning of the regime objective – to forestall dangerous climate change – and parties are still struggling to achieve consensus on the parameters of one of the regime’s core principles, the notion of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities’. On the latter concept, the positions of developed and developing countries have diverged quite dramatically, with some developing countries continuing to insist that developed countries shoulder the primary burdens of addressing climate change. To be sure, the claims of ‘historical responsibility’ that developing countries have leveled against developed countries in relation to global carbon emissions will have no comparable basis in the cyber context. Still, a global regime-building effort in the cyber context, could also invite arguments by developing countries that States’ common responsibilities should be differentiated so as to lessen their burden or entitle them to technical or financial assistance. It seems sensible, even inevitable; to assist less developed countries in addressing the underlying common concern. In fact, most MEAs today do provide for various kinds of assistance, including through multilateral funds designed to finance conversion to new technologies or otherwise address capacity limitations. But it is highly unlikely that major States, such as the US, will be any more inclined to accept formal differentiation or assistance obligations in the cyber context than they have been in the climate context (which is not to say ‘no assistance’). Finally, experience with MEAs, especially the climate regime, also shows the potential pitfalls of treaty-based standard-setting. The need for agreement by a significant majority of parties (typically 3/4) and the common practice of consensus decision-making can easily stall progress or result\n See Jutta Brunnée/Stephen Toupe, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (2010), Chapter 4.\n See Jutta Brunnée/Charlotte Streck, The UNFCCC as a Negotiating Forum: Towards Common but more Differentiated Responsibilities, Climate Policy 13 (2013), 589.\n For an overview, see Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, Technical and Financial Assistance, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.) (note 5), 947.\n It is precisely this dimension of the principle that prompted the United States to declare that Principle 7 Rio Declaration (one prominent articulation of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’) did not ‘imply a recognition or acceptance by the United States of any international obligations or liabilities, or any diminution of the responsibilities of developing countries under international law’, see UN Report of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg, South Africa, 26 August – 4 September 2002, UN Doc. A/CONF.199/20 (2002), 145.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nin lowest-common-denominator standard-setting, a concern that has been raised also in the cyber context and will be further discussed below.\n## B. International Cyberspace Governance\nAs with the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations, standard-setting bodies and multilateral agreements for cyberspace governance already exist or are being created. Their precise scope, authority, and norm-developing processes, however, remain unclear and may therefore benefit from considering the environmental governance experience.\nThere are many intergovernmental organisations, both specialised and general, that address different aspects of cyberspace regulation, however their ability to constitute, or form the foundation for, a universal normative or regulatory regime for cyberspace is doubtful. In terms of technical standard-setting, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a UN specialised agency, has been active “with regard to International Public Policy Issues Pertaining to the Internet and the Management of Internet Resources, including Domain Names and Addresses.” However, it has been criticised for being unable to adjust to the rapid changes in the cyberspace environment, being potentially unrepresentative of the views of all of its members, and being ill-equipped to regulate other, non-technical, areas of cyberspace such as international and criminal law. Similarly, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regards “[p]reserving and enhancing the operational stability, reliability, security, and global interoperability of the Internet” as one of its core objectives, and makes binding decisions and policies on various, mostly technical, internet-related issues. However, its powers continue to be largely derived from, and dependant on, the US government; it has therefore been criticised for essentially being a State actor rather than an “international organization with a fully democratic legitimation.”\n---\n See discussion in *Brunnée/Tonpe*, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law (note 155).\n *Sabine von Schorlemer*, Telecommunications, International Regulation, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International LawMPEPIL, Vol. IX (2012), 818 et seq.\n *Ibid.*\n *David Gross et al.*, Cyber Security Governance: Existing Structures, International Approaches and the Private Sector, in: Lord/Sharp (eds.) (note 162), 114, 116.\n *Woltag* (note 81).\n *Ibid.*\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 29\nThese essentially technical bodies, moreover, lack any formal law-making ability. Nonetheless, they have become increasingly politicised, and “distrust by some nations may prevent them from making and enforcing any unilateral policy determinations going forward.” As for more general intergovernmental and regional organisations active in the cyberspace arena, such as the European Union (EU), Council of Europe, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, NATO, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and others, their activities with respect to cyberspace norm-development include issuing reports, organising conferences and summits, devising and promoting policies and conventions, and establishing working groups. However, the respective responsibilities of these organisations, as well as their standard-setting authority, remain unclear; there is often little cooperation among them; and their efforts have been conflicting at times.\nThe limited utility of these bodies for cyberspace norm-creation arguably stems from the lack of international consensus on their precise role in cyberspace governance and the appropriate institutional character of any future regulatory regime. At the 2003 and 2005 World Summits on the Information Society (WSIS I and II), for instance, some developed countries, led by the US, adopted a ‘non-governmental’ approach and regarded the private sector influence and in particular the mandate of ICANN as sufficient for regulatory purposes. A majority of developing countries, including China, however, called for a ‘government-centered’ approach involving intergovernmental management of the internet, for example by the ITU. It was ultimately decided to maintain the existing governance system, while establishing a new Internet Governance Forum (IGF) within the UN for\n As well as others, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the Internet Society (ISOC), the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n Deibert/Crete-Nishibata (note 141), 346, 347; Gross et al.

The EU and the US continue to object to ITU governance of the internet, despite growing calls for “an equal role and responsibility for international Internet governance” for all governments, and the IGF remains merely a forum for discussion, without any powers of supervision or decision-making. As a result, there is still no effective institutional authority that is universally accepted. Ultimately, it has been said that any intergovernmental institution or regime established to regulate and govern cyberspace must have sufficient expertise and technical capability for norm-creation, be perceived as having sufficient legitimacy by the international community, and be able to generate “both high level and specific behavioral norms that are widely accepted as legitimate.”\nA possible alternative to an intergovernmental or non-governmental regulatory institution is a treaty-based regime resembling the one established with respect to climate change. The development of such a regime was attempted, for instance, with respect to the regulation of cyber crime through the creation of the Budapest Convention. However, the Convention has only been ratified by 47 States thus far, and is unlikely to be universally adopted since many nations view it as a ‘European’ document. Multilateral treaties to regulate certain aspects of cyberspace, including cyber security, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, have also been suggested by scholars, as well as States such as Russia.

It is not clear as of yet whether this apparent shift, notably in the UN climate change regime, reflects significant and lasting structural change in international environmental treaty making from ‘top-down’ to ‘bottom-up’ approaches.[181] At any rate, in the cyberspace context, treaty-based standard-setting and norm-creation already has been criticised for being too ‘top-down’ for the needs of the medium and, as in the environmental context, as likely to suffer from the “lowest common denominator effect.”[182] Also, creating a multilateral treaty on cyberspace regulation is bound to be a protracted process, and some observers suggest that “an adequate legal framework is only realisable if the foundation is done on an informal law-making basis.”[183] Such informal law-making efforts have in fact been attempted, for instance by China, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, who in 2011 submitted to the UN a proposal for an international code of conduct for information security.[184] While this initiative has since been discussed in various international forums,[185] its viability is doubtful in light of objections by the US and\n\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nmost Western countries to its State-centric model for internet governance. It seems, therefore, that before any international regulatory regime can be devised, a conceptual framework for cyberspace governance must be agreed upon, on the basis of which such a regime could function.\nIt is possible that such a framework could be created around the protection of cyberspace itself, for instance by adopting the notion of a ‘commons’ or ‘shared resource’ regime as discussed above, or in the form of a multilateral treaty regime for the prevention of transboundary impacts, such as that established under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention). The LRTAP Convention, one of the earliest MEAs, has been successful in facilitating preventive regulation and integrated policy-making based on scientific assessments and economic modeling. As one commentator has noted, “experience with multilateral environmental treaties has shown that investigation and monitoring can be important tools underlying a dynamic regulatory framework that can adapt to changes in levels of risk identified.” In the case of the LRTAP Convention, this ‘science-policy interaction’ has been successful in achieving emission reductions of air pollutants in light of such factors as: the direct link between relevant science and policy preparation; multiple scenarios that present policy options; accessibility of science to all participants; a framework offered for countries to provide their own data; the consensus based way of working; and the ability to adapt scientific and policy frameworks to developments in science and policy. Devising a treaty regime along the lines of the LRTAP Convention model may be particularly useful in the cyberspace context, which is similarly dynamic and scientific/technical in nature.\nHowever, it seems fair to say that the development of such a conceptual framework or treaty regime is unlikely to be successful at this point in time. This type of norm-building effort would have to overcome several obstacles, quite apart from State security interests. These range from States’ general reluctance to declare\nhttp://www.unidir.org/files/files/TH_Madrid_21Mar14.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n UNIDIR High-Level Seminar (note 185), 3; Roger Hurwitz, A New Normal?

As already mentioned, such reluctance is evident in the disagreements concerning the allocation of a greater governance role to the ITU. Liberal democracies are concerned that the intergovernmental model of internet governance would be “fragmented, slow and not interoperable” and facilitate censorship in authoritarian States. In turn, developing States that are not able to deal with cyber threats tend to blame the flaws in internet security on the ICANN-led governance structure and seek a new, government-controlled model. During the 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications, 89 governments, including many developing States, supported an enhanced role for the ITU over internet regulation and approved revisions to the International Telecommunication Regulations intended to transfer authority for regulating critical aspects of the internet from ICANN to the ITU. 54 countries, including the US, the EU, and most other developed countries, however, advocated for the existing model of internet oversight by multi-stakeholder, non-governmental institutions, and refused to sign the revised text of the Regulations. While some observers considered the outcome of the Conference to signal a “digital Cold War,” the long term implications of these partially adopted revisions have yet to emerge.\nMoreover, any conceptual and/or regulatory framework for cyberspace governance would have to include non-State actors, particularly the private sector, in law-making or norm-development processes, as has been explicitly recognised.

This sentiment was echoed by the Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet, which strongly emphasised the need for multi-stakeholder participation. Most recently, in April 2014, the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial) brought together representatives from civil society, the private sector, academia, and the technical community, supported by several governmental representatives, to “establish strategic guidelines related to the use and development of the Internet in the world.” The Meeting resulted in the Multistakeholder Statement, a non-binding document that set out “Internet Governance Process Principles” emphasising inclusiveness, collaboration, meaningful participation, and consensus driven governance. Nonetheless, it has been argued that “some nations and [intergovernmental organisations] still must embrace further the value of collaboration beyond merely with state actors,” suggesting that there is room for improvement with the involvement of non-State actors in policy-making and norm-development processes relating to cyberspace.\nIn addition, as in the international environmental context, cyberspace governance must also address tensions between the developed and developing worlds, which are reflected in disagreements over cyber governance issues such as the role of the ITU and further complicate efforts to establish a global normative/regulatory regime. The need to bridge the ‘digital divide’, the “social and spatial inequalities in internet access” between developed and developing countries, has long been recognised. For instance, the primary objectives of the WSIS I and II conferences were “to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society” and to “pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society.” Similarly, the recent NETmundial statement emphasised that “Internet governance institutions\n Tunis Agenda (note 169), para. 29; Woltag (note 81).\n Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), paras. 58, 59.\n Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial), NETmundial: The beginning of a process, available at: http://netmundial.br/about/ (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n NETmundial, NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement, 24 April 2014, available at: http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n Gross et al.

However, while the risk of the internet “reinforce[ing] or even deepen[ing] existing divisions between the haves and have-nots, between the developed and developing worlds” has been acknowledged, no mechanism for the even distribution of the “benefits of the information technology revolution” has thus far been created, with the exception of a voluntary “Digital Solidarity Fund” established pursuant to the WSIS. Therefore, for any truly global regulatory regime of cyberspace to succeed, the interests and capabilities of developing countries must be taken into account both in its development process and in its content. Here, too, lessons may be learned from the environmental context, including concerning the challenges involved.\nIn sum, the need for multi-stakeholder involvement and global representation in the development of norms and regulatory mechanisms to govern cyberspace seems to be widely recognised. Less formal frameworks based on ‘soft law’, rather than intergovernmental agreements or institutions, may be more conducive to the development of such norms and mechanisms. Still, the involvement and cooperation of States seems equally important in light of the fact that they retain control over cyberspace infrastructure and the enforcement of cyberspace regulation, and that some form of State responsibility for harmful cyberspace activities emanating from their territories is required. Ultimately, therefore, an effective regulatory framework for cyberspace may require a “multi-layered structure” that combines informal norm-developing networks, institutions for multi-stakeholder consultation, technical standard-setting bodies, and treaties for intergovernmental cooperation and regulation. As has been suggested elsewhere, “the legal framework [for cyberspace] is to be based on networks established by the concerned communities and linked together through interconnection mechanisms.” Such an interconnected system is necessary in order for international consensus to be achieved on the controversial elements of cyberspace governance discussed in this chapter, including the legal nature and conception of\n NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement (note 202).\n Warf (note 204), 21.\n Antonio Segura-Serrano, Internet Regulation and the Role of International Law, Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law 10 (2006), 191, 259, available at: www.mpii.de/files/pdf3/06_antonov1.pdf (accessed on 21 October 2010).\n See supra, notes 153–160 and accompanying text.\n Weber (note 75), 7.\n Ibid., 4.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ncyberspace and the content and limits of States' obligations in relation to peacetime cyberspace activities.\n## V. Conclusion\nAnd so we return to the no harm rule. Our conclusion is that, at least in the short run, the most promising foundation for international cyberspace law is the harm prevention/due diligence framework that has already gained considerable traction in this context. One of this framework's main advantages is precisely that it does not require wholesale norm-creation or big normative battles, as would be required in an effort to develop norms for the governance of cyberspace itself as a 'shared' or 'commons' resource. The basic norms already exist and apply to activities and harms that involve cyberspace just as to any other activity that occurs under the jurisdiction of States.\nIn this regard, the evolution of international environmental law is instructive, especially in relation to the efforts to flesh out the concepts of harm prevention and due diligence. The Interim Report of the Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet is an excellent illustration of how the same could be accomplished in the cyber context. It articulates adaptations of the general principles of prevention, diligence, procedural obligations, and precaution, including to a multi-stakeholder context, and highlights the need for the development of common standards and best practices. Such standards need not be developed in legally binding form or in a multilateral treaty to be influential, or to flesh out the binding prevention and diligence obligations that exist at custom. As we have shown, although international agreements have played a crucial role in global environmental protection, we appear to be witnessing a certain return to basic principles in the regulation of transboundary environmental harm. The harm prevention/due diligence framework may offer the most suitable approach also in the cyber context, where the potential benefits of a treaty-based approach arguably are outweighed by the drawbacks. The development of cyberspace norms can rather take place through relatively informal legal means in an interconnected, multi-stakeholder system that incorporates States and non-State actors, thereby bypassing lumbering and often stalled treaty-based processes.\nNonetheless, the development of such norms requires some degree of international consensus on the nature of cyberspace governance, the content of basic principles, and the degree and type of regulation required. Unlike the liberal approach adopted by the Advisory Group, it seems that the Tallinn Manual Group\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 37\nof Experts took a more conservative stance and could not agree on certain issues, notably the question whether there is a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent any cyber activity with a ‘negative effect,’ or just a duty not to knowingly allow harmful acts that are underway to continue. As we have suggested, the different nature, focus, and purpose of these two groups of experts may account for their divergent approaches to States’ obligations in this context. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that some of the Tallinn Manual’s experts have now turned their attention to the application of international law principles, such as the use of countermeasures, to cyberspace activities in peacetime, noting that “few, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold.” It will be interesting to see, therefore, if and how the original positions taken in the Tallinn Manual shift in this new context.\nNotwithstanding the usefulness of analogies with international environmental law, cyberspace really is a different kind of space, perhaps leaving for international law only the relatively limited task of holding States to appropriate standards of diligence. Although consensus has yet to be achieved on the content and limits of these norms as they apply to this unique, virtual ‘ecosystem’, we believe that it is worth teaching an old law new tricks!\n Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, 28, paras. 7, 11.\n Schmitt, Cyber Operations (note 2), 1.\nTSpace Research Repository\ntspace.library.utoronto.ca\nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO\nLIBRARIES"

We begin by exploring opportunities for borrowing well-established rules of harm prevention and due diligence from the more advanced, but not dissimilar, field of international environmental law. We argue that these rules can provide a legal foundation for the emerging field of international cyber law, and have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. We then draw on the experience of international environmental law with conceptual notions such as ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, as well as with institutional models such as multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies. We highlight the risks and drawbacks of the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a commons in the ‘virtual’ world of cyberspace.\nKEYWORDS: International Environmental Law, Non-State Actors, State Responsibility, Transboundary Harm Prevention, Due Diligence, Global Commons, Shared Resources, Institutional Framework\nI. Introduction\nFor international lawyers, the body of rules that should govern cyberspace and harmful cyber activities is still an emerging field. Much has been written in recent years about the circumstances in which cyber actions by States, or attributable to States, should be considered equivalent to ‘armed attacks’ that might trigger\n¹ The title is borrowed from *Jody Freeman*, Teaching an Old Law New Tricks, The New York Times, 30 May 2014, available at: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/opinion/teaching-an-old-law-new-tricks.html?emc=edit_tv_20140530&amp;nl=opinion&amp;nlid=28076609 (accessed on 3 July 2014) (commenting on the *Ohama* Administration’s recourse to existing clean air legislation in the face of Congress’ failure to regulate greenhouse gas emissions).\n* Professor of Law and Metcalf Chair in Environmental Law, Faculty of Law, University of Toronto.\n** SJD Candidate, University of Toronto Faculty of Law; Research Fellow, Max Planck Institute for International, European and Regulatory Procedural Law.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nanother State’s right to self-defence.² But the legal toolkit of the law on the use of force is not appropriate for dealing with the vast majority of ‘cyber attacks’ and, in any case, is not applicable. Many State-controlled cyber attacks remain below the thresholds of the use of force framework, engaging instead the basic rules requiring that States not cause harm to other States or to areas beyond State jurisdiction. Others may amount not to a ‘use of force,’ but to illegal intervention. The legal consequences, as a result, will be governed by the law of State responsibility, not the law on the use of force. The same applies, arguably, in situations in which a cyber attack might be likened to a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter),³ but not an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 UN Charter.⁴ Furthermore, and quite apart from the question whether actions fall within the ambit of the rules on the use of force or another set of rules, many cyber acts are not undertaken by States or their agents, such that States would be directly responsible for them. Rather, a large proportion of such actions are undertaken by non-State actors, who operate within the territories or otherwise under the jurisdiction of various States. It is the legal regime for this wide array of ‘peacetime’ cyber operations that we consider in this chapter, focusing in particular on the primary obligations of States in relation to non-State actions occurring under their jurisdiction.\nIn exploring this terrain, we draw on the evolution and legal building blocks of international environmental law, which we believe holds a number of important lessons for the emerging field of international cyberspace law. International environmental law evolved in a way that is not dissimilar to what is now occurring in relation to cyberspace. When the first environmental problems arose, there existed no specific rules on environmental impacts in international law. Recourse had to be had to the general rules that govern the rights and obligations attached to\n² See e.g., Peter Margulies, Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility, Melbourne Journal of International Law 14 (2013), 1; Michael N.

But dealing with international environmental problems often requires cooperation and finely calibrated response measures that can address complex problems and adapt as the problems or human understanding of them and technical capacity to solve them evolve. International environmental law and the emerging field of international cyberspace law are similar also in some important structural respects. Notably, one of the distinctive features of international environmental law is that it must almost always deal with impacts that are generated by private actors. Furthermore, like the potential consequences of cyber activities, environmental consequences of actions in one State are often felt in another State’s territory or in areas beyond State jurisdiction – the ‘commons’.\nHowever, if one were to undertake an assessment of the state of international environmental law in 2014, one might conclude that, at least in some respects, it is coming full circle. In the 1980s and 1990s, the field experienced rapid growth through the emergence of specialised rules and principles, and the subsequent proliferation and progressive expansion of more and more elaborate treaty regimes and treaty-based standard-setting processes relating to a wide array of regional and global issues.⁵ Today, new environmental agreements have become a rarity and even the further development of existing regimes through treaty-based international environmental law-making seems to have slowed. Indeed, in the case of the perhaps most complex international environmental challenge – climate change – international environmental law appears to be undergoing a fundamental shift from ‘top-down’ standard-setting to a more flexible, ‘bottom-up’ approach.⁶ Whether by coincidence or in response to these patterns, the foundational principles of international environmental law have seen something of a renaissance. In the last few years, States have invoked basic rules concerning transboundary impacts and have turned to international courts and tribunals for clarification of the attendant procedural obligations and due diligence requirements. In other words, some of the recent developments in international environmental law can be traced all the way back to its roots in basic principles concerning sovereign rights and in the iconic cases that developed these principles, such as the *Island of Palmas* arbitration or the *Corfu Channel* case.⁷\n⁵ For an overview on this evolution, see *Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey*, Mapping the Field, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2008), 1.\n⁶ See *e.g.* *Daniel Bodansky*, A Tale of Two Architectures: The Once and Future U.N.

We first discuss the application of these concepts in the environmental context, considering how they may contribute to the development of norms for the regulation of harmful activities in cyberspace. We will show that the obligations of harm prevention and due diligence have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. Many cyber security and legal scholars,⁸ as well as governments⁹ and international organisations,¹⁰ have recognised States’ obligation to exercise due diligence in order to prevent cyber activities that are harmful to other States from occurring in their territories. We then turn to the notions of ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, concepts that are prominent in international environmental law but have been controversial or of limited relevance in the cyber context. We discuss them mainly to highlight the potential and risks of efforts to regulate not only harm caused by States to other States in relation to cyberspace, but also harm caused to cyberspace itself as a common resource. Finally, drawing on the experience with the design of multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies, we offer some observations on institutional models, and highlight some of the potential drawbacks of these models in the cyber context. At this point, in any case, multilateral treaty-based regimes are largely absent in the\n⁸ See e.g., Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace, International Law Studies 89 (2013), 123, 138; Jan Messerschmidt, Hackback: Permitting Retaliatory Hacking by Non-State Actors as Proportionate Countermeasures to Transboundary Cyberharm, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 52 (2013), 275; Margulies (note 2), 16, 18, 19; Katharina Ziolkowski, Ius ad bellum in Cyberspace – Some Thoughts on the “Schmitt-Criteria” for Use of Force, in: Christian Czosseck/Rain Ottis/Katharina Ziolkowski (eds.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Proceedings (2012), 306, 307; Joanna Kulesza, International Internet Law, Global Change, Peace &amp; Security 24 (2012), 351; Tallinn Manual (note 2), 26–28; Jason Healey/Hannah Pitts, Applying International Environmental Legal Norms to Cyber Statecraft, I/S: A Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society 8 (2012), 356; Matthew E.

We will suggest that the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a 'commons' is unlikely to be feasible or even desirable. Our goal in this chapter is to explore opportunities and post warning signs for those in the 'virtual' world of cyberspace who seek to learn from the 'real' world of international environmental law.\n## II. The No Harm Rule and Related Principles\nOne of the most straightforward approaches to building international cyberspace law may be to apply the legal principles on harm prevention and due diligence to cyberspace issues. These principles are not only well established, but also anchored in foundational principles of international law that are designed to balance competing sovereign interests. For example, in the *Island of Palmas* case, the Arbitrator held that “[t]erritorial sovereignty [...] has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability.”¹¹ Similarly, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its decision in the *Corfu Channel* case, found that it is “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹²\nInternational environmental law, in the absence of specific rules, adapted these general rules to the environmental setting. The salient principles evolved into the proposition that States' rights to use their territories and resources are limited by the obligation to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control do not cause significant transboundary harm. This 'no harm' rule has since been affirmed and fleshed out through a series of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and other international instruments, as well as several arbitral and judicial decisions.¹³ The ICJ confirmed in its advisory opinion on the *Legality of the Threat* or\n¹¹ *Island of Palmas Case* (note 7), 839.\n¹² ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 7), 22.\n¹³ See e.g., *Trail Smelter Case* (USA, Canada), Arbitral Award of 16 April 1938 and 11 March 1941, RIAA III, 1905, 1965; *Lac Lamnac Arbitration* (France, Spain), Arbitral Award of 16 November 1957,\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nUse of Nuclear Weapons that “the general obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States or of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the environment.”¹⁴ The Court reiterated this conclusion in its decision in the Gabilikovo-Nagymaros case and its decision in the Pulp Mills case.¹⁵ The International Law Commission’s (ILC) Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities too confirmed States’ obligation to “take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.”¹⁶\nThe key point for our present purposes is that looking to international environmental law ultimately means turning to basic principles, applicable to any harm caused to States’ territories, including cyber-related harm, without the need for ‘norm creation’. We believe that this fact alone is a crucial advantage. In addition, international environmental law offers rich State practice and judicial opinions that provide guidance on the nature of the due diligence obligations that flow from the exercise of sovereign rights. Two recent cases are of particular interest in this respect – the ICJ’s Pulp Mills case and the advisory opinion on Activities in the Area of the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS Chamber).¹⁷ The discussion below focuses on the elements of each decision that flesh out the no harm rule with respect to due diligence, the attendant procedural obligations, and the relationship between harm prevention and precaution. As we proceed, we explore the extent to which the approach in international environmental law finds parallels in the emerging international cyberspace law.\nRIAA XII, 281; Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

Harm Prevention and Due Diligence\n1. International Environmental Law and Norm Evolution\nin International Cyberspace Law\nIn the Pulp Mills decision, the ICJ emphasised two important features of the no harm rule. First, it encompasses an obligation to prevent harm. Second, “the principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory.”¹⁸ This obligation to act with due diligence entails “not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators.”¹⁹\nThe ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion on Activities in the Area, in turn, was concerned with the responsibility of States to take appropriate measures to ensure that private entities operating in the deep seabed do not cause harm in that ‘commons’ area. Perhaps most importantly for present purposes, the Chamber highlighted the contextual nature of the due diligence standard. The Chamber observed that the due diligence standard “may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or technological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity [...] [and] be more severe for the riskier activities.”²⁰ Due diligence may vary also in light of the capacity of the State concerned, although this point appears to be more controversial. Some leading commentators on international environmental law, citing numerous international instruments that accommodate developing countries’ lesser technological and regulatory capacity, including the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change,²¹ compared the flexibility of the due diligence standard to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.²² However, the ITLOS Chamber made a point of emphasising that different treatment for developed and developing States is warranted only when the underlying international legal obligations provide for it.²³\n¹⁸ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 101.\n¹⁹ Ibid., para. 197.\n²⁰ ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), para. 117.\n²¹ See supra, note 13.\n²² Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell, International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149.\n²³ ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), paras. 151–163.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nThe general requirement of harm prevention, and its attendant due diligence obligation, has already been recognised as a basis for States' obligations with respect to cyberspace activities. The Ad hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (Advisory Group), established by the Council of Europe, explicitly referred to the use of the no harm principle in the environmental law context, and relied on it to “underline the primary nature of the proposed commitments of a state to prevent, manage and respond to significant transboundary disruption of or interference with the stability, robustness, resilience and openness of the Internet.”²⁴ Some States have also recognised a general due diligence obligation in cyberspace. The United States (US), for instance, considers cyber security due diligence to be an emerging norm according to which “States should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse,”²⁵ while recognising that “unique attributes of networked technology require additional work to clarify how these norms apply.”²⁶ A duty “not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies” was also recognised by China and Russia in 2011.²⁷ Russia argued for inclusion of a more specific duty to “take all necessary steps to prevent any destructive information action originating from their own territory or using the information infrastructure under their jurisdiction, as well as cooperate to locate the source of computer attacks carried out with the use of their territory, to repel these attacks and to eliminate their consequences” in a proposed international information security convention.²⁸\nThe obligation to prevent harm to other States from cyber attacks and other malicious cyber activities conducted in their territories is generally considered to\n²⁴ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 64.\n²⁵ US International Strategy for Cyberspace (note 9), 10.\n²⁶ Ibid., 9.\n²⁷ United Nations General Assembly, Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

Specifically, it noted that “an efficient observance of a due diligence commitment is understood as the implementation of those measures which would be commensurate with the overall capabilities of the country concerned to address the risks,”³⁸ and that legislative, administrative, or other action necessary to implement a States’ due diligence commitments “should be subject to the capabilities of the state concerned.”³⁹\nThe scope of States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations in cyberspace were also considered in the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), a document prepared by an independent international group of experts comprised of practitioners and scholars (Tallinn Manual Group of Experts).⁴⁰ While the Manual deals primarily with cyber warfare, it recognises the no harm obligation as a rule of “a general international legal nature” applicable to “the relationship between states, cyber infrastructure, and cyber operations” and extending to “all cyber activities from one State’s territory that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another States’ territory [...] irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State.”⁴¹\nAgain in keeping with the approach in international environmental law, the Tallinn Manual considers that the no harm prevention and due diligence obligations encompass the requirement that States “use all means at [their] disposal\n³⁶ Ibid., paras. 71–73.\n³⁷ Ibid., para. 74.\n³⁸ Ibid.\n³⁹ Ibid., para. 77.\n⁴⁰ Tallinn Manual (note 2).\n⁴¹ Ibid., 15, 26, 27.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 11\nto require [private entities]” to take remedial action to terminate a harmful activity.⁴² The Manual also addresses one important issue that has remained underspecified thus far: the level of harm required to trigger the harm prevention duty. In international environmental law, the *Trail Smelter Case* posited a “serious consequence” standard with respect to transboundary air pollution,⁴³ although today a “significant harm” standard, intended to exclude *de minimis* harm, is more common.⁴⁴ The Tallinn Manual only requires a “negative effect” to result from the cyberspace activity, which need not involve physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals.⁴⁵ However, the Manual does not specify what harm *would* be considered as having a sufficiently “negative effect” in this context.\n## 2. Areas of Controversy\nIt appears then that the duty to prevent harm and the due diligence obligation are already informing the cyberspace discourse, thereby eliminating, at least in part, the need to ‘reinvent the wheel’ with regard to the regulation of harmful conduct in cyberspace. However, while the relevance of these principles in the cyberspace context has been widely recognised, their precise nature and scope remain contested, and therefore in need of further development and clarification. In this regard, there appears to be several broad areas of controversy, all related in one way or another to the challenges of attribution and to questions surrounding how heavy a harm prevention burden to place on States in relation to non-State activities. After all, hackers and other cyber actors can draw from a rich menu of options for concealing their identities and evading attribution.⁴⁶\nHence, some have doubted the political as well as practical feasibility of no harm and due diligence obligations of States in the cyberspace context, as opposed to reliance on the stringent requirements of the law of State responsibility for direct attribution of harmful actions to States.⁴⁷ A viable due diligence framework, some\n⁴² *Ibid.*, 28, para. 9.\n⁴³ *Healey/Pitts* (note 8), 378.\n⁴⁴ ILC Draft Articles Transboundary Harm (note 16), 41–42.\n⁴⁵ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 5.\n⁴⁶ For example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets can be intercepted or spoofed mid-route, making it difficult to trace them back to their source. Alternatively, reliance on “botnets”, robot networks of malware-infected personal computers, allows attackers to remain anonymous by assuming the identity of someone else in order to perform malicious actions. See *Shackelford/Andres* (note 2), 982 and *Mauno Pibelgas*, Back-Tracing and Anonymity in Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 28), 46, 47. We are grateful to *Alex Ognihone* for assisting us with this point.\n⁴⁷ *Ziolkowski* (note 8), 307.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nargue, may be difficult to achieve as “it is unclear that any state is prepared (politically or technologically) to take full responsibility for all harm emanating from gateway routers, very small aperture terminals [...] wireless mobile devices, and other devices within its territory or jurisdiction.”⁴⁸ Therefore, States may not be willing to agree on criteria for a more expansive regime of indirect responsibility for non-State actors’ cyber activities, based on the ‘no harm’ principle.⁴⁹ In short, it may seem sensible and even self-evident that States should enact and enforce criminal laws regarding cross-border cyber attacks, in line with the ICJ’s finding in *Pulp Mills* that diligence requires States to “adopt appropriate rules and measures” and “take all appropriate measures to enforce” them.⁵⁰ But it may be exceedingly difficult to define in a concrete and also manageable manner what exactly are “appropriate” standards and efforts to prevent harm from cyber attacks and other hostile acts. And, even if agreed, such a general standard may not suffice. “Because of the speed with which cyber weapons could be deployed,” some observers claim, “relying only upon cyber due diligence presents too great a risk of intrusion by unfriendly actors.”⁵¹ This challenge is further complicated by “the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character,”⁵² as well as precisely “the ease with which deception can be mounted through cyber infrastructure,”⁵³ which may make it impossible for a State to prevent injury to another State.⁵⁴\nSome interpretations of due diligence in cyberspace have attempted to take the unique nature of cyber acts into account. For instance, the Advisory Group has limited the applicability of States’ “due diligence commitments of prevention, management and response” to situations where the State is the actual operator or manager of critical internet resources. Where it is not, the Group suggests that “the principle of subsidiarity or non-involvement of states in the ordinary administration of the network or operational issues” prevails, recognising the fact that “the private sector takes the lead in the day-to-day operations of the\n⁴⁸ *Sean Kanuck*, Sovereign Discourse on Cyber Conflict Under International Law, Texas Law Review (Tex.

While the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts agreed that the obligations would be triggered if a State had “actual knowledge” of the acts in question, it could not agree on whether they would also obtain if a State had only “constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge,” for instance where a State fails to use due care in policing cyber activities on its territory and is therefore unaware of the acts.59 Some have argued that “a state’s duty to prevent cyber attacks should not be based on a state’s knowledge of a particular cyber attack before it occurs, but rather on its actions to prevent cyber attacks in general,” since such attacks are “extremely difficult for host-states to detect prior to the commission of a specific attack.”60 While this approach would be in line with the general thrust of the harm prevention and due diligence obligations as they have developed in international environmental law, it has been criticised for going too far in reducing the knowledge requirement in the cyber context.61 Others have contended that “presumptive knowledge is sufficient to trigger the duty” if the cyber attack can reasonably be considered to belong to a series of cyber attacks” originating from a State’s territory.62 The position of the Advisory Group in this regard is close to the stance of international environmental law; it is that “the disruption and interference should be foreseeable and the state concerned must know or should have known under the circumstances that the given activity involved a risk of significant consequences.”63\n55 Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), paras. 77, 78.\n56 Tallinn Manual (note 2), 34, paras. 3–4.\n57 Fleck (note 2), 339.\n58 Margulies (note 2), 16–17.\n59 Tallinn Manual (note 2), 28, para. 11.\n60 Sklerov (note 29), 71.\n61 Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 136, 137; Pirker (note 29), 205.\n62 Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 136.\n63 Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 74.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nFinally, and relatedly, there seems to be a lack of consensus regarding the precise scope of the no harm and due diligence obligations in cyberspace. Notably, given the “difficulty of mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats,” the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts could not agree on whether or not these general obligations should be applied to “situations in which the relevant acts are merely prospective” as opposed to those that are already underway.⁶⁴ In other words, the Group could not agree on a general precautionary duty of States to undertake all appropriate measures with regard to potential cyber threats at an early stage and before a concrete risk of harm occurs,⁶⁵ a concept with roots in international environmental law that we discuss in more detail below. Furthermore, the Group could not reach a consensus on the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations to States through which cyber operations merely transit, in light of the “unique routing processes of cyber transmissions.”⁶⁶ By contrast, certain scholars have suggested that “reasonable measures to prevent [...] prospective acts are required”⁶⁷ and that even a mere transit State “has an obligation to prevent a cyber attack.”⁶⁸ However, there is no consensus on this issue as of yet.⁶⁹\nThese contentious issues, among others, must be resolved in order for the no harm principle to effectively regulate activities in cyberspace. International consensus should be achieved on the general content and limits of the due diligence standard applicable to cyberspace. Agreement is also needed on the relationship between States’ responsibility for failure to take diligent harm prevention measures and their responsibility for non-State acts directly attributable to them under the law of State responsibility. Arguably, both types of responsibility obtain, and each applies to a distinct type of ‘failure’ by a State. But, absent consensus on the issue, developing an effective normative and regulatory framework for cyberspace on the basis of the duty to prevent harm and the law of State responsibility will be difficult.⁷⁰ With the caveats noted above, the development of these principles in the environmental context, and particularly the contextual approach adopted by the ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion, may be\n⁶⁴ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 7.\n⁶⁵ Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 169.\n⁶⁶ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 28, 29, para. 12.\n⁶⁷ Pirker (note 29), 208.\n⁶⁸ Ibid., 209.\n⁶⁹ Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 137, 138.\n⁷⁰ Kirsch (note 2), 638; Kanuck (note 48), 1592; Kulesza, State Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks on International Peace and Security (note 8), 151; Gary Brown/Keira Poellet, The Customary International Law of Cyberspace, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 126, 141.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 15\nhelpful in this regard. Applying such an approach in the cyberspace context could allow for a flexible, contextual application of the due diligence standard. One might also envision a contextual interpretation of the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility in accordance with new technological developments and the evolving nature of cyberspace. However, as in the debates surrounding the attribution of non-State actor conduct for the purposes of the law on the use of force, many States and other observers will likely have misgivings about modifying (and thereby potentially eroding) what is meant to be a general framework for specific purposes. The due diligence standard is therefore likely to be the most promising conceptual hook for the necessary fine-tuning; the precise contours of this standard could change over time and in accordance with the gravity of the transboundary cyber harm caused.\n## B. Procedural Obligations\nThe no harm rule entails a series of procedural obligations, including the obligation to notify or warn potentially affected States,⁷¹ the obligation to exchange information, to consult and negotiate,⁷² and the general obligation to cooperate to prevent harm.⁷³ The Pulp Mills case confirms that these procedural obligations, on the one hand, have a separate existence as customary norms (that can be violated on their own terms – even when harm is ultimately not caused), and, on the other hand, are implied in the substantive obligation to prevent environmental harm (e.g. a State may have to notify or consult with another about potential harm in order to meet its obligation of diligent harm prevention).⁷⁴\nIn the cyberspace context, similar cooperative requirements and processes have been emphasised in light of its rapidly changing technological nature,⁷⁵ its “global character”,⁷⁶ and because protection from cyber threats requires “collaborative relationships for exchanging cyber defense data and an ability to establish trusted relationships.”⁷⁷ Accordingly, the duty to cooperate has been considered to be\n⁷¹ ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 7).\n⁷² Lac Lamocx Arbitration (note 13).\n⁷³ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 145 (tracing the obligation to cooperate to the good faith principle in international law).\n⁷⁴ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), paras. 78, 79.\n⁷⁵ Rolf Weber, Future Design of Cyberspace Law, Journal of Politics and Law 5 (2012), 1.\n⁷⁶ Ziolkowski (note 29), 177.\n⁷⁷ Diego Vázquez et al., Conceptual Framework for Cyber Defense Information Sharing within Trust Relationships, in: Czosseck/Ottis/Ziolkowski (eds.) (note 8), 2012, 4th International\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nrelevant as a general principle of international law,⁷⁸ as well as a legal obligation of States in the arena of cyber security.⁷⁹ Reliance on traditional means of international cooperation in areas such as cybercrime, however, has been viewed as incapable of offering the timely response needed.⁸⁰ Therefore, new cooperative mechanisms have been developed in this context, such as the 24/7 international assistance network established under the Budapest Convention for investigations and evidence collection concerning cybercrime.⁸¹\nThis broad duty to cooperate has been recognised as part and parcel of the obligation to prevent harm in the cyberspace context.⁸² It includes the obligation to undertake a risk assessment, to exchange information, to inform, notify, and consult other States in concrete cases of risk of significant transboundary harm,⁸³ and to cooperate “with the victim-states of cyber attacks that originated from within their borders” during investigations and prosecutions.⁸⁴ The Advisory Group, for instance, stated as general requirements that “States should co-operate mutually, in good faith and in consultation with each other and with concerned stakeholders at all stages of designing and implementing policies in relation to the Internet,”⁸⁵ and “should take all reasonable measures to provide prior and timely notification and relevant information to states that may be potentially affected.”⁸⁶ These requirements envision “participation of states within whose jurisdiction disruptions or interferences with the Internet stability, robustness and resilience may originate, and states likely to be affected or actually affected, in action aimed at prevention of, preparedness for and response to risks and threats to critical Internet resources.”⁸⁷\nConference on Cyber Conflict Proceedings (NATO CCD COE Publications 2012), 429.\n⁷⁸ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 75.\n⁷⁹ Ziolkowski (note 29), 177, 178.\n⁸⁰ United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime: Draft (February 2013), xi, available at: http://www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n⁸¹ Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Art. 35; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Internet, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. VI (2012), 227.\n⁸² Ziolkowski (note 29), 186.\n⁸³ Ibid., 169; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 376.\n⁸⁴ Sklerov (note 29), 62; Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 135.\n⁸⁵ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 18.\n⁸⁶ Ibid., 21.\n⁸⁷ Ibid., para. 75.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 17\nIn more practical terms, the Advisory Group noted that States should, in particular, “co-operate in the creation of public awareness about the risks and opportunities of cross border Internet traffic and the development of educational tools to enable citizens to share responsibilities for a safer Internet,” as well as take legislative action in order to overcome barriers to international cooperation.⁸⁸ Moreover, “states may establish mechanisms that are suitable for monitoring the implementation of their preparedness and prevention commitments in respect of disruptions and interference with the infrastructure of the Internet.”⁸⁹ The Advisory Group also set out detailed standards for information exchange and coordinated action, some of which were explicitly ‘borrowed’ from the international environmental context.⁹⁰ These include the development of common rules and practices for information sharing, incident reporting, and for deploying internet resilience technologies; timely notification of transboundary risks and vulnerabilities; assessment of possible or actual adverse transboundary effects; coordination of emergency and response policies; and mutual consultations and assistance.⁹¹ Some of these obligations have also been included in the Budapest Convention.⁹²\nThe reality remains, however, that some States from which cyber attacks originate refuse to accept responsibility or cooperate with investigations,⁹³ that a clear framework for effective and timely exchange of information on critical infrastructure protection is lacking,⁹⁴ and that outside the realm of cyber crime there has been little international cooperation in reducing the transboundary impact of malicious activities in cyberspace.⁹⁵ Since States continue to have “wide discretion as to how to fulfill the legal obligation to cooperate in the cyber realm,”⁹⁶ there is a clear need for consensus to be reached on a uniform standard for cooperation. Such consensus, moreover, cannot include only States. In light of the dominant role of the private sector and civil society in internet governance, a multi-stakeholder approach must be applied in the discussion and formulation of\n⁸⁸ Ibid., paras. 76, 79.\n⁸⁹ Ibid., para. 80.\n⁹⁰ Ibid., para. 93.\n⁹¹ Ibid., paras. 91–102.\n⁹² Such as mutual assistance, see Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Chapter III.\n⁹³ Kirsch (note 2), 638.\n⁹⁴ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 91.\n⁹⁵ Heaby/Pitts (note 8), at 366.\n⁹⁶ Ziolkowski (note 29), 178.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nprocedural obligations such as the duty to cooperate.⁹⁷ This approach requires public-private collaboration, including internet service provider assistance, as well as data exchanges and partnerships, to form part of any international legal framework or standard for cyberspace cooperation.⁹⁸\n## C. Precaution\nIn the environmental context, at least, due diligence also appears to have become a conceptual bridge between the duty to prevent harm and the proposition that States, in certain circumstances, also must take precautionary measures. As traditionally conceived, the no harm rule is engaged when there is a known or objectively determined risk of significant environmental harm.⁹⁹ By contrast, the precautionary principle, as articulated in Principle 15 Rio Declaration,¹⁰⁰ is triggered by ‘threats of serious or irreversible damage’ and its lower evidentiary threshold could strengthen the protective potential of international environmental law. However, debate persists among States and academic commentators as to the precise contents of the principle, and whether or not it has acquired customary law status.¹⁰¹ International courts and tribunals, while acknowledging the wisdom of precautionary approaches to environmental protection,¹⁰² have avoided pronouncing on its legal status.¹⁰³\nThe ITLOS Chamber, in the *Activities in the Area* advisory opinion, suggested that there was a trend “towards making [the precautionary] approach part of customary international law,”¹⁰⁴ and observed that it “is also an integral part of the general obligation of due diligence.”¹⁰⁵ This obligation requires States “to take all\n---\n⁹⁷ Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, *Principles of International Internet Law*, German Law Journal 11 (2010), 1245, 1261, 1262.\n⁹⁸ *Eneken Tikk*, *Establishing Rules for Cyber Security*, in: Scott Jasper (ed.), *Conflict and Cooperation in the Global Commons* (2012), 222–224.\n⁹⁹ See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 153.\n¹⁰⁰ Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 15.\n¹⁰¹ See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 154–164.\n¹⁰² See ICJ, *Gablikoro-Nagymaros* (note 15), para. 140; id., *Pulp Mills* (note 15), paras. 164, 185.

Indeed, it has been suggested that States are obliged “to take (general) precautionary measures with regard to potential cyber threats posing a significant risk of damage of a transboundary nature.”¹¹⁰ This obligation has also been said to form part of States’ due diligence obligation in this context,¹¹¹ and to include “the duty to undertake all appropriate regulatory measures at an early stage, and well before the (concrete) risk of harm occurs,”¹¹² although the precise degree of knowledge of such a risk required from States in order to trigger the duty, as already mentioned, remains controversial.¹¹³ Precautionary measures in this context would include “the implementation of strategic, political, organisational, administrative, legal and technical measures [...] aimed at general prevention” of misuse of cyberspace for malicious activities by non-State actors,¹¹⁴ although what precisely such measures would entail remains to be clarified by “future State practice.”¹¹⁵ Such State practice can be seen, for instance, in recent domestic legislative initiatives attempting to impose a legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to\n¹⁰⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ The ITLOS Chamber may have spelled out what the ICJ merely alluded to in its *Gablōkoon-Nagymarus* and *Pulp Mills* decisions by noting that ‘in the field of environmental protection, vigilance and prevention are required on account of the often irreversible character of damage and of the limitations inherent in the very mechanism of reparation of this type of damage’.

A “precautionary approach” was expressly recognised by the Advisory Group, which considered the identification, assessment, and notification of possible or actual risks of adverse transboundary effects on the internet, and the prior and timely notification of such risks, to form part of States’ prevention obligation in cyberspace.¹¹⁹ The Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, as we have already noted,¹²⁰ adopted a more conservative approach and did not encompass prospective acts or acts of which States ‘should have known’ in the obligation to prevent cyber harm to other States.¹²¹ Therefore, while both groups of experts seem to agree on the basic need for States to exercise due diligence in order to prevent transboundary cyber harm, their interpretations of the nature and scope of these obligations diverge.\nOne possible explanation for this divergence is the different nature, purpose, and mandate of each of these groups of experts. The Advisory Group, comprised of European experts in fields such as law, information, and telecommunications, was set up by the Steering Committee on the Media and New Communication Service of the Council of Europe. It was instructed to examine “the shared or mutual responsibilities of states in ensuring that critical Internet resources are managed in the public interest and as a public asset” and “make proposals [...] relating to the prevention and management of events [...] falling within member states’ jurisdictions or territories, which could block or significantly impede Internet access [...] with the objective of guaranteeing the ongoing functioning and universal nature and integrity of the Internet.”¹²² The mandate of the Advisory\n¹¹⁶ Robin Geiß/Henning Lehmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

In so doing, it focused on States’ due diligence and procedural obligations while excluding such controversial issues as State responsibility, cyber warfare, and countermeasures.¹²³\nThe Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, on the other hand, was comprised of both European and non-European legal and technical experts (but all from Western States), many of whom with experience or expertise related to armed conflict, national defence, or security policy.¹²⁴ It was set up by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, an international military organisation,¹²⁵ and tasked with producing “a manual on the law governing cyber warfare.”¹²⁶ Accordingly, the Manual explicitly excluded any detailed discussion of cyber activities “that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.”¹²⁷ While it addressed the application of general international legal rules to cyberspace in times of peace, including States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations, the focus of the Manual was on cyber warfare and the application of international laws of armed conflict to it. Having to decide on such controversial issues, which were avoided by the Advisory Group, as well as the background of some of the experts in the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, may have influenced the tone of the Manual and its perspective, resulting in a more conservative and narrow stance with respect to States’ obligations in cyberspace.¹²⁸ As one commentator noted, “the Experts were very cautious to avoid taking any risks when drafting the rules” and, since unanimity was required to formulate the rules, “the most controversial international law aspects of cyber operations were therefore left unresolved.”¹²⁹\nThe different approaches taken by the Advisory Group and the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts reflect some of the underlying disagreements and confusion that\n¹²³ The Advisory Group explicitly drew a distinction between States’ commitments to prevent and manage cross-border disruptions of or interferences with the internet and international law rules governing responsibility for internationally wrongful acts, Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 20, para. 85.\n¹²⁴ See “the international group of experts and participants” in the Tallinn Manual (note 2), x–xiii.\n¹²⁵ Although the Tallinn Manual does not represent the views of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, its sponsoring nations, or NATO, Tallinn Manual (note 2), 11.\n¹²⁶ Ibid., (note 2), at 1.\n¹²⁷ Ibid., 4.\n¹²⁸ It has been suggested, for instance, that there may be an overtly close connection between the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts and the military and a potential resulting bias in the substance of the Manual, Pirkor (note 29), 190.\n¹²⁹ Marco Rossini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (2014), 31.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\npersist in the cyberspace context with regard to States' harm prevention and due diligence obligations, what precisely these obligations entail, and when they apply. Some doctrine emanating from the US, as well as European politicians and international law scholars, view cyberspace as \"the fifth battlefield\" and therefore, like the Tallinn Manual, emphasise States' obligations in terms of use of force, self-defence, and countermeasures, rather than in terms of harm prevention and due diligence. An opposite view is that said to be represented by the Advisory Group, which \"holds that states are obliged to observe due diligence in preventing cyber attacks and they may only be held responsible for a cyber attack if it can be demonstrated that they have failed to meet the due diligence standard.\"¹³⁰\n## III. Cyberspace as a Global Commons or a Shared Resource?\nIn the environmental context, it is accepted that States have an obligation to prevent harm to the territory of another State, or to areas beyond national control – global commons.¹³¹ However, the full legal ramifications of this ‘commons’ aspect of the harm prevention obligation are far from settled.¹³² Notably, there is no direct State practice on the question of who can invoke a State’s responsibility for harm to the commons. When it comes to applying the rules concerning harm to the commons to cyberspace, a prior question looms large: Is cyberspace a ‘commons’ in the first place? Alternatively, might it be a ‘shared resource’ of States?\nSome have identified the cyber domain as a global commons, together with the high seas, air, and space, and view these as “domains that are not controlled by any single state” but are rather “universally needed and thus should be shared.”¹³³ The Advisory Group, for instance, regarded “critical Internet resources” as global commons “under the stewardship of the international Internet community as a whole.”¹³⁴ The US and Japan have also regarded cyberspace as a global commons;\n¹³⁰ Kulesza, International Internet Law (note 8), 359–360.\n¹³¹ See Stockholm Declaration (note 13), Principle 21; Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 2. And see ICJ, Legality of Nuclear Weapons (note 14), para. 29; id., Gabilikovo-Nagymaros (note 15), para. 53; and id., Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 101.\n¹³² Jutta Brunnée, Common Areas, Common Heritage, Common Concern, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.)

From a definitional, or practical, perspective, the cyber domain is distinguishable from the other global commons on account of being a human creation and involving both physical infrastructure located in national territories and intangible features that transcend territorial borders.¹³⁶ Furthermore, unlike the sea, Antarctica, and outer space, “there is a ‘population’ or community in cyberspace and [...] [it] is not an entirely independent international space or concern that is beyond national regulation.”¹³⁷ According to some observers, in order for cyberspace to become a global commons, “long-established rights of sovereignty and property ownership recognized by the numerous domestic jurisdictions involved” in cyberspace would have to be overridden and legitimate and illegitimate users would have to be positively identified for the enforcement of norms or collective solutions. Neither of these conditions is currently satisfied in the cyberspace context.¹³⁸\nFrom a conceptual perspective, the identification of cyberspace as a global commons has thus far failed to clarify States’ obligations. The Advisory Group, for instance, emphasised the need for harm to be caused to another State, rather than to cyberspace as a resource, in order to trigger States’ obligations, notwithstanding its explicit reference to the internet as a global commons.¹³⁹ Moreover, the global commons concept does not necessarily make cyberspace any easier to regulate.¹⁴⁰ It has been argued, for instance, that while in the context of other global commons, users have “successfully self-organized for sustainable use of a commons” in the absence of government control, in the case of cyberspace the “affordances of the cyber technologies — that is, the way the technologies enable their use — and the mentalities of the users” have resulted in a “tragedy of the commons” that prevents effective self-organisation for sustainable use of\n¹³⁵ United States Department of Defense, The Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support (2005), 12, available at: https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=454976 (accessed on 23 October 2015); Ziolkowski (note 29), 183.\n¹³⁶ Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 22–23.\n¹³⁷ Kam Wai Chik, ‘Customary internet-ional law’: Creating a body of customary law for cyberspace, Part 1: Developing rules for transitioning custom into law, Computer Law &amp; Security Review 26 (2010), 3, 13.\n¹³⁸ Kanuck (note 48), 1577, 1579.\n¹³⁹ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 69.\n¹⁴⁰ Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 23.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ncyberspace.¹⁴¹ The concept of cyberspace as a commons, therefore, does not seem to have contributed much to the development of clear norms to regulate its use, and may even hinder this process.¹⁴²\nSome academic observers have warned against what they view as a gradual move away from the perception of cyberspace as a global commons and toward a State-based governance regime, considering it to constitute “norm regression” in the global governance of cyberspace.¹⁴³ But however intuitive it may seem to think of cyberspace as a type of commons, the idea remains controversial and in any event would not necessarily advance the effort to develop norms for the regulation of cyberspace, such as the duty to prevent harm. Even in the environmental context, the legal status of spaces or resources beyond the exclusive jurisdiction of States tends to be controversial. Aside from well-established examples of geographic areas like the high seas, Antarctica, or outer space, States have avoided the ‘commons’ label, precisely because it implies both the absence of sovereignty and certain collective rights and obligations.¹⁴⁴\nOne might alternatively consider the potential relevance of the notion of ‘shared resource’. This concept certainly fits key aspects of cyberspace, perhaps better than the notion of a ‘commons’, because it applies to resources that are under the jurisdiction of States but are quintessentially transboundary in nature. This paradigm permits States that share such a resource to devise norms and rules that take into account their respective sovereign interests, their mutual interests in the use and protection of the resource, and their obligations under international law. In the environmental context, States have often avoided using this umbrella concept, arguably because of the implication of less than full sovereignty and the broader implications the concept might have for other resources, and have used more issue-specific concepts, like ‘international watercourse’.¹⁴⁵\n¹⁴¹ Roger Hurwitz, Depleted Trust in the Cyber Commons, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 20, 21; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 366.\n¹⁴² But see Scott Shackelford, Toward Cyberpeace: Managing Cyberattacks Through Polycentric Governance, American University Law Review 62 (2013), 1273, 1293 (suggesting that cyberspace be treated as ‘pseudocommons’, “comprised of a shared global infrastructure that is controlled by public and private entities subject to national and international regulations”).\n¹⁴³ Ronald Deibert/Masashi Crets-Nishibata, Global Governance and the Spread of Cyberspace Controls, Global Governance 18 (2012), 341, 343, 345; Joanna Kuleczy/Roy Balleste, Signs and Portents in Cyberspace: The Rise of Jus Internet as a New Order in International Law, Fordham Intellectual Property, Media and Entertainment Law Journal 23 (2013), 1320.\n¹⁴⁴ Brunnie, Common Areas, Common Heritage, Common Concern (note 132).\n¹⁴⁵ See Jutta Brunnie/Stephen Toupe, Environmental Security and Freshwater Resources: Ecosystem Regime Building, American Journal of International Law 91 (1997), 26; Kanuck (note 48), 1580.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 25\nNonetheless, this conception could be helpful in relation to cyberspace since it would allow States to maintain certain sovereign rights, although these would not be absolute and would be balanced against the interests of other States and the international community.¹⁴⁶ While the concept of ‘shared resource’ is not a panacea for the difficulties already discussed with respect to defining and applying the no harm and due diligence obligations to cyberspace, it has been suggested that such a tailored model may present an alternative avenue for establishing States’ legal obligation to cooperate in this context through such principles as the sustainable and equitable use of shared resources. These principles may encourage States to undertake all necessary means in order to preserve the internet for future generations, which implies a proactive countering of cyber threats, an obligation to take precautionary measures, and restraint from any action that could hamper the availability and reliability of the internet.¹⁴⁷ In short, a ‘shared resource’ model could promote stewardship in cyberspace, rather than sovereignty.¹⁴⁸ While it may not resolve fundamental definitional issues, such a model could provide an alternative conceptual framework that shifts the focus from States’ obligations to each other to States’ obligations to cyberspace as a shared resource, thereby facilitating the development of norms and rules for its governance.\n## IV. Institutional Frameworks\nIt has been said that “there are structural similarities between the milieus of international law and of the Internet: neither is completely hierarchical and both must deal with ‘commons’ problems.”¹⁴⁹ Whether the future cyberspace governance regime will be grounded in the no harm and due diligence framework or in a ‘commons’ framework that may evolve over time, an additional question concerns the appropriate process for developing and maintaining the attendant normative and regulatory framework. International environmental law offers some models for governance regimes, and we thus turn to an examination of its normative and regulatory structures.\n¹⁴⁶ Ibid., 1580.\n¹⁴⁷ Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 179–181.\n¹⁴⁸ See Duncan Hollis, Stewardship versus Sovereignty?

International Environmental Governance\nIn the environmental context, so-called framework agreements have played a prominent role. They help in dealing with complex, evolving issues by allowing parties to begin by defining the common concern at hand, agreeing on principles to guide States’ actions, and establishing institutions and decision-making procedures for subsequent regime-development.^^\nMany environmental regimes create, or collaborate with, bodies that facilitate exchange among scientific or technical experts. Such bodies are important in building consensus around the nature of collective concerns and the collective action that is required to address them. Scientific or technical expert bodies also make important contributions in the further elaboration, refinement, or adjustment of regulatory strategies.^^ In the cyber context one could easily see the usefulness of such an approach, for example in relation to the constantly shifting needs of cyber security and the related due diligence standards. Environmental regime development *per se* is usually in the hands of a plenary body, which facilitates regular, long-term engagements between technical experts, policy-makers, lawyers, and relevant non-State actors (international organisations, non-governmental organisations, or business entities).^^ Although, in a formal sense, law-making remains in the hands of States, non-State actors can provide input into law-making processes or even help shape their outcomes.^^\nEnvironmental standard-setting itself occurs through decisions of plenary bodies, without subsequent formal consent by individual States. In most cases, the resulting standards are not legally binding, notwithstanding the mandatory language they may contain.^^ This approach facilitates agreement on collective action and standards that are applicable to all parties – an important feature for efforts to address collective concerns. Equally important is that soft regulatory processes enable speedier regime development and adjustment than processes that require subsequent ratification by individual States. In the cyber context both of these features could be significant, since (as in the environmental context) cyber\n^^ See *Jutta Brunnée*, Toward Effective International Environmental Law – Trends and Developments, in: Steven Kennett (ed.), Law and Process in Environmental Management (1993), 222–229.\n^^ For a detailed discussion, see *ead*, Coping with Consent: Lawmaking under Multilateral Environmental Agreements, Leiden Journal of International Law 15 (2002), 1.\n^^ *Ibid.*, 15, 16.\n^^ *Ibid.*, 14.\n^^ *Ibid.*, 25, 26.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 27\nproblems, or relevant technical understanding or capacity, as well as political dynamics, typically evolve over time, often rapidly.\nWith respect to treaty making, the experience with MEAs shows that even an apparently straightforward matter as agreeing on the nature and scope of the underlying concern and the principles that should govern it may be fraught with difficulties. In the climate context, for example, it took more than twenty years for parties to agree on the precise meaning of the regime objective – to forestall dangerous climate change – and parties are still struggling to achieve consensus on the parameters of one of the regime’s core principles, the notion of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities’.¹⁵⁵ On the latter concept, the positions of developed and developing countries have diverged quite dramatically, with some developing countries continuing to insist that developed countries shoulder the primary burdens of addressing climate change.¹⁵⁶ To be sure, the claims of ‘historical responsibility’ that developing countries have leveled against developed countries in relation to global carbon emissions will have no comparable basis in the cyber context. Still, a global regime-building effort in the cyber context, could also invite arguments by developing countries that States’ common responsibilities should be differentiated so as to lessen their burden or entitle them to technical or financial assistance. It seems sensible, even inevitable; to assist less developed countries in addressing the underlying common concern. In fact, most MEAs today do provide for various kinds of assistance, including through multilateral funds designed to finance conversion to new technologies or otherwise address capacity limitations.¹⁵⁷ But it is highly unlikely that major States, such as the US, will be any more inclined to accept formal differentiation or assistance obligations in the cyber context than they have been in the climate context (which is not to say ‘no assistance’).¹⁵⁸ Finally, experience with MEAs, especially the climate regime, also shows the potential pitfalls of treaty-based standard-setting. The need for agreement by a significant majority of parties (typically 3/4) and the common practice of consensus decision-making can easily stall progress or result\n¹⁵⁵ See Jutta Brunnée/Stephen Toupe, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (2010), Chapter 4.\n¹⁵⁶ See Jutta Brunnée/Charlotte Streck, The UNFCCC as a Negotiating Forum: Towards Common but more Differentiated Responsibilities, Climate Policy 13 (2013), 589.\n¹⁵⁷ For an overview, see Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, Technical and Financial Assistance, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.) (note 5), 947.\n¹⁵⁸ It is precisely this dimension of the principle that prompted the United States to declare that Principle 7 Rio Declaration (one prominent articulation of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’) did not ‘imply a recognition or acceptance by the United States of any international obligations or liabilities, or any diminution of the responsibilities of developing countries under international law’, see UN Report of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg, South Africa, 26 August – 4 September 2002, UN Doc.

International Cyberspace Governance\nAs with the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations, standard-setting bodies and multilateral agreements for cyberspace governance already exist or are being created. Their precise scope, authority, and norm-developing processes, however, remain unclear and may therefore benefit from considering the environmental governance experience.\nThere are many intergovernmental organisations, both specialised and general, that address different aspects of cyberspace regulation, however their ability to constitute, or form the foundation for, a universal normative or regulatory regime for cyberspace is doubtful. In terms of technical standard-setting, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a UN specialised agency, has been active “with regard to International Public Policy Issues Pertaining to the Internet and the Management of Internet Resources, including Domain Names and Addresses.”¹⁶⁰ However, it has been criticised for being unable to adjust to the rapid changes in the cyberspace environment,¹⁶¹ being potentially unrepresentative of the views of all of its members, and being ill-equipped to regulate other, non-technical, areas of cyberspace such as international and criminal law.¹⁶² Similarly, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regards “[p]reserving and enhancing the operational stability, reliability, security, and global interoperability of the Internet” as one of its core objectives, and makes binding decisions and policies on various, mostly technical, internet-related issues.¹⁶³ However, its powers continue to be largely derived from, and dependant on, the US government; it has therefore been criticised for essentially being a State actor rather than an “international organization with a fully democratic legitimation.”¹⁶⁴\n---\n¹⁵⁹ See discussion in *Brunnée/Tonpe*, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law (note 155).\n¹⁶⁰ *Sabine von Schorlemer*, Telecommunications, International Regulation, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International LawMPEPIL, Vol. IX (2012), 818 et seq.\n¹⁶¹ *Ibid.*\n¹⁶² *David Gross et al.*, Cyber Security Governance: Existing Structures, International Approaches and the Private Sector, in: Lord/Sharp (eds.) (note 162), 114, 116.\n¹⁶³ *Woltag* (note 81).\n¹⁶⁴ *Ibid.*\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 29\nThese essentially technical bodies,¹⁶⁵ moreover, lack any formal law-making ability. Nonetheless, they have become increasingly politicised, and “distrust by some nations may prevent them from making and enforcing any unilateral policy determinations going forward.”¹⁶⁶ As for more general intergovernmental and regional organisations active in the cyberspace arena, such as the European Union (EU), Council of Europe, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, NATO, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and others, their activities with respect to cyberspace norm-development include issuing reports, organising conferences and summits, devising and promoting policies and conventions, and establishing working groups.¹⁶⁷ However, the respective responsibilities of these organisations, as well as their standard-setting authority, remain unclear; there is often little cooperation among them; and their efforts have been conflicting at times.¹⁶⁸\nThe limited utility of these bodies for cyberspace norm-creation arguably stems from the lack of international consensus on their precise role in cyberspace governance and the appropriate institutional character of any future regulatory regime. At the 2003 and 2005 World Summits on the Information Society (WSIS I and II),¹⁶⁹ for instance, some developed countries, led by the US, adopted a ‘non-governmental’ approach and regarded the private sector influence and in particular the mandate of ICANN as sufficient for regulatory purposes. A majority of developing countries, including China, however, called for a ‘government-centered’ approach involving intergovernmental management of the internet, for example by the ITU.¹⁷⁰ It was ultimately decided to maintain the existing governance system, while establishing a new Internet Governance Forum (IGF) within the UN for\n¹⁶⁵ As well as others, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the Internet Society (ISOC), the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n¹⁶⁶ Deibert/Crete-Nishibata (note 141), 346, 347; Gross et al.

The EU and the US continue to object to ITU governance of the internet,¹⁷² despite growing calls for “an equal role and responsibility for international Internet governance” for all governments,¹⁷³ and the IGF remains merely a forum for discussion, without any powers of supervision or decision-making.¹⁷⁴ As a result, there is still no effective institutional authority that is universally accepted. Ultimately, it has been said that any intergovernmental institution or regime established to regulate and govern cyberspace must have sufficient expertise and technical capability for norm-creation, be perceived as having sufficient legitimacy by the international community, and be able to generate “both high level and specific behavioral norms that are widely accepted as legitimate.”¹⁷⁵\nA possible alternative to an intergovernmental or non-governmental regulatory institution is a treaty-based regime resembling the one established with respect to climate change. The development of such a regime was attempted, for instance, with respect to the regulation of cyber crime through the creation of the Budapest Convention. However, the Convention has only been ratified by 47 States thus far,¹⁷⁶ and is unlikely to be universally adopted since many nations view it as a ‘European’ document.¹⁷⁷ Multilateral treaties to regulate certain aspects of cyberspace, including cyber security, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, have also been suggested by scholars,¹⁷⁸ as well as States such as Russia.

It is not clear as of yet whether this apparent shift, notably in the UN climate change regime, reflects significant and lasting structural change in international environmental treaty making from ‘top-down’ to ‘bottom-up’ approaches. At any rate, in the cyberspace context, treaty-based standard-setting and norm-creation already has been criticised for being too ‘top-down’ for the needs of the medium and, as in the environmental context, as likely to suffer from the “lowest common denominator effect.” Also, creating a multilateral treaty on cyberspace regulation is bound to be a protracted process, and some observers suggest that “an adequate legal framework is only realisable if the foundation is done on an informal law-making basis.” Such informal law-making efforts have in fact been attempted, for instance by China, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, who in 2011 submitted to the UN a proposal for an international code of conduct for information security. While this initiative has since been discussed in various international forums, its viability is doubtful in light of objections by the US and\n179 See e.g., Charles Dunlap, Perspectives for Cyber Strategists on Law for Cyberwar, Strategic Studies Quarterly 5 (2011), 81; Louise Arimatsu, A Treaty for Governing Cyber-Weapons: Potential Benefits and Practical Limitations, in: Czosseck/Ottis/Ziolkowski (eds.)

This type of norm-building effort would have to overcome several obstacles, quite apart from State security interests.

As already mentioned, such reluctance is evident in the disagreements concerning the allocation of a greater governance role to the ITU. Liberal democracies are concerned that the intergovernmental model of internet governance would be “fragmented, slow and not interoperable” and facilitate censorship in authoritarian States.¹⁹¹ In turn, developing States that are not able to deal with cyber threats tend to blame the flaws in internet security on the ICANN-led governance structure and seek a new, government-controlled model.¹⁹² During the 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications,¹⁹³ 89 governments, including many developing States, supported an enhanced role for the ITU over internet regulation and approved revisions to the International Telecommunication Regulations intended to transfer authority for regulating critical aspects of the internet from ICANN to the ITU.¹⁹⁴ 54 countries, including the US, the EU, and most other developed countries, however, advocated for the existing model of internet oversight by multi-stakeholder, non-governmental institutions, and refused to sign the revised text of the Regulations.¹⁹⁵ While some observers considered the outcome of the Conference to signal a “digital Cold War,”¹⁹⁶ the long term implications of these partially adopted revisions have yet to emerge.¹⁹⁷\nMoreover, any conceptual and/or regulatory framework for cyberspace governance would have to include non-State actors, particularly the private sector, in law-making or norm-development processes, as has been explicitly recognised.¹⁹⁸ The 2005 WSIS II Tunis Agenda, for instance, stated that the “international\n¹⁹¹ Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar, Cyber Diplomacy: Agenda, Challenges and Mission, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

The need to bridge the ‘digital divide’, the “social and spatial inequalities in internet access” between developed and developing countries,²⁰⁴ has long been recognised. For instance, the primary objectives of the WSIS I and II conferences were “to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society” and to “pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society.”²⁰⁵ Similarly, the recent NETmundial statement emphasised that “Internet governance institutions\n¹⁹⁹ Tunis Agenda (note 169), para. 29; Woltag (note 81).\n²⁰⁰ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), paras. 58, 59.\n²⁰¹ Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial), NETmundial: The beginning of a process, available at: http://netmundial.br/about/ (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n²⁰² NETmundial, NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement, 24 April 2014, available at: http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n²⁰³ Gross et al.

Here, too, lessons may be learned from the environmental context, including concerning the challenges involved.²⁰⁹\nIn sum, the need for multi-stakeholder involvement and global representation in the development of norms and regulatory mechanisms to govern cyberspace seems to be widely recognised. Less formal frameworks based on ‘soft law’, rather than intergovernmental agreements or institutions, may be more conducive to the development of such norms and mechanisms. Still, the involvement and cooperation of States seems equally important in light of the fact that they retain control over cyberspace infrastructure and the enforcement of cyberspace regulation, and that some form of State responsibility for harmful cyberspace activities emanating from their territories is required. Ultimately, therefore, an effective regulatory framework for cyberspace may require a “multi-layered structure”²¹⁰ that combines informal norm-developing networks, institutions for multi-stakeholder consultation, technical standard-setting bodies, and treaties for intergovernmental cooperation and regulation. As has been suggested elsewhere, “the legal framework [for cyberspace] is to be based on networks established by the concerned communities and linked together through interconnection mechanisms.”²¹¹ Such an interconnected system is necessary in order for international consensus to be achieved on the controversial elements of cyberspace governance discussed in this chapter, including the legal nature and conception of\n²⁰⁶ NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement (note 202).\n²⁰⁷ Warf (note 204), 21.\n²⁰⁸ Antonio Segura-Serrano, Internet Regulation and the Role of International Law, Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law 10 (2006), 191, 259, available at: www.mpii.de/files/pdf3/06_antonov1.pdf (accessed on 21 October 2010).\n²⁰⁹ See supra, notes 153–160 and accompanying text.\n²¹⁰ Weber (note 75), 7.\n²¹¹ Ibid., 4.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ncyberspace and the content and limits of States' obligations in relation to peacetime cyberspace activities.\n## V. Conclusion\nAnd so we return to the no harm rule. Our conclusion is that, at least in the short run, the most promising foundation for international cyberspace law is the harm prevention/due diligence framework that has already gained considerable traction in this context. One of this framework's main advantages is precisely that it does not require wholesale norm-creation or big normative battles, as would be required in an effort to develop norms for the governance of cyberspace itself as a 'shared' or 'commons' resource. The basic norms already exist and apply to activities and harms that involve cyberspace just as to any other activity that occurs under the jurisdiction of States.\nIn this regard, the evolution of international environmental law is instructive, especially in relation to the efforts to flesh out the concepts of harm prevention and due diligence. The Interim Report of the Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet is an excellent illustration of how the same could be accomplished in the cyber context. It articulates adaptations of the general principles of prevention, diligence, procedural obligations, and precaution, including to a multi-stakeholder context, and highlights the need for the development of common standards and best practices. Such standards need not be developed in legally binding form or in a multilateral treaty to be influential, or to flesh out the binding prevention and diligence obligations that exist at custom. As we have shown, although international agreements have played a crucial role in global environmental protection, we appear to be witnessing a certain return to basic principles in the regulation of transboundary environmental harm. The harm prevention/due diligence framework may offer the most suitable approach also in the cyber context, where the potential benefits of a treaty-based approach arguably are outweighed by the drawbacks. The development of cyberspace norms can rather take place through relatively informal legal means in an interconnected, multi-stakeholder system that incorporates States and non-State actors, thereby bypassing lumbering and often stalled treaty-based processes.\nNonetheless, the development of such norms requires some degree of international consensus on the nature of cyberspace governance, the content of basic principles, and the degree and type of regulation required. Unlike the liberal approach adopted by the Advisory Group, it seems that the Tallinn Manual Group\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 37\nof Experts took a more conservative stance and could not agree on certain issues, notably the question whether there is a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent any cyber activity with a ‘negative effect,’ or just a duty not to knowingly allow harmful acts that are underway to continue.²¹² As we have suggested, the different nature, focus, and purpose of these two groups of experts may account for their divergent approaches to States’ obligations in this context. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that some of the Tallinn Manual’s experts have now turned their attention to the application of international law principles, such as the use of countermeasures, to cyberspace activities in peacetime, noting that “few, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold.”²¹³ It will be interesting to see, therefore, if and how the original positions taken in the Tallinn Manual shift in this new context.\nNotwithstanding the usefulness of analogies with international environmental law, cyberspace really is a different kind of space, perhaps leaving for international law only the relatively limited task of holding States to appropriate standards of diligence. Although consensus has yet to be achieved on the content and limits of these norms as they apply to this unique, virtual ‘ecosystem’, we believe that it is worth teaching an old law new tricks!\n²¹² Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, 28, paras. 7, 11.\n²¹³ Schmitt, Cyber Operations (note 2), 1.\nTSpace Research Repository\ntspace.library.utoronto.ca\nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO\nLIBRARIES"

We begin by exploring opportunities for borrowing well-established rules of harm prevention and due diligence from the more advanced, but not dissimilar, field of international environmental law. We argue that these rules can provide a legal foundation for the emerging field of international cyber law, and have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. We then draw on the experience of international environmental law with conceptual notions such as ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, as well as with institutional models such as multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies. We highlight the risks and drawbacks of the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a commons in the ‘virtual’ world of cyberspace.\nKEYWORDS: International Environmental Law, Non-State Actors, State Responsibility, Transboundary Harm Prevention, Due Diligence, Global Commons, Shared Resources, Institutional Framework I. Introduction For international lawyers, the body of rules that should govern cyberspace and harmful cyber activities is still an emerging field. Much has been written in recent years about the circumstances in which cyber actions by States, or attributable to States, should be considered equivalent to ‘armed attacks’ that might trigger ¹ The title is borrowed from *Jody Freeman*, Teaching an Old Law New Tricks, The New York Times, 30 May 2014, available at: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/opinion/teaching-an-old-law-new-tricks.html?emc=edit_tv_20140530&amp;nl=opinion&amp;nlid=28076609 (accessed on 3 July 2014) (commenting on the *Ohama* Administration’s recourse to existing clean air legislation in the face of Congress’ failure to regulate greenhouse gas emissions).\n* Professor of Law and Metcalf Chair in Environmental Law, Faculty of Law, University of Toronto.\n** SJD Candidate, University of Toronto Faculty of Law; Research Fellow, Max Planck Institute for International, European and Regulatory Procedural Law.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 another State’s right to self-defence.² But the legal toolkit of the law on the use of force is not appropriate for dealing with the vast majority of ‘cyber attacks’ and, in any case, is not applicable. Many State-controlled cyber attacks remain below the thresholds of the use of force framework, engaging instead the basic rules requiring that States not cause harm to other States or to areas beyond State jurisdiction. Others may amount not to a ‘use of force,’ but to illegal intervention. The legal consequences, as a result, will be governed by the law of State responsibility, not the law on the use of force. The same applies, arguably, in situations in which a cyber attack might be likened to a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter),³ but not an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 UN Charter.⁴ Furthermore, and quite apart from the question whether actions fall within the ambit of the rules on the use of force or another set of rules, many cyber acts are not undertaken by States or their agents, such that States would be directly responsible for them. Rather, a large proportion of such actions are undertaken by non-State actors, who operate within the territories or otherwise under the jurisdiction of various States. It is the legal regime for this wide array of ‘peacetime’ cyber operations that we consider in this chapter, focusing in particular on the primary obligations of States in relation to non-State actions occurring under their jurisdiction.\nIn exploring this terrain, we draw on the evolution and legal building blocks of international environmental law, which we believe holds a number of important lessons for the emerging field of international cyberspace law. International environmental law evolved in a way that is not dissimilar to what is now occurring in relation to cyberspace. When the first environmental problems arose, there existed no specific rules on environmental impacts in international law. Recourse had to be had to the general rules that govern the rights and obligations attached to ² See e.g., Peter Margulies, Sovereignty and Cyber Attacks: Technology’s Challenge to the Law of State Responsibility, Melbourne Journal of International Law 14 (2013), 1; Michael N.

Schmitt, International Law in Cyberspace: The Kob Speech and Tallinn Manual Juxtaposed, Harvard International Law Journal 54 (2012), 13, 20.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 3 State sovereignty. But dealing with international environmental problems often requires cooperation and finely calibrated response measures that can address complex problems and adapt as the problems or human understanding of them and technical capacity to solve them evolve. International environmental law and the emerging field of international cyberspace law are similar also in some important structural respects. Notably, one of the distinctive features of international environmental law is that it must almost always deal with impacts that are generated by private actors. Furthermore, like the potential consequences of cyber activities, environmental consequences of actions in one State are often felt in another State’s territory or in areas beyond State jurisdiction – the ‘commons’.\nHowever, if one were to undertake an assessment of the state of international environmental law in 2014, one might conclude that, at least in some respects, it is coming full circle. In the 1980s and 1990s, the field experienced rapid growth through the emergence of specialised rules and principles, and the subsequent proliferation and progressive expansion of more and more elaborate treaty regimes and treaty-based standard-setting processes relating to a wide array of regional and global issues.⁵ Today, new environmental agreements have become a rarity and even the further development of existing regimes through treaty-based international environmental law-making seems to have slowed. Indeed, in the case of the perhaps most complex international environmental challenge – climate change – international environmental law appears to be undergoing a fundamental shift from ‘top-down’ standard-setting to a more flexible, ‘bottom-up’ approach.⁶ Whether by coincidence or in response to these patterns, the foundational principles of international environmental law have seen something of a renaissance. In the last few years, States have invoked basic rules concerning transboundary impacts and have turned to international courts and tribunals for clarification of the attendant procedural obligations and due diligence requirements. In other words, some of the recent developments in international environmental law can be traced all the way back to its roots in basic principles concerning sovereign rights and in the iconic cases that developed these principles, such as the *Island of Palmas* arbitration or the *Corfu Channel* case.⁷ ⁵ For an overview on this evolution, see *Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey*, Mapping the Field, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook of International Environmental Law (2008), 1.\n⁶ See *e.g.* *Daniel Bodansky*, A Tale of Two Architectures: The Once and Future U.N.

We first discuss the application of these concepts in the environmental context, considering how they may contribute to the development of norms for the regulation of harmful activities in cyberspace. We will show that the obligations of harm prevention and due diligence have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. Many cyber security and legal scholars,⁸ as well as governments⁹ and international organisations,¹⁰ have recognised States’ obligation to exercise due diligence in order to prevent cyber activities that are harmful to other States from occurring in their territories. We then turn to the notions of ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, concepts that are prominent in international environmental law but have been controversial or of limited relevance in the cyber context. We discuss them mainly to highlight the potential and risks of efforts to regulate not only harm caused by States to other States in relation to cyberspace, but also harm caused to cyberspace itself as a common resource. Finally, drawing on the experience with the design of multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies, we offer some observations on institutional models, and highlight some of the potential drawbacks of these models in the cyber context. At this point, in any case, multilateral treaty-based regimes are largely absent in the ⁸ See e.g., Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace, International Law Studies 89 (2013), 123, 138; Jan Messerschmidt, Hackback: Permitting Retaliatory Hacking by Non-State Actors as Proportionate Countermeasures to Transboundary Cyberharm, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 52 (2013), 275; Margulies (note 2), 16, 18, 19; Katharina Ziolkowski, Ius ad bellum in Cyberspace – Some Thoughts on the “Schmitt-Criteria” for Use of Force, in: Christian Czosseck/Rain Ottis/Katharina Ziolkowski (eds.), 2012 4th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Proceedings (2012), 306, 307; Joanna Kulesza, International Internet Law, Global Change, Peace &amp; Security 24 (2012), 351; Tallinn Manual (note 2), 26–28; Jason Healey/Hannah Pitts, Applying International Environmental Legal Norms to Cyber Statecraft, I/S: A Journal of Law and Policy for the Information Society 8 (2012), 356; Matthew E.

We will suggest that the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a 'commons' is unlikely to be feasible or even desirable. Our goal in this chapter is to explore opportunities and post warning signs for those in the 'virtual' world of cyberspace who seek to learn from the 'real' world of international environmental law.\n## II. The No Harm Rule and Related Principles One of the most straightforward approaches to building international cyberspace law may be to apply the legal principles on harm prevention and due diligence to cyberspace issues. These principles are not only well established, but also anchored in foundational principles of international law that are designed to balance competing sovereign interests. For example, in the *Island of Palmas* case, the Arbitrator held that “[t]erritorial sovereignty [...] has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability.”¹¹ Similarly, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its decision in the *Corfu Channel* case, found that it is “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹² International environmental law, in the absence of specific rules, adapted these general rules to the environmental setting. The salient principles evolved into the proposition that States' rights to use their territories and resources are limited by the obligation to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control do not cause significant transboundary harm. This 'no harm' rule has since been affirmed and fleshed out through a series of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and other international instruments, as well as several arbitral and judicial decisions.¹³ The ICJ confirmed in its advisory opinion on the *Legality of the Threat* or ¹¹ *Island of Palmas Case* (note 7), 839.\n¹² ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 7), 22.\n¹³ See e.g., *Trail Smelter Case* (USA, Canada), Arbitral Award of 16 April 1938 and 11 March 1941, RIAA III, 1905, 1965; *Lac Lamnac Arbitration* (France, Spain), Arbitral Award of 16 November 1957, GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 Use of Nuclear Weapons that “the general obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control respect the environment of other States or of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the environment.”¹⁴ The Court reiterated this conclusion in its decision in the Gabilikovo-Nagymaros case and its decision in the Pulp Mills case.¹⁵ The International Law Commission’s (ILC) Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities too confirmed States’ obligation to “take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof.”¹⁶ The key point for our present purposes is that looking to international environmental law ultimately means turning to basic principles, applicable to any harm caused to States’ territories, including cyber-related harm, without the need for ‘norm creation’. We believe that this fact alone is a crucial advantage. In addition, international environmental law offers rich State practice and judicial opinions that provide guidance on the nature of the due diligence obligations that flow from the exercise of sovereign rights. Two recent cases are of particular interest in this respect – the ICJ’s Pulp Mills case and the advisory opinion on Activities in the Area of the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS Chamber).¹⁷ The discussion below focuses on the elements of each decision that flesh out the no harm rule with respect to due diligence, the attendant procedural obligations, and the relationship between harm prevention and precaution. As we proceed, we explore the extent to which the approach in international environmental law finds parallels in the emerging international cyberspace law.\nRIAA XII, 281; Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, UN Doc.

Harm Prevention and Due Diligence in International Cyberspace Law In the Pulp Mills decision, the ICJ emphasised two important features of the no harm rule. First, it encompasses an obligation to prevent harm. Second, “the principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory.”¹⁸ This obligation to act with due diligence entails “not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators.”¹⁹ The ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion on Activities in the Area, in turn, was concerned with the responsibility of States to take appropriate measures to ensure that private entities operating in the deep seabed do not cause harm in that ‘commons’ area. Perhaps most importantly for present purposes, the Chamber highlighted the contextual nature of the due diligence standard. The Chamber observed that the due diligence standard “may change over time as measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or technological knowledge. It may also change in relation to the risks involved in the activity [...] [and] be more severe for the riskier activities.”²⁰ Due diligence may vary also in light of the capacity of the State concerned, although this point appears to be more controversial. Some leading commentators on international environmental law, citing numerous international instruments that accommodate developing countries’ lesser technological and regulatory capacity, including the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change,²¹ compared the flexibility of the due diligence standard to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.²² However, the ITLOS Chamber made a point of emphasising that different treatment for developed and developing States is warranted only when the underlying international legal obligations provide for it.²³ ¹⁸ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 101.\n¹⁹ Ibid., para. 197.\n²⁰ ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), para. 117.\n²¹ See supra, note 13.\n²² Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell, International Law and the Environment (3rd ed. 2009), 149.\n²³ ITLOS, Activities in the Area (note 17), paras. 151–163.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 The general requirement of harm prevention, and its attendant due diligence obligation, has already been recognised as a basis for States' obligations with respect to cyberspace activities. The Ad hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (Advisory Group), established by the Council of Europe, explicitly referred to the use of the no harm principle in the environmental law context, and relied on it to “underline the primary nature of the proposed commitments of a state to prevent, manage and respond to significant transboundary disruption of or interference with the stability, robustness, resilience and openness of the Internet.”²⁴ Some States have also recognised a general due diligence obligation in cyberspace. The United States (US), for instance, considers cyber security due diligence to be an emerging norm according to which “States should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse,”²⁵ while recognising that “unique attributes of networked technology require additional work to clarify how these norms apply.”²⁶ A duty “not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security or proliferate information weapons or related technologies” was also recognised by China and Russia in 2011.²⁷ Russia argued for inclusion of a more specific duty to “take all necessary steps to prevent any destructive information action originating from their own territory or using the information infrastructure under their jurisdiction, as well as cooperate to locate the source of computer attacks carried out with the use of their territory, to repel these attacks and to eliminate their consequences” in a proposed international information security convention.²⁸ The obligation to prevent harm to other States from cyber attacks and other malicious cyber activities conducted in their territories is generally considered to ²⁴ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 64.\n²⁵ US International Strategy for Cyberspace (note 9), 10.\n²⁶ Ibid., 9.\n²⁷ United Nations General Assembly, Letter dated 12 September 2011 from the Permanent Representatives of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, UN Doc.

Specifically, it noted that “an efficient observance of a due diligence commitment is understood as the implementation of those measures which would be commensurate with the overall capabilities of the country concerned to address the risks,”³⁸ and that legislative, administrative, or other action necessary to implement a States’ due diligence commitments “should be subject to the capabilities of the state concerned.”³⁹ The scope of States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations in cyberspace were also considered in the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (Tallinn Manual), a document prepared by an independent international group of experts comprised of practitioners and scholars (Tallinn Manual Group of Experts).⁴⁰ While the Manual deals primarily with cyber warfare, it recognises the no harm obligation as a rule of “a general international legal nature” applicable to “the relationship between states, cyber infrastructure, and cyber operations” and extending to “all cyber activities from one State’s territory that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another States’ territory [...] irrespective of the attributability of the acts in question to a State.”⁴¹ Again in keeping with the approach in international environmental law, the Tallinn Manual considers that the no harm prevention and due diligence obligations encompass the requirement that States “use all means at [their] disposal ³⁶ Ibid., paras. 71–73.\n³⁷ Ibid., para. 74.\n³⁸ Ibid.\n³⁹ Ibid., para. 77.\n⁴⁰ Tallinn Manual (note 2).\n⁴¹ Ibid., 15, 26, 27.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 11 to require [private entities]” to take remedial action to terminate a harmful activity.⁴² The Manual also addresses one important issue that has remained underspecified thus far: the level of harm required to trigger the harm prevention duty. In international environmental law, the *Trail Smelter Case* posited a “serious consequence” standard with respect to transboundary air pollution,⁴³ although today a “significant harm” standard, intended to exclude *de minimis* harm, is more common.⁴⁴ The Tallinn Manual only requires a “negative effect” to result from the cyberspace activity, which need not involve physical damage to objects or injuries to individuals.⁴⁵ However, the Manual does not specify what harm *would* be considered as having a sufficiently “negative effect” in this context.\n## 2. Areas of Controversy It appears then that the duty to prevent harm and the due diligence obligation are already informing the cyberspace discourse, thereby eliminating, at least in part, the need to ‘reinvent the wheel’ with regard to the regulation of harmful conduct in cyberspace. However, while the relevance of these principles in the cyberspace context has been widely recognised, their precise nature and scope remain contested, and therefore in need of further development and clarification. In this regard, there appears to be several broad areas of controversy, all related in one way or another to the challenges of attribution and to questions surrounding how heavy a harm prevention burden to place on States in relation to non-State activities. After all, hackers and other cyber actors can draw from a rich menu of options for concealing their identities and evading attribution.⁴⁶ Hence, some have doubted the political as well as practical feasibility of no harm and due diligence obligations of States in the cyberspace context, as opposed to reliance on the stringent requirements of the law of State responsibility for direct attribution of harmful actions to States.⁴⁷ A viable due diligence framework, some ⁴² *Ibid.*, 28, para. 9.\n⁴³ *Healey/Pitts* (note 8), 378.\n⁴⁴ ILC Draft Articles Transboundary Harm (note 16), 41–42.\n⁴⁵ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 5.\n⁴⁶ For example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets can be intercepted or spoofed mid-route, making it difficult to trace them back to their source. Alternatively, reliance on “botnets”, robot networks of malware-infected personal computers, allows attackers to remain anonymous by assuming the identity of someone else in order to perform malicious actions. See *Shackelford/Andres* (note 2), 982 and *Mauno Pibelgas*, Back-Tracing and Anonymity in Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 28), 46, 47. We are grateful to *Alex Ognihone* for assisting us with this point.\n⁴⁷ *Ziolkowski* (note 8), 307.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 argue, may be difficult to achieve as “it is unclear that any state is prepared (politically or technologically) to take full responsibility for all harm emanating from gateway routers, very small aperture terminals [...] wireless mobile devices, and other devices within its territory or jurisdiction.”⁴⁸ Therefore, States may not be willing to agree on criteria for a more expansive regime of indirect responsibility for non-State actors’ cyber activities, based on the ‘no harm’ principle.⁴⁹ In short, it may seem sensible and even self-evident that States should enact and enforce criminal laws regarding cross-border cyber attacks, in line with the ICJ’s finding in *Pulp Mills* that diligence requires States to “adopt appropriate rules and measures” and “take all appropriate measures to enforce” them.⁵⁰ But it may be exceedingly difficult to define in a concrete and also manageable manner what exactly are “appropriate” standards and efforts to prevent harm from cyber attacks and other hostile acts. And, even if agreed, such a general standard may not suffice. “Because of the speed with which cyber weapons could be deployed,” some observers claim, “relying only upon cyber due diligence presents too great a risk of intrusion by unfriendly actors.”⁵¹ This challenge is further complicated by “the nature of harmful cyber acts, especially time and space compression, and their often-unprecedented character,”⁵² as well as precisely “the ease with which deception can be mounted through cyber infrastructure,”⁵³ which may make it impossible for a State to prevent injury to another State.⁵⁴ Some interpretations of due diligence in cyberspace have attempted to take the unique nature of cyber acts into account. For instance, the Advisory Group has limited the applicability of States’ “due diligence commitments of prevention, management and response” to situations where the State is the actual operator or manager of critical internet resources. Where it is not, the Group suggests that “the principle of subsidiarity or non-involvement of states in the ordinary administration of the network or operational issues” prevails, recognising the fact that “the private sector takes the lead in the day-to-day operations of the ⁴⁸ *Sean Kanuck*, Sovereign Discourse on Cyber Conflict Under International Law, Texas Law Review (Tex.

While the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts agreed that the obligations would be triggered if a State had “actual knowledge” of the acts in question, it could not agree on whether they would also obtain if a State had only “constructive (‘should have known’) knowledge,” for instance where a State fails to use due care in policing cyber activities on its territory and is therefore unaware of the acts.59 Some have argued that “a state’s duty to prevent cyber attacks should not be based on a state’s knowledge of a particular cyber attack before it occurs, but rather on its actions to prevent cyber attacks in general,” since such attacks are “extremely difficult for host-states to detect prior to the commission of a specific attack.”60 While this approach would be in line with the general thrust of the harm prevention and due diligence obligations as they have developed in international environmental law, it has been criticised for going too far in reducing the knowledge requirement in the cyber context.61 Others have contended that “presumptive knowledge is sufficient to trigger the duty” if the cyber attack can reasonably be considered to belong to a series of cyber attacks” originating from a State’s territory.62 The position of the Advisory Group in this regard is close to the stance of international environmental law; it is that “the disruption and interference should be foreseeable and the state concerned must know or should have known under the circumstances that the given activity involved a risk of significant consequences.”63 GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 Finally, and relatedly, there seems to be a lack of consensus regarding the precise scope of the no harm and due diligence obligations in cyberspace. Notably, given the “difficulty of mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible threats,” the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts could not agree on whether or not these general obligations should be applied to “situations in which the relevant acts are merely prospective” as opposed to those that are already underway.⁶⁴ In other words, the Group could not agree on a general precautionary duty of States to undertake all appropriate measures with regard to potential cyber threats at an early stage and before a concrete risk of harm occurs,⁶⁵ a concept with roots in international environmental law that we discuss in more detail below. Furthermore, the Group could not reach a consensus on the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations to States through which cyber operations merely transit, in light of the “unique routing processes of cyber transmissions.”⁶⁶ By contrast, certain scholars have suggested that “reasonable measures to prevent [...] prospective acts are required”⁶⁷ and that even a mere transit State “has an obligation to prevent a cyber attack.”⁶⁸ However, there is no consensus on this issue as of yet.⁶⁹ These contentious issues, among others, must be resolved in order for the no harm principle to effectively regulate activities in cyberspace. International consensus should be achieved on the general content and limits of the due diligence standard applicable to cyberspace. Agreement is also needed on the relationship between States’ responsibility for failure to take diligent harm prevention measures and their responsibility for non-State acts directly attributable to them under the law of State responsibility. Arguably, both types of responsibility obtain, and each applies to a distinct type of ‘failure’ by a State. But, absent consensus on the issue, developing an effective normative and regulatory framework for cyberspace on the basis of the duty to prevent harm and the law of State responsibility will be difficult.⁷⁰ With the caveats noted above, the development of these principles in the environmental context, and particularly the contextual approach adopted by the ITLOS Chamber’s advisory opinion, may be ⁶⁴ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, para. 7.\n⁶⁵ Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 169.\n⁶⁶ Tallinn Manual (note 2), 28, 29, para. 12.\n⁶⁷ Pirker (note 29), 208.\n⁶⁸ Ibid., 209.\n⁶⁹ Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 137, 138.\n⁷⁰ Kirsch (note 2), 638; Kanuck (note 48), 1592; Kulesza, State Responsibility for Cyber-Attacks on International Peace and Security (note 8), 151; Gary Brown/Keira Poellet, The Customary International Law of Cyberspace, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 126, 141.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 15 helpful in this regard. Applying such an approach in the cyberspace context could allow for a flexible, contextual application of the due diligence standard. One might also envision a contextual interpretation of the attribution rules in the law of State responsibility in accordance with new technological developments and the evolving nature of cyberspace. However, as in the debates surrounding the attribution of non-State actor conduct for the purposes of the law on the use of force, many States and other observers will likely have misgivings about modifying (and thereby potentially eroding) what is meant to be a general framework for specific purposes. The due diligence standard is therefore likely to be the most promising conceptual hook for the necessary fine-tuning; the precise contours of this standard could change over time and in accordance with the gravity of the transboundary cyber harm caused.\n## B. Procedural Obligations The no harm rule entails a series of procedural obligations, including the obligation to notify or warn potentially affected States,⁷¹ the obligation to exchange information, to consult and negotiate,⁷² and the general obligation to cooperate to prevent harm.⁷³ The Pulp Mills case confirms that these procedural obligations, on the one hand, have a separate existence as customary norms (that can be violated on their own terms – even when harm is ultimately not caused), and, on the other hand, are implied in the substantive obligation to prevent environmental harm (e.g. a State may have to notify or consult with another about potential harm in order to meet its obligation of diligent harm prevention).⁷⁴ In the cyberspace context, similar cooperative requirements and processes have been emphasised in light of its rapidly changing technological nature,⁷⁵ its “global character”,⁷⁶ and because protection from cyber threats requires “collaborative relationships for exchanging cyber defense data and an ability to establish trusted relationships.”⁷⁷ Accordingly, the duty to cooperate has been considered to be ⁷¹ ICJ, Corfu Channel (note 7).\n⁷² Lac Lamocx Arbitration (note 13).\n⁷³ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), para. 145 (tracing the obligation to cooperate to the good faith principle in international law).\n⁷⁴ ICJ, Pulp Mills (note 15), paras. 78, 79.\n⁷⁵ Rolf Weber, Future Design of Cyberspace Law, Journal of Politics and Law 5 (2012), 1.\n⁷⁶ Ziolkowski (note 29), 177.\n⁷⁷ Diego Vázquez et al., Conceptual Framework for Cyber Defense Information Sharing within Trust Relationships, in: Czosseck/Ottis/Ziolkowski (eds.) (note 8), 2012, 4th International GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 relevant as a general principle of international law,⁷⁸ as well as a legal obligation of States in the arena of cyber security.⁷⁹ Reliance on traditional means of international cooperation in areas such as cybercrime, however, has been viewed as incapable of offering the timely response needed.⁸⁰ Therefore, new cooperative mechanisms have been developed in this context, such as the 24/7 international assistance network established under the Budapest Convention for investigations and evidence collection concerning cybercrime.⁸¹ This broad duty to cooperate has been recognised as part and parcel of the obligation to prevent harm in the cyberspace context.⁸² It includes the obligation to undertake a risk assessment, to exchange information, to inform, notify, and consult other States in concrete cases of risk of significant transboundary harm,⁸³ and to cooperate “with the victim-states of cyber attacks that originated from within their borders” during investigations and prosecutions.⁸⁴ The Advisory Group, for instance, stated as general requirements that “States should co-operate mutually, in good faith and in consultation with each other and with concerned stakeholders at all stages of designing and implementing policies in relation to the Internet,”⁸⁵ and “should take all reasonable measures to provide prior and timely notification and relevant information to states that may be potentially affected.”⁸⁶ These requirements envision “participation of states within whose jurisdiction disruptions or interferences with the Internet stability, robustness and resilience may originate, and states likely to be affected or actually affected, in action aimed at prevention of, preparedness for and response to risks and threats to critical Internet resources.”⁸⁷ Conference on Cyber Conflict Proceedings (NATO CCD COE Publications 2012), 429.\n⁷⁸ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 75.\n⁷⁹ Ziolkowski (note 29), 177, 178.\n⁸⁰ United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime: Draft, xi, available at: http://www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/UNODC_CCPCJ_EG.4_2013/CYBERCRIME_STUDY_210213.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n⁸¹ Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Art. 35; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Internet, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL), Vol. VI (2012), 227.\n⁸² Ziolkowski (note 29), 186.\n⁸³ Ibid., 169; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 376.\n⁸⁴ Sklerov (note 29), 62; Heintschel von Heinegg (note 8), 135.\n⁸⁵ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 18.\n⁸⁶ Ibid., 21.\n⁸⁷ Ibid., para. 75.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 17 In more practical terms, the Advisory Group noted that States should, in particular, “co-operate in the creation of public awareness about the risks and opportunities of cross border Internet traffic and the development of educational tools to enable citizens to share responsibilities for a safer Internet,” as well as take legislative action in order to overcome barriers to international cooperation.⁸⁸ Moreover, “states may establish mechanisms that are suitable for monitoring the implementation of their preparedness and prevention commitments in respect of disruptions and interference with the infrastructure of the Internet.”⁸⁹ The Advisory Group also set out detailed standards for information exchange and coordinated action, some of which were explicitly ‘borrowed’ from the international environmental context.⁹⁰ These include the development of common rules and practices for information sharing, incident reporting, and for deploying internet resilience technologies; timely notification of transboundary risks and vulnerabilities; assessment of possible or actual adverse transboundary effects; coordination of emergency and response policies; and mutual consultations and assistance.⁹¹ Some of these obligations have also been included in the Budapest Convention.⁹² The reality remains, however, that some States from which cyber attacks originate refuse to accept responsibility or cooperate with investigations,⁹³ that a clear framework for effective and timely exchange of information on critical infrastructure protection is lacking,⁹⁴ and that outside the realm of cyber crime there has been little international cooperation in reducing the transboundary impact of malicious activities in cyberspace.⁹⁵ Since States continue to have “wide discretion as to how to fulfill the legal obligation to cooperate in the cyber realm,”⁹⁶ there is a clear need for consensus to be reached on a uniform standard for cooperation. Such consensus, moreover, cannot include only States. In light of the dominant role of the private sector and civil society in internet governance, a multi-stakeholder approach must be applied in the discussion and formulation of ⁸⁸ Ibid., paras. 76, 79.\n⁸⁹ Ibid., para. 80.\n⁹⁰ Ibid., para. 93.\n⁹¹ Ibid., paras. 91–102.\n⁹² Such as mutual assistance, see Convention on Cybercrime (note 31), Chapter III.\n⁹³ Kirsch (note 2), 638.\n⁹⁴ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 91.\n⁹⁵ Heaby/Pitts (note 8), at 366.\n⁹⁶ Ziolkowski (note 29), 178.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 procedural obligations such as the duty to cooperate.⁹⁷ This approach requires public-private collaboration, including internet service provider assistance, as well as data exchanges and partnerships, to form part of any international legal framework or standard for cyberspace cooperation.⁹⁸ ## C. Precaution In the environmental context, at least, due diligence also appears to have become a conceptual bridge between the duty to prevent harm and the proposition that States, in certain circumstances, also must take precautionary measures. As traditionally conceived, the no harm rule is engaged when there is a known or objectively determined risk of significant environmental harm.⁹⁹ By contrast, the precautionary principle, as articulated in Principle 15 Rio Declaration,¹⁰⁰ is triggered by ‘threats of serious or irreversible damage’ and its lower evidentiary threshold could strengthen the protective potential of international environmental law. However, debate persists among States and academic commentators as to the precise contents of the principle, and whether or not it has acquired customary law status.¹⁰¹ International courts and tribunals, while acknowledging the wisdom of precautionary approaches to environmental protection,¹⁰² have avoided pronouncing on its legal status.¹⁰³ The ITLOS Chamber, in the *Activities in the Area* advisory opinion, suggested that there was a trend “towards making [the precautionary] approach part of customary international law,”¹⁰⁴ and observed that it “is also an integral part of the general obligation of due diligence.”¹⁰⁵ This obligation requires States “to take all --- ⁹⁷ Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, *Principles of International Internet Law*, German Law Journal 11 (2010), 1245, 1261, 1262.\n⁹⁸ *Eneken Tikk*, *Establishing Rules for Cyber Security*, in: Scott Jasper (ed.), *Conflict and Cooperation in the Global Commons* (2012), 222–224.\n⁹⁹ See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 153.\n¹⁰⁰ Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 15.\n¹⁰¹ See *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 22), 154–164.\n¹⁰² See ICJ, *Gablikoro-Nagymaros* (note 15), para. 140; id., *Pulp Mills* (note 15), paras. 164, 185.

Indeed, it has been suggested that States are obliged “to take (general) precautionary measures with regard to potential cyber threats posing a significant risk of damage of a transboundary nature.”¹¹⁰ This obligation has also been said to form part of States’ due diligence obligation in this context,¹¹¹ and to include “the duty to undertake all appropriate regulatory measures at an early stage, and well before the (concrete) risk of harm occurs,”¹¹² although the precise degree of knowledge of such a risk required from States in order to trigger the duty, as already mentioned, remains controversial.¹¹³ Precautionary measures in this context would include “the implementation of strategic, political, organisational, administrative, legal and technical measures [...] aimed at general prevention” of misuse of cyberspace for malicious activities by non-State actors,¹¹⁴ although what precisely such measures would entail remains to be clarified by “future State practice.”¹¹⁵ Such State practice can be seen, for instance, in recent domestic legislative initiatives attempting to impose a legal duty on relevant enterprises to frequently update their systems to the latest security standards and to ¹⁰⁶ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁷ Ibid.\n¹⁰⁸ The ITLOS Chamber may have spelled out what the ICJ merely alluded to in its *Gablōkoon-Nagymarus* and *Pulp Mills* decisions by noting that ‘in the field of environmental protection, vigilance and prevention are required on account of the often irreversible character of damage and of the limitations inherent in the very mechanism of reparation of this type of damage’.

A “precautionary approach” was expressly recognised by the Advisory Group, which considered the identification, assessment, and notification of possible or actual risks of adverse transboundary effects on the internet, and the prior and timely notification of such risks, to form part of States’ prevention obligation in cyberspace.¹¹⁹ The Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, as we have already noted,¹²⁰ adopted a more conservative approach and did not encompass prospective acts or acts of which States ‘should have known’ in the obligation to prevent cyber harm to other States.¹²¹ Therefore, while both groups of experts seem to agree on the basic need for States to exercise due diligence in order to prevent transboundary cyber harm, their interpretations of the nature and scope of these obligations diverge.\nOne possible explanation for this divergence is the different nature, purpose, and mandate of each of these groups of experts. The Advisory Group, comprised of European experts in fields such as law, information, and telecommunications, was set up by the Steering Committee on the Media and New Communication Service of the Council of Europe.

In so doing, it focused on States’ due diligence and procedural obligations while excluding such controversial issues as State responsibility, cyber warfare, and countermeasures.¹²³ The Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, on the other hand, was comprised of both European and non-European legal and technical experts (but all from Western States), many of whom with experience or expertise related to armed conflict, national defence, or security policy.¹²⁴ It was set up by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, an international military organisation,¹²⁵ and tasked with producing “a manual on the law governing cyber warfare.”¹²⁶ Accordingly, the Manual explicitly excluded any detailed discussion of cyber activities “that occur below the level of a ‘use of force’.”¹²⁷ While it addressed the application of general international legal rules to cyberspace in times of peace, including States’ harm prevention and due diligence obligations, the focus of the Manual was on cyber warfare and the application of international laws of armed conflict to it. Having to decide on such controversial issues, which were avoided by the Advisory Group, as well as the background of some of the experts in the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts, may have influenced the tone of the Manual and its perspective, resulting in a more conservative and narrow stance with respect to States’ obligations in cyberspace.¹²⁸ As one commentator noted, “the Experts were very cautious to avoid taking any risks when drafting the rules” and, since unanimity was required to formulate the rules, “the most controversial international law aspects of cyber operations were therefore left unresolved.”¹²⁹ The different approaches taken by the Advisory Group and the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts reflect some of the underlying disagreements and confusion that ¹²³ The Advisory Group explicitly drew a distinction between States’ commitments to prevent and manage cross-border disruptions of or interferences with the internet and international law rules governing responsibility for internationally wrongful acts, Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), 20, para. 85.\n¹²⁴ See “the international group of experts and participants” in the Tallinn Manual (note 2), x–xiii.\n¹²⁵ Although the Tallinn Manual does not represent the views of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, its sponsoring nations, or NATO, Tallinn Manual (note 2), 11.\n¹²⁶ Ibid., (note 2), at 1.\n¹²⁷ Ibid., 4.\n¹²⁸ It has been suggested, for instance, that there may be an overtly close connection between the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts and the military and a potential resulting bias in the substance of the Manual, Pirkor (note 29), 190.\n¹²⁹ Marco Rossini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (2014), 31.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 persist in the cyberspace context with regard to States' harm prevention and due diligence obligations, what precisely these obligations entail, and when they apply. Some doctrine emanating from the US, as well as European politicians and international law scholars, view cyberspace as\"the fifth battlefield\"and therefore, like the Tallinn Manual, emphasise States' obligations in terms of use of force, self-defence, and countermeasures, rather than in terms of harm prevention and due diligence. An opposite view is that said to be represented by the Advisory Group, which\"holds that states are obliged to observe due diligence in preventing cyber attacks and they may only be held responsible for a cyber attack if it can be demonstrated that they have failed to meet the due diligence standard.\"¹³⁰ ## III. Cyberspace as a Global Commons or a Shared Resource?\nIn the environmental context, it is accepted that States have an obligation to prevent harm to the territory of another State, or to areas beyond national control – global commons.¹³¹ However, the full legal ramifications of this ‘commons’ aspect of the harm prevention obligation are far from settled.¹³² Notably, there is no direct State practice on the question of who can invoke a State’s responsibility for harm to the commons. When it comes to applying the rules concerning harm to the commons to cyberspace, a prior question looms large: Is cyberspace a ‘commons’ in the first place? Alternatively, might it be a ‘shared resource’ of States?\nSome have identified the cyber domain as a global commons, together with the high seas, air, and space, and view these as “domains that are not controlled by any single state” but are rather “universally needed and thus should be shared.”¹³³ The Advisory Group, for instance, regarded “critical Internet resources” as global commons “under the stewardship of the international Internet community as a whole.”¹³⁴ The US and Japan have also regarded cyberspace as a global commons; ¹³⁰ Kulesza, International Internet Law (note 8), 359–360.\n¹³¹ See Stockholm Declaration (note 13), Principle 21; Rio Declaration (note 13), Principle 2.

From a definitional, or practical, perspective, the cyber domain is distinguishable from the other global commons on account of being a human creation and involving both physical infrastructure located in national territories and intangible features that transcend territorial borders.¹³⁶ Furthermore, unlike the sea, Antarctica, and outer space, “there is a ‘population’ or community in cyberspace and [...] [it] is not an entirely independent international space or concern that is beyond national regulation.”¹³⁷ According to some observers, in order for cyberspace to become a global commons, “long-established rights of sovereignty and property ownership recognized by the numerous domestic jurisdictions involved” in cyberspace would have to be overridden and legitimate and illegitimate users would have to be positively identified for the enforcement of norms or collective solutions. Neither of these conditions is currently satisfied in the cyberspace context.¹³⁸ From a conceptual perspective, the identification of cyberspace as a global commons has thus far failed to clarify States’ obligations. The Advisory Group, for instance, emphasised the need for harm to be caused to another State, rather than to cyberspace as a resource, in order to trigger States’ obligations, notwithstanding its explicit reference to the internet as a global commons.¹³⁹ Moreover, the global commons concept does not necessarily make cyberspace any easier to regulate.¹⁴⁰ It has been argued, for instance, that while in the context of other global commons, users have “successfully self-organized for sustainable use of a commons” in the absence of government control, in the case of cyberspace the “affordances of the cyber technologies — that is, the way the technologies enable their use — and the mentalities of the users” have resulted in a “tragedy of the commons” that prevents effective self-organisation for sustainable use of ¹³⁵ United States Department of Defense, The Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support (2005), 12, available at: https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=454976 (accessed on 23 October 2015); Ziolkowski (note 29), 183.\n¹³⁶ Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 22–23.\n¹³⁷ Kam Wai Chik, ‘Customary internet-ional law’: Creating a body of customary law for cyberspace, Part 1: Developing rules for transitioning custom into law, Computer Law &amp; Security Review 26 (2010), 3, 13.\n¹³⁸ Kanuck (note 48), 1577, 1579.\n¹³⁹ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), para. 69.\n¹⁴⁰ Aatola/Sipilä/Vuorisalo (note 133), 23.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 cyberspace.¹⁴¹ The concept of cyberspace as a commons, therefore, does not seem to have contributed much to the development of clear norms to regulate its use, and may even hinder this process.¹⁴² Some academic observers have warned against what they view as a gradual move away from the perception of cyberspace as a global commons and toward a State-based governance regime, considering it to constitute “norm regression” in the global governance of cyberspace.¹⁴³ But however intuitive it may seem to think of cyberspace as a type of commons, the idea remains controversial and in any event would not necessarily advance the effort to develop norms for the regulation of cyberspace, such as the duty to prevent harm. Even in the environmental context, the legal status of spaces or resources beyond the exclusive jurisdiction of States tends to be controversial. Aside from well-established examples of geographic areas like the high seas, Antarctica, or outer space, States have avoided the ‘commons’ label, precisely because it implies both the absence of sovereignty and certain collective rights and obligations.¹⁴⁴ One might alternatively consider the potential relevance of the notion of ‘shared resource’. This concept certainly fits key aspects of cyberspace, perhaps better than the notion of a ‘commons’, because it applies to resources that are under the jurisdiction of States but are quintessentially transboundary in nature. This paradigm permits States that share such a resource to devise norms and rules that take into account their respective sovereign interests, their mutual interests in the use and protection of the resource, and their obligations under international law. In the environmental context, States have often avoided using this umbrella concept, arguably because of the implication of less than full sovereignty and the broader implications the concept might have for other resources, and have used more issue-specific concepts, like ‘international watercourse’.¹⁴⁵ ¹⁴¹ Roger Hurwitz, Depleted Trust in the Cyber Commons, Strategic Studies Quarterly 6 (2012), 20, 21; Healey/Pitts (note 8), 366.\n¹⁴² But see Scott Shackelford, Toward Cyberpeace: Managing Cyberattacks Through Polycentric Governance, American University Law Review 62 (2013), 1273, 1293 (suggesting that cyberspace be treated as ‘pseudocommons’, “comprised of a shared global infrastructure that is controlled by public and private entities subject to national and international regulations”).\n¹⁴³ Ronald Deibert/Masashi Crets-Nishibata, Global Governance and the Spread of Cyberspace Controls, Global Governance 18 (2012), 341, 343, 345; Joanna Kuleczy/Roy Balleste, Signs and Portents in Cyberspace: The Rise of Jus Internet as a New Order in International Law, Fordham Intellectual Property, Media and Entertainment Law Journal 23 (2013), 1320.\n¹⁴⁴ Brunnie, Common Areas, Common Heritage, Common Concern (note 132).\n¹⁴⁵ See Jutta Brunnie/Stephen Toupe, Environmental Security and Freshwater Resources: Ecosystem Regime Building, American Journal of International Law 91 (1997), 26; Kanuck (note 48), 1580.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 25 Nonetheless, this conception could be helpful in relation to cyberspace since it would allow States to maintain certain sovereign rights, although these would not be absolute and would be balanced against the interests of other States and the international community.¹⁴⁶ While the concept of ‘shared resource’ is not a panacea for the difficulties already discussed with respect to defining and applying the no harm and due diligence obligations to cyberspace, it has been suggested that such a tailored model may present an alternative avenue for establishing States’ legal obligation to cooperate in this context through such principles as the sustainable and equitable use of shared resources. These principles may encourage States to undertake all necessary means in order to preserve the internet for future generations, which implies a proactive countering of cyber threats, an obligation to take precautionary measures, and restraint from any action that could hamper the availability and reliability of the internet.¹⁴⁷ In short, a ‘shared resource’ model could promote stewardship in cyberspace, rather than sovereignty.¹⁴⁸ While it may not resolve fundamental definitional issues, such a model could provide an alternative conceptual framework that shifts the focus from States’ obligations to each other to States’ obligations to cyberspace as a shared resource, thereby facilitating the development of norms and rules for its governance.\n## IV. Institutional Frameworks It has been said that “there are structural similarities between the milieus of international law and of the Internet: neither is completely hierarchical and both must deal with ‘commons’ problems.”¹⁴⁹ Whether the future cyberspace governance regime will be grounded in the no harm and due diligence framework or in a ‘commons’ framework that may evolve over time, an additional question concerns the appropriate process for developing and maintaining the attendant normative and regulatory framework. International environmental law offers some models for governance regimes, and we thus turn to an examination of its normative and regulatory structures.\n¹⁴⁶ Ibid., 1580.\n¹⁴⁷ Ziolkowski (note 29), 167, 179–181.\n¹⁴⁸ See Duncan Hollis, Stewardship versus Sovereignty?

International Environmental Governance In the environmental context, so-called framework agreements have played a prominent role. They help in dealing with complex, evolving issues by allowing parties to begin by defining the common concern at hand, agreeing on principles to guide States’ actions, and establishing institutions and decision-making procedures for subsequent regime-development.^[150]^ Many environmental regimes create, or collaborate with, bodies that facilitate exchange among scientific or technical experts. Such bodies are important in building consensus around the nature of collective concerns and the collective action that is required to address them. Scientific or technical expert bodies also make important contributions in the further elaboration, refinement, or adjustment of regulatory strategies.^[151]^ In the cyber context one could easily see the usefulness of such an approach, for example in relation to the constantly shifting needs of cyber security and the related due diligence standards. Environmental regime development *per se* is usually in the hands of a plenary body, which facilitates regular, long-term engagements between technical experts, policy-makers, lawyers, and relevant non-State actors (international organisations, non-governmental organisations, or business entities).^[152]^ Although, in a formal sense, law-making remains in the hands of States, non-State actors can provide input into law-making processes or even help shape their outcomes.^[153]^ Environmental standard-setting itself occurs through decisions of plenary bodies, without subsequent formal consent by individual States. In most cases, the resulting standards are not legally binding, notwithstanding the mandatory language they may contain.^[154]^ This approach facilitates agreement on collective action and standards that are applicable to all parties – an important feature for efforts to address collective concerns. Equally important is that soft regulatory processes enable speedier regime development and adjustment than processes that require subsequent ratification by individual States. In the cyber context both of these features could be significant, since (as in the environmental context) cyber ^[150]^ See *Jutta Brunnée*, Toward Effective International Environmental Law – Trends and Developments, in: Steven Kennett (ed.), Law and Process in Environmental Management (1993), 222–229.\n^[151]^ For a detailed discussion, see *ead*, Coping with Consent: Lawmaking under Multilateral Environmental Agreements, Leiden Journal of International Law 15 (2002), 1.\n^[152]^ *Ibid.*, 15, 16.\n^[153]^ *Ibid.*, 14.\n^[154]^ *Ibid.*, 25, 26.\nTeaching an Old Law New Tricks 27 problems, or relevant technical understanding or capacity, as well as political dynamics, typically evolve over time, often rapidly.\nWith respect to treaty making, the experience with MEAs shows that even an apparently straightforward matter as agreeing on the nature and scope of the underlying concern and the principles that should govern it may be fraught with difficulties. In the climate context, for example, it took more than twenty years for parties to agree on the precise meaning of the regime objective – to forestall dangerous climate change – and parties are still struggling to achieve consensus on the parameters of one of the regime’s core principles, the notion of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities’.¹⁵⁵ On the latter concept, the positions of developed and developing countries have diverged quite dramatically, with some developing countries continuing to insist that developed countries shoulder the primary burdens of addressing climate change.¹⁵⁶ To be sure, the claims of ‘historical responsibility’ that developing countries have leveled against developed countries in relation to global carbon emissions will have no comparable basis in the cyber context. Still, a global regime-building effort in the cyber context, could also invite arguments by developing countries that States’ common responsibilities should be differentiated so as to lessen their burden or entitle them to technical or financial assistance. It seems sensible, even inevitable; to assist less developed countries in addressing the underlying common concern. In fact, most MEAs today do provide for various kinds of assistance, including through multilateral funds designed to finance conversion to new technologies or otherwise address capacity limitations.¹⁵⁷ But it is highly unlikely that major States, such as the US, will be any more inclined to accept formal differentiation or assistance obligations in the cyber context than they have been in the climate context (which is not to say ‘no assistance’).¹⁵⁸ Finally, experience with MEAs, especially the climate regime, also shows the potential pitfalls of treaty-based standard-setting. The need for agreement by a significant majority of parties (typically 3/4) and the common practice of consensus decision-making can easily stall progress or result ¹⁵⁵ See Jutta Brunnée/Stephen Toupe, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law: An Interactional Account (2010), Chapter 4.\n¹⁵⁶ See Jutta Brunnée/Charlotte Streck, The UNFCCC as a Negotiating Forum: Towards Common but more Differentiated Responsibilities, Climate Policy 13 (2013), 589.\n¹⁵⁷ For an overview, see Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, Technical and Financial Assistance, in: Bodansky/Brunnée/Hey (eds.) (note 5), 947.\n¹⁵⁸ It is precisely this dimension of the principle that prompted the United States to declare that Principle 7 Rio Declaration (one prominent articulation of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’) did not ‘imply a recognition or acceptance by the United States of any international obligations or liabilities, or any diminution of the responsibilities of developing countries under international law’, see UN Report of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg, South Africa, 26 August – 4 September 2002, UN Doc. A/CONF.199/20 (2002), 145.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 in lowest-common-denominator standard-setting,¹⁵⁹ a concern that has been raised also in the cyber context and will be further discussed below.\n## B. International Cyberspace Governance As with the application of the no harm and due diligence obligations, standard-setting bodies and multilateral agreements for cyberspace governance already exist or are being created. Their precise scope, authority, and norm-developing processes, however, remain unclear and may therefore benefit from considering the environmental governance experience.\nThere are many intergovernmental organisations, both specialised and general, that address different aspects of cyberspace regulation, however their ability to constitute, or form the foundation for, a universal normative or regulatory regime for cyberspace is doubtful. In terms of technical standard-setting, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a UN specialised agency, has been active “with regard to International Public Policy Issues Pertaining to the Internet and the Management of Internet Resources, including Domain Names and Addresses.”¹⁶⁰ However, it has been criticised for being unable to adjust to the rapid changes in the cyberspace environment,¹⁶¹ being potentially unrepresentative of the views of all of its members, and being ill-equipped to regulate other, non-technical, areas of cyberspace such as international and criminal law.¹⁶² Similarly, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regards “[p]reserving and enhancing the operational stability, reliability, security, and global interoperability of the Internet” as one of its core objectives, and makes binding decisions and policies on various, mostly technical, internet-related issues.¹⁶³ However, its powers continue to be largely derived from, and dependant on, the US government; it has therefore been criticised for essentially being a State actor rather than an “international organization with a fully democratic legitimation.”¹⁶⁴ --- ¹⁵⁹ See discussion in *Brunnée/Tonpe*, Legitimacy and Legality in International Law (note 155).\n¹⁶⁰ *Sabine von Schorlemer*, Telecommunications, International Regulation, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International LawMPEPIL, Vol. IX (2012), 818 et seq.\n¹⁶¹ *Ibid.* ¹⁶² *David Gross et al.*, Cyber Security Governance: Existing Structures, International Approaches and the Private Sector, in: Lord/Sharp (eds.) (note 162), 114, 116.\n¹⁶³ *Woltag* (note 81).\n¹⁶⁴ *Ibid.* Teaching an Old Law New Tricks 29 These essentially technical bodies,¹⁶⁵ moreover, lack any formal law-making ability. Nonetheless, they have become increasingly politicised, and “distrust by some nations may prevent them from making and enforcing any unilateral policy determinations going forward.”¹⁶⁶ As for more general intergovernmental and regional organisations active in the cyberspace arena, such as the European Union (EU), Council of Europe, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, NATO, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and others, their activities with respect to cyberspace norm-development include issuing reports, organising conferences and summits, devising and promoting policies and conventions, and establishing working groups.¹⁶⁷ However, the respective responsibilities of these organisations, as well as their standard-setting authority, remain unclear; there is often little cooperation among them; and their efforts have been conflicting at times.¹⁶⁸ The limited utility of these bodies for cyberspace norm-creation arguably stems from the lack of international consensus on their precise role in cyberspace governance and the appropriate institutional character of any future regulatory regime. At the 2003 and 2005 World Summits on the Information Society (WSIS I and II),¹⁶⁹ for instance, some developed countries, led by the US, adopted a ‘non-governmental’ approach and regarded the private sector influence and in particular the mandate of ICANN as sufficient for regulatory purposes. A majority of developing countries, including China, however, called for a ‘government-centered’ approach involving intergovernmental management of the internet, for example by the ITU.¹⁷⁰ It was ultimately decided to maintain the existing governance system, while establishing a new Internet Governance Forum (IGF) within the UN for ¹⁶⁵ As well as others, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the Internet Society (ISOC), the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n¹⁶⁶ Deibert/Crete-Nishibata (note 141), 346, 347; Gross et al.

The EU and the US continue to object to ITU governance of the internet,¹⁷² despite growing calls for “an equal role and responsibility for international Internet governance” for all governments,¹⁷³ and the IGF remains merely a forum for discussion, without any powers of supervision or decision-making.¹⁷⁴ As a result, there is still no effective institutional authority that is universally accepted. Ultimately, it has been said that any intergovernmental institution or regime established to regulate and govern cyberspace must have sufficient expertise and technical capability for norm-creation, be perceived as having sufficient legitimacy by the international community, and be able to generate “both high level and specific behavioral norms that are widely accepted as legitimate.”¹⁷⁵ A possible alternative to an intergovernmental or non-governmental regulatory institution is a treaty-based regime resembling the one established with respect to climate change. The development of such a regime was attempted, for instance, with respect to the regulation of cyber crime through the creation of the Budapest Convention. However, the Convention has only been ratified by 47 States thus far,¹⁷⁶ and is unlikely to be universally adopted since many nations view it as a ‘European’ document.¹⁷⁷ Multilateral treaties to regulate certain aspects of cyberspace, including cyber security, cyber attacks, and cyber warfare, have also been suggested by scholars,¹⁷⁸ as well as States such as Russia.

It is not clear as of yet whether this apparent shift, notably in the UN climate change regime, reflects significant and lasting structural change in international environmental treaty making from ‘top-down’ to ‘bottom-up’ approaches.[181] At any rate, in the cyberspace context, treaty-based standard-setting and norm-creation already has been criticised for being too ‘top-down’ for the needs of the medium and, as in the environmental context, as likely to suffer from the “lowest common denominator effect.”[182] Also, creating a multilateral treaty on cyberspace regulation is bound to be a protracted process, and some observers suggest that “an adequate legal framework is only realisable if the foundation is done on an informal law-making basis.”[183] Such informal law-making efforts have in fact been attempted, for instance by China, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, who in 2011 submitted to the UN a proposal for an international code of conduct for information security.[184] While this initiative has since been discussed in various international forums,[185] its viability is doubtful in light of objections by the US and GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 most Western countries to its State-centric model for internet governance.¹⁸⁶ It seems, therefore, that before any international regulatory regime can be devised, a conceptual framework for cyberspace governance must be agreed upon, on the basis of which such a regime could function.\nIt is possible that such a framework could be created around the protection of cyberspace itself, for instance by adopting the notion of a ‘commons’ or ‘shared resource’ regime as discussed above, or in the form of a multilateral treaty regime for the prevention of transboundary impacts, such as that established under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention).¹⁸⁷ The LRTAP Convention, one of the earliest MEAs, has been successful in facilitating preventive regulation and integrated policy-making based on scientific assessments and economic modeling.¹⁸⁸ As one commentator has noted, “experience with multilateral environmental treaties has shown that investigation and monitoring can be important tools underlying a dynamic regulatory framework that can adapt to changes in levels of risk identified.”¹⁸⁹ In the case of the LRTAP Convention, this ‘science-policy interaction’ has been successful in achieving emission reductions of air pollutants in light of such factors as: the direct link between relevant science and policy preparation; multiple scenarios that present policy options; accessibility of science to all participants; a framework offered for countries to provide their own data; the consensus based way of working; and the ability to adapt scientific and policy frameworks to developments in science and policy.¹⁹⁰ Devising a treaty regime along the lines of the LRTAP Convention model may be particularly useful in the cyberspace context, which is similarly dynamic and scientific/technical in nature.\nHowever, it seems fair to say that the development of such a conceptual framework or treaty regime is unlikely to be successful at this point in time. This type of norm-building effort would have to overcome several obstacles, quite apart from State security interests.

As already mentioned, such reluctance is evident in the disagreements concerning the allocation of a greater governance role to the ITU. Liberal democracies are concerned that the intergovernmental model of internet governance would be “fragmented, slow and not interoperable” and facilitate censorship in authoritarian States.¹⁹¹ In turn, developing States that are not able to deal with cyber threats tend to blame the flaws in internet security on the ICANN-led governance structure and seek a new, government-controlled model.¹⁹² During the 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications,¹⁹³ 89 governments, including many developing States, supported an enhanced role for the ITU over internet regulation and approved revisions to the International Telecommunication Regulations intended to transfer authority for regulating critical aspects of the internet from ICANN to the ITU.¹⁹⁴ 54 countries, including the US, the EU, and most other developed countries, however, advocated for the existing model of internet oversight by multi-stakeholder, non-governmental institutions, and refused to sign the revised text of the Regulations.¹⁹⁵ While some observers considered the outcome of the Conference to signal a “digital Cold War,”¹⁹⁶ the long term implications of these partially adopted revisions have yet to emerge.¹⁹⁷ Moreover, any conceptual and/or regulatory framework for cyberspace governance would have to include non-State actors, particularly the private sector, in law-making or norm-development processes, as has been explicitly recognised.¹⁹⁸ The 2005 WSIS II Tunis Agenda, for instance, stated that the “international ¹⁹¹ Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar, Cyber Diplomacy: Agenda, Challenges and Mission, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

(note 162).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 management of the Internet should be multilateral, transparent and democratic, with the full involvement of governments, the private sector, civil society and international organizations.¹⁹⁹ This sentiment was echoed by the Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet, which strongly emphasised the need for multi-stakeholder participation.²⁰⁰ Most recently, in April 2014, the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial) brought together representatives from civil society, the private sector, academia, and the technical community, supported by several governmental representatives, to “establish strategic guidelines related to the use and development of the Internet in the world.”²⁰¹ The Meeting resulted in the Multistakeholder Statement, a non-binding document that set out “Internet Governance Process Principles” emphasising inclusiveness, collaboration, meaningful participation, and consensus driven governance.²⁰² Nonetheless, it has been argued that “some nations and [intergovernmental organisations] still must embrace further the value of collaboration beyond merely with state actors,”²⁰³ suggesting that there is room for improvement with the involvement of non-State actors in policy-making and norm-development processes relating to cyberspace.\nIn addition, as in the international environmental context, cyberspace governance must also address tensions between the developed and developing worlds, which are reflected in disagreements over cyber governance issues such as the role of the ITU and further complicate efforts to establish a global normative/regulatory regime. The need to bridge the ‘digital divide’, the “social and spatial inequalities in internet access” between developed and developing countries,²⁰⁴ has long been recognised. For instance, the primary objectives of the WSIS I and II conferences were “to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society” and to “pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society.”²⁰⁵ Similarly, the recent NETmundial statement emphasised that “Internet governance institutions ¹⁹⁹ Tunis Agenda (note 169), para. 29; Woltag (note 81).\n²⁰⁰ Interim Report of the Ad-hoc Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet (note 10), paras. 58, 59.\n²⁰¹ Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial), NETmundial: The beginning of a process, available at: http://netmundial.br/about/ (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n²⁰² NETmundial, NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement, 24 April 2014, available at: http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf (accessed on 3 July 2014).\n²⁰³ Gross et al.

Here, too, lessons may be learned from the environmental context, including concerning the challenges involved.²⁰⁹ In sum, the need for multi-stakeholder involvement and global representation in the development of norms and regulatory mechanisms to govern cyberspace seems to be widely recognised. Less formal frameworks based on ‘soft law’, rather than intergovernmental agreements or institutions, may be more conducive to the development of such norms and mechanisms. Still, the involvement and cooperation of States seems equally important in light of the fact that they retain control over cyberspace infrastructure and the enforcement of cyberspace regulation, and that some form of State responsibility for harmful cyberspace activities emanating from their territories is required. Ultimately, therefore, an effective regulatory framework for cyberspace may require a “multi-layered structure”²¹⁰ that combines informal norm-developing networks, institutions for multi-stakeholder consultation, technical standard-setting bodies, and treaties for intergovernmental cooperation and regulation. As has been suggested elsewhere, “the legal framework [for cyberspace] is to be based on networks established by the concerned communities and linked together through interconnection mechanisms.”²¹¹ Such an interconnected system is necessary in order for international consensus to be achieved on the controversial elements of cyberspace governance discussed in this chapter, including the legal nature and conception of ²⁰⁶ NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement (note 202).\n²⁰⁷ Warf (note 204), 21.\n²⁰⁸ Antonio Segura-Serrano, Internet Regulation and the Role of International Law, Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law 10 (2006), 191, 259, available at: www.mpii.de/files/pdf3/06_antonov1.pdf (accessed on 21 October 2010).\n²⁰⁹ See supra, notes 153–160 and accompanying text.\n²¹⁰ Weber (note 75), 7.\n²¹¹ Ibid., 4.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 cyberspace and the content and limits of States' obligations in relation to peacetime cyberspace activities.\n## V. Conclusion And so we return to the no harm rule. Our conclusion is that, at least in the short run, the most promising foundation for international cyberspace law is the harm prevention/due diligence framework that has already gained considerable traction in this context. One of this framework's main advantages is precisely that it does not require wholesale norm-creation or big normative battles, as would be required in an effort to develop norms for the governance of cyberspace itself as a 'shared' or 'commons' resource. The basic norms already exist and apply to activities and harms that involve cyberspace just as to any other activity that occurs under the jurisdiction of States.\nIn this regard, the evolution of international environmental law is instructive, especially in relation to the efforts to flesh out the concepts of harm prevention and due diligence. The Interim Report of the Advisory Group on Cross-border Internet is an excellent illustration of how the same could be accomplished in the cyber context. It articulates adaptations of the general principles of prevention, diligence, procedural obligations, and precaution, including to a multi-stakeholder context, and highlights the need for the development of common standards and best practices. Such standards need not be developed in legally binding form or in a multilateral treaty to be influential, or to flesh out the binding prevention and diligence obligations that exist at custom. As we have shown, although international agreements have played a crucial role in global environmental protection, we appear to be witnessing a certain return to basic principles in the regulation of transboundary environmental harm. The harm prevention/due diligence framework may offer the most suitable approach also in the cyber context, where the potential benefits of a treaty-based approach arguably are outweighed by the drawbacks. The development of cyberspace norms can rather take place through relatively informal legal means in an interconnected, multi-stakeholder system that incorporates States and non-State actors, thereby bypassing lumbering and often stalled treaty-based processes.\nNonetheless, the development of such norms requires some degree of international consensus on the nature of cyberspace governance, the content of basic principles, and the degree and type of regulation required. Unlike the liberal approach adopted by the Advisory Group, it seems that the Tallinn Manual Group Teaching an Old Law New Tricks 37 of Experts took a more conservative stance and could not agree on certain issues, notably the question whether there is a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent any cyber activity with a ‘negative effect,’ or just a duty not to knowingly allow harmful acts that are underway to continue.²¹² As we have suggested, the different nature, focus, and purpose of these two groups of experts may account for their divergent approaches to States’ obligations in this context. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that some of the Tallinn Manual’s experts have now turned their attention to the application of international law principles, such as the use of countermeasures, to cyberspace activities in peacetime, noting that “few, if any, cyber operations have crossed the armed attack threshold.”²¹³ It will be interesting to see, therefore, if and how the original positions taken in the Tallinn Manual shift in this new context.\nNotwithstanding the usefulness of analogies with international environmental law, cyberspace really is a different kind of space, perhaps leaving for international law only the relatively limited task of holding States to appropriate standards of diligence. Although consensus has yet to be achieved on the content and limits of these norms as they apply to this unique, virtual ‘ecosystem’, we believe that it is worth teaching an old law new tricks!\n²¹² Tallinn Manual (note 2), 27, 28, paras. 7, 11.\n²¹³ Schmitt, Cyber Operations (note 2), 1.\nTSpace Research Repository tspace.library.utoronto.ca UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LIBRARIES"

We begin by exploring opportunities for borrowing well-established rules of harm prevention and due diligence from the more advanced, but not dissimilar, field of international environmental law. We argue that these rules can provide a legal foundation for the emerging field of international cyber law, and have already made their way into the cyberspace discourse. We then draw on the experience of international environmental law with conceptual notions such as ‘global commons’ and ‘shared resources’, as well as with institutional models such as multilateral environmental agreements and norm-developing bodies. We highlight the risks and drawbacks of the conceptual and institutional leap from States' transboundary harm prevention duties to protection of a commons in the ‘virtual’ world of cyberspace.",
